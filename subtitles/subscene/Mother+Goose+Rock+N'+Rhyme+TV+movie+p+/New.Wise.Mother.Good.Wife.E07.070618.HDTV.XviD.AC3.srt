00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,960
- Episode 7 -

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,010
Stop it!

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,850
I love you. I mean it.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,840
Gyung Guk-Hee!

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,780
Why I ought to...

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,000
Are you okay?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,830
Why did you punch him?

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,160
What?

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,030
- Are you nuts?
- Aren't you nuts?

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,140
Why did you punch him?

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,140
Of course, I...

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,770
You're...you're with him...
late at night...

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,160
- How can you do this?
- Mind your own business.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,070
We're divorced now.

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,120
Apologize.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,250
What?

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,060
Apologize for punching him!

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,770
You want me to apologize to him?

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,890
Apologize. Now!

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,080
Forget it, Guk-Hee.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm okay. You may go now.

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,150
What?

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,970
Let's go.

24
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,960
Why I ought to...

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,850
Why I ought to...

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,870
I'm older than you,
and I'm a married woman.

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,210
Why are you doing this to me?

28
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,830
Why are you laughing?

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,150
You defended me.

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,240
Don't ever do that again.

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,790
I'm okay with it.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,240
It's me. Come out!

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,100
Come out!

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,950
You wanted me to apologize to that kid?

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,090
What are you trying to do,
make me jealous?

36
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe you're using too many brain cells.

37
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,980
You're supposed to apologize
after punching someone.

38
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,120
That's what I taught Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk.

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,250
Fine. Let me ask you one question.

40
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,180
What's that kid to you?

41
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,790
Are you guys dating?

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,020
I don't have to answer that.

43
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,010
You're really going to go out with him?!

44
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,780
What the...

45
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,830
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:26,200
I've protected you until now, but you need to have your head on straight.

47
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,110
You hang out with women with botox
on their brains and now that kid?

48
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,880
Stop! That's enough.

49
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,960
Listen, you didn't protect me.
You made me into a fool.

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,980
I accommodated you, but you
always complained. I lost my identity.

51
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,030
Didn't you say Tae-Ran boosts your ego?

52
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm regaining my confidence
now that you left me.

53
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,800
I found the Gyung Guk-Hee
who was talented and confident.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,040
The people you belittle
have given me strength.

55
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,820
Mind your own business. Don't call me
late at night and lecture me.

56
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,120
It's up to me to date a kid or an old man.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Stay out of my life.

58
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,800
Fine, is that what you want?

59
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm never going to help you
when you're in need.

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,810
Got that?

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,100
I'll never ask you for your help.

62
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,180
Yun-Shil, time for lunch.

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,790
I have a great plan. I'll be back.

64
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,950
I'll be a changed woman
when you see me again.

65
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,930
From, Yun-Shil.

66
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,260
Why are you laughing? Do you think
it's funny that Guk-Hee punched me?

67
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,870
I can't help it.

68
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,030
Speak for yourself.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,860
I'm mad at myself.

70
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,900
I can't believe I punched that kid
when Guk-Hee and I am divorced.

71
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,800
I think I have a lot to look forward to.

72
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,950
Hello?

73
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,950
Tae-Ran, why didn't you come
pick up your laptop?

74
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,870
I waited for you.

75
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,100
You didn't answer my calls.
What's wrong?

76
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,990
- What is it?
- You have a cut on your face.

77
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, I scratched myself while playing
with Eun-Suk last night.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,850
Isn't it uncomfortable for you to live in the same neighborhood as Guk-Hee?

79
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,820
Well...

80
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,010
It is.

81
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,080
What's that?

82
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,980
Wait, I've seen this before.

83
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,240
This is mine.

84
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,000
Is this his way of telling you
that he's mad?

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,150
You deserve half of what he has!

86
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,010
Why did he only give you your clothes?

87
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,900
You're right. You need to
fight for your right.

88
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,870
Who is it?

89
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,810
Go in.

90
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,010
Saw your stuff? I put it there
because I moved in.

91
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,200
I was going to wait until the wedding,
but why wait?

92
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,930
Shouldn't you move on
with your life too?

93
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,260
I thought you'd need your stuff.

94
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,240
Excuse me. I need to
make snacks for the kids.

95
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,090
Who is it?

96
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,950
What are you doing?

97
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,150
You don't want your stuff back?

98
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I'm so glad you moved in.

99
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,890
Mother took care of Eun-Suk
and Gi-Suk for too long.

100
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,140
I'm glad you moved in.
Here are the things you should know.

101
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,800
Memorial on March 6th and July 7th.

102
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,960
Mother's birthday on June 7th.

103
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,170
HOA meeting every first
Monday of the month.

104
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,780
Volunteer at Eun-Suk's school
every Wednesday.

105
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,780
You need to clean and cross students.

106
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,090
Mother's bible study is here on Wednesdays. It's tiring even to read it.

107
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,880
You can check the rest yourself.

108
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,770
HOA rules. It's annoying but
has to be abided by. Listen carefully.

109
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,040
Electricity bill is due on the 10th, water 15th, gas 20th, and HOA fees 18th.

110
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,910
Don't be late on your bills.

111
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,140
No running water on Wednesdays.

112
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,210
There's more.

113
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,130
Recycling times are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 7-9AM.

114
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,070
Be sure to separate chicken bones,
crab shells, and eggshells.

115
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,880
Stay home during disinfection time
every second week of the month.

116
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,230
Or else all the roaches will be
all over this place.

117
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,920
Bye. Let's go.

118
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,160
Did you see the look on her face
when we talked about the roaches?

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,990
Why is she scared of roaches?
They're so tiny.

120
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,840
She's so fake.

121
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,840
She's never done housework.

122
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,210
Are you okay?

123
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,780
Yes. We should lead a planned life.

124
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,970
We ought to put it into action.

125
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,010
Plan? Okay!

126
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm going to pull out my wisdom tooth, and give my dad some allowance.

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,110
I want to sleep in too.

128
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,840
Sleep in? I like that idea.

129
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,180
I'll sleep in once a week
and read comic books.

130
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,230
Maybe we should go rent some now.

131
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,930
Get me some romance novels.

132
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,950
There was something else
I wanted to read...

133
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,070
I should've done this earlier.

134
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,040
If I didn't go to the beach that day,
I would've never had time for myself.

135
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,080
We should learn to enjoy our life.

136
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,030
Tuesdays, snacks for Gi-Suk's child care center...

137
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,800
Wednesdays, Mother's bible study group...

138
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,830
Electricity bill is due on the 10th, water 15th, gas 20th...

139
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,140
These are the household chores?

140
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,890
- Is that what Guk-Hee told you?- Yes.

141
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,040
She wrote these to give you a hard time.

142
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,830
It's impossible to do
everything on the list!

143
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,240
You never helped her, right?

144
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,790
Of course I did...

145
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,990
She only wrote what's necessary.

146
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,810
How can you do all these by yourself? Let's ask my mom to come.

147
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:16,870
The hardest thing to do in life
is to earn money from writing.

148
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,200
Household chores are a piece of cake.

149
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,950
Then let's do it. I'll help you.

150
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,150
Sir, there are 4 crazy
female ghosts at my house.

151
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,030
Just go home.

152
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,040
I can't go home!

153
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,250
I reported it, but there's
no such thing as ghosts!

154
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,140
Are you shocked that
your wife passed way?

155
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,180
Go home, we already closed
your wife's suicide case.

156
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,050
No, I can't go home!

157
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,980
Officer, can you interrogate me?

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,860
Hang on.

159
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,810
Hello?

160
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,850
I'm telling you, it's a ghost.

161
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,940
Wow, he's totally nuts.

162
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,900
I don't feel like cleaning today.

163
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,910
- It never ends.
- I know.

164
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,160
- How much did we eat?
- Lately, a lot.

165
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,240
- Hi again.
- Hi.

166
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,770
I can do those chores
with my eyes closed.

167
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,930
I'm all done.

168
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,030
I'll let you know if there's more.

169
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,150
I'll be too busy to take you
into consideration though.

170
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,130
Why don't you move?

171
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,850
Wow, I can't believe you have
the nerve to say that.

172
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,940
I'll have to find another way then.

173
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,260
- Oh my...
- Wait.

174
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,870
You need to clean your own mess.

175
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,110
Recycle your own trash.

176
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm on my way to dinner. I'll do it later.

177
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,010
Look, this woman's not
cleaning her mess.

178
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,970
Shouldn't you make her clean
the trash bin as a punishment?

179
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,920
Why don't you help her out?

180
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,040
- Why should we?- Why not?

181
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,010
You have all the time in the world!

182
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,190
Excuse me, I heard
you're a very famous writer.

183
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,240
My son is an aspiring actor.
Do you want to see his picture?

184
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,210
Can you get the famous actress Kam Sung-Yun's autograph for me?

185
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,940
I hate it when things like this happens!

186
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,850
I ought to yank all those
women's hair out!

187
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,880
It's not worth it. Let's go.

188
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,210
No wonder I didn't feel like cleaning.

189
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,970
Let's go.

190
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,890
I'm glad I finally got it pulled out.

191
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,880
It must've hurt.
Why did you wait so long?

192
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:26,230
I thought the pain would
go away after awhile.

193
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,080
It was a part of me...

194
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,030
Was this your car?

195
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh my, isn't this expensive?

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,800
I've been wanting talk to you.

197
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,150
You know the house
where the 3 women live?

198
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,070
Of course, I do.

199
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,040
Why are you kicking me out? Didn't
you want me to live another 2 years?

200
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:15,100
The president of HOA
makes the calls around here.

201
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,230
- Please reconsider.
- I already made up my mind.

202
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,960
Hello?

203
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,130
You want me to quit?

204
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,070
No, I need the money.

205
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,860
Please! I'll work harder!

206
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,070
Please don't fire me!

207
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,820
With enough people, you can
even turn against heaven.

208
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,930
No one can beat the president of HOA.

209
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,180
This is driving me crazy too.

210
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,960
Get yourself another job.

211
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,870
I have an announcement
to make about Building 303.

212
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,150
Real estate values are going up...

213
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,840
...because of a new elementary school
in the neighborhood.

214
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,190
But we have one problem.

215
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,850
Will people want to live with
a bunch of women...

216
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,130
...who got kicked out of their homes?

217
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,810
No!

218
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,900
Yes! Right on!

219
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,210
Those women spoiled my wife!

220
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,110
What's going on?

221
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,770
- Get out!
- Get out!

222
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,030
- Get out!
- Get out!

223
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,040
Look, can we please live in peace?

224
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,200
We have a good reason for doing this!

225
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Hey you! Listen to me!

226
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,900
I hate people like them!

227
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,890
This is getting on my nerves.

228
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,910
That's a human being, not a ghost.

229
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,260
Lee Yun-Shil!

230
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,770
I thought you killed her!

231
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,030
No, I didn't... Actually, I couldn't.

232
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,950
I locked her up in an inn, and she ran away.

233
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,100
I think the innkeeper opened the door for her.

234
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,220
What about the corpse?

235
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,060
That's what I wanted to ask you.

236
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,240
I thought you checked the corpse!

237
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,940
Didn't you check her face?

238
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,910
Yes, but it was unidentifiable because her face was a mess from drowning.

239
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,890
After all, her ID was in the pocket.

240
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,990
Anyways, your wife is still alive.

241
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,790
My money!

242
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,200
My money!

243
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,930
My money! My money!

244
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,790
Yun-Shil...I'm going to get you!

245
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,990
I'm going to get you!

246
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,110
I'm here to open a bank account.

247
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,150
You shouldn't have annoyed Tae-Ran.

248
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,080
You should've left when I asked you.

249
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,770
You want me to leave because I make you and Tae-Ran uncomfortable?

250
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,810
How can you be
so selfish and shameless?

251
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,070
You provoked Tae-Ran first
with a list of chores and such.

252
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,140
Please don't stand against Tae-Ran.

253
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,210
She's on a whole new level apart from you and those women with botox.

254
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,050
You can't match up to her competence.

255
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:27,850
Competence?
You call that competence?

256
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,930
Is that all you need to be
the wife you need?

257
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,860
Then what do you think it takes to be a good wife?

258
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,020
Just quietly cook and
do the laundry at home?

259
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:46,000
Is that who you thought I was?

260
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:55,200
You don't know what's really important.

261
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,770
And what would that be?

262
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,770
Ta-dah!

263
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,200
Are you sure I'm not bothering you?

264
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,830
I'm sorry for interrupting.

265
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,900
I wanted you to interrupt me.

266
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,240
What do you need?

267
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
Stop messing around.

268
00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:00,180
I want to know if they have
the right to kick us out.

269
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:15,140
Once the contract term expires, the tenant does not have a right to renew.

270
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:23,170
That means she has to get out.

271
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:31,220
No, I can't let her get
kicked out because of me.

272
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,940
Suk-Doo, look!

273
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,070
This place stinks.

274
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,850
Myung-Pil, open the veranda window!

275
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,770
Got it!

276
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,210
Come on, let's eat.

277
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,120
Myung-Pil!

278
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,860
Hurry up.

279
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,990
Tae-Ran, I'll be back.

280
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,120
I left my car interior light on.

281
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,860
Hurry back!

282
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,800
The owner demanded
to cancel the contract...

283
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,220
...on the day I went to pay
the remaining balance.

284
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
She demanded $60,000 on the spot.

285
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,860
That's wrong.

286
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,810
She wasn't supposed to do that to you.

287
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:56,100
If I can get that house back,
that means we have a place to stay.

288
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,150
Do you think I can get that house back?

289
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,910
Nice going. Very nice.

290
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,980
Are you going out with him?

291
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,060
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'll bring the contract.

292
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,040
Hey! I'm talking to you!

293
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,890
Are you jealous?

294
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,110
What?

295
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,850
I don't understand why you keep on butting in between Guk-Hee and me.

296
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,810
You jerk!

297
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,210
Who do you think you are?

298
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,190
Don't call me a jerk.

299
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,840
I'm very grateful to you.

300
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,980
What? Grateful?

301
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,210
Thanks to you,
that fine woman is now available.

302
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,840
Now that she's available,
I can ask her out.

303
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,100
Thanks.

304
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:56,230
By the way, that was a nice punch. We're even now.

305
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,050
What that little...

306
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:19,020
I thought you can do those chores
with your eyes closed.

307
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,990
What the? What are you doing here?

308
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,060
I realized something while
you were trying to kick me out.

309
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,950
Maybe I can get what's important back.

310
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,150
Here it is!

311
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,810
Get out. Get out!

312
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,920
Let me remind you.
This is still my house.

313
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,830
I can come here whenever I want
until I'm officially divorced.

314
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,190
Hey!

315
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,910
Oh, no.

316
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,080
Don't put this near the fire.
That's dangerous.

317
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,910
We've been using canola oil
for 2 years to stay healthy.

318
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,800
It'll smell good in stir-fry food.

319
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:02,120
You need to use homemade
soy paste for stews.

320
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,140
You didn't even add garlic?

321
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,890
You should do the dishes
as soon as possible.

322
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,900
The edges might chip off
if you leave them like that.

323
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,060
Take good care of them until I take them after I find a place to stay.

324
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,070
Hey!

325
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,000
- Who do you think you are?
- Oh, by the way...

326
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,840
Can you tell Myung-Pil
to mind his own business...

327
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,110
...whether I talk to
a college student or not?

328
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,810
Hey!

329
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,780
Tae-Ran! Are you okay?

330
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,770
Tae-Ran!

331
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,970
I saved up for 8 years to buy that house.

332
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,110
I lost my house
after signing the contract.

333
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:06,810
I want to get it back if I can.
If I can get it, we can live there together.

334
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
You have to get it back.

335
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,150
You went through so much trouble because of that house.

336
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,070
Let's get it back!

337
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,920
And...Su-Duk made
an accomplishment today.

338
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,250
We can sell this to get some money.

339
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,150
You don't have any money
because you got fired.

340
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,950
Su-Duk will help.

341
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,950
I have good news!

342
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,850
There's a chance you can
get that house back!

343
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,030
She wasn't supposed to do that to you.

344
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,900
Really?

345
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,970
Let me see the contract.
I'll show it to my friend.

346
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,050
Call the homeowner to set up a meeting.

347
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,090
Follow me.

348
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,950
Suk-Doo is a fine man.

349
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,190
He has a servant boy image.

350
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,200
Guk-Hee looks like his mistress.

351
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,910
Ma'am!

352
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,120
He's practicing to be a good husband.

353
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,860
That's what I like about him.

354
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,040
I hope Guk-Hee makes a move on him.

355
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,210
Should we help her?

356
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,840
What are you talking about?

357
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,890
The servant boy.

358
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,180
Fulfill the contract?

359
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,050
But you even pay me the balance!

360
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,770
That's because you refused to take it!

361
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,770
You demanded $60,000 more on the spot, and forwarded me the contract fee.

362
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,810
You weren't supposed to do that.

363
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,860
I got some legal advice.

364
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,110
That house is now worth $600,000.

365
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,130
Why would I sell it to you for $300,000?

366
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,010
Then I'll sue.

367
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,010
As you wish.

368
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,810
Look, it's too late now.

369
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,910
The owner can cancel the contract.

370
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,900
All she needs to do
is to pay the penalty...

371
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,770
...of double the contract fee
for breaching the contract.

372
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,850
Is it the contract fee
that what you want?

373
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,900
Don't you understand Korean? Why don't you understand what we're saying?

374
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,820
We want the house, not the contract fee!

375
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,180
It's my house. I can do whatever I want.

376
00:30:53,130 --> 00:31:00,220
Tae-Ran, it's been two days.
Please say something!

377
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,090
What did Guk-Hee tell you?

378
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm hanging on your every word.

379
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,970
You're making me miserable.

380
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,820
Tae-Ran!

381
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,060
Myung-Pil.

382
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,970
Yes? What is it?

383
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,120
Are you sure you went downstairs because the car interior light was on?

384
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,030
Well, you see...

385
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:39,260
I saw you fighting with a man
on the night Mr. Yeom was here.

386
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,140
Do you still have feelings for Guk-Hee?

387
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,240
It just happened.

388
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,900
For a minute there,
I thought we were still married.

389
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,970
I quickly came back to my senses
and thought, 'It's none of my business.'

390
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,960
Like Samuel Johnson said,
'Life is not long...

391
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,920
...and too much of it must not
pass in idle deliberation.'

392
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,910
Smart people like us shouldn't
waste our time over this.

393
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,800
This is wrong.

394
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,160
I'll go and get this settled!

395
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,880
I'll kick Guk-Hee out and
I'll make sure never to see her again!

396
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,970
Satisfied? Okay?

397
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,130
Fatso! How dare you sell my ring!

398
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,020
I'm going to kill you.

399
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:28,230
I'll find Jang-Mi, Yun-Shil,
and get the insurance money.

400
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,020
I'll kill three birds with one stone.

401
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,170
Jang-Mi! I knew it!

402
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,020
She's boy crazy!

403
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,820
What are you doing here? Who are you?

404
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,930
You crazy jerk! I'm here to find my wife!

405
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,860
Your wife?

406
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,890
Let's get this settled.

407
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,790
Is anyone home?

408
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,020
Guk-Hee!

409
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,780
Excuse me.

410
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,930
It's me.

411
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,210
Jang-Mi is with two men?

412
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,140
Who are you?

413
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,240
That's what I want to ask you!

414
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,880
You jerk!

415
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,100
You bunch of...

416
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,120
Why, I ought to...

417
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,890
Don't come near me!

418
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,000
What's going on? Our house!

419
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,800
Thief! Thief!

420
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,250
Wait! Wait!

421
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,130
What happened?

422
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,170
What did Guk-Hee say?

423
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,240
You told her, right?

424
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,010
Yes...

425
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,090
Tae-Ran! I can't take this anymore.

426
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,070
Let's just forget about her.

427
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,240
I don't want to deal with
the losers in that house.

428
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,260
Let's take it to the court.

429
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,990
I'll request compulsory mediation
and a restraining order.

430
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,130
What happened?

431
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,840
Nothing happened.

432
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,980
What now?

433
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,990
See you at the court tomorrow.

434
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:52,790
I don't want to fight over making you move and what to do about the kids.

435
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,110
Let's take this to the court.

436
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,770
Let's settle this at the family court.

437
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,150
You'll be summoned
in about 5 days or so.

438
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,140
We need the both of you to be here.

439
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,950
It'll be over in 5 days.

440
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,840
You're right.

441
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,930
Where do I file a civil case?

442
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,770
At the 2nd floor of the
next building to the left.

443
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,230
See you in 5 days.

444
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,770
I filed my application.

445
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,890
Tae-Ran, all you need to do is wait.

446
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,990
Lunch?

447
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,020
There's a kimchi stew place
in front of the court.

448
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,190
I'll eat there.

449
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,990
Bye.

450
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,970
Why are you here?

451
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,800
This is my favorite place.

452
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,230
I'm the one who introduced
this place to you.

453
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,810
- How many?
- Oh, one!

454
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,020
One!

455
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,260
We don't have any seats.
Would you like to sit together?

456
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,190
Enjoy your food.

457
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,060
You surprised me.

458
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,160
I thought you'd say no,
but you went along with the divorce.

459
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,120
I pulled my wisdom tooth out.

460
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,090
I thought it'd hurt, but I felt much better.

461
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:20,120
At the time, I wasn't
ready to divorce you.

462
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:26,790
I tried to hold onto you
even though it was painful...

463
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,950
...just like my wisdom tooth,
since you were a part of me.

464
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,990
But I think I can get rid of you now.

465
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,890
Actually, I might feel
much better after this.

466
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,770
I'll grant you a divorce.

467
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm going to sue
and get that house back...

468
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,260
...the one you said
we lost because of me.

469
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,970
I'll move once I get
that house back. Don't worry.

470
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,980
The house we couldn't get
because she demanded $60,000?

471
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,190
It's not fair.

472
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,200
It's not fair that the
real estate prices skyrocketed.

473
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,860
It's not fair that we lost that house.

474
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,940
Yes! It's not fair!

475
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:16,020
Things wouldn't be this rough
if we had gotten that house.

476
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,790
I'm going to get it back.

477
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,800
That'll be nice.

478
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,820
But I doubt the homeowner
will sell it to you.

479
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,060
That's useless. Don't do it.

480
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,070
I'll do it.

481
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,260
Now that I know it's wrong,
I have to do something about it.

482
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,880
I want Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk
to be proud of me.

483
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,920
What are you looking at?

484
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,990
Uh...nothing.

485
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,870
Real Estate Laws

486
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,260
What were you doing there?

487
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,110
Do you live here?

488
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,890
What are you doing here?

489
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,930
Is he living with you?

490
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:31,770
Are you from the city hall?
Are you taking a census?

491
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,040
We're having dinner.
Don't bother us.

492
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,000
This is a book of real estate laws.

493
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,020
You should know the facts
if you don't want to get embarrassed.

494
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,110
I already read that book.

495
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,900
Fine then.

496
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,950
Bye.

497
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,130
Myung-Pil.

498
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,910
Yes, Tae-Ran?

499
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,840
What are you doing with that book?

500
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,860
When Guk-Hee lost that house,
all I did was nag her.

501
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,980
Now she wants that house back.

502
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,830
It's not going to happen...

503
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,180
...but I wanted to give her this book because I feel sorry for her.

504
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,840
But it's over now.

505
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,790
It's over!

506
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,880
I did what I can do!

507
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,060
She's going to sue for a stupid house?

508
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,200
Are you going to follow her blindly?

509
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,010
Dad, there's a storytelling class tomorrow...

510
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,940
Follow her blindly?

511
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,940
A stupid house?

512
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,960
Right, you may not
understand this, Tae-Ran.

513
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:45,000
But we scraped every penny
for 8 years for that house!

514
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,020
It's not a stupid house.

515
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,790
Are you going to team up with her now?

516
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,780
Do you want me to pretend
I don't know anything?

517
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,240
Now that I know how upset
you are over this matter...

518
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:07,820
...I'll promise you that
I'll never talk to Guk-Hee again.

519
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,810
I'll never go see Guk-Hee on my own will.

520
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,040
Satisfied?

521
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,110
You know that I never say never, right?

522
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,900
Mom, what am I going to do
about the storytelling class?

523
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,040
The Pauper didn't do anything.

524
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,980
Come over here... I see...

525
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,920
Don't worry, I'll work my magic.

526
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,200
Okay.

527
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,260
It's okay.

528
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,100
Very good.

529
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,100
I'm done.

530
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,060
What else do you want me
to help you with?

531
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,970
Chop the green onions.

532
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,960
I need them to be thin.

533
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,150
Okay!

534
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:30,100
By the way, I don't think
you should say 'I'll help you.'

535
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,240
Huh?

536
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,180
By saying 'I'll help you,' you're assuming that I'm the main constituent...

537
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,260
...and you're not.

538
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,020
You should say 'Let's do it together' instead of 'I'll help you.'

539
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,820
These chores concern both of us.

540
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,900
That means you should do it too.

541
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,880
Don't say 'I'll help you'
like you're being generous.

542
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,950
Oh...

543
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,900
Didn't you help Guk-Hee
at all with household chores?

544
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,930
Huh? Yes, I did help her!

545
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,800
I mean...we did them together!

546
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:11,800
Then you should get started
instead of asking me if you can help.

547
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,130
Sure thing...

548
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,890
Then let's get started on
chopping the green onions.

549
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,010
Chop the potatoes and the onions too.

550
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,960
If you bite on this, you won't get tears.

551
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,250
You know that you can reduce propanesulfonic acid...

552
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,840
...by using the same substance, right?

553
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,930
Uh-huh...

554
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:50,070
I just need to make a lunchbox
for the race tomorrow.

555
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,240
Huh? Oh, no...

556
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:05,200
The race isn't on tomorrow!
Tomorrow's storytelling time!

557
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,850
Oh, no...

558
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,160
Ji-Hoon and So-Young!
Long time no see.

559
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,160
Gyung-Chul, how are you after
the rollerblading accident?

560
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,770
Myung-Hoon, you got a Ryukendo shirt!

561
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,110
You look exactly like Ryukendo
with that hairdo!

562
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:29,830
I'm going to tell you a story about
the Prince and the Pauper.

563
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,920
That's my mom! Isn't she pretty?

564
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,800
Ta-dah!

565
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:45,070
Hi, I'm the Prince of your kingdom.

566
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,180
Hi, I'm Tom from the countryside.

567
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,900
Wow! We look exactly alike!

568
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,940
You're like my mirror image!

569
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,040
This is incredible!

570
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,990
The Prince and the Pauper
were surprised...

571
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,150
...by how much they looked alike.

572
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,860
Mom! When will the
hide and seek be over?

573
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,910
It'll be over soon.

574
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,800
Gi-Suk must be waiting. Let's go.

575
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,110
Okay.

576
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,200
Eun-Suk! Gi-Suk!
Go inside and wash up.

577
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,860
I need to talk to the Pauper.

578
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,880
Yes, Prince mother.

579
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,780
Good afternoon.

580
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,170
You look triumphant
after storytelling time.

581
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,990
Why do you look upset?

582
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,200
Are you stressed out because
you didn't make it to storytelling time?

583
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,930
If you think you can prove your worth through a mother role, you're wrong.

584
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,050
You got booted off your role as a wife.

585
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,130
All you have left is your role as a mother.

586
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:36,890
What are you going to do if
you get booted from both roles?

587
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,100
Did you wait for me just to show
how concerned you are?

588
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,810
I'm saying this because
I feel sorry for you.

589
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,800
After all, you're my friend.

590
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,080
You're going to feel
very desolate later on.

591
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,810
I'd rather have you leave now.

592
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,110
Desolate?

593
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,240
Myung-Pil promised me that
he'll never talk to you again.

594
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:03,880
The 8 years you spent
with him was in vain.

595
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,130
Right, you're very competent.

596
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,790
My husband fell for you,
and you kicked me out.

597
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,040
I give you credit for that.

598
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,170
That's probably what
Myung-Pil wanted too.

599
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,000
With enough people,
you can stand against heaven.

600
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,830
Everyone told me
that I couldn't do anything.

601
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,860
But there's something
Myung-Pil and you don't know.

602
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,030
I have something that you don't.

603
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,220
That's enough to stand against heaven.

604
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,890
And what would that be?

605
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,780
Sincerity.

606
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,010
You're always insecure
because you don't have that.

607
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,030
Why do you need Myung-Pil
to promise that to you?

608
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,830
You want to kick me out
because you're insecure.

609
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,250
You're scared that an average person like me might win this fight with you.

610
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,060
I feel sorry for you.

611
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,150
Don't mind me.
Just do your own thing.

612
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,800
You know how to make money, but you don't know how to act like a person.

613
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,840
Hey!

614
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Come over here!

615
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,970
Thanks for the great show.

616
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,950
Gyung Guk-Hee...

617
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,850
Hello, Tae-Ran.

618
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,890
I can't take this anymore.

619
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,040
Can you come home early tonight?
We need to talk.

620
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Okay, I'll be home early.

621
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,160
Bye.

622
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,100
What happened?

623
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,090
I can't get a day of rest!

624
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,170
My back aches and I'm tired!

625
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,970
I can't live like this!

626
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:19,880
What's wrong with my life?

627
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,900
You said you need a breakthrough.

628
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,060
The pain comes with the breakthrough.

629
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,190
Officer Oh!

630
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,920
Where's Kim Jo-Han?

631
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,120
A large sum of money was exchanged at the time he signed up for life insurance.

632
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,020
Kim Jo-Han was telling the truth.

633
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,110
But I told him to go home.

634
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,840
He kept on talking about ghosts...

635
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,980
Where's Kim Jo-Han?

636
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,090
I don't know.

637
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,970
He's probably home.

638
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:07,130
I only got $280 for
selling my wedding ring.

639
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,080
That's because it's not a real diamond.

640
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:13,090
I can't believe he got you
a fake wedding ring.

641
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,900
Aren't you mad?

642
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,990
No, his heart was as precious
as a diamond at the time.

643
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:21,150
I'm angrier that
he's calling Su-Duk 'Fatso.'

644
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,240
I'll get your ring back after
I get my house and a job.

645
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,950
That ring's important to you.

646
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,040
You can go ahead.
I have to stop by the market.

647
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,110
I'll look for anything to recycle.

648
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,170
Nam Jang-Mi!

649
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,900
What are you doing here?

650
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:06,960
You told me to come find you
whenever I want!

651
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,930
We need to talk.

652
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:15,070
Okay, let's talk outside.

653
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,940
Outside?

654
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,120
Okay, let's go outside.

655
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,100
Don't touch me.

656
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,040
Okay.

657
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,050
Don't touch me!

658
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,950
I won't.

659
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,880
Jang-Mi.

660
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,160
Excuse me. Where's building 2?

661
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,910
Building 2?

662
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,120
Over there.

663
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,120
This is building 3.

664
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,820
Thank you.

665
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,950
Help!

666
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,920
Come over here!

667
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,030
- Help!
- You're so dead!

668
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,080
- Stop right there!
- Let me go!

669
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,100
- Let go!
- Let's walk side by side.

670
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,130
Don't touch me.

671
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,150
Fine.

672
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,820
I told you not to touch me!

673
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,790
Fine, fine. Let's go.
I won't touch you.

674
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,040
I told you not to touch me!

675
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,100
Hi.

676
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,000
Let me go! Let go! Let me go!!

677
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,980
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get her inside!

678
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,130
Get her inside!

679
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,870
Stop it! Let me go!
Stop it! Let me go!

680
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,250
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

681
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,110
Jang-Mi!

682
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,010
Hello, Tae-Ran, I'm almost here.

683
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,140
You're already outside?

684
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,250
Come to the roadside.

685
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,220
Stop it!

686
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,780
Officer!

687
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,260
Jang-Mi!

688
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,930
Myung-Pil!

689
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,880
What the heck?

690
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,050
Follow that car!

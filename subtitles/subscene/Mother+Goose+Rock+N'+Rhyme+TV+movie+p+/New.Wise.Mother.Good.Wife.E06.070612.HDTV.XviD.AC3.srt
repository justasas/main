1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,700
You should have some too.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,540
Okay.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,280
- Episode 6 -

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,500
This is so good.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,370
What do you think?
Do you like it?

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,260
Yes, but I wish this was spicier.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,240
I'll get some hot sauce.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,340
Excuse me!

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,590
Oh, my gosh!

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,500
No, stay seated.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,330
Guk-Hee!

12
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,250
Was this your plan?

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,610
You told me not to regret it.

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,500
Is this what you were thinking?

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,490
It was supposed to be just
you, me, and Tae-Ran.

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,540
The kids and my mother
somehow ended up coming.

17
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,320
See? This hurts.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,240
Everyone will get hurt.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,310
We know where this is leading to.

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,490
Why are you making it
hard on everyone?

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,360
Stamp your seal. Do it!

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,430
Stamp your seal!

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,230
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

24
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,560
I see. Is that what you really want?

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,520
Fine, I'll do it!

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,220
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,320
Have fun!

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,550
So you stamped it for him? Why?

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,290
You're only doing your husband
and his lover a favor!

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,210
I was fuming when I saw them
eating affectionately...

31
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,480
...with my mother-in-law and kids.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,590
I was definitely pissed off.

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,210
You should've tormented them instead!

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,260
Stop. You're not officially divorced yet...

35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,270
...until you go to
family court with your husband.

36
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,660
- Just don't go.
- Yes, you have time to reverse it.

37
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,540
No, I don't want to be with those people who don't know what's important in life.

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,590
Really?

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,260
I'll be fine.

40
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,490
Su-Duk, do you have any bibimbab left?

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,670
I'm hungry.

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,540
Huh? I'll make it for you right now.

43
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,480
Do you know why
I wanted us to drink tequila?

44
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,490
It used to be a regular drink...

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,640
...but with the
Spanish distillation techniques...

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,230
...it was reborn into this awesome taste.

47
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,640
The same goes for me.

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,530
Through you, I feel like I'm a new man.

49
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,240
I was touched to see you pull through.

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,370
I know it was tough. Thanks.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,630
I know it was difficult for you,
and I know that I hurt Guk-Hee.

52
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:20,420
Knowing the pain I've caused everyone, I'll value our life together even more.

53
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,470
I'll never let you regret
or fail ever again.

54
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,530
Cheers.

55
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,260
What's all this?

56
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,500
Have breakfast. I made it myself!

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,470
When did you make all this?

58
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:39,350
I can do so much now that I don't have to worry about my husband and kids.

59
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,310
You should take a break from all this.

60
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,380
That's not easy to do if you've
never taken a break before.

61
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,550
Hi! Everyone's already up!

62
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,410
- Wow, this looks good.
- Come follow me for a sec.

63
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,320
How annoying...

64
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,240
There were quite a few
second-hand items at the thrift shop.

65
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's have tea and chat.

66
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,210
Tea? Just like when we were single?

67
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,440
That sounds great!

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,350
Should we all have coffee right now?

69
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,640
You're so excited, aren't you?

70
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,390
Do you think Guk-Hee
is enjoying herself?

71
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,270
Guk-Hee, are you really okay?

72
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,470
Of course she's not doing well.
She stamped her divorce papers yesterday.

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,390
I'm okay. Now that I'm single,
I'm going to live my life.

74
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,340
Why not? Don't you agree, Su-Duk?

75
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,320
Huh? Well...um...I'm with you!

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,500
Okay then, let's all eat. I'm hungry.

77
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,670
Okay.

78
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,250
We're late. We need to hurry.

79
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,650
Mom!

80
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,380
Hi.

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,430
How are you doing?

82
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,700
Eun-Suk, I got your broken
rollerblades fixed.

83
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,450
From now on, don't put on
your wrist guards backwards.

84
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,550
I don't do that anymore, Mom.

85
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,220
Did you have a nice dinner yesterday?

86
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,620
How can I eat in a situation like that?

87
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,440
I can't believe this.
How did this happen?

88
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,230
You have no one to blame but yourself.

89
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,530
Don't come to see the kids for awhile.

90
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,610
I'll take care of them until
everything settles down.

91
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,630
I think it's best for you.

92
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,260
Let's go.

93
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,340
Hang on.

94
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:19,270
I need to tell the kids what's
happening between their mom and dad.

95
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,470
Okay, listen to your mom.

96
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,350
Come here.

97
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,690
Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk, do you remember
the 'The Prince and the Pauper' story?

98
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,390
Yeah, the Prince and
the pauper trade places.

99
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,220
The Prince becomes the beggar,
and the beggar becomes the Prince.

100
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,580
I'm going to play that game with Tae-Ran.
We're going to trade places.

101
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,530
Tae-Ran's going to be your mom,
and I'm going to have fun.

102
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,280
You're so lucky, mom!

103
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:21,410
Even though I'm at a different house,
don't worry about a thing.

104
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm just playing a fun game.

105
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm going to have fun,
so I hope you have fun watching.

106
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,530
Just think of it as a fun game, okay?

107
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,700
Okay!

108
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,510
Who's the pauper?

109
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,400
Tae-ran, of course.

110
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,690
Wow, you're the Prince!

111
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,600
A good wife?

112
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,590
What did the sly fox do
to be a good wife?

113
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,580
Just because she makes a lot of money?

114
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,370
Just because she's tall
and has a nice body?

115
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,550
Those people emphasize measurable
things rather than sincerity.

116
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Then what about us housewives?

117
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,510
It's not like we don't
want to earn money.

118
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,640
Honestly, we don't have the time.

119
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,670
Besides, what did
Guk-Hee do wrong?

120
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,510
It's not her fault
she couldn't buy a house.

121
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,320
No, it's because real estate
prices skyrocketed.

122
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,280
It was because she was unlucky.

123
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,320
I heard that luck comes
to those who deserve them.

124
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,530
I guess I don't.

125
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:46,310
My husband told me that I'm not
qualified to be a good wife.

126
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:53,480
He said we're all disqualified.

127
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,570
What? Disqualified?

128
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,530
Why? What are we disqualified?

129
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,400
Do you know how much
misery we have to put up with?

130
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,220
What more do they possibly want?

131
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,380
They expect a lot from us. They keep
on demanding and wanting more.

132
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,600
What do they want us to do?

133
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:25,510
We work day and night to take care
of our family, but all we get are criticisms!

134
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,440
We have feelings too!

135
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,290
We're always being hit left and right.

136
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,480
We have attitude.
I want to show them that!

137
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,400
I really want to show them what we got.

138
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Girls, we have a problem!

139
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,590
He's looking at it, right?

140
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,640
Oh, no! He found it!

141
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,220
He's coming! We're busted!

142
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,420
My heart's shriveling away! Help!

143
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,480
We're busted. What should we do?

144
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,700
Do you think White Pants knows it's us?

145
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,650
Maybe.

146
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,600
Then what should we do?

147
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,580
We don't have much time
since he found out.

148
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,260
Let's file a police report.

149
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,210
Would you be okay?

150
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,580
Even though we have a footage
of White Pants and Sniff together...

151
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,480
...you need to go in person
to find hard evidence.

152
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,540
I'll go to the police station.

153
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,560
Yun-Shil...

154
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,230
Yun-Shil, let's go to the police station
after I come back from the market.

155
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,680
Don't back down, okay?

156
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,390
Okay, see you later.

157
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,290
It's okay, Tae-Ran.

158
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,580
I have time later this afternoon.

159
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,610
Let's have lunch together.

160
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

161
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,550
How are you?

162
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,480
Good. And you?

163
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,520
Good, since you stamped
the divorce papers.

164
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,280
Are you happy?

165
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,370
Thanks to you.

166
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,420
Good for you.

167
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,500
Honey!

168
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,570
You better not change your mind.

169
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,620
We still have to go to court before
our divorce becomes official.

170
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,240
We have to talk about
alimony and the kids.

171
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,250
Don't change your mind, okay?

172
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,370
Oh, and by the way!

173
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,320
You should move.

174
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,550
It'll be uncomfortable to keep running
into each other if you live here.

175
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,310
You need to move.

176
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,680
Why do I have to move?

177
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,210
I have to live here because
of the kids' school!

178
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,410
You're going to start a new life anyway.

179
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,210
It's better to move on with your
life instead of lingering around.

180
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,700
It's best for you.
It's all for your best!

181
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,570
Hey!

182
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,570
What the?

183
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,420
Ouch! Ouch!

184
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,370
You were always like this to me!

185
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,450
You always demanded me
to do things for you!

186
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,500
I painstakingly did
everything for you!

187
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,280
You wanted a divorce after cheating
on me! Now you want me to move?!

188
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,250
Are you...are you nuts?

189
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,520
What are you looking at?

190
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,480
Do you want me to hit you again?

191
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't mistreat me.

192
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,380
You're no longer my husband,
so stop bossing me around!

193
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,330
My heads going to fly
all the way to Jeju Island...

194
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,210
...if I let out the stress I endured
for the past 10 years from you!

195
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,260
I better not catch you again.

196
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,550
You'll be dead meat, got that?!

197
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,390
What the...what the...
sheesh...

198
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,250
I bet they're behind this.

199
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,520
It's over for you if I get caught.

200
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,410
You do know you killed my wife, right?

201
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,220
Bring the surveillance footage
from that house.

202
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,240
Do it!

203
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,330
Is anyone home?

204
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,210
Of course not.

205
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,450
I'll check this room first.

206
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,420
Ta-dah!

207
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,520
How interesting.

208
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,560
There's a kimchi fridge in the room...

209
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,580
Nothing here.

210
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,340
Where could it be?

211
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,660
Nothing here either.

212
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,510
I found it!

213
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,270
It's snowing in Tahiti.

214
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,250
Awkward, isn't it?

215
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,640
You're tumultuous, and I'm sensitive.

216
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,510
This is just like us.

217
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,500
I'm scared of you.

218
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,680
It's snowing in Tahiti.

219
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:09,660
Awkward things shouldn't be together.

220
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,690
Nam Jang-Mi!

221
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,620
Nam Jang-Mi!

222
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,310
Nam Jang-Mi!

223
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,700
He already sent Yun-Shil's
kids abroad to study.

224
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,320
Yeah, White Pants is meticulous.

225
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,400
Yun-Shil!

226
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,320
- Sheesh!
- Yun-Shil!

227
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,660
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil...

228
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,310
Yun-Shil...

229
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,290
Yun-Shil...

230
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
Yun-Shil...Yun-Shil!

231
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,450
Where are you?

232
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,430
Yun-Shil!

233
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,260
Who was it? Who did this to you?

234
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,400
Tell me!

235
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,230
Yun-Shil...

236
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,220
Yun-Shil!

237
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,650
Are you positive it was Sniff?

238
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,300
I had more than 10 missed calls.

239
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,330
I didn't answer because I didn't
recognize the number, but it was Sniff.

240
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,330
He knows that this is my house.

241
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,600
He used to be a detective.

242
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,460
He finds addresses and
phone numbers in no time.

243
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,610
He found criminals just by
sniffing around!

244
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,350
I'm busted.

245
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,320
I can't get away from him!

246
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,390
What should we do?

247
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,690
Her husband's going to drag her
back, and we lost our evidence.

248
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,240
We need the laptop back.

249
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,250
I'll go...

250
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,500
I'm going to settle things
with my husband.

251
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,220
I'll go.

252
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,700
Why's the bulb already out?

253
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,550
White Pants fainted?

254
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,500
Yes, he must've thought
I was a ghost.

255
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,230
It makes sense since he had her
killed and cremated.

256
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,280
You do look like a ghost, all pale.

257
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,440
She's right.

258
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,400
Then you didn't settle anything
with your husband, huh?

259
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,220
I was so shocked, I ran away.

260
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,650
Should I go back?

261
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,650
No, I have a better plan.

262
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,580
Honey...

263
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,220
(Turn Yourself In)

264
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,560
Honey...I'm sorry...I'm so sorry!

265
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,490
Honey...I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...

266
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,470
I'm sorry, honey!

267
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,430
Let go of me!

268
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,300
What? Turn yourself in?

269
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,480
Yeah! I have to turn myself in!

270
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,210
You're doing this to take all the
life insurance policy for yourself, huh?

271
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,630
No!

272
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,330
I saw a ghost.

273
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,340
My wife came back to haunt me!

274
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,210
Whatever.

275
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,590
Hey, I'm Sniff, you hear?

276
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,310
If you lie to me,
I'm going to kill you.

277
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,490
Hand me the money, got that?

278
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,540
Wait! Are you leaving?

279
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,360
- Don't go.
- I'm coming back tomorrow.

280
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Don't go!

281
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,380
? March along, sing our song,
with the Army of the free. ?

282
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,570
(Police Station)

283
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,230
Wow, we did it!

284
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,380
Su-Duk made a difference.

285
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,340
We did it!

286
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,550
My husband won't even
believe what Su-Duk did.

287
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,430
This is great!

288
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,640
Why did I have to touch him, huh?

289
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
Are you okay, Yun-Shil?

290
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,470
It's complicated.

291
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,450
After all, he was your husband.

292
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:42,350
I wonder what happened to us.

293
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,250
You were probably
only married on paper.

294
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:56,230
Sniff was my husband, but I never imagined him doing such a thing.

295
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,300
We don't know each other.
How can we be a married?

296
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,650
I married out of love.

297
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,660
My husband told me that I'm the most beautiful person in the whole world.

298
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,440
He keeps making fun of
my weight after having kids.

299
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:31,330
Hey...thanks to what
happened today, I think I can...

300
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,290
I think I have courage now!

301
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,680
That's great. Let's go.

302
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,440
Oh Bong-Goo. Wake up.

303
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
I told you to wake up!

304
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,670
Hey fatso! I'm glad you're here.

305
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,600
I told you not to go to her house!

306
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Fatso, you're...

307
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,590
I'm not a fatso!

308
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,350
Hey fatso, did you just yell at me?

309
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,210
Yes, I did. So?

310
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,640
How dare you!

311
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,280
I'm going to kill you!

312
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,340
Get up. Get up!

313
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm not going to cook for you anymore!

314
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,500
Not until you apologize!

315
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,350
And once again, I'm not fatso.

316
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,220
I'm Kim Su-Duk!

317
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,400
Shove it.

318
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,220
Bong-Goo, I'm watching you!

319
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,320
Hello?

320
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,340
It's me, Jang-Mi.

321
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,490
Jang-Mi...long time no see.

322
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,390
You showed up on your own will.

323
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,640
Have a seat.

324
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,410
Yun-Shil's husband came clean.

325
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,390
What?

326
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:50,390
I never knew you'd do
such a horrendous thing.

327
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm not going to hide anymore.

328
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,310
I'm not going to hide and
ruin my life over you anymore.

329
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,250
Keep this in mind.

330
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:10,220
You don't scare me anymore.

331
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,220
Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk!
Did you guys brush your teeth?

332
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,470
No.

333
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,700
You should brush your teeth
if you don't want your teeth to rot.

334
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,280
How was the science class presentation?

335
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,530
Did you keep your promise?

336
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,410
Yes, I was the first one to raise my hand.

337
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,350
Good.

338
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,640
Come in.

339
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,570
Have some coffee.

340
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:56,620
Why don't we live somewhere
like this for about a year?

341
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,490
It's a private school in England.

342
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,380
I think it'll be a good experience
for Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk.

343
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,450
Sounds great!

344
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,630
But I'll be fired if I take a year off.

345
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,470
Do you want to work there
for the rest of your life?

346
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,630
How can you be an office worker for the rest of your life? That sounds horrible.

347
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,660
They say that your last chance
to change jobs is at age forty.

348
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,690
You can start a business or do something more creative.

349
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,290
Take control of your life.

350
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,480
Doesn't that sound cool?

351
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,430
Yes...

352
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,690
I like this school.

353
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,570
The facilities are nice,
and it's not too far from the city.

354
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,580
That'll be good for the kids.

355
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,600
?Repeat after me.
Repeat after me. ?

356
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:58,400
?Repeat after me. This is great! ?

357
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,330
Tae-Ran, go inside.

358
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,240
Gi-Suk! Eun-Suk! It's time for bed.

359
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,330
Go brush your teeth.

360
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,680
Eun-Suk! Gi-Suk!

361
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,610
Eun-Suk...

362
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,630
Look what you're doing?

363
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,480
This is the reason why
I asked you to move!

364
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,430
What will the neighbors think?

365
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,700
I don't care what my neighbors think.

366
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,650
No wonder you're shameless.

367
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,570
I'm not the one who's shameless.

368
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,540
You're the one who's shameless
for making me see my kids like this.

369
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,520
There's no point in blaming me.

370
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Face it. You're a loser.

371
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,530
You're just holding on because
you don't want to face the facts.

372
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm asking you to move because
you're being pathetic.

373
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:03,650
Now that I'm out of that house,
I can be objective with you.

374
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,680
I can see who you really are.

375
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,310
You're a quibbler.

376
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,430
You think you're all that.

377
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,550
You disrespect other people.

378
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:19,350
Yet I defended you and cared for you...

379
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:24,290
...because you're my husband
and my children's father.

380
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,210
I'm not pathetic.

381
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,550
I'm living my life without you.

382
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,670
Do whatever you want.

383
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,220
Just remember that you don't
belong here anymore!

384
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,660
Mom, are you in pain?

385
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Do you need a kiss?

386
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,510
Do you feel empty?

387
00:39:54,510 --> 00:40:02,250
I...now see what I've lost.

388
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:12,290
I'm pretending to be strong,
but I know what's irreversible.

389
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,410
This is where everything started...
like a midsummer night's dream.

390
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,360
My husband and my mother-in-law always pointed out my mistakes.

391
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,620
I had tons of things to do at home.

392
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,560
I saved every penny I can,
but I couldn't buy that house.

393
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,380
So many things happened
to me since then.

394
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:49,350
It all started here with that moon.

395
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,600
Do you want to go back to
how things used to be?

396
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,250
No.

397
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:15,260
I lost something,
but I gained something else.

398
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,320
I'm Gyung Guk-Hee now.

399
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,460
I have hope.

400
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:29,210
And as long as I have hope,
I can gain back what I've lost.

401
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,300
I'm sure I can start over.

402
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,330
Of course you can!

403
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,440
Of course you can!

404
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,360
Guess what I just did?

405
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,620
I told my husband not to
call me fatso anymore!

406
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,320
You did?

407
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,440
Yes! I feel great!

408
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,580
Thanks, everyone.

409
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:07,260
I thought about what
I want to do from now on.

410
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,500
You'll see me change.

411
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,280
I'll be a good elder sister.

412
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,490
I talked to my ex-husband.

413
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,610
I'm not going to hide anymore.

414
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,350
What's wrong with you guys?

415
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,470
I bought some chicken soup
to cheer you up...

416
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,530
...because I thought
you guys were feeling down.

417
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,540
No one here is in regret?

418
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,380
Doesn't anyone want to
go back to how things were?

419
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:39,590
Go back? No way!

420
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,510
She's right.

421
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,220
Why would I want to go back?

422
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,610
Su-Duk yelled at her husband!

423
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,660
You know what?

424
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,660
I think you guys deserve a reward.

425
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,430
I feel nauseous.

426
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,270
I haven't been at a place
like this in 4 years.

427
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,440
Wow, everyone here is young!

428
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,400
They're still up at this hour!

429
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,560
What do you want us to do here?

430
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,370
We don't need anything.

431
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,490
Yes, you do!
Look at your clothes!

432
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,270
I can't afford clothes from a mall,
but I can get you clothes from here.

433
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,360
Prince Park Suk-Doo is willing
to shell out his pay!

434
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,460
Are you serious?

435
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,460
Well, I can't say no to that.

436
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,260
I'll start first.

437
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,490
Let's go!

438
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,650
Are you serious?

439
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,400
Tae-Ran, you're a great writer.

440
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,620
Do you like it?

441
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,490
It's a great read!

442
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,230
I think this will be an even bigger hit than your last work, Deja vu!

443
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,610
I love this scene!

444
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,610
I'm so proud of you.

445
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,230
Come over here.

446
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,490
No, I have to go.

447
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,690
I have a meeting tomorrow.

448
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,410
Stay a little longer...
just for 30 more minutes, please?

449
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,310
The kids are outside.

450
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,520
So?

451
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,670
It's Mr. Yeom.

452
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,580
Hello? What's up?

453
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,340
To my house? Now?

454
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,680
I love you, Gyung Guk-Hee!

455
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,530
What?

456
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,530
I love you!

457
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,220
Park Suk-Doo!
Stop making fun of me!

458
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,320
Hi, Myung...

459
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,460
Hi.

460
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,700
What are you doing here at this hour?

461
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,690
I would've have come if
I knew that you had a guest.

462
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,310
I'm sorry.

463
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,660
It's okay, Mr. Yeom.

464
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,650
Let's talk outside.

465
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,280
Have fun.

466
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,270
See you next time. Bye.

467
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,240
I'm sorry...

468
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,630
Goodnight.

469
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:51,350
Where's Guk-Hee?
Is she sleeping?

470
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,390
She's not here?

471
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,260
No.

472
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:09,280
Was that...was that your new mistress?

473
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:16,290
You mean Tae-Ran and you are...

474
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,310
I'm hungry...

475
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,490
The food looks great!

476
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,520
I want everything on the menu!

477
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,330
Okay?

478
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,370
Okay!

479
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,210
Where's the restroom?

480
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,220
Around the corner.

481
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,450
Me too!

482
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,660
Stop messing with me.

483
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,340
You're going to get in trouble
if you do that again.

484
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

485
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,490
I feel great.

486
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,670
Me too.

487
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:01,670
It's tough, but I'm glad
I'm with good people.

488
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:08,400
I'm proud of myself
for pulling through.

489
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,400
Guess what?

490
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,490
I don't think I can hang out with college students anymore. I think it'll be boring.

491
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Thanks, Suk-Doo.

492
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,510
You're much younger than me,
but I think of you as a good friend.

493
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,570
Now you think I'm a friend?

494
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,330
But I don't want to be
your friend anymore.

495
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,590
I thought you said once a friend,
always a friend.

496
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,570
You don't want to be
friends anymore?

497
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,260
I feel happy!

498
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,250
Hello, night time!

499
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,380
I haven't been outside
at night in a long time!

500
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,630
Same here.

501
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,480
I haven't felt this great in a long time.

502
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:03,310
By the way, Suk-Doo, you spent
your hard-earned money on us.

503
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:08,680
You should start saving up now if
you want to be a good husband later.

504
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,290
You need practice in order
to be a good husband.

505
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:16,340
Practice? What kind of practice?

506
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,330
Do you want to know?

507
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,340
I want to know how
I can be a good husband.

508
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,360
First, you to be kind.

509
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,600
Everyone grows old.

510
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,500
Families are people
who watch you change.

511
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:41,470
Love will turn into affection, and affection will make an everlasting bond.

512
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,310
If you want to be a good husband...

513
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:50,510
...you need to be kind-hearted
and unchanging.

514
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,700
You to practice how to
make conversation.

515
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,410
If you don't have conversations,
you'll end up like me and Sniff.

516
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,360
A man of hatred
instead of conversations.

517
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,510
Some men will think
your wife is pretty too.

518
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:17,310
Instead of lusting over other women, remember how pretty your wife is.

519
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,240
I want sincerity.

520
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,600
As long as he's sincere,
his family can accept him...

521
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,480
...no matter what the
world thinks of him.

522
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,590
I'll keep that in mind!

523
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,640
Cheers for a good husband!

524
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,640
Cheers!

525
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,440
Nothing's stopping you, isn't it?

526
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,490
I don't know what to say to you.

527
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,500
I can't you believe
you're getting a divorce.

528
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,560
It wasn't easy for me either.

529
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:15,410
Are you sure about this?

530
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,570
I thought this over millions of times.

531
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,250
I'm confident.

532
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,620
A modern good wife?

533
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,310
Is that what you want?

534
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,350
I just want a woman
who's suitable for me.

535
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,430
What brings you to my place tonight?

536
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,340
What happened to your eye?

537
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,280
Who did this to you?

538
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,650
Who is he?

539
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,210
It's a she.

540
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,310
My wife did this to me.

541
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,510
She's a good puncher.

542
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,640
Why?

543
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,430
She gets a little sensitive
when she's writing her thesis.

544
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,540
I came home drunk.

545
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,240
There's nothing wrong with drinking!

546
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,230
I'm supposed to go home early
and sober when she's writing.

547
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,350
That's not a reason to hit you!

548
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,530
How can you let a woman hit you!

549
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,630
Don't talk too loud!
There are people here.

550
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:26,630
If you're so ashamed,
then why did you let her do that to you?

551
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,560
Be a man!

552
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,300
Lose your ego.

553
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,670
Lose your ego?

554
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,340
Everyone's envious of
my acupuncturist wife.

555
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,210
A man should bust out
his wallet faster than a bullet.

556
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,300
That's how I life my life.

557
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,340
I bust my wallet out
and buy everyone drinks and food.

558
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,440
People think I'm great.

559
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:59,340
Life is like a coin with two sides.

560
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,430
If you choose this, you'll lose that.

561
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,380
If you choose that, you'll lose this.

562
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:17,520
I think we're going to have a lot of things to talk about in the future.

563
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,550
Let's call it a day.

564
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,310
Take your time.

565
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,450
Oh, my eye hurts.

566
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,700
Let's drink.

567
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,590
Hello? This is Tae-Ran.

568
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,610
Are you home?

569
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,420
I left my laptop at your place.

570
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,220
I'll go and pick it up right now.

571
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,510
Is Mr. Yeom still with you?

572
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,700
No, you can come over.

573
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,230
Thanks, Suk-Doo.

574
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,440
Although you lost money, you heard a lecture about how to be a good husband.

575
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
Just think of it as tuition.

576
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,350
That's right.

577
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,220
Be a good husband and a good man!

578
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,240
Park Suk-Doo!

579
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,210
Me too!

580
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,450
I'm going to go and
try my new underwear on!

581
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,520
Goodnight!

582
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,630
Guk-Hee! Can you help me?

583
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,560
Stop it!

584
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,350
I feel so much better after a drink.

585
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,380
I'll walk you to the taxi.

586
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,450
No, I can go by myself.

587
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,380
Hey, let go of my hand!

588
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,270
No, my hand's asleep!

589
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,220
Stop it!

590
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:23,240
Don't tell anyone that
my wife punched me!

591
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,690
My lips are sealed.

592
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:33,400
Those young people are lucky.

593
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,260
I hope you stay happy!

594
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,480
Are you jealous?

595
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,520
There's a taxi! Taxi!

596
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,430
No, that's an expensive taxi.

597
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,490
I can afford it.

598
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:03,350
I bust out my wallet faster than a bullet.

599
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,500
Goodnight.

600
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,660
Goodnight!

601
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,490
Stop it!

602
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,280
You're acting strange today.

603
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,380
What do you mean?

604
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,520
You've been acting strange since we were at the shopping center!

605
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,670
You said something like
'I love you' and all.

606
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,230
Do you think that's strange?

607
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,290
Of course it is.

608
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:45,410
Don't say things like that
in front of other people.

609
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:49,300
You're a good friend, but...

610
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,400
Stop it!

611
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,300
I love you. I mean it.

612
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,680
Stop it!

613
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,470
Gyung Guk-Hee!

614
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,680
Are you okay?

615
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,500
Why did you punch him?

616
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,650
What?

617
00:58:30,240 --> 00:59:45,290

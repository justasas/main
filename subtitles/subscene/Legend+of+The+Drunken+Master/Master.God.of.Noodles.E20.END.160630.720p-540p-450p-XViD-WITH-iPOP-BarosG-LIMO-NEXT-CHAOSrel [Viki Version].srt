I want to stop feeling guilty every time I see you. I'm sick and tired of it.

<i>Friends... there's not much to it.</i>

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,210
<i>We both lied about things we shouldn't have lied about.</i>

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,950

35
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,980
Prime Noodle Chef, what are you trying to do right now?

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,910
You've abandoned the kitchen for a week now!

37
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,840
The kitchen is a mess and the customers' complaints are pouring in. Goong Rak Won will close down this way!

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,930
Close it down. It's stranger to keep business running.

39
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,550
What?

40
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,080
Who would eat noodles prepared by a murderer?

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,250
Until Kim Gil Do's trace has been erased from Goong Rak Won, close it. That's the right thing.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,390
It was unfortunate your parents passed away in that manner.

43
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,500
The fact that Kim Gil Do was a murderer is as big of a shock to us as it is to you!

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,400
But why should Goong Rak Won be hurt by that?

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,600
Somehow it's come this far.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,440
eI can't see it fall apart like this. I will not ever stand for that. I can't watch that happen.

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,080
Quit the Prime Noodle Chef position. You are most liable for making Goong Rak Won this way.

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,060
You should've embraced it and covered it up. You dug up a wound.

49
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,560
Leave at once.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,010
I can't leave. I have to protect this position.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,670
Kim Gil Do will appear.

52
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,850
Whoever dies, we'll have to see the end to it then.

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,330
You, really...!

54
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,290
My friend died.

55
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,450
Because I was blinded by my desire to destroy Kim Gil Do to take revenge...

56
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,430
I didn't consider my friends at all.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,270
My friends came into this hell because of me.

58
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,910
It's the same as if I killed Tae Ha.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,450
Madam Seol, let me give you some advice.

60
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,870
My anger... don't let it be directed toward you.

61
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,150
You won't be able to handle it.

62
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,020
So, just stay put. At least until Kim Gil Do dies.

63
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:23,070
Should I give you advice, too? Don't drag in innocent people into your revenge.

64
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,060
You're not the Prime Noodle Chef to me anymore.

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,370
I'll do anything in my power to drag you down.

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,700
Everything is his way or no way.

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,250
He's acting like that as the Prime Noodle Chef. How much worse could he be as the Noodle Master?

68
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,450
Are you going to stay put? Are you listening to me?

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,920
Seriously, how can you be so heartless? His friend died.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,340
We should give him time to mourn.

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,530
What in the world... it's not like you're a pig with an armband. Why are you so frustrated?

72
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,040
What? A pig with an armband? Hey!

73
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,340
What? Did I say something wrong?

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,520
Just because you got a few shares from the Noodle Master,

75
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,550
gosh, you're excited to go around causing a ruckus.

76
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,450
Think of other people. No matter how important noodles are, it's not more important than people.

77
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,540
<i>It...seems like you don't have motion sickness.</i>

78
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,040
<i>I do, if I don't eat.</i>

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,390
<i>Let go, before I yell.</i>

80
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,490
<i> You're the thief, not me. </i>

81
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,170
<i>What? What happened?</i>

82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:34,240
<i>The smell of sweat, cars, and dumplings.</i>

83
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,220
<i>Do you know what they smell like in combination?</i>

84
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,590
<i>It smells like Tae Ha.</i>

85
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,520
What are you doing here?

86
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,000
What is this?

87
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,260
Tae Ha's things.

88
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,470
This is driving me crazy...Just saying his name is making me cry.

89
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,330
Tae Ha...

90
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>Don't misunderstand. I'm throwing it away to you.</i>

91
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,420
<i>I have a request.</i>

92
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,800
<i>Remember my scent.</i>

93
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,660
Secretary Park left quite a trace.

94
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,980
After my father passed away like that,

95
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,090
I know better than anyone else what an empty place a person leaves behind.

96
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,820
There's no other way. You cry your heart out if you want to. What can you do?

97
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,210
There's something I said that's stuck in my heart like a thorn.

98
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,920
When I said you have dirty blood in you...

99
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,260
How could I have said such a thing as a human being?

100
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,660
My blood isn't all that clean, you know.

101
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,650
What I said, just like that...

102
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,530
it's stuck right here. No matter how hard I tried to pull it out, I couldn't.

103
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,780
I'm really sorry, Da Hee.

105
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,320
It's okay. You weren't being genuine...

106
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,790
I knew it.

107
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,450
And you know Moo Myeong... he must be struggling so much right now.

108
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,660
Madam Seol will shake him up quite a bit.

109
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,750
His life must've been hell all around. Shouldn't we protect him?

110
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,950
I know.

111
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,360
No matter what anyone says... the person who genuinely loves noodles in Goong Rak Won is...

112
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,530
Myeong.

113
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,720
I will become a source of strength as well.

114
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,050
You and I...

115
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,660
I know very well that we can't go back to the time we used to eat noodles together.

116
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,830
But still...

117
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,700
Whenever you guys go through a hard time, can you sit next to each other like this and comfort each other?

118
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,250
I would really like it if you guys did that.

119
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll do that, Madam.

120
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,010
Also,

121
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,010
thank you very much.

122

Prosecutor.

127
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,260
Did something happen?

128
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,970
Prosecutor, it's my fault.

129
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,200
Stop this act, you son of b*itch.

130
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,450
Arrest him.

131
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,540
He's not here yet?

132
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,250
He's on his way.

133
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,930
I'm sorry. Due to my disability...

134
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,740
Can we start right away?

135
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,780
Of course. I've lived for this day.

136
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,850
Let's go.

137
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,070
You remember, right? Secretary Hwang Seong Rok.

138
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,010
How can I forget?

139
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,540
You look good.

140
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,280
You've lost some weight.

141
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,100
You seem to have suffered a little.

142
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,340
What suffering?

143
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,610
Even in hiding, I've given out my signature.

144
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,990
People didn't have much interest in me as I had expected.

145
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,140
People will now have more interest in you.

146
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,520
We will start with your relationship to each other first.

147
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,610
Kim Gil Do...

148
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,950
May 27, 2014. You ordered Hwang Seong Rok's murder under a bridge, right?

149
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,630
What are you talking about?

150
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,950
Why would the Noodle Master want to kill me?

151
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,370
These questions were formed based on your testimony.

152
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,710
There must've been a mistake.

153
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:34,390
Or the coercive mood could've been present during the time of my testimony.

154
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,000
Whether I made that type of testimony or not...

155
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,430
I can't really remember.

156
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,860
What are you doing right now?!

157
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,790
All the testimony procedures are recorded and remain as evidence.

158
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,050
The mood was not coercive and there was no mistake.

159
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,360
What happens if I retract my testimony?

160
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,150
Don't say that you guys...

161
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,550
I have no intention of maintaining the same testimony.

162
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,150
I retract my testimony.

163
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,700
Take away the reference witness Hwang Seong Rok.

164
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,270
Did you tamper with the witness while you were on the run?

165
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,610
Just take things as they are.

166
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,190
Don't imagine things.

167
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,450
You animal.

168
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,510
You look upset, Prosecutor.

169
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,050
I'll lighten up your load.

170
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,120
You know Assemblyman So Tae Seop's housekeeper from the past...

171
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,550
I did kill her.

172
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:30,360
I did kill her, yes. But Ha Jung Tae and his wife's murders...

173
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,270
You only have Choi Soon Seok's testimony, but no evidence.

174
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,760
And unfortunately, the statute of limitations on both cases have expired.

175
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,300
And Assemblyman Choi's case on the checks that were issued...

176
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:54,400
CEO Lee Jeong Beom of Raymond Company did that.

177
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,290
And since the Prosecutors' Office dropped that case, I have nothing to do with that.

178
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:05,880
And you said I ran away for seven days while I was being arrested.

179
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,840
It's not running away...

180
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,470
It was an accident. Due to the shock, in the state of panic...

181
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,030
I got lost.

182
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,490
What about Tae Ha? You killed him!

183
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,590
You killed him to hide your secrets!

184
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,920
That's just you imagining things.

185
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,590
A prosecutor should only use evidence. She must not use speculation and her imagination.

186
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,250
You son of a b*tch!

187
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,390
Prosecutor, you must not.

188
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,000
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong, listen carefully.

189
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,160
I did not kill Tae Ha.

190
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,490
Whether you believe me or not, I don't care.

191
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,130
But that is the truth.

192
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,500
Secretary Hwang.

193
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,890
Say it.

194
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,430
I'd like you to take care of one more thing for me.

195
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,910
Are you not aware that we are

196
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,710
in the restroom of the prosecutors' office?

197
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,000
I have an item I need. It's hard to come by it, but I really need you to get it for me.

198
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Would a person be able to come by it? It's only through money you can get it.

199
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,860
What is it that you want?

200
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,120
Then, are we forced to acquit Kim Gil Do?

201
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,090
We've been embarrassed due to conducting a difficult exigent arrest and coercing testimony that's been retracted.

202
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,070
Is that right?

203
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,660
Give me a little more time. If I dig a little more...

204
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,450
If you dig...

205
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,630
does nonexistent evidence appear?

206
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,140
Only in seven days, the bastard manipulated the witness and even obtained evidence.

207
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,650
During those seven days you relaxed!

208
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,430
- I'm sorry.<br> - I received a report about you accepting a bribe.

209
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,880
I know all of the money went to the orphanage.

210
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,090
I understand you had no choice but to accept it to get to Kim Gil Do. But...

211
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,780
A criminal is a criminal.

212
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,560
You have two choice. One, dismissal.

213
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,100
The other choice is to be arrested for accepting a bribe.

214
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,390
Why don't you dismiss me?

215
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,100
You're suspended from this moment on until you receive a formal dismissal.

216
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,450
You're prohibited to conduct any business as a prosecutor.

217
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Noodle Masters @ Viki</i>

218
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,850
That insect like man.

219
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,710
Should I take care of it?

220
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:16,490
There's no need to make my rash even bigger by scratching it before the upcoming event.

221
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,150
At the political convention, I'll get the control of the party.

222
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,280
I'll enter the presidential election right away.

223
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,860
You can always clean a bug, don't you think?

224
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,360
If you change your mind, let me know.

225
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,110
Instead, increase my security.

226
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,990
That Kim Gil Do... he's more than capable of coming to get me.

227
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,450
Assemblyman, Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong is here to see you.

228
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,460
Tell her to come in!

229
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,710
- Assemblyman. <br>- Kim Gil Do got released?

230
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,150
The witness retracted his testimony.

231
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,510
The witness played you. He got his case dropped.

232
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,120
He must be so happy.

233
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,640
Please give me another chance.

234
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,880
Weren't you dismissed? Now, just forget everything and...

235
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,280
look for a new line of work. You're smart, so...

236
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,830
you won't have a problem making a living wherever you go.

237
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,780
I can't give up here.

238
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,430
You have to help me so that

239
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,780
in the future when you do big things, there won't be any problems.

240
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,050
Look at this girl, you've been soaking in shit water. Are you threatening me now?

241
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,700
If you feel that it is a threat... then yes, it is a threat.

242
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,230
What you're doing right now... it's not just a threat. It's called bluffing.

243
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,700
You... do you even have the classified document?

244
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,740
Of course.

245
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,230
Are you certain?... I'm asking if you're certain?!

246
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,930
<i> Yeo Gyeong, there are so many stars by the prison window tonight...</i>

247
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,170
<i> Whenever I received a letter from you, I wrote you a reply. </i>

248
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:53,880
<i> I've been meaning to mail it to you. But I put them away because I didn't want to shake you up. </i>

249
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,820
<i> Read it whenever you think of me. </i>

250
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,360
<i> That's enough for me, Yeo Gyeong. </i>

251
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,590
Kim Gil Do.

252
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,950
The best spot to stab is your back.

253
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,270
You can't turn your back too easily.

254
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,060
Get out immediately.

255
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,130
When someone feels threatened, their pupils dilate.

256
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,430
That way, they can better see dangerous situations.

257
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,690
And their mouths slightly widen.

258
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,660
They're getting ready... to scream 'save me'.

259
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,680
That includes you as well.

260
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,220
You haven't changed a bit. Then and even now.

261
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,060
Tae Ha was killed by So Tae Sub.

262
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,310
Choose now...

263
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:26,210
So Tae Seop who killed Tae Ha. I, who ordered your parents' murder.

264
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,490
If you choose So Tae Seop,

265
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,160
you and I will work together on the same side.

266
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,330
If you choose me, we have to fight until one of us dies.

267
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,750
There are no other options.

268
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,350
We have to end this tiresome unlucky fate somehow.

269
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:58,560
Give me proof that So Tae Seop killed him... until you show me, I can't believe it.

270
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:21,140
It's a picture of my daughter Da Hae kidnapped by So Tae Seop.

271
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,300
and this...

272
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,230
<i> We're exchanging your daughter for your life. It's simple.</i>

273
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,750
<i> There's a warehouse in Incheon. I'll give you the address. Hurry up and go there.</i>

274
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,450
<i> You die and let your daughter live. Isn't that a fair trade? </i>

275
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,700
He made this same call to Tae Ha.

276
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,520
and Tae Ha arrived at the warehouse first...

277
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,060
that's how he died.

278
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,940
I will kill So Tae Seop.

279
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,160
I need your help to do that.

280
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,370
<i>One... Two... Three...</i>

281
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,860
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry at all...</i>

282
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,760
<i> Kim Gil Do! </i>

283
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,470
<i>Shut up!</i>

284
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,120
<i> If I was going to kill you, I could've done it a hundred times over! </i>

285
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,180
<i>It's not over yet. So look forward to it.</i>

286
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,170
<i>My father was a monster who killed two people.</i>

287
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,380
<i>I did not become a monster.</i>

288
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,640
<i>To say you've become a monster due to your unfortunate past...</i>

289
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,620
<i>that excuse is not allowed.</i>

290
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,550
<i>What do you know about me?</i>

291
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,940
<i>I saw your sincere feeling at the ossuary that day.</i>

292
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,130
<i>You said that you were acting. But you can't cry like that falsely.</i>

293
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,380
<i>Please keep your last shred of genuine intentions.</i>

296
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,110
- Gil Do, have you been well?<br> - <i>I've been suffering a bit thanks to you.</i>

297
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,660
You're going through a lot in your old age. Why are you so greedy?

298
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,060
If you live a grounded life, things like these would not have happened.

299
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,170
<i>How could it be compared to your greed?</i>

300
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:18,250
<i>It's not about my greed. It's because of my lack of power that I had to let myself be manipulated.</i>

301
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,970
How can you say that?

302
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,680
<i>Can I come in?</i>

303
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,850
Why did you kidnap Da Hae?

304
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,090
Only then will you show yourself.

305
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,480
I can't imagine that you would be nonchalant about your own daughter.

306
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,680
Why did you kill Tae Ha?

307
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,080
It's not that I wanted to kill him,

308
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,960
it's that he came to me to be killed.

309
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,570
He thought that his death would ensure Da Hae would live, and that Prosecutor Chae could also be saved.

310
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,160
He and you are two entirely different persons.

311
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,080
Wouldn't it be enough for you to take away the classified document?

312
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,090
Wouldn't it have been enough for you to steal the noodle recipe?

313
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,440
Why did you have to kill? Even to burn two persons to death, and causing all that commotion?

314
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,890
Everything started after having met you, Assemblyman.

315
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,600
It all went downhill from then onwards.

316
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,850
There's no turning back since.

317
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,610
That's right. There's no turning back now.

318
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,450
<i>I want to kill Assemblyman So Tae Sub.</i>

319
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,890
<i>To do that, I need your help, Prosecutor Chae.</i>

320
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,600

Why are you here?

324
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,720
I have a favor to ask of you. Help me to meet Assemblyman So Tae Sub.

325
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,500
That won't be difficult.

326
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,840
But you have to tell me the reason.

327
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,130
Tae Ha was killed by Assemblyman So Tae Sub.

328
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,380
I definitely cannot forgive him.

329
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,930
That's dangerous, Yeo Gyeong. If you fall deeper, you will not be able to climb out of it.

330
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,910
I already lost Tae Ha. I don't want to lose you too.

331
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,800
After losing me as well, who are you going to obstruct next?

332
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,360
- We can't continue to endure and suffer in silence.

333
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,400
We can't let Tae Ha leave in such a lonely way.

334
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,300
At least for us, we can't do that.

335
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,750
How can I forget this fragrant smell?

336
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,460
Do you know how much I longed to eat Lotus Flower Noodle?

337
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,410
I should have offered it to you often. I'm sorry.

338
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,470
Don't say stuff like that.

339
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:47,580
If not for you, when can I find an opportunity like this to eat such a precious noodle?

340
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,420
Excuse me, Assemblyman.

341
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,540
Yes.

342
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,640
I have a favor to ask of you.

343
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,870
Tell me. Whatever it is, can I say no?

344
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,890
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong wants to meet you.

345
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,170
How do you know Prosecutor Chae?

346
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,100
I have been summoned several times because of Kim Gil Do.

347
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,620
It looks like I shouldn't have uttered those words. Please take it as if you didn't hear them.

348
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,620
No, it's not that. Alright, since she wants to meet me so badly, I should meet her.

349
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,980
- Da Hae. <br>-Yes.

350
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,070
You have to pace yourself. If you continue this way, you will collapse from exhaustion.

351
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,070
There are people who could make 100 bowls of noodles by themselves.

352
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't like this. I'm going crazy with worry because of you.

353
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,130
Noodle Chef Kim Da Hae, please make one palace pheasant buckwheat noodles.

354
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,790
You should give the order to the Assistant Noodle Chef first.

355
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,070
Oh? What? I'm the Assistant Noodle Chef. What is it?

356
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:29,070
The customer wants <i>you<i> personally to cook and serve him.</i></i>

357
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,800
Pardon?

358
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,100
Over here.

359
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,050
I came as a customer today.

360
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,920
Your skill in kneading the dough has improved quite a bit.

361
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,700
The stickiness is just perfect and the smell of buckwheat is perfect as well.

362
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:43,730
With this level of your skill, you won't be ashamed anywhere out there.

363
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,030
Who killed Tae Ha?

364
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,660
Tell me.

365
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,390
Did you kill him? Is that the case?

366
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:10,840
Tell me that it isn't. Please tell me that you didn't do it.

367
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,050
It wasn't me.

368
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,700
Then, whose doing is it?

369
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,480
Who killed him?

370
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,260
Someone you don't know. You shouldn't know who did it either.

371
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,630
It's because of you. Everything is because of you!

372
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:10,120
Why didn't you answer your phone that time? If you had answered, then I wouldn't have been kidnapped.

373
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,900
Tae Ha... He died while trying to save me.

374
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,350
I said he died because of me.

375
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,800
No. If you hadn't done anything bad, then Tae Ha wouldn't be dead now.

376
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,450
You should've died.

377
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,420
You're the one who committed the crime. Why did an innocent person have to die?

378
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,880
Why? Why? WHY?

379
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,750
Aigoo... It's been a while, Prosecutor.

380
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,880
- Have you been well? <br> -Thanks to you.

381
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,870
You didn't call me because I'm nice, so what's the matter?

382
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,490
I found out who kidnapped Da Hae.

383
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,140
That person killed Tae Ha too.

384
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,210
Who is the bastard?

385
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,290
Only allow Chae Yeo Gyeong to come up here.

386
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,050
Block the rest.

387
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,640
Alright.

388
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,640
There's no use in that.

389
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,860
There is no one to help you.

390
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,490
What are you doing right now?

391
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,320
Tae Ha is a friend like my life.

392
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,060
That Tae Ha was killed by you.

393
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,460
So... are you trying to kill me?

394
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,970
No. We don't kill people.

395
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,780
Tae Ha and I both.

396
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,170
Even if you get things crooked, say the right thing.

397
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,950
It's not that you don't kill, it's that you cannot kill.

398
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,720
I'm a man who moves a nation.

399
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,880
If you lay your finger on me,

400
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,730
you do know what's going to happen, right?

401
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:47,780
Then you guys will disappear without any trace.

402
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,770
Because you said that, let's just go with that w can't kill people.

403
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:01,400
But it seems there is someone who's not like us.

404
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,110
Then...

405
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,950
What are you doing?!

406
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,890
<i>The caller could not pick up the phone.</i>

407
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:32,890
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to you by <br> The Lucky Team @ Viki </i>

408
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,130
Thirty years ago,

409
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,670
the moment that I met you,

410
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,660
everything became a mess.

411
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,020
If I hadn't seen a flyer for a tutor...

412
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,110
How do you think that my life would have been?

413
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,560
You would've gone elsewhere and...

414
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,290
lived imitating someone else's life.

415
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:37,690
And if you liked something of his, you would've stolen everything from him.

416
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,460
I've even thought of living a new life.

417
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,860
But it doesn't seem so easy.

418
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,180
I became too sick of it.

419
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,340
The whole world knows that you're a murderer.

420
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,170
Living a new life... do you think that that is possible?

421
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,210
That's why now... I'm wondering if I should give up.

422
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,090
<i>If there's something that you're upset with... </i>use words!

423
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,830
You want an assemblyman's gold badge, right? I'll give you one. No, not just one. I can give you ten. Hey!

424
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,860
Calm down, Gil Do!

425
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,110
This is not it! There has been a misunderstanding!

426
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,720
Stop!

427
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,100
Today, once more, it seems I have to live as a monster.

428
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,980
Goodbye.

429
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,420
Were you waiting for me?

430
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,680
What are you doing?

431
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,640
Something that a scaredy cat like you couldn't do.

432
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,450
Ha Jung Tae. Park Tae Ha.

433
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,910
You died because I was born.

434
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,110
As I lived life,

435
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,740
there was one moment I felt guilty.

436
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,670
When I pushed Ha Jung Tae, your father

437
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,830
off the cliff.

438
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,590
I've lived with many names.

439
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,610
When Ha Jung Tae disappeared, I was the most happiest.

440
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,650
Like that name was mine from the beginning.

441
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,190
Because of that happiness,

442
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,600
we had to live in hell.

443
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,110
I'm sorry but I am not sorry at all.

444
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,920
In order for me to survive...

445
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,650
I just did my best.

446
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,750
Is that wrong?

447
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,930
You monster.

448
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:13,160
I thought of living under pretense another time.

449
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,870
but, doing that got me so bored.

450
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:41,890
Your father's notebook... I stole it.

451
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,990
That was the beginning of Goong Rak Won.

452
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,260
One bullet left.

453
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,460
To use it on you,

454
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,320
or use it on me. You decide.

455
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,240
Because I was born,

456
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,050
how many more people will die?

457
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:50,010
Is that a misfortune or being lucky?

458
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,960
No.

459
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,590
You can't die so easily.

460
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:01,150
Myeong... no, Soon Seok...

461
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,060
this isn't you taking revenge.

462
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,180
I'm ending it myself.

463
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:16,550
The beginning and end... I always form my own judgment and...

464
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,960
I decide.

465
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,830
No!!

466
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,530

471
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,980
I came to surrender myself.

472
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,380
Surrender?

473
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,190
As in "Surrender yourself and live in light?"

474
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:36,830
November 11, 2007. The murder case from Sarang Orphanage. I'm the culprit.

I mean... What are you saying right now?

476
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,450
Other than that, I committed evidence tampering, accepting bribery, ordering murder...

Master Liu, even though these refugees have starved for days,

Master Liu.

34
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,440
You said that we have to open the granary and give out food, right?

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,210
-Okay, let's do that.<br>-That's right.

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:58,080
Master Liu, I see that your mind is drifting away. It must be because that you have traveled too much these days and haven't had enough rest.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,010
I will be holding a feast at Jade Flower House tonight.

38
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,900
I hope Master Liu would come and relax a little bit.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,700
Master Liu, what do you think?

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
-Jade Flower House?<br>-Yes.

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,100
The music at Jade Flower House

42
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,980

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes.

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,620
Music?

45
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,780
Okay, then. I could get to know the culture of this place.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,220
Good, then I'll be waiting for Master Liu at Jade Flower tonight.

47

We'll definitely get drunk with Master Liu tonight.

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,750
Why am I thinking about that bookworm?

My Go board!

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,320
Mistress, what has happened to you today? We've never seen you being so ill at ease.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,870
Yeah. Mistress was repeating something to herself just a minute ago.

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,180
I think...she is missing Master.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,280
Who... Who is missing him?

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,060
Stop guessing!

58
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,560
I think I also heard Master's name just a while ago.

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,400
You... Do the two of you have any manners?

60
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,130
Let's see how I'm gonna take care of you!

61
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,750
Mistress won't allow us to say the truth.

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,440
Exactly. Mistress, please don't hit us.

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,490
We'll pretend like we didn't hear anything.

64

Go, go, go. Get out of here. I don't want to see the two of you.

65

Yes, yes, yes. Mistress, we'll leave then.

66
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,950

<i>What level am I, a nine-tail-fox, at?</i>

70
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,850
<i>How can I possibly be obsessed with him?</i>

71
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,990
<i>It's impossible for a nine-tail-fox to be obsessed with anything.</i>

72
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,830
<i>Not to mention a dull person like Liu Changyan.</i>

73

84

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,290
I just made a new friend today. Her name is Ying'er.

91
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,090
She's clever and sensible. I'm very fond of her.

92
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,870
Moreover, she is very beautiful and so is her dance.

93
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,660
She is a lovely girl.

94
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,790
I really like her.

95
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,730
Could there really be a beauty like that in this world?

96
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,250
Even the Duchess would appreciate her?

97
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,970
Your Highness, I don't usually praise someone.

98
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,120
It's just that this girl is really lovely. Even I fell for her.

99
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,030
Then she must be a stunning beauty, right?

100
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,450
Your Highness, this girl is congenial to me.

101
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,140
How about I invite her to come to our house someday

102
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,950
to view the moon, have a little wine,

103
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,370
and dance a little bit? Your Highness, what do you think?

104
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,040
Good. Of course.

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,870
Since you like it,

106
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,210
go ahead and do it immediately.

107
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,640
Okay.

108
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,230

the Ninth Duke have a feast in his house tonight. The Duchess invited me to dance for them.

How did you get to know the Duchess?

You can. Of course, you can.

158
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,350
Oh, be careful with what you say and how you act.

159
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,720
Make sure you don't offend anybody at the Duke's place.

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
I understand. Thank you, Master.

161
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,930
Maid, quickly. Bring out all of my pretty clothes.

162
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,930
You look really beautiful.

163

Why are you just standing there, Master?

164
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,800
Today, I brought a bottle of vintage wine to share with you.

165
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,090
It's already been a long time

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,080
since the last time we've drank together.

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,460
I remember that when I first met you,

168
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,560
I wanted to hold your hand everyday

169
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,620
and talk while we drank.

170
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,890
How many years have passed since then?

171
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,710
Yeah.

172
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,980
Age has mercy over no one.

173
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,950
With the blink of an eye, so many years have passed.

174
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,460
I still remember that,

175
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,890
when I first met you,

176
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,690
you were sitting by the river, staring blankly, like a goddess.

177
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,990
I was thinking then that I had to marry you.

178
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,660
It was all arranged by God.

179
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,220
When I got home, I realized that our families had been friends for generations.

180
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,860
Coincidentally, I would always run into you in my backyard.

181
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,000
You really think that happened by chance?

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,280
It didn't happen by chance?

183
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,840
Ever since I had met you,

184
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,080
I would always think of various excuses to go visit your family.

185
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,630
Then I would stay in the backyard for a whole day

186
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,850
just to see you.

187
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,170
After that, I would miss you for a whole month,

188
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,940
and wish for our next meeting to come soon.

189
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,970
Actually...

190
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,740
I would always go to the backyard, thinking that maybe I would see you again.

191
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,950
Really?

192
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,880
Then why didn't you tell me?

193
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,920
What's so important about this?

194
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,900
-Master.<br>-I'm here.

195
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,920
<i>From this day on, you can let Master Hong stay in your room.</i>

196
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,670
<i>But you can't let him decide this. You must take control.</i>

197
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,670
<i>You have to reject him a couple of times and leave him wanting for more.</i>

198
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>What is it?</i>

199
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,750
I'm feeling sick all of a sudden. I'm afraid that I can't drink with you anymore.

200
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,840
If you're sick, then I should stay by your side.

201
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,710
Someone come here! Find a doctor!

202
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,470
No, no, no. It's okay.

203
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,700
Why?

204
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,560
I've already promised the Buddha that

205
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,330
I will have three days of abstinence. I'm afraid that I can't stay with you in the same room.

206
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,740
Please go rest, Master.

207
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,960
I won't go with you any further, Master.

208
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,620
Please rest early.

209
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,110
You rest early, too. I'll come and see you again after a couple of days.

210
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,880
Okay.

211
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,780
She is my wife,

212
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,980
yet she's acting like someone else's wife.

213
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,590
Someone come here.

214
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,440
-Master.<br>-Where's Second Mistress?

215
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,050
The Duchess took Mistress to her home.

216
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,060
I forgot about that. Ying'er is going to dance at the Duke's house tonight.

217
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,360
Okay.

218
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,960
You go fetch some water for me. I'm gonna wash up. I'll sleep here tonight.

219
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,950
Yes, Master.

220
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,790
I remember that I took Ying'er in

221
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,050
because she danced well.

222
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,960
Now when I think about it,

223
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,370
that's the only merit she had.

224
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,700
My wife is better.

225
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,060
Qin (an instrument), Go (a game), calligraphy, and painting. She knows them all.

226
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,510
Moreover, she is educated, reasonable, clever, and virtuous.

227
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,790
She is also more graceful than Ying'er.

228
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,090
Now we're like this.

229
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,980
It's all my fault.

230
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,370
Heng'er is here?

231
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,880
Heng'er is here!

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,980
Heng'er!

233
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,340
Your Highness, I didn't lie to you, right?

234
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,870
Isn't she lovely?

235
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,940
Ying'er is as beautiful as a flower and her dance is so graceful.

236
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,740
It's hard to find someone like her even in the capital.

237
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,070
Come here, Sister. Come and meet His Highness.

238
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,390
Your Highness, I'm not that good. Her Highness praises me too highly.

239
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,260
Exactly.

240
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,890
This girl does look pretty.

241
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,910
But when it comes to appearance and posture, Mrs. Liu, Tao Heng, should be number one in this world.

242
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,860
Duchess, how can this friend of yours compare with her?

243
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,340
-Your Highness!<br>-Your Highness!

244
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,530
Not only does Ying'er dance well, she can also drink.

245
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,370
Come here, Sister, drink with His Highness until he is content!

246
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,190
-Yes.<br>-No need for that.

247
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,780
I'm not in a good mood tonight.

248
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,010
Let's end here.

249
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,780
Your Highness!

250
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,330
Tao Heng,

251
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,400
I will definitely return this shame to you someday.

252
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,210
My beauty...

253
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,700
I miss you so much...

254
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Liu Changyan,

255
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,560
how can you deserve such a beautiful wife?

256
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,860
Someone come!

257
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,830
Your Highness, those who can rule the world are kings.

258
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,780
Those who have power get to dominate.

259
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,580
You are from the royal bloodline and have authority over the court.

260
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,330
Don't you have the courage to kill all gods and demons?

261
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,460
Anyone who is preventing you from having that beauty

262
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,710
should be killed.

263
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,630
Your Highness, what do you think?

264
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,100
Kill them all!

265
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,290
Then I can have my beauty.

266
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,840
That's right.

267
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,550
Kill him.

268
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,060
Kill him!

269
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,250
That way you can have the woman that you've lost your soul to.

270
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,960
Your favorite! Favorite!

271
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,660
Kill him...

272
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,930
Kill him.

273
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,460
Kill Liu Changyan.

274
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,380
Then I can have the woman I love the most.

275
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,850
Liu Changyan...

276
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,200
I'll make sure that you never come back.

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Here, here, here. Cheers...

278
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,610
Here, Master.

279
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,030
Please drink.

280
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,290
Very nice.

281
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,870
Good.

282
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,470
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.

283
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,930
Good. Look at that body.

284
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,690
Good!

285
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,000
-Nice dancing.<br>-Good.

286
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,470
Very nice.

287
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,650
Come here quickly. Drink wine with Master Liu.

288
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,940
It's okay. It's okay.

289
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,130
Thank you for dancing for us.

290
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,690
I still have to discuss some matters with these officials.

291
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,230
You may go now.

292
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,990
Looks like Master Liu has gotten used to the beauties in the capital.

293
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,080
The beauties in a small town like ours

294
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,100
are not attractive at all.

295
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,070
-Yeah.<br>-No, no, no. I don't mean that.

296
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,950
I'm really thankful for this feast and dance

297
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,550
you've prepared for me.

298
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,080
It's just that my wife has warned me at home,

299
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,960
and also I'm not interested in prostitutes.

300
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,030
I can only appreciate your kindness and decline your offer.

301
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,560
Master Liu, since you respect your wife so much,

302
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,310
Mrs. Liu must be extremely virtuous and beautiful.

303
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,260
Not at all. Not at all.

304
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,420
<i>My wife is more than extremely beautiful...</i>

305
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,970
Since Master Liu is not interested in the beauties,

306
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,130
then we'll drink with Master Liu.

307
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,760
Here, Master Liu, I'll drink a toast to you.

308
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,670
We won't leave until we're drunk tonight.

309
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,270
-Toast to you. Toast to you.<br>-Here. Please drink.

310
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,210
<i>Liu Changyan, you dare to drink more?</i>

311
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,920
<i>You have been so disrespectful to senior!</i>

312
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,730
<i>You still have to save the entire fox clan and you're drinking now?</i>

313
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,000
<i>And you even have feelings toward...</i>

314
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,580
<i>I'm a bastard!</i>

315
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,700
I'll drink a toast to Master Liu and Mrs. Liu.

316
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,120
-Here, here, here. Cheers.<br>-Cheers.

317
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,980
Cheers.

318
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,160
Masters! Let me, let me!

319
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,520
You must be tired.

320
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,110
Thank you for sending me home. You can go back now.

321
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,430
Okay, Master Liu, you take rest.

322
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,210
-We'll leave then.<br>-Goodbye.

323
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,670
-Goodbye, goodbye.<br>-Be careful!

324
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,040
-Master...<br><i>-Let's head home, too.</i>

325
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,250
What's wrong? Why do you look so worried?

326
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,450
Mistress is here.

327
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,940
-Who's here?<br>-Mistress, Nine-Tail-Fox senior is here to visit you!

328
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,750
Heng- Heng'er is here?

329
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,340
Wh-where is she?

330
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,960
You go in first.

331
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,310
-I'm not going in there.<br>-You're a good for nothing...

332
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,520
You're a good for something; you go in!

333
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,740
Fine, I'll go in!

334
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,430
-Do I look like I'm drunk?<br>-Uh-uh!

335
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,270
Don't push me!

336
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,230
Heng'er, why did you come here?

337
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,440
What? Is this a bad time?

338
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,490
Did I interrupt something good for you?

339
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,170
No, no, no! This is a great time, a great time!

340
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,200
You stayed out all night?

341
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,220
You arrived here last night?

342
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,330
If I hadn't, were you going to lie to me?

343
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,110
Of course not. Why would I lie to you?

344
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,710
Alright.

345
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,700
Tell me the truth, where did you go drinking?

346
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,840
Drink? No, no, no, I didn't drink.

347
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,320
The local magistrates held a welcome party,

348
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,830
and I couldn't refuse, so I went.

349
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,310
I just had a few cups...

350
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,210
and just got home from the party.

351
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,160
Welcome party?

352
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,670
You are really considerate!

353
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,660
Was it really with a few magistrates?

354
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,260
-Yes! Yes!<br>-You're still lying to me!

355
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,280
Very good , Liu Changyan! You usually look very earnest,

356
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,680
but I didn't expect that, after pretending to be human for a few days,

357
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,520
you‘d gotten better at everything except for drinking!

358
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,750
You even learned how to lie!

359
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,500
Heng'er, I really didn't!

360
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,030
You know how much I can drink. I only took a few sips. I didn't even touch the fingers of those dancers...

361
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,090
Dancers?

362
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,220
Other than drinking, you're even accompanied by dancers?

363
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,530
Heng'er, I swear, I didn't even touch the fingers of those dancers!

364
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,570
If I did anything that may hurt you,

365
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,830
I will be struck by lightning and die a painful death!

366
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,500
And I was worried about you!

367
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,350
I was afraid that you wouldn't get used to the bitter life in this small town.

368
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,980
I didn't expect that you were enjoying it here!

369
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,890
I realize now that you have gotten more and more used to the life in the human world!

370
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,900
Heng'er,

371
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,300
-please believe in me...<br>-Don't come over!

372
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,710
I feel very tired right now. I need to rest. Get out!

373
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,460
Then I'll get out...

374
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,790
This lad right here, who are you?

375
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,920
How come you look familiar even though I've never met you before?

376
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm the Second Mistress!

377
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,620
What? You don't recognize me?

378
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,140
Second Mistress? Are you joking?

379
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,190
But somehow, you look alike...

380
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,160
Of course! That's me!

381
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,690
But you're a man!

382
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,150
I...

383
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,650
I was a man from the very start!

384
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,980
Then...then...then...how come...

385
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,110
Come here. Come here.

386
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,990
Our Master, he...

387
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,130
has a weird hobby.

388
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,880
He let me dress as a woman and live in the Liu's house.

389
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Master?

390
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,000
You and Master?

391
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,170
-Su Xi!<br>-Ah?

392
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,630
What did you say?

393
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,370
No...no...nothing...

394
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,480
-Mistress! He and Master, they...<br>-I know!

395
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,980
Su Xi!

396
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,930
Actually...it's not like that!

397
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,390
I'm actually Master's bodyguard!

398
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,760
I was pretending to be a woman and protecting Master secretly!

399
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,740
Bodyguard?

400
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,310
That's right!

401
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,600
I don't think so...

402
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,000
It's because that I'm intelligent and respond quickly!

403
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,630
And I'm also very loyal.

404
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,610
It's very hard to find someone like me in this world.

405
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,180
A person like me usually has a crucial effect at critical moments.

406
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,880
Is that really so?

407
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,710
If you don't believe me, ask Mistress.

408
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,750
Okay, stop playing around.

409
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,280
-I'm hungry. Go get some food for me.<br>-Yes, Mistress.

410
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,760
No wonder Master never rests at your place.

411
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,620
Su Xi, where is Liu Changyan?

412
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,330
Master went out very early this morning.

413
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,450
He said that he's going to express sympathy to the those in the disaster. He will also take a look at how bad the farmlands are.

414
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,130
He's really serious about it even though he's such a minor official.

415
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,520
Do you know where the disaster area is?

416
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,220
Yes, I know.

417
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,480
The consequence of this disaster is really severe. We need to order the guards to come here and help us.

418
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,570
Master Li, please take care of that matter.

419
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,380
-Okay.<br>-Master Zhao, see if the victims of this drought need anything.

420
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,170
Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,730
Husband!

422
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,810
Wife, why are you here?

423
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,410
You must be very tired after working all morning, right?

424
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,520
I came here to look after you.

425
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,860
Look, you're sweating so much.

426
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,560
Master Liu is indeed a lucky man.

427
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,270
Your wife is not only beautiful but also gentle and caring.

428
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,120
Yes. Yes.

429
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,430
Gentle, caring, and very considerate.

430
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,950
-Yes. Yes.<br>-Not at all. Not at all.

431
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,740
Master, you give me high praise.

432
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,530
My husband came home in the middle of the night last night.

433
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,900
Everyone must have been working hard for the disaster zone.

434
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,850
You must take care of your health.

435
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,610
I won't keep you from your work.

436
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,970
I'll head back for now.

437
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,770
Alright, travel safely Madam!

438
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,650
Heng'er, I'll send you home.

439
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,520
Heng'er!

440
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,090
Heng'er! You really misunderstood me last night!

441
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,160
You keep saying that.

442
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,420
You knew I was angry and you didn't stay home. Why did you run away?

443
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,080
Heng'er, the court sent me to investigate disaster conditions. If I don't investigate and understand it personally,

444
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,070
how would the court give us funds?

445
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,300
If you really felt anything for these refugees,

446
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,080
why did you go drinking? Don't you know that

447
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,240
a cup of wine can feed a family of three for a day?

448
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,820
What you say is right.

449
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,700
Heng'er!

450
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,480
The fault is all on me.

451
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,190
I didn't understand the situation before attending the banquet and created all this misunderstanding.

452
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,570
I'm really angry.

453
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,020
You should be... You should be.

454
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm not joking with you!

455
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,230
I don't dare to joke with you, too.

456
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,820
Come on, Heng'er, you know that I'm not very good at talking. Please don't give me a hard time anymore.

457
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,660
Who's giving you a hard time?

458
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,990
Did you think I came all the way here just to interrogate you?

459
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,680
If I didn't think that you really cared about the people, I wouldn't have bothered to come.

460
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,940
Alright, Heng'er. Let's not talk about this for now.

461
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,080
How about we talk about our real business?

462
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,880
Oh, so now that you've placated me, you want to talk business?

463
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,890
I haven't had news of the Hong couple lately, and I've been worried.

464
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:52,780
Fine, then I'll tell you. That couple are now stuck together like glue.

465
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,470
Like a newlywed couple.

466
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,540
Really?

467
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,010
Then when will they be able to have children?

468
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,370
Liu Changyan, you look like such a straight-laced person normally.

469
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,680
How come you keep abruptly saying things only perverts would say?

470
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,090
That...

471
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,470
When will that couple share a room, have a "good time," have children,

472
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,610
you can ask these things without blushing?

473
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,490
N-no.

474
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,410
That's not what I meant.

475
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,550
Madam must be tired, would you like some water?

476
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,860
No need for water.

477
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,450
But I am a little hungry, is there anything to eat?

478
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,390
There is! Wild vegetable porridge! I'll bring some out for you.

479
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,920
Wild vegetable porridge?

480
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,540
Do you eat wild vegetable porridge every day?

481
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,500
Heng'er, it might sound bad, but it actually tastes pretty good.

482
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,420
Those officials that welcomed you with a banquet

483
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,290
didn't send you any meat and vegetables?

484
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,320
I distributed them to the refugees when I went on inspection.

485
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,140
Didn't you see them? They are really in a pitiful state.

486
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,870
They are pitiful? Aren't you pitiful eating wild vegetable porridge every day?

487
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,350
Why don't you taste it first, it really tastes pretty good.

488
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,210
Madam, wild vegetable porridge.

489
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,710
Here, I'll fill a bowl for you.

490
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,720
Here, taste some.

491
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm not eating; you go ahead.

492
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,350
Heng'er, you haven't eaten all day. Why don't you have a little?

493
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,940
We'll be heading back to the capital the day after tomorrow.

494
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,400
But I'm a little tired, I'm going to take a nap.

495
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,590
Heng'er...

496
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,970
You will need to do this skillfully.

497
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,090
Make it look like disaster refugees rioting against corrupted officials

498
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,080
and take care of Liu Changyan for me.

499
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,470
-Yes, your grace.<br>-Only...

500
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,710
Mrs. Liu must not be harmed in any way.

501
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,940
Don't worry, Your Highness.

502
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,300
In any case, this time,

503
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,020
you must make sure that no one knows.

504
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,940
Yes!

505
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,530
If you can, you must show Lady Nuwa how cruel and ruthless

506
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,410
those she cherishes and protects are.

507
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,050
Willing to kill each other for the greed of a beautiful woman.

508
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,980
What is there to protect?

509
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,850
Why not let the exceptional Fox Clan rule over all

510
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,150
and save you pitiful villains?

511
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,970
<i>Should I try for Madam's room again tonight?</i>

512
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,900
<i>By my count, the three days of abstinence have passed.</i>

513
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,130
<i>Tao Heng, you are nothing.</i>

514
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,180
<i>I won't be satisfied until I get rid of you.</i>

515
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,520
You can't even pour tea now?

516
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,340
I was thinking of what to prepare for you for a night snack.

517
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,600
There's no need.

518
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,160
I will be sleeping in First Mistress' room tonight. Why don't you rest early.

519
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,970
What's going on lately?

520
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,740
Rejections all around.

521
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,450
I remember when we were newlyweds, you did this all the time.

522
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,090
Getting water for my wash.

523
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,020
If I didn't see you all day, then

524
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,990
I wouldn't be able to sleep well.

525
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,230
Good times will always fade away.

526
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,930
Since then, even without me,

527
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,000
weren't you just fine?

528
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,340
Madam!

529
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,050
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have looked for something new and married Ying'er.

530
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,150
I neglected you.

531
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,340
It isn't all your fault.

532
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,770
I didn't bear the Hong family a boy or a girl.

533
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,490
-I almost violated the seven rules<br>- No! no!

534
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,290
It was all my foolishness.

535
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,960
Will you give me another chance?

536
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,420
Will you forgive me?

537
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,490
Then...can we rest now?

538
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,710
Where did this chicken come from?

539
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,970
I saw that you haven't eaten these couple of days,

540
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,460
so I had Su Xi buy it from the villagers.

541
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,980
What... What is it?

542
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,610
What are you doing?

543
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,700
I...I... Nothing.

544
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,970
The chicken is cooked!

545
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,160
-Really?<br>-I'll tear you a piece

546
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,850
Wonderful!

547
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,060
Here, have a taste.

548
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,140
Is it good?

549
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,960
<i>Mistress Nine-tail is so adorable!</i>

550
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,940
<i>Oh heavens, what am I doing now?</i>

551
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,650
<i>Have I gone crazy?</i>

552
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,930
<i>Have I developed feelings for my senior?</i>

553
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
<i>Where is your sense?</i>

554
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,740
<i>Liu Changyan!</i>

555
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,650
Aren't you eating?

556
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,760
Yes! I'm eating, I'm eating!

557
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,540
Eating!

558
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,590
Delicious!

559
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,130
<i>I guess my senses, from the time in the mountains when she started tormenting me,</i>

560
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,560
<i>have been lost</i>

561
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,000
It smells wonderful!

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,650
You ate it all!

563
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,840
And left me the chicken's butt!

564
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,670
What noise is that!

565
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,140
Quick, let's hide.

566
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,370
What are you doing?

567
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,190
-My power isn't working!<br>-Not working?

568
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,940
Get behind me.

569
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,990
Hide.

570
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,920
Who is the bastard Liu Changyan? Come out and die!

571
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,130
It's your responsibility to protect the clan leader, right?

572
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,020
Go out, go!

573
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,700
Sir, he is Liu Changyan! We're all just servants.

574
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,110
Please let us go!

575
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,680
What are you talking about?

576
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,290
You are Liu Changyan?

577
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,950
Sir, the one who is sleeping in there is Mrs. Liu.

578
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,850
Please let us go.

579
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,010
You, go!

580
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,180
You, tie him up!

581
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,660
Let's go!

582
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,910
Yo! You look really pretty!

583
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,020
Let me touch you...

584
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,700
Open your mouth!

585
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,760
Do it quickly! I don't want new problems to rise!

586
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,160
Let's go!

587
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,240
Go! Go! Quickly!

588
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,950
Go! Quickly!

589
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,130
Heng'er, are you alright?

590
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,070
What can go wrong for me?

591
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,800
I feel like there's something unusual about these thugs.

592
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,730
You just said your magic doesn't work anymore. Why is that so?

593
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,210
I have no idea. That never happened before.

594
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,390
But even if my magic doesn't work, we can still use your magic.

595
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,200
We're not allowed to use magic in the human world.

596
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,050
Didn't you already use it just then?

597
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,070
That... That was an emergency.

598
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,710
There's order in the human world. We can't disrupt it.

599
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,590
What rule is that?

600
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,420
The 93-rule of the fox clan. Any fox traveling in the human world cannot use magic.

601
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,880
Anyone who disrupts the order of the human world will stay in the human world forever

602
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,030
and cannot go back to the Green Hill.

603
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,810
Senior, you are a nine-tail-fox. Only nine-tail-foxes won't be restricted by the rules of the fox clan.

604
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,020
I wonder who set that rule.

605
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,550
The elders and my father.

606
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,690
The son is just like his father. I finally understand that phrase now.

607
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,110
Okay, let's stop talking about these useless things.

608
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,810
We have to think of a way to untie these ropes.

609
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,970
But they are too tight.

610
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,770
How can we untie them if we cannot use our magic?

611
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,460
Untie...?

612
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,870
What are you doing?

613
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,840
<i>Nine-tail-fox, as long as you can be heartbroken like the other foxes,</i>

614
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,500
<i>and give me one teardrop,</i>

615
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,360
<i>this magical fruit will ripen.</i>

616
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,150
<i>-Grey-eared-fox?<br>-You destroyed my face and my eye,</i>

617
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,920
<i>and forced me to cut my own tail...</i>

618
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,280
<i>Today, I'm going to make you pay twice the price!</i>

619
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,970
<i>Oh woman!</i>

620
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,810
<i>Won't you drop even one tear for him?</i>

621
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,540
<i>Look at him.</i>

622
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,750
<i>Die!</i>

623
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:35,120

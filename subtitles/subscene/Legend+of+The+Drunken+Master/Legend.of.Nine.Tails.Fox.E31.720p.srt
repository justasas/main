<i>Opening Song: "To Ask the Moon" by Yisa Yu</i>

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,980
♫<i>Fret not that the clouds cover the moon</i>♫

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,150
♫<i>It's just the wind showing its love</i>♫

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,810
♫<i>If we say the stars are the ocean of the sky</i>♫

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,390
♫<i>then the moon is the longing of the tides</i>♫

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,630
♫<i>When the clouds scatter</i>♫

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,590
♫<i>The moon lights up the earth's haze</i>♫

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,880
♫<i>The world stops in this moment</i>♫

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,980

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,750

<i>Enchanted Fox Chapter: Heng Niang</i>

20
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,980
Move!

21
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,810
Yo! You're very pretty!

22
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,110
Let me touch you some...

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,050
Open your mouth!

24
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,090
Hurry up, I don't want any complications.

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,710
Move!

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,560
Move, move! Quick!

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,030
Move! Quick, quick!

28
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,710
Heng'er, are you alright?

29
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,690
How wouldn't I be alright?

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,400
I think there's something odd about these bandits.

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,090
You said your magic failed, what was that about?

32
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,880
I don't know why either; this has never happened before.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,650
But even if my magic's not working,

34
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,870
yours still works.

35
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,610
We can't randomly use magic in the human world.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,060
Didn't you just use it?

37
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,610
Th-That was an emergency.

38
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,280
The human world has its own rules, we can't break them.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
What rule is this?

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,900
The Fox Clan's 93rd Rule: Any Fox clan member who travels the human world is not allowed to use magic.

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,630
If we disrupt the human order, then we must stay in the human world forever and never return to the Green Hill.

42
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,470
Senior you are a nine-tailed fox. Only a nine-tailed fox is not restrained by the Fox Clan's rules.

43
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,640
I'd really like to know who made this rule.

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,030
The Elder, my departed father.

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,080
The fruit does not fall far from the tree. I understand now.

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,560
Alright, let's stop talking about these useless things.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,010
We need to hurry and think of a way to loosen these ropes.

48
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,590
But these ropes are tied too tight,

49
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,990
and neither you nor I can use magic. How do we untie them?

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,780
Untie them...?

51
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,940
What are you going to do?

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,740
Senior, what are you going to do?

53
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,000
Senior?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,810
Senior!

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,500
Senior!!

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,930
That's ticklish! Senior!

57
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,850
Could you please stop?

58
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,030
Even though you can't use magic, you should still be able to handle those bandits right?

59
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes, without magic, I still have my martial arts.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,990
If I hadn't been worried about you getting hurt, I would have fought them.

61
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,220
It's alright, you don't have to explain.

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,940
Let's go after them.

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,790
Hold on, they've already gone so far, how will we find them?

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,970
Don't be a fool.

65
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,040
We're both foxes. Even if we don't use magic, we can find them with this!

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,730
That's right, I am a fool!

67
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,570
Over here! Sit!

68
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,920
Why aren't we killing them?

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,040
What do you know? We'll wait for their family's ransom money,

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,070
-and kill them then!<br>-You so smart!

71
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Don't be afraid, Taozi. I'm here!

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,300
B-But they are ruthless killers,

73
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,250
what if--what if they kill us?

74
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,120
Then I guess we'll just die!

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,530
Then in another 18 years I'll be a man again!

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,690
Anyway, you have me for company.

77
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,160
You won't be lonely on the way to the underworld.

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,180
But I don't want to die!

79
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,990
I don't want to die!

80
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,080
I don't want to die...

81
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,470
But you're not dead yet!

82
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,160
What are you crying about!

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,290
You won't die. Don't worry, I'm a bodyguard!

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,450
Really?

85
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,000
Really!

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,090
Are you really a bodyguard?

87
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,150
I really am a bodyguard! I'll protect you.

88
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,540
<i>Clan leader made me swear not to use magic.</i>

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,410
<i>Now look at us. What to do?</i>

90
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,910
<i>Do I use it or not?</i>

91
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,030
<i>Will a suave, distinguished fox, such as I,</i>

92
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,050
<i>die here</i>

93
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,830
<i>at the hands of such ugly bandits?</i>

94
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,590
<i>No way, definitely not!</i>

95
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,980
<i>I must use a little magic!</i>

96
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,210
Who goes there!

97
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,920
Master is here!

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Master is here?

99
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Does master know martial arts?

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,640
I guess you didn't know, master is...

101
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,620
a martial arts expert hiding in the government!

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,880
Master, I knew you were going to come save us!

103
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,300
How did your ropes get loose?

104
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,570
Oh, those bandits didn't tie me tightly enough.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,810
Master, who did you offend that had them chase you all the way here?

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Lately, disasters have spread. The surrounding bandits are rising; claiming to kill corrupt officials.

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,310
On the surface it looks like the work of bandits.

108
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,760
Even so, it doesn't look that simple.

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,050
We can't bother with that now.

110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,680
We shouldn't linger here too long. While the news that Master Liu has been captured by bandits is traveling,

111
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,600
we should quietly head back to the capital on the safe side.

112
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,420
I think these bandits were following orders.

113
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,390
I wonder whose orders.

114
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,860
Who have you offended as a minor official?

115
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,530
I don't think I have.

116
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,440
Even if the citizens asked, it wouldn't be necessary to plot my death.

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,580
There must be some explanation.

118
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,190
Hey, Su Xi! Master was able to defeat the bandits by himself,

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,170
why would he still need your protection?

120
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,860
Even if you're great at martial arts, you still need to sleep. Right?

121
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,450
Oh, that's true.

122
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,780
Also, Su Xi, where did you learn to disguise yourself as a woman?

123
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,190
I grew up among piles of girls

124
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,280
and I couldn't even tell.

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,010
Oh, that was nothing.

126
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,240
I just learned a few things from street entertainers.

127
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
Did you grow up traveling the world?

128
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,540
Yeah! A good man should see the world and not be tied down in one place!

129
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,460
That's true. I like men like you.

130
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,060
Y-You like me?

131
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,710
Uh, no, I just mean I like men like you, not like master.

132
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,550
Oh, you like my type, and you don't like master.

133
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,700
Don't misinterpret me!

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,910
Even if you had feelings for me, we may not be fated.

135
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,250
Wh-What do you mean?

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,900
You wouldn't understand.

137
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,220
But, Taozi, do you really like me?

138
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,860
I'm not talking to you anymore!

139
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,700
You're making fun of me. I'm going to look for madam.

140
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,310
Tell me!

141
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,690
You can whisper it to me. I've never had anyone like me.

142
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know what it feels like to be liked.

143
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,420
If you keep saying that, I'm going to ignore you.

144
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,930
Alright, I'll stop! I'll stop. Don't be mad, Taozi.

145
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,470
Are you alright? Did you twist your ankle?

146
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,370
What do you think?

147
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,970
I'll help you over there to sit a bit.

148
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,980
Here, have a seat.

149
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,180
Which foot is it?

150
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,630
Please, be gentle.

151
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,890
Is this the spot?

152
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,370
What about this?

153
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,050
Much better.

154
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,970
Your bone shouldn't be hurt; nothing serious.

155
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,120
Without magic, everything is difficult.

156
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,790
I just wanted you to take care of one person! What have you done?

157
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,690
Your subject has failed! Please, forgive me!

158
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,920
Fools! All of you are fools!

159
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,870
Send out a search team and find them immediately!

160
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,900
Protect Mrs. Liu and kill Liu Changyan!

161
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,260
Yes!

162
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,760
I figured you would fail.

163
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,400
But your failure will give me a hand.

164
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,560
This magic fruit

165
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,420
is just missing one drop of fox tears.

166
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,630
Nine-tailed fox, you only have to have your heart broken like the other fox spirits.

167
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,330
And give me one drop of your tears.

168
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,370
This magic fruit

169
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,390
will ripen and break open.

170
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,630
How did we get to this state?

171
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,620
Four people squeezed into one little broken house.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,360
Ah, Su Xi! Su Xi, your life is hard!

173
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,550
Come, Su Xi. A man should be flexible.

174
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,940
I am being flexible!

175
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,270
But if you want me to sleep on a wooden bench, I might as well sleep outside on the ground.

176
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,100
Look, you're thinking of yourself again.

177
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,650
What about the Missus and Taozi?

178
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,800
Su Xi, how about you sleep on the floor and I'll sleep on the bench?

179
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,240
It's dangerous outside at night.

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,960
Don't you go out there!

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,450
Taozi, you treat me the best!

182
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,600
If you want to like me, go ahead!

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,980
-I won't say anything!<br>-Who says I like you!

184
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,760
I don't like you!

185
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,950
Ah, our Suxi is so pitiful.

186
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,850
Looking after us all this way, and now he has to sleep on a wooden bench.

187
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,840
That's right! All this way I've suffered the most!

188
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,090
Hubby, let's ignore them.

189
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,560
Let's rest.

190
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,750
Su Xi, it's late.

191
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,220
Why don't you rest, too?

192
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,580
Then you rest, too.

193
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:46,010
<i>Timing & Subtitles brought to you by Gone with the Shirt Team @viki</i>

194
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,310
If you squirm anymore, you'll fall off.

195
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,840
If you fall off, won't they laugh at you?

196
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,900
I don't want to crowd you.

197
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,520
This blanket's a little thin.

198
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,810
If we cuddle together, it'll be warmer, and I won't be cold.

199
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,080
And we're foxes.

200
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,050
Animals snuggle for warmth. It's nature's way.

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,230
Su Xi

202
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,640
Sleeping like that is so uncomfortable.

203
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,720
Why don't you squeeze in here with me?

204
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,310
Shouldn't men and women not have any contact?

205
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,170
Forget it then.

206
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,050
Wait, I'm not that particular.

207
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,790
Taozi, you're so good to me.

208
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,770
Customers, sorry for the wait!

209
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,550
Here are the noodles you ordered.

210
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,330
I'll split some with you.

211
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,060
I'm not hungry; you eat.

212
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,950
These past few days you haven't eaten much.

213
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,480
Just wild vegetable porridge everyday. I've already eaten half a roast chicken,

214
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,300
and you just had a little.

215
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,060
I'm so hungry my eyes are blurry, how could you not be hungry?

216
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,790
<i>You eat. I'm really not hungry.</i>

217
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,990
<i>Though my magic is sealed,</i>

218
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>my inner energy is still there</i>

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,960
<i>even if I don't eat, I can carry on for a while.</i>

220
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,980
<i>That reminds me.</i>

221
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,900
<i>I just lost my magic, why have I become like a human</i>

222
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,530
<i>and unable to withstand hunger?</i>

223
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,510
<i>You're a woman, I'm a man;</i>

224
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,050
<i>naturally we're different.</i>

225
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,130
<i>What's different? When you first came to the valley to find me,</i>

226
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,060
<i>you couldn't defeat me.</i>

227
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,500
<i>That's because I couldn't simply make moves on you.</i>

228
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,900
<i>You're my senior after all.</i>

229
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,050
<i>You forgot I was your senior when you were so affectionate.</i>

230
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,470
<i>I didn't force you to do anything with me. Why do you keep using words like "senior" "junior" all day?</i>

231
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,430
Heng'er!

232
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,680
Don't eat then!

233
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,520
Hey, do you even see that I'm here?

234
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,850
What was that?

235
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,880
Nothing!

236
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,850
Su Xi, I'll give you mine!

237
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,110
Aren't you eating?

238
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,470
I'm full!

239
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,720
Taozi, you're so kind!

240
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,600
Have you seen a couple around 25-6. The man is handsome, the woman especially beautiful?

241
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
I haven't!

242
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,120
Everyone listen up!

243
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,590
<i>We are the Ninth Duke's men! We are looking for Master Liu Changyan who is missing!</i>

244
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,500
<i>Anyone who has any leads will be heavily rewarded!</i>

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,160
Sir! Sir!

246
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,790
<i>Don't let Taozi reveal where we are!</i>

247
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,600
Sir, is there really a big reward?

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,340
You saw them?

249
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,940
No. But if there is a reward, I'll look extra hard for you!

250
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,830
Step aside!

251
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,220
Su Xi, why didn't you let me tell those guards?

252
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,290
I'm not too clear either, but madam made me do it.

253
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,990
Come on. Let's go find Madam.

254
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,430
The kidnapping happened the day before yesterday.

255
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,540
The news should be that Master Liu was kidnapped.

256
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,040
If that's so, the guards should be looking for news of the bandits.

257
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,110
That's right. It has only been a day since we rescued Su Xi and Taozi and fled through the night.

258
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,670
Even if they caught the bandits and got a confession, it should be that Master Liu was rescued.

259
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,720
And not that Master Liu has gone missing.

260
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
And I was just thinking,

261
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,160
who could a minor official like you have offended.

262
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,730
Looks like it's that Ninth Duke.

263
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,410
But the Ninth Duke is not a ruthless man, why would he do this?

264
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,720
I... I can't figure that out either.

265
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,220
With the Ninth Duke's power and position, there are many ways he could deal with you,

266
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,040
and openly remove you.

267
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,080
But he chose the lowliest method to take your life.

268
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,040
It's not at all like something he would do.

269
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,910
Oh, I understand now.

270
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,570
You're saying that the Ninth Duke is trying to kill us!

271
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,960
But hasn't the Ninth Duke always thought highly of our master?

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,770
Don't you know that the Ninth Duke likes our madam?

273
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,860
When you were sent to survey the disaster,

274
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,730
Ninth Duke especially invited our madam out to ingratiate himself.

275
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,750
I knew he liked our madam.

276
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,780
I guess, he wants to kill our master,

277
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,790
and have mistress for himself!

278
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,280
How dare he try to snatch our master's woman! He must be tired of living!

279
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,880
Don't be reckless!

280
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,160
If it truly is as we guess and it is the Ninth Duke,

281
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,440
we will need to stay hidden and be careful on our way.

282
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,410
It's alright. Since we now know who is behind all this,

283
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,590
it's much better than being ignorant.

284
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,730
We will just need to be more careful.

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
Go chase after them! This way!

286
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,850
Do you want to rest a little?

287
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,290
Let's get back to the capital first.

288
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,950
I was thinking that, too.

289
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,850
But...

290
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,940
Oh no. Su Xi, you block them first.

291
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,080
-No problem!<br>-Let's go!<br>-Su Xi, why are you going?

292
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,870
Taozi, you go with master first. I'll be fine!

293
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,910
Su Xi!

294
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,910
Now I have no choice!

295
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,990
Keep moving. I'll deal with them.

296
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,590
Use magic, use magic!

297
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,700
I can't use magic on humans!

298
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,540
You idiot!

299
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,420
Hui Er!

300
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,550
<i>Hui Er!</i>

301
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,700
Liu Changyan,

302
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,870
we meet again!

303
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,400
You ruined my face and slashed my eye!

304
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,790
You forced me to cut my tail. Let me repay you twice!

305
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,800
Stealing the magic fruit and breaking heaven's laws.

306
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,440
You put the Fox Clan in danger.

307
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,100
You still dare to make excuses?

308
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,350
Why can't I?

309
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,390
I am the one who will dominate the Fox Clan and lead it to glory!

310
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,350
I am the one that will be the Fox Clan's

311
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,490
pride and glory!

312
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,790
Liu Changyan, DIE!

313
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,050
Nine-tailed fox, your magic disappearing is heaven helping me!

314
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,870
Why don't you watch him die!

315
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,330
Oh, woman,

316
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,900
aren't you going to drop even one tear for him?

317
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,630
Liu Changyan, I tell you, I am not going to drop one tear for you,

318
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,080
but I will avenge you!

319
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,070
He will die without a corpse!

320
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,340
Oh, you cold-hearted woman!

321
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,450
Then watch him!

322
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,960
Watch him!

323
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,210
Watch him!

324
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,780
Die!

325
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,170
Liu Changyan, are you alright?

326
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm fine. I'm fine.

327
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,860
You're wounded to this extent, what do you mean you're fine?

328
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,700
Don't worry, this little injury I can handle.

329
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,740
Can you?

330
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,940
You're just a six-tailed fox, how do you have this ability?

331
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,090
I may only be a six-tailed fox,

332
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,120
but Grandmother and the others all say, I am a fox that's rarely seen once in a thousand years.

333
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,710
Most six-tailed foxes need a thousand years of practice. How long have you been practicing?

334
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,120
Only three hundred.

335
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,720
Three hundred years!

336
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,650
And you're already a six-tailed fox!

337
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,170
That's why I'm the 79th clan leader.

338
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,910
It must have hurt a lot.

339
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,000
You spit out your inner core to save me.

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,090
You must be very weak, too.

341
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,240
I said those things then,

342
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,540
are you upset?

343
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,940
I know you were just harsh on the outside, but soft on the inside.

344
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,710
How could you bear for me to die?

345
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,380
Nine-tailed fox!

346
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,930
I-I...

347
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,710
How am I going to get your tears?

348
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,800
<i>Stop! Come back.</i>

349
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,780
Su Xi, isn't master seriously hurt?

350
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,940
-How is he alright already?<br>-You were mistaken.

351
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,430
The blood on master belongs to those guards.

352
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,440
Master's martial arts are very strong; of course, he's fine.

353
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,830
That's true.

354
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,730
Alright, let's stop talking and enter the capital.

355
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,180
Alright.

356
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,070
You.

357
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,990
-They're in, let's go!<br>-Wait, wait!

358
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
It looks a little bad,

359
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,580
but if we can fake our way through, it will save a lot of trouble.

360
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,660
How ugly could it be?

361
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,830
However ugly I get, I'm still Master Liu's beloved and pampered first mistress.

362
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,960
My wife speaks the truth.

363
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,260
-Let's go!<br>-Let's!

364
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,410
Stop!

365
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,260
Ugh, you smell! Move!

366
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,040
Move!

367
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,720
Stink!

368
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,750
We're finally back!

369
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,180
Does it feel like a different world?

370
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,750
It didn't feel that way before.

371
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,760
Now it feels like this place we call home

372
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,450
is especially important.

373
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,090
Home?

374
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,580
That's right, we're home!

375
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,210
I don't understand.

376
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,620
You are neighbors with Master Liu, and your wives are so close. How can you have no news?

377
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,300
Your Grace, I have sent people out everywhere for information,

378
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,170
but there is no news.

379
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,740
-Your Grace! Your Grace!<br>-You dare!

380
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,890
Don't you see I am talking? Who allowed you in here?

381
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,730
Your Grace, that Master Liu is here to see you!

382
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,530
Liu Changyan?

383
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,520
This...

384
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,130
Let him in!

385
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,950
Yes, Sir!

386
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,000
Liu Changyan?

387
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,730
Master Liu!

388
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,160
-I am here to see your Grace<br>-Never mind the formalities.

389
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,730
Master Liu, I heard that you met with bandits, and I have been very worried about your safety!

390
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,200
Thank you for the Ninth Duke's concern.

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,960
Master Liu, it's good that you are fine.

392
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,720
-I'm fine<br>-Now that I see you are safe and sound, I've worried for nothing!

393
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,820
Master Liu, how did you escape from the bandits?

394
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,220
<i>Go and see the Ninth Duke, and tell him a little lie.</i>

395
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,070
<i>Tell him that when we were kidnapped, I suffered from shock.</i>

396
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,970
<i>That my health was especially affected. I guarantee that duke will be especially concerned about me.</i>

397
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,520
<i>He will forget everything else.</i>

398
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,370
As we were being kidnapped, we were saved by a hero.

399
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,880
But my wife is suffering from shock.

400
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,140
She is recovering at home.

401
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,920
Mrs. Liu suffered from shock!

402
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,700
Is she alright?

403
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,620
I tell you, Mrs. Liu is so precious; you must get a doctor for her.

404
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,910
Make sure you don't delay! No, no, no!

405
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,670
Now that I think of it, you must have a royal physician see to her.

406
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,520
My thanks, Your Grace.

407
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,350
Daye, hurry and summon the royal physician!

408
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,960
-Yes<br>-Hurry!

409
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,340
That's strange. Why is today's chicken so unappetizing?

410
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,890
This was prepared by a famous chef from the capital.

411
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,610
But it's not as good as the chicken Liu Changyan roasted for me in the village.

412
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,680
Fragrant and tender.

413
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,690
Where did he learn to do that?

414
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,370
How did it go? Did you do what I asked you to?

415
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,250
What was the Ninth Duke's response? Was he especially worried for me?

416
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,000
Of course, he was worried about you. He immediately made a fuss about having a royal physician coming to see you.

417
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,040
As I expected.

418
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,950
Heng'er, what are you planning?

419
00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:00,090
Liu Changyan, you and I may have had a one night's relationship, but I don't have to tell you everything, do I?

420
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,730
What you say is true. But, but you and I...

421
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,650
What?

422
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,090
Heng'er.

423
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,910
Stop "Heng'er Heng'er" ing already.

424
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,030
I said I would complete the Fox Clan's business, and I definitely will.

425
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,010
So don't ask me anymore. Right now, there's something even more important.

426
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,960
Can you help me do it?

427
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,480
What is it?

428
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,840
I don't know why, but since I ate that chicken you roasted, I can't eat anything else.

429
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,070
But.. But...

430
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:34,240
-But what?<br>-When I was at home, my parents hated my cooking!

431
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,860
But I like it!

432
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,460
I tell you, if I can't have some today,

433
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,990
I'll be in a bad mood!

434
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,170
Hurry, hurry!

435
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm starving! This is much more important than the Ninth Duke!

436
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,820
Where's the master? Why hasn't he been here today?

437
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,180
The master is at the first mistress'

438
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,250
admiring flowers with her.

439
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,250
That Madam Zhu!

440
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,610
A lowly yellow-faced old woman.

441
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,230
Dares to seduce the master behind my back!

442
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,220
These flowers blooming so beautifully

443
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,850
are all the result of your meticulous care.

444
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,120
Mrs. Liu taught me well. Now she's back but is in a bad mood.

445
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,090
I'd like to pick some flowers to comfort her.

446
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,770
Wife, all day I'm either looking for Master Liu or the Ninth Duke.

447
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm running around all day, don't I need comfort, too?

448
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,610
You've worked hard.

449
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,360
I don't want those

450
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,110
simple words.

451
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,540
How old are you now, yet you're still acting like a child?

452
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,170
All that's in your head is love and passion.

453
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,000
That's not all that's in my head.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,680
You're the only one in my heart.

455
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,410
Little sister is here.

456
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,410
I never thought that at this age,

457
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,060
you still have the inclination to pretty yourself with flowers.

458
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,740
These flowers are beautiful, but not everyone looks good with them.

459
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,580
Aren't you worried your looks will fade?

460
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,490
Ying'er, watch your mouth.

461
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,070
Master, I wonder where she learned her seductive ways.

462
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,260
Trying to be all foxy.

463
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,520
I said to watch your mouth!

464
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,110
She's the one who's being shameless at her age!

465
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,650
Thinking of all the ways to entwine herself around you.

466
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,710
Vile, shameless!

467
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,240
Shut your mouth! You--!

468
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,210
Why have you become like this?

469
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,210
Speaking out of turn as a concubine!

470
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,920
No respect, no common decency!

471
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,960
I am like that! I want to be like that!

472
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,790
You, right now... You!

473
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,150
Behaving like this, how can anyone look well on you?

474
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,960
I won't punish you today. Go, think it over in your room.

475
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,080
Master!

476
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,980
Why are you so angry at me?

477
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,910
I told you to go to your room, didn't you hear me?

478
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,000
Then are you going to stay with her tonight?

479
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,770
I'm going to be reading tonight!

480
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,950
Reading through the night!

481
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,480
-Master...<br>-Dismissed.

482
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,110
-Master!<br>-Dismissed!

483
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,960
Wife! Wife!

484
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,950
I don't know what tricks she played;

485
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,000
she's managed to lead him around in circles!

486
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,740
It's Tao Heng.

487
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,360
It's that vile woman!

488
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,340
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be in this position!

489
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,870
How is she?

490
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,170
Master Liu, congratulations!

491
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,600
Mrs. Liu is with child!

492
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,320
Congratulations!

493
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,130
Congratulations!

494
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,030
Thank you, Doctor, and Ninth Duke's concern.

495
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,330
Husband, why don't you invite the Duke and the royal physician to retire in the front parlor.

496
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,710
Right.

497
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,700
Right.

498
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,410
Master Liu, I will write a prescription for Mrs. Liu to stabilize her fetus.

499
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,230
You just need to have someone follow the prescription.

500
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,160
Thank you, Sir.

501
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,100
I shall not disturb you

502
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,260
and take my leave.

503
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,530
-This way.<br>-Take my leave!

504
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,800
<i>No wonder I suddenly lost my magic.</i>

505
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,870
<i>I'm pregnant!</i>

506
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,810
<i>I have a child with Liu Changyan!</i>

507
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,370
Do you have something to say?

508
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,450
Heng'er, is this child real?

509
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,210
Do you think I'm lying to you?

510
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,760
No, that's not what I meant.

511
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,890
This child wasn't diagnosed by me.

512
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,660
That royal physician said so.

513
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,870
Also, I don't have any magic right now. How could I lie to you?

514
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,160
Heng'er, don't misunderstand.

515
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,180
It's just this happened so suddenly.

516
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm not ready at all!

517
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,670
-This child is here at a bad ti...<br>-That's enough, Liu Changyan

518
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,170
I know right now you want to list all of your big reasons.

519
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,650
But in the end, in your eyes, I'm just a trouble maker.

520
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,400
Stopping you from achieving your great goals.

521
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,250
Heng'er, you really misunderstand.

522
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,800
You don't know what kind of task we need to do.

523
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,040
With Hui Er putting obstacles in our way,

524
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,960
the Fox Clan is facing annihilation, the Green Hill will quite possibly no longer exist.

525
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,320
-Having a child at this time<br>-That's enough!

526
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,410
Don't say anymore. I don't want to hear it.

527
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,260
You have many things to deal with. This child is mine.

528
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,010
And it's my business, alright?

529
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,410
It's also mine!

530
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,510
That's right. Actually, as your senior,

531
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,220
I shouldn't fight with you.

532
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,650
But this child is mine,

533
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,120
and is yours.

534
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,200
No matter what, based on your identity, position and power, I should be the one who should raise this child.

535
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,900
There is no need for you to do anything.

536
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,760
Heng'er, you're angry so I'm not going to take those words seriously.

537
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,180
I'm not mad. I will complete what I agreed to do.

538
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,770
When I go back to the Green Hill, I will live my life freely.

539
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,960
And you can continue being the Clan Leader.

540
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,570
Heng'er, I said some foolish words. Please don't take them to heart.

541
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,270
If I can help the Fox Clan through this trial,

542
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,120
I will come back for the both of you.

543
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,680
Forget it.

544
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,260
There's no point talking about this now.

545
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,660
I'll go make some dinner for you both.

546
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,890
Idiot.

547
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,750
Mrs. Liu's pulse is very odd.

548
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,790
I've practiced over 20 years, and this is the first time I've felt such a strange pregnancy pulse.

549
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,820
I think it may have something to do with the fetus being unstable.

550
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,740
I'd better prescribe some nourishing medication for her,

551
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,540
so that Mrs. Liu can be nursed back to health.

552
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,190
No.

553
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,610
You should prescribe abortion medication.

554
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,250
Get rid of Liu Changyan's child, and make sure no one finds out!

555
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,160
Your Grace, this, this...

556
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,480
What do you know? I've long since disliked Liu Changyan.

557
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,400
He is nothing but a useless minor official.

558
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,990
Sooner or later, he'll be removed by His Majesty.

559
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,070
I'm just helping His Majesty.

560
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,940
I understand.

561
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,740
Why are you standing there? Get moving!

562
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,130
Right, I will go right now.

563
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,160
Liu Changyan, Liu Changyan.

564
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,420
You're not fit to have a child with Heng'er.

565
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,460
You keep pacing up and down, are you trying to starve me?

566
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,770
Heng'er? Heng'er are you asleep?

567
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,780
Just come in. Why are you dithering out there?

568
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,480
Heng'er, I made you some soup.

569
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,610
Would you get up and have some?

570
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,810
Leave it. I'll drink it when I feel like it.

571
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,050
You're mad.

572
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:09,130
Heng'er, what happened yesterday and in the past are all my fault.

573
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,050
I hope that you will take care of yourself.

574
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,920
Don't trouble yourself for my mistakes

575
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,050
and hurt yourself.

576
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,570
So what happened yesterday and in the past,

577
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,470
are they all mistakes?

578
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:29,910
Heng'er, I can't put things together as well as you do. Could you not pick out the faults in my words?

579
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,610
Please?

580
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,950
Heng'er, it's all my fault.

581
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,650
What's your fault?

582
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,070
Making you mad is my fault.

583
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,290
It's good that you know it.

584
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,120
Then can you forgive me?

585
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,750
Forgive which time?

586
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,250
Didn't you say you made many mistakes?

587
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,610
This time.

588
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,580
I'm hungry.

589
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,400
Heng'er, I simmered this soup for 4 hours.

590
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,190
I'm not sure if it will suit your tastes.

591
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,090
If you don't like it, I'll make it again.

592
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,040
If you make it again, I'd have to wait another 4 hours. Wouldn't I starve?

593
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,060
This is raw the first time and ripe the second time. If I did it again, it wouldn't take as long.

594
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,860
Come, taste a little.

595
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,860
How is it?

596
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,160
It tastes a little odd, but tolerable.

597
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,930
Really?

598
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,180
You lie. It's pretty good! Have a bite!

599
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,890
Let me tell you. Now that madam is pregnant,

600
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,180
we will have to make chicken soup for her every day. Her food must be nutritious.

601
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,760
<i>Also, whatever she does, you must keep her company. She must never go out alone, understand?</i>

602
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,330
<i>I know all that.</i>

603
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,180
<i>-Do you?<br>-Of course, I do!</i>

604
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,990
Pregnant!

605
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,690
Now that you are pregnant, you must remember to drink medicinal soup every day.

606
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,230
Why don't I take care of your food and drink?

607
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,680
I couldn't trouble you.

608
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,550
My health has always been good, eating a little more or less won't affect me.

609
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,150
Little sister, what are you saying? We are like close sisters.

610
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,330
And now that Master and I are on good terms again,

611
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,960
you are my savior and I can't thank you enough.

612
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,640
It's just that... you are so young,

613
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,870
how do you know men's hearts so well?

614
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,300
To this day, do you still not understand the reasoning behind it?

615
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,990
I understand a little.

616
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,950
But I don't understand some as well.

617
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,690
<i>In this world, no matter man or woman,</i>

618
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,670
<i>are naturally attracted to those who are outstanding.</i>

619
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:06,040
<i>But most women, after they marry, they begin to forget themselves.</i>

620
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,060
<i>All the advantages they had, they discard one by one.</i>

621
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,810
<i>In the end, they become someone they themselves don't like.</i>

622
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,110
<i>I just helped you find the best of yourself again.</i>

623
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,080
<i>The one that others like the most.</i>

624
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,050
<i>In the beginning, putting you in the worst position,</i>

625
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,110
<i>didn't make you likable.</i>

626
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,100
<i>Even though your husband wouldn't even look at you,</i>

627
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,880
<i>but when you went on the tour with the duchess and he suddenly saw you，</i>

628
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,170
<i>it's as if he hadn't seen you in a long time.</i>

629
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,270
<i>Do you know the feeling of meeting again after a long time,</i>

630
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,500
<i>can lead a person back to memories of the past.</i>

631
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,560
<i>That day, when we went out together,</i>

632
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,010
<i>you changed from a dirty farm wife into an elegant beauty.</i>

633
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:00,080
<i>That's why when your husband saw you, he wanted you,</i>

634
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,040
<i>wanted to get close to you and understand you again.</i>

635
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,010
<i>And from that time on?</i>

636
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,770
<i>From then on, he thinks of me all day.</i>

637
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,670
<i>Just when he wants to be with me, I draw him in slowly;</i>

638
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,230
<i>yet, I don't satisfy him immediately.</i>

639
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,710
That's right.

640
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:24,060
An old love can be young again, and all his thoughts are on you.

641
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,970
In fact, these are all just strategies.

642
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,490
If the time comes when you don't want to be threatened by the concubine again,

643
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:35,150
you must remember to be the you that others will like.

644
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,470
These principles...

645
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,020
If you hadn't said them to me, I might have already been set aside.

646
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,600
In the end, it's up to whether this man is worth your effort.

647
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,390
If he's not worth it, then you might as well let it go.

648
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,900
I can't be as free as you.

649
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,940
As the saying goes, ten years practice and you can take a boat together. One hungred years practice and you can share a pillow.

650
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,280
Since we have the fate to be husband and wife, of course, we should grow old together.

651
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,900
How can I just let go by saying so?

652
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,530
<i>With this unexpected fate between he and I,</i>

653
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,880
<i>I wonder if we can grow old together, too?</i>

654
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,160
Little sister.

655
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,950
Little sister!

656
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,050
What's the matter?

657
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,940
It's nothing. Why don't you come with me to my room? I have a magic weapon for you.

658
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,720
A magic weapon?

659
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,240
Master Liu.

660
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,000
Like this.

661
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,050
Right.

662
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,110
And like this.

663
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,920
This is called Charm through the Smoke.

664
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,890
Charm through the smoke?

665
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,810
Husband, what are you doing?

666
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,910
Heng'er, I was looking at my fan.

667
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,880
-Your fan?<br>-That's right!

668
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,720
Look, how well these words are written.

669
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,570
The words are well-written.

670
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,770
Madam, the Hong family's Second Mistress is here.

671
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,340
You're dismissed.

672
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,050
Yes.

673
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,150
-Go on.<br>-Yes.

674
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,310
I hear you are expecting.

675
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,900
You're quite well-informed.

676
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,770
Such joyous news, of course, I would know.

677
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,760
Have you called me here

678
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,210
to show off?

679
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,860
Show off?

680
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,250
You are quite capable.

681
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,330
Causing my husband to distance himself from me,

682
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,080
seduced by that yellow-faced hag, every day going to her room.

683
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,420
-This is my fault?<br>-Are you claiming innocence?

684
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,640
The path of husband and wife is paved in sincerity.

685
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,900
If you really love your husband, you should respect his first wife

686
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,230
and not fight for his attention.

687
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,210
If you aren't sincere and are only seeking power and position,

688
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,240
then it's simple.

689
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,230
Since your mistress has won back your master's heart,

690
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,450
then you should submit to defeat.

691
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,200
Submit to defeat?

692
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,560
That's right. When it's time to retreat then retreat.

693
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,160
If you are determined to snatch his love,

694
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,220
then you are just looking for humiliation.

695
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,010
Looking for humiliation?

696
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,740
There's nothing that is certain in this world.

697
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,970
Men are naturally fickle.

698
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,430
It just depends on which girl has the best moves.

699
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,850
Is love really so shallow in your eyes?

700
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,400
Men rely on women for prestige.

701
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,590
Women rely on men for an easy life.

702
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:24,740
This world has always been about give and take.

703
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,890
Stubborn and untamable.

704
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,060
What did you say?

705
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,180
The fact that I'm willing to teach you is your fortune.

706
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,760
These evil thoughts of yours will lead to your own destruction.

707
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,340
Lead myself to my own destruction?

708
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,570
Mrs. Liu, listen well.

709
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,020
You've repeatedly ruined my plans

710
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,280
and cost me years of hard work.

711
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,010
I'd love to pluck out your muscles

712
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,060
and peel off your skin.

713
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,440
Looks like this was a useless gesture for me.

714
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,240
It's true I am not the good type.

715
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,020
Anyone who offends me, I will pay back ten times.

716
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,560
If they want me dead, I will definitely drag them down to hell with me.

717
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,970
Since you will not listen to my counsel,

718
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,340
then please leave.

719
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:30,030
Mrs. Liu, this is not over.

720
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,120
That ruthless Ninth Duke!

721
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,720
He dares to have medicine sent to abort my child?

722
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,350
I was going to ignore you,

723
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,780
but since you just had to mess with me,

724
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,510
then don't blame me for returning the favor!

725
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,140
Really shameless!

726
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,170
Husband, who are you talking about?

727
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,990
Of course, I'm talking about the Ninth Duke!

728
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,810
It's clear that we are a happily married couple, yet he still sends this medicine for you.

729
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,970
He's clearly currying your favor!

730
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,050
Did you and I get married?

731
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,070
I'm afraid we aren't even husband and wife.

732
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,280
How did we become a happily married couple?

733
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,520
Heng'er, we're about to have a child.

734
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,970
Why does that matter?

735
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,060
Aren't you a master of etiquette?

736
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,060
Between the two of us, our parents have not spoken for us,

737
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,510
no matchmaker has either.

738
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,960
So we are even skipping the wedding ceremony.

739
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,880
And you're criticizing the Ninth Duke.

740
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,830
I don't think you're much better than him.

741
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,800
I-I-I-I'll definitely make it up to you!

742
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,750
Make it up to you.

743
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,680
Ah, child,

744
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,420
your dad is quite a blockhead.

745
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,710
You must definitely not take after him.

746
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,330
Mama's teaching you...

747
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:19,050
If one day someone tries to take your woman, you must teach him a good lesson!

748
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,230
You must have no mercy!

749
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,910
Don't let your woman be like your mom,

750
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,860
and have to teach the bad guy a lesson herself.

751
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,650
-Su Xi, you're awesome!<br>-Let's have another!

752
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,120
One, two, three!

753
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,750
Amazing! Again!

754
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,730
Su Xi!

755
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,920
Come here a minute.

756
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,090
What do you wish, Mistress?

757
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,970
Su Xi, tell me honestly.

758
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,100
Do you like Taozi?

759
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,600
I am a little attached to her.

760
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,400
But you know the rule that Liu Changyan set.

761
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,650
If you want to be with a human,

762
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,630
you will have to give up years of practice.

763
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,410
And be a normal person like them.

764
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,100
Slowly experiencing old age and death, with no going back.

765
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,650
I'm willing! I'm willing to stay here.

766
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,990
Even if I grow old and die with Taozi, I'm willing.

767
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,950
-Really?<br>Really!

768
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,890
The way Taozi treats me well,

769
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,480
can't compare to anyone else.

770
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,220
But even if you want to stay with a human,

771
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,390
based on Liu Changyan's personality, won't he take you home by force?

772
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,000
Mistress, you must never tell the Clan Leader!

773
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,570
If I don't tell him, how are you going to stay?

774
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,050
Um...

775
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,710
However, you know my relationship with your clan leader.

776
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,170
If I can put in a good word for you, it might all work out.

777
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,560
Mistress, you're really going to help me?

778
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,120
I can persuade him for you; however,

779
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,220
you must agree to help me with something.

780
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,880
Of course! Senior, please tell me!

781
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:36,130

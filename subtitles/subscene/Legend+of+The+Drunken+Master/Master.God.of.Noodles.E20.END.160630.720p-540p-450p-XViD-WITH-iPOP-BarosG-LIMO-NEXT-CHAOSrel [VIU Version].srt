(Final Episode 20)

4
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,524
Everything we said was a lie.

5
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:16,564
Friends...

6
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:20,194
mean nothing.

7
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:21,464
I lied.

8
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:25,594
I want to stop feeling guilty whenever I look at you.

9
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:28,124
Friends? It means nothing.

10
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:29,324
Yeo Kyung lied, too.

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:34,524
We both said something we never should've said.

12
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:37,417
Something we would regret for the rest of our lives.

13
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:41,964
Tae Ha, you'll meet new friends here.

14
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:52,564
Friends are never meaningless.

15
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,191
It's always shocking...

16
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,121
to face...

17
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,704
the death of a dear friend.

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,421
What should we do?

19
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,621
You start feeling grief...

20
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,521
once you recover...

21
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,091
from the shock.

22
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,521
Even if...

23
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,651
it wasn't the death of your friend.

24
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,921
(Seven days later)

25
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,391
What do you think you are doing?

26
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,451
You haven't shown up in the kitchen for a week now.

27
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,761
Everything is out of order. Customers are complaining.

28
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,951
If this goes on, we'll soon be closing the restaurant.

29
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,191
Close the restaurant.

30
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,991
It's weird for it to be still open.

31
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:22,791
What?

32
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,451
Who would want to eat...

33
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,591
noodles that were once cooked by a murderer?

34
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:33,091
Close the restaurant until people forget about him.

35
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,261
That's the right thing to do.

36
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,291
I'm sorry that he killed your parents.

37
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,351
The fact that Kim Gil Do is a murderer...

38
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,691
was also a big shock to all of us.

39
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,491
But what does Goongnakwon have to do with anything?

40
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,121
We all worked very hard to get here.

41
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:58,491
I can't just stand by and watch it go down like this.

42
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,951
It's unacceptable. I won't allow it.

43
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,951
Resign from Master of Noodles.

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,751
You are the one who messed up Goongnakwon.

45
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:11,251
You were supposed to protect it,

46
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,991
but you ruined it instead.

47
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,121
Leave right now.

48
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,751
I can't do that.

49
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,521
I have to keep my place.

50
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,591
Kim Gil Do will definitely show up.

51
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:27,721
Even if someone has to die, that's when it'll end.

52
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,121
Stop it.

53
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,951
My friend died.

54
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,821
Burning with vengeance against Kim Gil Do,

55
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:38,221
I didn't even care about my friends.

56
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,491
I'm the one...

57
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,591
who led them into this mess.

58
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,321
I'm...

59
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:49,591
practically the reason why Tae Ha died.

60
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:56,721
Ms Seol.

61
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,591
Let me give you a word of advice.

62
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:03,821
You don't want my anger firing towards you.

63
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,691
I don't think you'd be able to handle it.

64
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,791
So just sit tight.

65
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,921
At least until Kim Gil Do dies.

66
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,491
Let me give you a word of advice, too.

67
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,021
Don't get innocent people involved in your revenge.

68
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,721
From now on,

69
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,791
you're no longer the top head of noodles to me.

70
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,691
I will drag you down from that position,

71
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,251
no matter what it takes.

72
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,121
He thinks he can have everything his way.

73
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:58,191
How worse will it be when he becomes the noodle master?

74
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,451
Gang Sook, aren't you going to do anything about it?

75
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,521
Are you even listening to me?

76
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:09,061
My gosh, why are you being so cold-hearted?

77
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,851
His friend just died.

78
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:13,421
We should give him some time to grieve.

79
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:17,721
What's your problem? You're acting like a dictator.

80
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:22,021
What? A dictator? Hey!

81
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,251
What? I didn't say anything wrong.

82
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,121
After getting the shares from Mr Ha,

83
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:31,251
you're poking around here and there.

84
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,321
Just try to understand others.

85
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:35,451
I understand the restaurant is important,

86
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,321
but nothing is more important than people.

87
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:38,521
My goodness.

88
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,851
I guess...

89
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,321
you don't get carsick.

90
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,451
I do, if I have an empty stomach.

91
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,051
Let go of me before I scream.

92
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,391
You're the thief, not me.

93
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,391
Stop it.

94
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,651
Oh, no! Hide.

95
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,491
You smell of sweat, car...

96
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,351
and dumplings.

97
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,891
But when all that combines together,

98
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:37,351
do you know what it smells like?

99
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,491
It smells like Tae Ha.

100
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,321
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,151
What are they?

102
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:25,291
They're Tae Ha's stuff.

103
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,991
I can't believe this.

104
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,791
I keep crying every time I say his name.

105
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,321
Tae Ha...

106
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,821
Don't flatter yourself. I'm just throwing it away.

107
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:03,451
Please do me a favour.

108
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,691
Please remember my smell.

109
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:36,791
Mr Park left a big hole in everyone's hearts.

110
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,851
After my father passed away,

111
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:47,661
I realised how hard it is to miss someone who left me.

112
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,791
You have no choice but to cry as much as you want.

113
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:58,091
Something has been bothering for a long time.

114
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:07,991
I once said you have bad blood in you.

115
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,821
I can't believe I had said such a hurtful thing.

116
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,091
It's not like my blood is any cleaner.

117
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:21,351
What I said to you kept weight me down...

118
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,161
the whole time.

119
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:26,661
However hard I tried, I couldn't get it out of my head.

120
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:30,851
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:34,921
I really mean it, Da Hae.

122
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,791
It's okay.

123
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,591
I knew that...

124
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:45,791
you didn't mean it.

125
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,551
Myeong will be going through a tough time.

126
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,421
Ms Seol will make it even worse.

127
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,661
He'll feel like he's being attacked from all sides.

128
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,251
We should protect him.

129
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:05,821
I know.

130
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,121
Whatever they say,

131
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,551
the person who loves noodles the most...

132
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,661
is Myeong.

133
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,591
I will do what I can to help.

134
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,321
I know very well that you and I...

135
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:31,051
can't go back to the day we cooked and ate together.

136
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:32,991
But...

137
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,521
when we're going through a tough time,

138
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:39,991
we could lend each other a shoulder.

139
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,921
Wouldn't that help?

140
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,321
I wish that were possible.

141
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,021
I'll do that, Ma'am.

142
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,191
I'd like to...

143
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,021
thank you.

144
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,191
(Park Tae Ha)

145
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:22,951
(Park Tae Ha)

146
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,891
(So Tae Seop is most likely to represent his party.)

147
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,391
Ms Chae.

148
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,191
Is something wrong?

149
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,051
Ms Chae.

150
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,621
I'm at fault.

151
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:17,291
Quit putting on a show, you jerk.

152
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,291
Take him.

153
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,151
Any news yet?

154
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:40,621
He's on his way.

155
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,191
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,751
I'm disabled, you see.

157
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:06,421
Can we begin right away?

158
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:07,791
Of course.

159
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:10,121
I lived waiting for this day.

160
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,091
Come with me.

161
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,851
Do you remember him? Mr Hwang Sung Rok.

162
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:33,121
How could I forget him?

163
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,451
You look great.

164
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,791
You lost some weight.

165
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,051
Were you under some stress recently?

166
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,521
Not at all.

167
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,691
I even signed autographs...

168
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,721
while in hiding.

169
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,791
People don't care about me...

170
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:53,751
as much as I thought they would.

171
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,021
They will now.

172
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,021
We'll start with a case you're both involved in.

173
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,691
Mr Kim Gil Do.

174
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,591
On May 27, 2014,

175
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:10,451
did you order Mr Hwang's murder under a bridge?

176
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,651
What are you talking about?

177
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,891
Why would he want me dead?

178
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:22,851
These questions...

179
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:26,021
are based on the statement you gave us.

180
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,651
There was a mistake.

181
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:30,221
Or maybe...

182
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,421
I felt threatened during the interview.

183
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,451
To be honest,

184
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,921
I can't really remember if...

185
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,321
I made such a statement.

186
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:41,921
What are you doing?

187
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,991
Every interview is taped and preserved as evidence.

188
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:49,921
There was no misunderstanding or threats.

189
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,791
What happens if I change my statement?

190
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:05,821
It can't be.

191
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,691
Did you two...

192
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,091
My previous statement is invalid.

193
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,791
I want to revise it.

194
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,921
Get Mr Hwang out of here.

195
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,291
Did you bribe a witness...

196
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,221
while you were on the run?

197
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,291
Take things in the way they are.

198
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,821
Don't imagine things.

199
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,651
You beast.

200
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,791
I think you're a little emotional.

201
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,121
Let me help you out.

202
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,091
Congressman So Tae Seop's domestic helper.

203
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,861
I killed her.

204
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,721
That was me.

205
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:29,821
But the murder of Ha Jung Tae and his wife.

206
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:34,551
You only have Choi Soon Seok's statement and no proof.

207
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:37,751
And unfortunately, the statute of limitations...

208
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,451
for both cases have expired.

209
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:44,651
Then there's the case about Congressman Choi's cheques.

210
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:49,091
That's on the CEO of Raymond Company.

211
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:52,721
His name is Lee Jeong Beom.

212
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,721
You decided not to indict him,

213
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,821
so it has nothing to do with me.

214
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,121
You also said that...

215
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,751
I disappeared for a week during my arrest.

216
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,121
I didn't disappear.

217
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:12,091
I was in an accident and the shock left me panicked.

218
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,821
I lost my bearings.

219
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:19,021
What about Tae Ha? You killed him.

220
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,751
You killed him to hide your secrets.

221
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:23,621
Stop imagining things.

222
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,921
A prosecutor should work with evidence.

223
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:30,621
All your creative guesswork got you in this mess.

224
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,591
You jerk.

225
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,551
Don't, Ms Chae.

226
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,051
Ms Chae.

227
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,191
Listen carefully.

228
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,521
I didn't kill Tae Ha.

229
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,651
I don't care if you believe me or not.

230
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,951
But that's the truth.

231
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,821
Mr Hwang.

232
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:18,551
I'm listening.

233
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,591
Can you do me one more thing?

234
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,451
Do you realise that we're in...

235
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:29,151
the Public Prosecutors' Office?

236
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,251
There's something I need.

237
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,021
It will be hard to get,

238
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:35,821
but get it for me.

239
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,591
People don't procure things.

240
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,361
Money does.

241
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,651
What is it you need?

242
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:50,491
Does this mean you let Kim Gil Do off completely,

243
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,791
while making us look like...

244
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:57,091
we arrest the innocent and coerce statements from them?

245
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:00,491
- Is that right? - Please give me more time, Sir.

246
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,391
- If I look into... - What then?

247
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,991
Will you find evidence you couldn't before?

248
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,421
In just seven days, he bribed a witness...

249
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:10,991
and destroyed evidence,

250
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,791
while you sat and did nothing.

251
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,251
I apologise.

252
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,121
I heard you accepted a bribe.

253
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,691
I also know you gave it all to an orphanage.

254
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,551
I understand that you had no choice at the time.

255
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,651
But...

256
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,551
a crime is still a crime.

257
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,821
You can choose 1 of 2 options.

258
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,321
Be dismissed...

259
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,451
or be arrested for accepting a bribe.

260
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:42,821
Dismiss me.

261
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,821
You're now suspended until you're officially dismissed.

262
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,891
You are forbidden from working as a prosecutor.

263
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:57,221
(Goongnakwon's Kim Gil Do Appears Voluntarily)

264
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,551
This little insect.

265
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:07,921
Shall I deal with him?

266
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:11,551
We can't get into trouble...

267
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,151
right before an important event.

268
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:18,891
I will take over the party convention...

269
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,521
and then run for president.

270
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,751
I can kill an insect whenever I want.

271
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,751
Tell me if you change your mind, Sir.

272
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,361
Instead,

273
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,391
hire more bodyguards.

274
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,491
Gil Do...

275
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,051
will come for me.

276
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,891
Ms Chae Yeo Kyung's here to see you.

277
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:46,651
Let her in.

278
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:00,291
- Sir. - You let Gil Do go.

279
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,721
The witness changed his statement.

280
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,451
Good for him.

281
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,521
I bet he got off, too.

282
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:09,021
He must be happy.

283
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,851
Give me another chance.

284
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:15,491
Weren't you dismissed?

285
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,851
Forget all about it...

286
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,321
and find a new job.

287
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:25,621
You're a smart girl. You'll manage to make a living.

288
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,621
I can't give up now.

289
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:31,051
You have to help me. Only then...

290
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,951
will you be able to achieve your goal with ease.

291
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,991
You've changed a lot since we first met.

292
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,921
Are you threatening me?

293
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,751
If that's how you feel,

294
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,291
then yes, this is a threat.

295
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,751
The threat you just made...

296
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:51,791
is an empty threat, not a loaded one.

297
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,421
Do you even have...

298
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,321
the confidential document?

299
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,791
I do.

300
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:01,751
Are you sure?

301
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:05,451
I asked if you're sure.

302
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:33,591
(Dear Yeo Kyung)

303
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,851
(I wrote a reply to each letter you sent me.)

304
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:45,651
I wrote a reply to each letter you sent me.

305
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:49,351
I meant to send each of them,

306
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,021
but I didn't because I was afraid of distracting you.

307
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,091
Read them whenever you miss me.

308
00:23:58,851 --> 00:23:59,851
That...

309
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,451
is all I want, Yeo Kyung.

310
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:33,691
Kim Gil Do.

311
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:37,421
The back is the best spot to stab a person.

312
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:39,851
Don't show it to just anyone.

313
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,351
Get out.

314
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:47,521
When one is afraid, their pupils dilate.

315
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:50,991
That helps them focus on the attacker.

316
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,251
Their mouth also drops open.

317
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,621
Instinct prepares them...

318
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:58,091
so they can shout for help.

319
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,051
That's what you're doing.

320
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,891
Nothing has changed. You're still the same.

321
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:07,291
Tae Ha's death...

322
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,191
is on So Tae Seop.

323
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,451
Take your pick.

324
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,951
So Tae Seop who killed Tae Ha.

325
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,121
Or me who instigated your parents' murders.

326
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,821
If you pick So Tae Seop,

327
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:32,751
you and I will become allies for a brief period.

328
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:34,351
But if you pick me,

329
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:38,091
we must fight until one of us dies.

330
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,891
There's no other way.

331
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,851
Don't you think we should end...

332
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,591
this ill-fated relationship?

333
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,751
Show me proof that So Tae Seop killed him.

334
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:57,891
I won't believe you unless I see it.

335
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,291
These are photos of Da Hae...

336
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:20,451
that So Tae Seop sent me when he kidnapped her.

337
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:24,421
And there's this.

338
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:28,221
Exchange your life with your daughter's. It's simple.

339
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,491
There's a warehouse in Incheon.

340
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,251
I'll text you the address. Come over.

341
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,321
If you die to save your daughter,

342
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:39,551
wouldn't that be a fair trade?

343
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:42,651
He made...

344
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:45,291
the same call to Tae Ha.

345
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:50,451
Tae Ha reached the warehouse before I did,

346
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,321
and that's how he died.

347
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:57,251
So Tae Seop.

348
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,551
I'll kill him.

349
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,051
To do that,

350
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:05,451
I need your help.

351
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,721
One.

352
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,451
Two.

353
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,451
Three.

354
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:49,651
I'm sorry,

355
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:51,891
but I'm not sorry at all.

356
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:53,851
Kim Gil Do!

357
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:56,791
Shut your mouth!

358
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,951
If I wanted you dead,

359
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:02,251
I'd have killed you hundreds of times!

360
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:04,591
It's not over yet.

361
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,421
So be ready.

362
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:20,221
My father was a monster who killed two people,

363
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,991
but I didn't become one.

364
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,651
Blaming your unfortunate past for becoming a monster...

365
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:28,021
is just an excuse.

366
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,751
What do you know about me?

367
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,121
I saw your truth...

368
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,151
at the charnel house...

369
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,751
You said it was an act,

370
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,051
but no one can fake such tears.

371
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,621
Your last ounce of truth.

372
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,451
Stay true to it.

373
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,191
The only one who can stop this...

374
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:53,821
is you.

375
00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:54,991
Shut it.

376
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,451
(Kim Gil Do)

377
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,451
Gil Do, how have you been?

378
00:29:56,491 --> 00:29:58,251
Thanks to you, it wasn't easy.

379
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:00,991
I'm sorry to hear that.

380
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,621
Why were you being so greedy?

381
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:07,321
If you just lived your life the way it was,

382
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:09,091
things wouldn't have come this far.

383
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:12,221
I can't dare to compare my greed to yours.

384
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,691
It's not that I'm greedy.

385
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,151
It's just that I have no power.

386
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,051
Is that how it works?

387
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:24,591
May I go in?

388
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:41,751
Why...

389
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:44,351
did you kidnap Da Hae?

390
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:48,221
Because I thought you'd come to get her.

391
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,921
I didn't know you'd even abandon your own daughter.

392
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:55,251
Why did you kill Tae Ha?

393
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,491
I didn't purposely kill him.

394
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,621
He came to me to die.

395
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:02,021
He thought it was the only way for him...

396
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,591
to keep Da Hae and Prosecutor Chae alive.

397
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:10,051
He is completely different from you.

398
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:17,591
You should've taken just the confidential document.

399
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:21,291
You should've just taken the secret recipe.

400
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,191
Why did you have to...

401
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:28,051
burn two people to death and let things come this far?

402
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,121
Everything started from...
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

403
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,851
when I met you.

404
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,391
Everything went wrong from that moment on.

405
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,551
And I can't undo anything.

406
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:39,751
You're right.

407
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,051
You can't...

408
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:44,591
undo anything any more.

409
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:32,721
So Tae Seop.

410
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:34,991
I'll kill him.

411
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,451
To do that,

412
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,751
I need your help.

413
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,151
(Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung)

414
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,821
The number you have dialled is not available...

415
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,351
Why are you here?

416
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:35,091
I want you to do me a favour.

417
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:36,891
Let me meet with So Tae Seop.

418
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:38,791
That's not hard.

419
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:41,851
But I need to know why.

420
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:44,991
He's...

421
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,121
the one who killed Tae Ha.

422
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:51,621
I will never forgive that jerk.

423
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:54,351
It's too dangerous, Yeo Kyung.

424
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:56,791
There won't be a way out.

425
00:33:57,821 --> 00:33:59,091
I've already lost Tae Ha.

426
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,791
I don't want to lose you.

427
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,851
Who will you stop next when I die?

428
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:06,191
We can't put up with this forever.

429
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,421
Yeo Kyung.

430
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:08,691
I can't...

431
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,351
send Tae Ha like this.

432
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,451
We just can't...

433
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:16,321
do that to him, Myeong.

434
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:31,051
I couldn't forget this scent.

435
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,351
I really wanted to eat lotus flower noodles.

436
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,221
I should have served you the dish more often.

437
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,051
- I'm sorry, Sir. - Please don't say that.

438
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,691
If it weren't for you,

439
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,591
I would never have had the chance to try it.

440
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,191
Sir.

441
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:57,521
Yes?

442
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:59,651
I have a favour to ask of you.

443
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:02,851
Tell me.

444
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,761
I can do anything for you.

445
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,791
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung wants to see you.

446
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,521
How do you know her?

447
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,891
I was summoned a few times for Kim Gil Do's case.

448
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,051
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

449
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,691
- I'm sorry, Sir. - You don't need to be.

450
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,821
If she wants to see me that desperately,

451
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:34,421
I should go see her.

452
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,321
Da Hae.

453
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:50,721
Yes?

454
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,221
Go get some rest.

455
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:53,921
You look very tired.

456
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,651
There are people who work harder than me.

457
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,451
You look so pitiful.

458
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,821
I feel so sorry for you.

459
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:04,951
Gosh.

460
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:12,851
Ms Kim Da Hae.

461
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:16,221
We got an order for royal pheasant buckwheat noodles.

462
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:19,651
You should tell Deputy Head of Noodles about it.

463
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:22,291
What? What do I need to do?

464
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:24,991
The customer wants you...

465
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:27,821
to cook it and serve it to him yourself.

466
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,091
What?

467
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,051
Put it down here.

468
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:46,621
I came here as a guest today.

469
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,951
You did a good job with the dough.

470
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,291
It has a good consistency.

471
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,451
And I like the fragrance of buckwheat.

472
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:37,651
You are skilled enough...

473
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,951
to serve noodles...

474
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:42,551
on your own.

475
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,051
Who killed...

476
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,951
Tae Ha?

477
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,051
Tell me.

478
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,051
Did you kill him?

479
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,261
Was it you?

480
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,621
Please tell me it wasn't.

481
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:07,291
Please tell me that...

482
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,651
you didn't kill him.

483
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:13,951
I didn't kill him.

484
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,651
Then who did it?

485
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,391
Who killed him?

486
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:27,951
Someone you don't know.

487
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,151
Someone you shouldn't know.

488
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:00,421
It's your fault.

489
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,991
It's all because of you.

490
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:05,121
Why didn't you answer my call?

491
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,021
If you had answered my call,

492
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:08,821
I wouldn't have been kidnapped.

493
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,091
Tae Ha...

494
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,891
got killed while trying to save me.

495
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:17,321
He was killed because of me.

496
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:21,321
No.

497
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:24,851
If you didn't do bad things, Tae Ha wouldn't have died.

498
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,451
You're the one who should've died.

499
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,991
You're the one who committed all the crimes.

500
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:34,351
Why does Tae Ha have to be the one to get killed?

501
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:36,451
Why?

502
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,991
Why? Why?

503
00:39:57,991 --> 00:39:59,261
My goodness.

504
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:01,591
It's been a while, Prosecutor.

505
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:05,451
Have you been well?

506
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:06,761
I've been well, thanks to you.

507
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,761
You wouldn't want to see me for no reason.

508
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,691
What's going on?

509
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:16,521
I found out the man who kidnapped Da Hae.

510
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:19,051
He killed Tae Ha, too.

511
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,221
Who is that worthless jerk?

512
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:33,451
Send up Chae Yeo Kyung only.

513
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,391
Block everyone else from entering.

514
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:37,991
Yes, Sir.

515
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,191
There's no use.

516
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:04,091
No one's here to help you.

517
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,221
What do you think you're doing?

518
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,521
Tae Ha...

519
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:12,291
was a dear friend of mine. But you...

520
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:14,821
killed him.

521
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:16,051
So what?

522
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,451
Are you trying to hurt me?

523
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:20,591
No.

524
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,151
Tae Ha and I...

525
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,321
don't kill people.

526
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,651
You should use the correct vocabulary.

527
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,451
It's not that you don't. You just can't.

528
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:36,021
I work for this country.

529
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:39,291
You know what will happen to you...

530
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:41,921
if you lay a finger on me, right?

531
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:46,691
You'll all be gone without a trace. Do you know that?

532
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:51,591
Let's just say that I can't kill...

533
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:54,351
since you insist on putting it that way.

534
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:56,991
But...

535
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:00,761
there are also people who aren't like us.

536
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:03,651
Goodbye.

537
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,191
What are you talking about?

538
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,891
Your call has been forwarded...

539
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,521
The moment I met you...

540
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:12,791
30 years ago,

541
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,921
everything got ruined.

542
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,351
What would've happened to my life...

543
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:23,891
if I hadn't come across that flyer?

544
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:26,521
You'd probably be somewhere...

545
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,051
mimicking someone else's life.

546
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,391
Then, if you like...

547
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:36,721
what you have, you would steal that life completely.

548
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:42,221
I thought about living a new life,

549
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:44,991
but it's not that easy.

550
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,391
I'm too tired.

551
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,521
The whole world knows that you're a murderer.

552
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:55,791
How can you possibly live a new life now?

553
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:00,221
That's why I'm thinking of giving up.

554
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,451
Gil Do.

555
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:08,291
We can talk this out.

556
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,721
You want the gold badge, right? I'll give you one.

557
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:13,351
I'll give you 10 if that's what you need.

558
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:15,921
Calm down, Gil Do. Calm down.

559
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,821
This is not right. You've misunderstood something.

560
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:20,121
Stop it.

561
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:24,491
I will live as a beast...

562
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,091
for one more day.

563
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,851
Goodbye.

564
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:25,591
Were you waiting for me?

565
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:27,621
What are you doing?

566
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,351
Something that a coward like you...

567
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:32,691
can never do.

568
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:50,721
Ha Jung Tae.

569
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:52,621
Park Tae Ha.

570
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:58,191
You two are dead in a place where I was born.

571
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:02,391
In my life, there was a time...

572
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:06,821
when I felt guilty for the first and last time.

573
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:09,691
It was when...

574
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:12,751
I pushed...

575
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:15,851
your father, Ha Jung Tae, off of a cliff.

576
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,891
I've lived by many names,

577
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:24,691
but I was the happiest when I lived as Ha Jung Tae.

578
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,951
It felt as if...

579
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:31,121
I was born with that name.

580
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:33,121
We had to live in agony...

581
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:36,491
because of that happiness of yours.

582
00:47:40,351 --> 00:47:41,491
I'm sorry,

583
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,021
but I don't feel sorry at all.

584
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:47,351
All I did was do my best...

585
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,651
to survive.

586
00:47:52,551 --> 00:47:53,621
Is that...

587
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:55,851
so wrong?

588
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:59,251
You are a beast.

589
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:12,221
I thought about mimicking another life again.

590
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,221
But...

591
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:18,051
I am too tired to do that now.

592
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:38,151
I stole...

593
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:41,191
your father's recipe note.

594
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,321
That was...

595
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:47,221
the beginning of Goongnakwon.

596
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:02,791
I have one bullet left.

597
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:06,851
I either shoot you...

598
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:08,521
or...

599
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,391
myself.

600
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:12,791
It's either one of the two.

601
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:41,651
How many people do you think...

602
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:44,251
get to die in the place they were born?

603
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,751
Is it an unfortunate thing...

604
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:49,721
or a fortunate thing?

605
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,021
No.

606
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,921
You can't die that easily.

607
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:57,551
Myeong.

608
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,291
No, Soon Seok.

609
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:03,251
This isn't you getting your revenge.

610
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,321
It's me putting and end to this myself.

611
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:11,221
The beginning and ending...

612
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:14,891
is always judged and decided...

613
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:17,921
by me.

614
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,691
No!

615
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:46,421
No.

616
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:51,921
No.

617
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:56,121
No.

618
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,521
Hey, Prosecutor Chae.

619
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:14,751
Take a seat.

620
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:16,951
You don't have to report your expulsion.

621
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:18,921
I came to turn myself in.

622
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:22,721
Turn yourself in?

623
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:26,121
Are you saying you committed a crime?

624
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:31,291
On November 10, 2007,

625
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,351
there was a murder case at Sarang Orphanage,

626
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,091
and I'm the murderer.

627
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:42,921
What? What are you talking about?

628
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:46,291
I've also committed crimes as a prosecutor.

629
00:51:46,591 --> 00:51:48,921
I destroyed evidence, took bribes, assisted murder...

630
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:51,091
and did many more.

631
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,691
(Top Head of Noodles, Moo Myeong)

632
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:54,491
Everyone is leaving.

633
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:56,821
One after the other.

634
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:10,491
My father put his entire life into these recipes.

635
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,591
Your father stole it,

636
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:18,891
but I am giving this to you.

637
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,921
Why are you giving this to me?

638
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,321
Please keep Goongnakwon going.

639
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,691
You're the only one who can make noodles...

640
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:32,921
with your heart, not just with your hands.

641
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:34,721
So keep it going.

642
00:53:42,551 --> 00:53:43,951
(Three years later)

643
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:58,221
Hello.

644
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:03,351
I am Kim Da Hae, Head of Noodles.

645
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:06,551
As you know,

646
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:08,491
there has been many complications...

647
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,651
at Goongnakwon for the last few years.

648
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,251
We haven't fully healed from our scars,

649
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:17,651
and we still have many problems.

650
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:21,991
However,

651
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,551
I believe we can overcome this...

652
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,321
if we all work together as one.

653
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:31,221
I will also do my best.

654
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,421
From now on, everything I say is an order,

655
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:38,451
not a request.

656
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,621
I will not take any objections,

657
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:43,321
and I won't tolerate disobedience.

658
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:48,351
From now on, everything I say is an order,

659
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:50,921
not a request.

660
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,321
I will not take any objections,

661
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,221
and I won't tolerate disobedience.

662
00:55:00,521 --> 00:55:01,951
Let's begin with two servings of...

663
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:03,651
royal pheasant buckwheat noodles.

664
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:05,551
Let us begin.

665
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,921
Why are you so late?

666
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:16,291
Look at you, putting on make-up and everything.

667
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:18,621
I wanted to look pretty. Is that bad?

668
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:20,621
Get in.

669
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,751
What are you doing? Why are you riding in the back?

670
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:29,221
Am I your driver or what?

671
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:31,621
You're my manager...

672
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:33,721
and I'm the next Master of Noodles...

673
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:36,251
who also has a 50 percent share of Goongnakwon.

674
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:38,421
I might just fire you.

675
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,551
My goodness, this is unbelievably lousy.

676
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,391
(Park Tae Ha)

677
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:15,921
I wasn't going to cry.

678
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:20,891
I...

679
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,491
didn't run away.

680
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:27,721
I fought everything just like you told me to,

681
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:30,421
and I'll continue to do so.

682
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:33,491
So...

683
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:37,891
please watch over me, Tae Ha.

684
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:43,351
And...

685
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:49,791
you too, Mum.

686
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:51,121
(Kim Seon Joo)

687
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:35,921
Are you okay?

688
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:38,221
Look at your hands.

689
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:40,951
May I have a bowl of noodles?

690
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,821
What kind of noodles would you like?

691
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,021
Shouldn't you look at me when you take my order?

692
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:09,451
It looks good.

693
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:36,521
It's good.

694
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:42,991
So...

695
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:46,091
we're back.

696
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,491
Both you...

697
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,421
and me.

698
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,251
It took too long.

699
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:57,551
You're right.

700
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,551
Do you remember...

701
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:08,221
the noodles the four of us ate at Chimyeon Restaurant?

702
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:11,051
That was really good.

703
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:21,621
A bit more.

704
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:24,521
Just enough of this.

705
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:30,791
Here.

706
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:33,851
Some sesame seeds.

707
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:36,051
- Can I eat? - Yes.

708
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:38,751
Let's eat.

709
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,751
- Give me that. - He ate too much.

710
01:00:46,421 --> 01:00:47,851
It's really good.

711
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:50,951
You're eating your hair, too.

712
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,151
- It's good. - Your shirt's dirty.

713
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,451
Thanks for the bow.

714
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,651
- There's more. - Let Yeo Kyung finish it.

715
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,351
- It's mine. - I'll make you more.

716
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,291
Gil Yong.

717
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:09,121
Will you hit me?

718
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:10,921
Hey!

719
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,521
Myeong!

720
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:16,821
- It's mine. - I want more.

721
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:21,691
- It's good. - It's nice.

722
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,721
- I want more. - I haven't eaten yet.

723
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,251
- Stop it. - Gosh.

724
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:27,991
Hang on.

725
01:01:32,891 --> 01:01:33,891
Hey.

726
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,151
What?

727
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:39,091
It's so good.

728
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,491
- What? - Try this.

729
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:43,091
Eat up.

730
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:47,221
(Thank you for watching "Master of Revenge".)

731
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:49,091
Don't they feed you at Goongnakwon?

732
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:50,651
I guess so.

733
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:54,891
- How funny. - Come to me if you're hungry.

734
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:57,391
Okay? I'll buy you a snack.

735
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:58,621
No thanks.

736
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,321
Yeo Kyung's eating everything.

737
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:07,321
(Master of Revenge)

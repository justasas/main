00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,732
<i>Everything was a lie.</i>

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,537
Friends...

5
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:20,470
are really nothing special.

6
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,067
<i>Me...</i>

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,950
I want to be over this damn guilt
I feel every time I look at you!

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,950
You were right.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,476
Friends really are nothing special.

10
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:29,799
<i>and Yeo Kyung...</i>

11
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,138
<i>We both lied</i>

12
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:35,294
<i>about things that we never
should have lied about.</i>

13
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,658
<i>We both told lies</i>

14
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:38,390
<i>we would definitely regret forever.</i>

15
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:52,922
<i>There's no such thing as a friend
who isn't really that special.</i>

<i>When a person is forced to face
the death of their friend...</i>

00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,780
<i>it entrances</i>

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,127
<i>that person with shock and sadness.</i>

19
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:08,199
What do we do now?

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,100
<i>The pain brought on by sadness only
disappears after the trauma has set in.</i>

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,399
<i>In a way, that's consolation
in and of itself.</i>

22
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:30,444
<i>Even if...</i>

23
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:32,038
<i>you're not necessarily friends.</i>

24
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>[Seven Days Later]</i>

25
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,831
What are you trying to pull
right now, Head Chef?

26
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,831
You've been ignoring the
kitchens for a week now!

27
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,202
The kitchens are a mess,
and customers are unsatisfied!

28
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:16,322
At this rate, we'll be
forced to shut down!

29
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,287
Shut it down then.

30
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,732
What's even weirder
is that we're still open.

31
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,743
What?

32
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:28,232
Who would eat noodles that
were once made by a murderer?

33
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:33,831
Shut this place down until Kim Gil Do's
presence is erased from here forever.

34
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,768
That's the right thing
to do in this situation.

35
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:43,031
What happened to your
parents is truly a shame.

36
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:48,132
Finding out that Kim Gil Do is a killer
was as shocking to us as it was to you.

37
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,829
But why do the consequences

38
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,956
have to be suffered by Goong Rak Won?

39
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:55,331
It took so much for us to get this big.

40
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,632
I will not stand by and watch it crumble.

41
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:01,732
I cannot accept that.
I refuse to watch it crumble like this.

42
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,331
Step down from your position.

43
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,331
You're the one who is most
responsible for our current state.

44
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,632
You should be trying to fix this
situation as much as possible.

45
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,732
But look at you.

46
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:15,575
Leave this place right now.

47
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,684
I can't do that.

48
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:21,232
I have to protect this position.

49
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:24,531
Kil Gil Do will definitely be back here.

50
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:27,931
Whoever ends up dying, I have to see this
through until the end, no matter what.

51
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,839
Why, you...

52
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,488
My friend died.

53
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:36,431
I got so distracted with my raging need
for revenge against Kim Gil Do

54
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,732
that I didn't even think of my friends.

55
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,156
My friend...

56
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,132
came into this living hell because of me.

57
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,264
Tae Ha...

58
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,164
I might as well have killed him, myself.

59
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:59,031
Madame Seol. Let me give you a warning.

60
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,400
Do not make me

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,312
redirect my rage towards you.

62
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:08,232
You definitely will not
be able to handle that rage.

63
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,807
So just stay put

64
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,295
and keep quiet until Kim Gil Do is dead.

65
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,131
Let me give you a warning too.

66
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,116
Don't drag people

67
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,607
who have nothing to do with you,
into your damn revenge plot.

68
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:32,232
From this point forward,
I do not consider you Head Chef.

69
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,138
I'll use whatever means necessary

70
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:36,203
to get you

71
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,636
thrown out of here.

72
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,532
He just does whatever the hell he wants!

73
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,602
He's like this as a head chef

74
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,631
imagine how much worse
he would be as Master!

75
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,032
Madame Go. Are you just going
to sit and watch this happen?

76
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,931
Hello? Are you listening to me?

77
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,455
Geez...

78
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,556
Why are you so damn insensitive?

79
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:13,732
His friend just died.
You have to give him time to grieve.

80
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:16,532
It's not like you're a major shareholder.

81
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,885
Why are you being so nosy,
like a truffle-sniffing pig?

82
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,898
What?

83
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,609
What did you just call me?

84
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,532
- Hey--
- Am I wrong though?

85
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:28,746
Now that you've got Master Ha's shares...

86
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,631
Geez, aren't you just
on a major power trip?

87
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,647
Can you be considerate
of others, just this once?

88
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,532
Noodles are important,
but not as important as people.

89
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,732
Geez...

90
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,991
<i>Um...</i>

91
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,631
I guess you don't actually
get motion sickness.

92
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:54,631
I do

93
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,631
if I don't eat.

94
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,049
<i>Let go</i>

95
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,335
before I start screaming.

96
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:00,583
You're the thief here, not me.

97
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,145
Hey!

98
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,374
<i>You smell like cars.</i>

99
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,056
<i>And sweat.</i>

100
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,607
<i>And...</i>

101
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,707
<i>dumplings.</i>

102
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,931
Do you know what it smells like,
when you mix all of those together?

103
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,332
It smells like Tae Ha.

104
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:08,614
Why are you here?

105
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,388
What's this?

106
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,631
Tae Ha's stuff.

107
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,441
I feel like I'm going crazy.

108
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,979
I keep tearing up, looking at this stuff.

109
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,765
Tae Ha...

110
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:00,717
Don't misunderstand.
I'm just using you as a garbage can.

111
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,984
<i>I have a request for you.</i>

112
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,924
<i>Please remember</i>

113
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:08,924
<i>my scent.</i>

114
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,331
It looks like Chief Park had
a big impact on a lot of people.

115
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,484
I think I know how empty it must feel...

116
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:48,041
at least from what I remember about
how I felt after my father died.

117
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:53,231
You have to just cry it out.
What else can you do, really?

118
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:59,132
There's something that
I've really wanted to tell you.

119
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:08,731
When I said that dirty blood
flows through your veins...

120
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,308
How could I still be considered human,
after saying such a terrible thing?

121
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:17,032
I mean, it's not like
my blood is much cleaner.

122
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:23,731
What I said back then has been
stuck in my heart like a thorn

123
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,132
and it hasn't left, no matter
how hard I tried to dig it out.

124
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,359
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:35,195
I truly am, Da Hae.

126
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,450
It's okay.

127
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:46,368
I knew that you didn't really mean it.

128
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,018
About Moo Myung...

129
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:57,231
I know he that he's going
through a rough patch.

130
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,877
Madame Seol is only making
things worse by pressuring him.

131
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,968
I'm sure that his entire life
has been a living hell

132
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,667
so we should protect him.

133
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,719
I know...

134
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,207
that no matter what anyone says

135
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:15,176
he truly loves noodles
and he truly loves making noodles.

136
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,723
I'll be

137
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,127
a source of strength for you.

138
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:27,388
I know that we can't

139
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:31,676
go back to the times when
we ate noodles together so comfortably.

140
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:34,609
But even so...

141
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,531
do you think we could lend each other

142
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,273
a shoulder to cry on

143
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,512
when we're going through tough times?

144
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,132
I think that would be
really nice, if we could.

145
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,831
I'll do that, Madame Go.

146
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:53,002
Also...

147
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,648
Thank you.

You remember Chief Hwang Sung Rok, right?

168
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,705
How could I possibly forget him?

169
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:36,757
You look good.

170
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:38,431
You look like you've lost some weight.

171
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,132
Seems like you've
been through quite a bit.

172
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,370
No, not really.

173
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,359
People were asking me for autographs

174
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,283
while I was on the run.

175
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:54,134
It felt like people weren't
as interested in me as I thought.

176
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,731
I'm sure that they'll be much
more interested in you soon.

177
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,632
Let's start with the incidents
that you were both involved in.

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,831
you ordered for Mr. Hwang
to be killed under a bridge. Correct?

181
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,547
What do you mean?

182
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:20,329
Why would Master Ha try to kill me?

183
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:26,032
What's written here is what
you said, word for word.

184
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:28,331
I'm sure that there
must have been an error.

185
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:30,739
Or I may have felt threatened

186
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:34,282
by a certain someone when I wrote that.

187
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:36,273
To be honest with you

188
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:38,715
I don't even remember...

189
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:40,632
ever making such a claim.

190
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,594
What are you trying to pull right now?

191
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:46,532
We have everything documented,
recorded and filed as evidence!

192
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,440
There was no pressure
placed on you, and I'm definitely

193
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,452
not mistaken.

194
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,085
What would happen if I were
to change my witness testimony?

195
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:07,005
Did you two...

196
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,005
by chance...

197
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:29,427
I do not wish to testify any longer.

198
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:33,485
I'd like to change my witness testimony.

199
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:46,402
Please take Chief Hwang Sung Rok away.

200
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,926
You even ruined our witness...

201
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:02,571
for your escape plan?

202
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:07,339
Just take things as they are.
Don't let your imagination run wild.

203
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,238
You damn monster.

204
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,438
Prosecutor, you seem a bit worked up.

205
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:13,952
Allow me to

206
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:16,839
take some pressure off of your shoulders.

207
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,839
Regarding that incident involving
Senator So's old housekeeper...

208
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,302
It's true that I killed her.

209
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,212
Yes, it is.

210
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,919
However...

211
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,294
the murder of Ha Jung Tae and his wife...

212
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:35,238
The only evidence against me for that
is Choi Soon Suk's eyewitness testimony.

213
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:40,339
And unfortunately, the statute
of limitations on that has expired.

214
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,619
And...

215
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,225
regarding the murder of
Professor Chae Il Hwan....

216
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,875
Raymond Holdings' CEO

217
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,446
Lee Jung Bum

218
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,520
was behind that one.

219
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:55,839
It had nothing to do with me.

220
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,438
But that doesn't matter now,
since he's been acquitted of all charges.

221
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:05,438
You also said that I'm being
charged for escaping authorities.

222
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,660
But I didn't escape.

223
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,682
I just got lost

224
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:10,895
from the trauma...

225
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:15,348
that I suffered, from the accident.

226
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,761
And what about Tae Ha?

227
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,638
You killed Tae Ha!

228
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,039
You killed Tae Ha so you
could hide your secrets!

229
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,839
Again with that wild imagination.

230
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,339
A prosecutor should make judgments
based solely on evidence.

231
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,938
That damn imagination of yours
is why things happened like this.

232
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,060
You son of a bitch!

233
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,991
Prosecutor, you can't.

234
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,987
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung.

235
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,728
Listen very carefully.

236
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,331
Tae Ha. I didn't kill him.

237
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:49,339
I don't care whether or not
you believe me.

238
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,444
But that's the honest truth.

239
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:15,987
Chief Hwang.

240
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,870
Go ahead.

241
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,138
I'd like it if you could
do one more thing for me.

242
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:27,223
You do realize that
this is the bathroom...

243
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,670
inside of the prosecutor's office, right?

244
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,539
I need something.

245
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,738
It won't be easy to get,
but I need you to get it for me.

246
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,161
Getting things is a matter of money.

247
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,851
What is it, though...

248
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:42,840
that you want?

249
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,785
So all we did was help Kim Gil Do
find a way out of all of this?

250
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,600
We were publicly humiliated after
getting an emergency warrant out for him

251
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,488
and we had our witness
change his testimony.

252
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,138
Correct?

253
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,938
Please, give me more time.
If I just dig deeper--

254
00:20:01,938 --> 00:20:04,080
And if you do?

255
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,839
Do you think you'll find some
secret evidence basket, then?

256
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,339
In seven days, he has managed to

257
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,138
buy out our only witness,
and get rid of all of the evidence.

258
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,539
Within those seven days, you did nothing!

259
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,138
I'm sorry, sir.

260
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,438
I received a report about
you receiving a bribe.

261
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:20,839
I also know that all that money
was donated to an orphanage.

262
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,938
I also understand that you had
no choice, due to the situation.

263
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:25,409
However

264
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,721
a crime is a crime.

265
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:31,267
You can choose one of two options.

266
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,436
One, be terminated.

267
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:36,539
Or two, be tried for the crime
of accepting a bribe.

268
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,539
I'll choose to be terminated.

269
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,788
From this point forward

270
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:48,138
until you get your termination letter,
you will be off of active duty.

271
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:51,539
Using any of your privileges
as a prosecutor is forbidden.

272
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:55,839
<i>[Goong Rak Won's Former Master
Kim Gil Do Acknowledges</i>

273
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,696
<i>Murdering Senator So's Old Housekeeper,
But As For Other Charges...]</i>

274
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,851
That vermin...

275
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,028
Should I take care of him?

276
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,532
I shouldn't keep scratching...

277
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,792
at a festering wound.

278
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:22,238
I'll become the leader of my faction,
and then I'll shoot for presidency.

279
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,176
After all, we can kill vermin, any time.

280
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:30,138
Please let me know if you
change your mind, sir.

281
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:32,647
But that being said...

282
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,938
increase the number of bodyguards I have.

283
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:38,161
Kim Gil Do has enough wrath in him

284
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,418
to try to do something.

285
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:43,686
Senator

286
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,149
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung is here.

287
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,010
Send her in.

288
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,471
Senator.

289
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:00,543
You let Kim Gil Do go?

290
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:03,039
Our witness decided to recant
his testimony against him.

291
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,051
He's been declared innocent now

292
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,588
so all you really did

293
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,274
was do him a favor.

294
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:12,339
Please give me one more chance.

295
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:16,138
Didn't you already get fired?

296
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:19,428
Just forget about all of this now.

297
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,590
Start fresh somewhere else.

298
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:25,839
You're smart, so you'll have no problem
making a living, wherever you may go.

299
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,840
I can't just give up now.

300
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:30,694
You must help me.

301
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:31,694
That's

302
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:34,638
the only way that you won't face
any issues from this point forward.

303
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:40,938
Wow, you've sure changed your tune.
Are you threatening me, right now?

304
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:45,938
If that's how it sounds to you,
then yes, it is a threat.

305
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:52,240
That isn't just any kind of threat.
This here, is called an empty threat.

306
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,811
Do you

307
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,703
even have the secret document?

308
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,126
Of course.

309
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,032
You sure?

310
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,039
Are you sure about that?

311
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,821
<i>[Dear Yeo Kyung, the stars lingered near
my window for longer than usual today.]</i>

312
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:46,238
<i>Whenever I got a letter from you,
I always wrote a reply letter.</i>

313
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:51,938
<i>I kept telling myself I had to send it,
but I was afraid of affecting you</i>

314
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:53,938
<i>so I folded them up
and put them away.</i>

315
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,438
<i>Read them whenever you think of me.</i>

316
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:03,138
<i>That's enough to make
me happy, Yeo Kyung.</i>

317
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,339
Kim Gil Do.

318
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,628
Do you know what the best place
to stab someone is?

319
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,339
Their back. You shouldn't show
your back to others so easily.

320
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,039
Get the hell out, right now.

321
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:48,339
When people feel fear,
their pupils dilate.

322
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,938
That way, they can analyze a situation
better, to get themselves out of danger.

323
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,805
And their lips part slightly too

324
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:56,080
as they prepare to scream

325
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,427
"Save me!"

326
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,839
And that's exactly what
you look like now, again.

327
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:05,539
There really is no easy way out
this time either, right?

328
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,708
Tae Ha.

329
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,648
So Tae Sup killed him.

330
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,117
So, choose.

331
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,779
Will you choose So Tae Sup,
who killed Tae Ha

332
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,539
or me, who planned
the murder of your parents?

333
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,263
If you choose So Tae Sup

334
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:30,490
you and I

335
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,039
will be on the same side, soon enough.

336
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,638
But if you choose me,
you'll have to keep fighting until

337
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:38,738
a person who is even more
important to you dies too.

338
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,339
There are no other choices.

339
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:47,539
We have to end this annoying relationship
between us, in one way or another.

340
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:55,438
Give me evidence that
So Tae Sup killed him.

341
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:58,539
I won't believe anything anymore
unless I see the evidence for myself.

342
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,880
So Tae Sup sent me that photo...

343
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,881
after he kidnapped my daughter, Da Hae.

344
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:24,938
And this...

345
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:27,701
<i>You'll basically be trading
your death for your daughter's life.</i>

346
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,064
<i>Isn't that fair?</i>

347
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,939
<i>Anyway, there's a warehouse in Incheon.</i>

348
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:34,839
<i>I'll send you the address,
so come there.</i>

349
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:40,238
<i>Isn't it only fair that we trade
your death for your daughter's life?</i>

350
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,938
He also made the same call to Tae Ha.

351
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:51,238
Tae Ha got to the
warehouse before I did

352
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:54,138
and that's why he died.

353
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:57,889
So Tae Sup.

354
00:26:58,744 --> 00:26:59,911
I will kill him.

355
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:06,138
And in order to do that,
I need your help.

356
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:42,938
<i>One... two... three.</i>

357
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,589
Sorry...

358
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,432
<i>but I'm not sorry at all.</i>

359
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:54,539
Kim Gil Do!

360
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,339
Shut up!

361
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,839
If I wanted to kill you, I could
have done it a hundred times already!

362
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,339
It's not over yet.
So you just wait.

363
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:21,039
My father was a monster
who killed two people.

364
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,638
But I didn't become a monster.

365
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:28,438
Saying that you became a monster because
of your terrible past, is just an excuse.

366
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:31,738
You don't know anything about me.

367
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,767
I saw your true colors
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

368
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,570
at the crematorium that day.

369
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:40,207
You said that you were just acting...

370
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:43,513
but you can't fake those kinds of tears.

371
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:47,839
Please retain that last shred of
being earnest that you might have left.

372
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,856
The only one who can
pull you out of this hell...

373
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,342
is you.

374
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:55,342
Shut up!

375
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:48,926
<i>[Kil Gil Do]</i>

376
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:56,039
Gil Do, have you been doing well?

377
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,039
<i>I've been through quite a bit,
all thanks to you.</i>

378
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,339
You've sure been through
a lot in your life, haven't you?

379
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,339
So why did you have to be so greedy?

380
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:09,839
If you had just lived a nice quiet life,
these things wouldn't have happened.

381
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,638
<i>You're not the only one in this world
with a lion's share of greed.</i>

382
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,539
<i>It's not because I was greedy.</i>

383
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:17,938
<i>It's probably because
I'm weaker, that I keep suffering.</i>

384
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:21,615
Is that right?

385
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:25,055
<i>May I come in?</i>

386
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:45,138
Da Hae... Why did you kidnap her?

387
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:49,039
I thought that it was the only way
I could get you to come to me.

388
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,339
I never imagined that you would
even ignore your own daughter.

389
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,839
And why did you kill Tae Ha?

390
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,938
It's not like I planned to.
He came to be killed.

391
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:05,339
He thought he had to die for Da Hae
and Prosecutor Chae to live.

392
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:10,938
He's a completely different
person than you.

393
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,438
Why didn't you just take the
secret document, and let him go?

394
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:22,238
And you? Why didn't you just steal
your friend's recipe, and leave him be?

395
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:28,638
Why did you have to go and set
two people on fire after that?

396
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,339
Everything happened after I met you.

397
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:36,138
That's where I went wrong.

398
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:38,938
Now I've veered off to the point
of no return, all thanks to you.

399
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,320
That's right.

400
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:45,184
There's no way you can make
things the way they once were, now.

401
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,391
<i>So Tae Sup...</i>

402
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,458
<i>I will kill him.</i>

403
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:41,236
<i>To do that... I need your help.</i>

404
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:55,621
<i>[Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung]</i>

405
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,938
<i>The number you have dialed,
is unavailable at this time...</i>

406
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:34,039
What brings you here?

407
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,938
I have a request to make.
Help me meet Senator So.

408
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,934
That's not hard. But...

409
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,569
you have to tell me what this is about.

410
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,839
Tae Ha... So Tae Sup
is the one who killed him.

411
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:52,238
I'll never forgive that bastard.

412
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,857
You'll be in danger, Yeo Kyung.

413
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:57,438
If you get in any deeper,
you won't be able to climb back out.

414
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:01,256
I've already lost Tae Ha.
I don't want to lose you too.

415
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,539
Who will you hold back next,
after you lose me?

416
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,138
I can't just sit and watch
like this anymore.

417
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,571
Yeo Kyung!

418
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:08,571
Tae Ha...

419
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:13,038
I can't send him off
in such a lonely way.

420
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:17,339
We really can't do that,
no matter what, Moo Myung.

421
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:31,938
I don't think I could ever
forget this scent!

422
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:36,038
Do you have any idea how much
I was craving lotus noodles?

423
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:39,877
I should have made them
for you more often. I'm sorry.

424
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,639
Oh, don't say stuff like that.

425
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,239
If not for you, I could never
eat such luxurious noodles.

426
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,378
Um, Senator.

427
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:58,139
Yes?

428
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,339
I have a favor to ask you.

429
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,348
Go ahead.

430
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,378
I'm happy to listen
to any request from you.

431
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,839
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyung
wishes to meet with you.

432
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:16,938
How do you know her?

433
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:21,038
I've been summoned by her a couple of
times regarding the case with Kim Gil Do.

434
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:28,739
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
asked you for that.

435
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,239
- Please ignore what I just said.
- No, I'll see her.

436
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,938
If she really wants to see me that bad,
then I have to see her, right?

437
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:49,824
Da Hae.

438
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:50,824
Yeah?

439
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:54,639
Take a break once in a while.
You'll pass out, at this rate.

440
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:58,139
Some people make hundreds
of servings on their own.

441
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:03,438
Geez. I just feel so damn bad,
just watching you.

442
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,270
Noodle-maker Kim.

443
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,822
One order of royal court court style
quail buckwheat noodles, please.

444
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:20,038
You have to give the order
to the sous-chef first.

445
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:22,839
What is it? Did you call for me?

446
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:28,339
The customer wants you, specifically
to make them and serve them.

447
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,239
What?

448
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,739
Put it here, please.

449
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:47,339
I'm here as a customer today.

450
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:27,538
Your kneading has gotten a lot better.

451
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:34,239
The elasticity is just right, and you've
maintained the buckwheat smell nicely.

452
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:38,127
With this level of skill

453
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:43,063
you could serve your noodles
anywhere... with pride.

454
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:47,063
Tae Ha...

455
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:49,473
Who killed him?

456
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,449
Tell me.

457
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,790
Did you kill him?

458
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,741
Is that what happened?

459
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,052
No, please, tell me that it isn't true.

460
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:08,413
Tell me that you didn't do it!

461
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,248
Please tell me you didn't do it!

462
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,277
It wasn't me.

463
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:24,045
Who did it, then?

464
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:26,902
Who killed him?

465
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:28,927
It's someone that you don't know.

466
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:31,708
And it must stay that way.

467
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,386
It's because of you.

468
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,498
It's all because of you!

469
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,339
Why didn't you pick up my call?

470
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:09,538
If you did, I never would
have gotten kidnapped!

471
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,811
Tae Ha...

472
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:14,281
He died trying to save me!

473
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,648
He died because of me...

474
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,000
No...

475
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,355
If you just didn't commit those crimes,
he wouldn't have died.

476
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:27,994
You should have been the one who died.

477
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,272
Why did you go and commit crimes

478
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:35,139
but have someone else
atone for your sins?

479
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,889
Why?

480
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,348
Why? Why?

481
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:59,750
Oh, geez...

482
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,936
It's been a while, Ms. Prosecutor.

483
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,639
Have you been well?

484
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,063
Yes, thanks to you.

485
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm sure you didn't call me
because you missed my pretty face.

486
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,639
So tell me,
what is this about?

487
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,795
Ms. Da Hae...

488
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,918
I found out who kidnapped her.

489
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,339
And he's the one
who killed Tae Ha too.

490
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:21,842
And who would that son of a bitch be?

491
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:34,538
Allow only Chae Yeo Kyung up here.

492
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:37,038
Stop anyone else who
tries to come up here.

493
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:38,639
Yes.

494
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:04,538
There's no use.
Nobody can help you now.

495
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,639
What the hell are you doing right now?

496
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,527
Tae Ha...

497
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,614
was a very dear friend to me.

498
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:15,038
And then, my dear friend,
Tae Ha... you killed him.

499
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,639
And now what?

500
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,951
You're going to kill me
because of that now?

501
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,246
No.

502
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:25,777
We're not capable of murder.
Not Tae Ha, not me.

503
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:30,239
Be a bit more honest with yourself,
even if you don't live honestly anymore.

504
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,438
Is it that you won't kill me,
or is it that you can't?

505
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:37,038
I'm a person who has
this country by the reins.

506
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:42,538
You know what will happen to you
if you lay one finger on me, right?

507
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:47,339
If you do, you two will disappear
without a trace. You know that, right?

508
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,708
Since you put it that way

509
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,601
let's just say that we "can't" kill you.

510
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,589
But, you know...

511
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:01,143
there are plenty of people
who aren't like us.

512
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,438
Then...

513
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,395
What the hell are you saying?

514
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,639
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available at this time...</i>

515
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,027
The moment I met you...

516
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:13,335
thirty years ago...

517
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:16,839
started the downward spiral
that ended up ruining my life.

518
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:21,500
I wonder how my life
would have turned out

519
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,090
if I just hadn't seen the ad
for a tutor that day.

520
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,547
You probably would have just...

521
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:30,438
stolen someone else's identity somewhere.

522
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,261
Isn't that right?

523
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:37,150
After all, you steal everything you like.

524
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,938
I thought about ways that
I could get a new lease on life.

525
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:46,261
But I couldn't think of one that easily.

526
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:48,605
I've grown too weary of everything.

527
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:53,239
Everyone in this world knows
that you're a murderer.

528
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,538
So how could you possibly start fresh?

529
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,232
That's why I figured

530
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,703
I'll just call it quits now.

531
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:05,514
Hey, Kim Gil Do.

532
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,900
If you have qualms, we can
settle them through words, right?

533
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,938
You wanted the Gold Senator's Badge?

534
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:13,839
Here, I'll give you one.
I'll give you ten, if you want!

535
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,348
Hey, calm down, Gil Do. This isn't right.

536
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:19,339
This is all a big misunderstanding!

537
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:20,339
Stop!

538
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:25,226
I think I'll have to live like a monster

539
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,415
for just one more day.

540
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:31,538
Have a safe trip to the other side.

541
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,339
Were you waiting for me?

542
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,438
What are you doing?

543
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:31,147
Something that a coward like you...

544
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:33,181
could never do.

545
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:51,045
Ha Jung Tae.

546
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:52,855
Park Tae Ha.

547
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:58,938
So these two are being laid to rest
where I was once born?

548
00:46:59,938 --> 00:47:07,409
I've felt that emotion called guilt
just once in my entire life.

549
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,750
When I made your father...

550
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,217
Ha Jung Tae...

551
00:47:14,143 --> 00:47:16,282
fall off of that cliff.

552
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,427
I've lived under many names...

553
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:25,049
but I was happiest
when I lived as Ha Jung Tae.

554
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:28,714
As if

555
00:47:28,714 --> 00:47:31,839
it was my real name,
from the very beginning.

556
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,554
You made me live through hell

557
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:36,998
for the sake of your happiness.

558
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:42,558
I'm sorry

559
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:44,523
but I'm not sorry at all.

560
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:48,391
All I did was

561
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:51,092
try my best to survive.

562
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,197
Is that

563
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:56,263
really so wrong?

564
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:59,938
You damn monster...

565
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,839
I even considered pretending to be
someone else and surviving that way.

566
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,025
But it...

567
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,339
wore me out way too much
to keep on living like that.

568
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:38,960
That's your father's notebook.

569
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,230
The one that I stole from him.

570
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:44,632
That

571
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:47,625
became the framework for Goong Rak Won.

572
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,047
This last bullet...

573
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:07,822
will be used either

574
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:09,172
to shoot me...

575
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:13,076
or to shoot you.

576
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:45,038
For someone to die where
they were once born...

577
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:48,545
Is that an ill fate?

578
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:50,268
Or a good one?

579
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:51,839
No.

580
00:49:54,186 --> 00:49:56,485
You shouldn't be allowed
to die so easily.

581
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:57,855
Moo Myung...

582
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:01,177
No, Soon Suk.

583
00:50:01,177 --> 00:50:03,864
Your revenge isn't what led to this.

584
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:06,772
I'm doing this on my own volition.

585
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,817
I'll always make all of the decisions.

586
00:50:12,985 --> 00:50:15,391
From the beginning, until the end.

587
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:18,538
I make the decisions.

588
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,438
No!

589
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,639
No...

590
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,639
No.

591
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:56,639
No.

592
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,339
Ah...

593
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:12,851
Oh, Prosecutor Chae!

594
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,918
Have a seat.

595
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,339
You don't have to come in
if you've been fired.

596
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,639
I came to confess.

597
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,589
Confess?

598
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:26,612
Confess as in, turn yourself in, confess?

599
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,139
I was the one who truly committed
the murder that took place

600
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:36,538
on November 10, 2007, at Love Orphanage.

601
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,494
No... What... the hell are you saying?

602
00:51:43,494 --> 00:51:46,739
Furthermore, as a prosecutor,
I got rid of the evidence.

603
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:49,639
I've also committed other crimes, such as

604
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,339
accepting bribes,
and accessory to another murder.

606
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,623
So it looks like
everyone leaves in the end...

607
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:57,058
one by one...

608
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:09,456
My father wrote these
noodle-making techniques

609
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:10,750
and devoted his entire life to this book.

610
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:17,185
Your father stole this from him

611
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:19,196
but I'm giving it to you now.

612
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:24,239
Why would you give this to me?

613
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,339
Please protect Goong Rak Won.

614
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:30,938
And make noodles that have been earnestly
created, with more than just hands.

615
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:33,545
Only you can do that.

616
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:34,770
I'm begging you.

619

As you may know

620
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:12,072
Goong Rak Won has been encompassed
by many unpleasant circumstances.

621
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,038
Our scars from that time
still haven't fully healed

622
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:18,538
and we are still going
through many hardships.

623
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:22,534
However

624
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:24,956
if we put all of our strength together

625
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:27,708
we can definitely overcome this.

626

00:55:19,438 --> 00:55:20,672

00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:27,639
Why are you sitting in the back?

640
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:29,938
Am I your driver?

641
00:55:29,938 --> 00:55:31,639
You're the Chief of Management.

642

What a dirty, rotten...

648
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:23,946
didn't run away.

649
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:28,839
I faced everything head on,
like you told me to.

650
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,438
And I'll keep doing that, from now on.

651
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:33,824
So...

had at the Chi Myun Restaurant?

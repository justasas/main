1
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:25,243
<i>The only way we'll know when and at
what targets a nuclear button will be pressed</i>

2
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,557
<i>is by electronic espionage-</i>

3
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:30,559
That’s what makes it so appalling
that Dodgson,

4
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:34,083
a self-confessed and convicted Soviet agent,

5
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,318
was able to hold a position of trust here
for ten years.

6
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,635
It must not happen again.

7
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:45,437
Each of you, not only section heads,
but each and every one of you,

8
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:50,123
has simply got to report oddities of behaviour
among your colleagues,

9
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:54,644
strange events or anything else
that strikes you as out of the ordinary.

10
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:59,926
It’s not only your jobs that are at risk,
it’s the survival of the free world.

11
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,278
<i>Did you spy
for the Russians for ten years?</i>

12
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,437
<i>Yes.</i>

13
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:33,645
Did you watch kiddy-porn videos
with Stephen Kedge?

14
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,718
Yes.

15
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:41,518
Does the photograph that I’ve just shown you
contain Allen Goodburn?

16
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:42,676
Yes.

17
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:46,521
Did you sometimes see him socially
with his wife Cynthia?

18
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,644
Get this thing off me!

19
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:52,685
Mr Dodgson,

20
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:57,921
you’ve already told me this machine
is no better than a fortune-teller at a fair.

21
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:02,000
I mean, if it’s junk, what’s your problem?

22
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:05,841
Are you anti-Black or just anti-American?

23
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:11,957
A lot of people detest your country
and all it stands for.

24
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,357
<i>In England, that’s not yet a crime.</i>

25
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,517
I think we have a problem.

26
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:24,198
Utah was painful to us, Dodgson. We don’t
forgive you for making us look foolish

27
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:28,121
and for putting another wedge between us
and our good friends.

28
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:32,917
You’re here to answer yes or no
to our friend’s questions. Yes or no.

29
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,157
And get on with it.

30
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:44,046
I'm gonna have to start all over again.

31
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,118
Sit real still.

32
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,317
Keep your eyes on the board.

33
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,806
Your friend Kedge fell under a train.

34
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:06,085
<i>Looks as though
they’ve taken the bait.</i>

35
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:10,319
As soon as we’re sure
they’ve bitten on Goodburn, I'll let you know.

36
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,398
Take the pills that evening.

37
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,087
Check.

38
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,078
And mate.

39
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,997
<i>Tickets, please.</i>

40
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:36,162
- Thanks. Cheltenham next stop, sir.
- Thank you.

41
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,715
Any more tickets now, please?

42
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:49,316
<i>The train on platform two
is the 12:10 from London Paddington -</i>

43
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:52,444
<i>This is Cheltenham Spa, Cheltenham Spa -</i>

44
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:55,166
<i>The train will be leaving in five minutes, 12:15,</i>

45
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:58,444
<i>for Gloucester, Stroud, Kemble,
and London Paddington -</i>

46
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:02,406
- Dad?
- Bob. You shouldn’t have bothered to come.

47
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:06,878
- Well, you’ve braved British Rail to get here.
- I’ve got a present for you.

48
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:12,246
The bloke in the Russian book shop
said it was a fair translation.

49
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,239
It’s beautiful. Thanks.

50
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,602
- How’s business?
- Struggling.

51
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,120
<i>Yeah?</i>

52
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:26,596
Over here. By the way, there’s someone
coming I particularly want you to meet.

53
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:29,155
A girl, eh? It’s about time.

54
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,841
- Two of them, actually.
- Two?

55
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:47,763
PV.

56
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,075
PV?

57
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,603
- It’s to do with security. Positive vetting.
- Yeah, PV.

58
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:55,679
- PV? It sounds rude.
- It’s all in your mind.

59
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,758
No, no, she’s quite right. It is rude.

60
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:00,839
And I speak as one
who’s being PV'd at the moment.

61
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,919
<i>- It’s routine.
- Known as the quinquennial review.</i>

62
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,682
Yeah, we are PV'd by IOs, Tiffany.

63
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,203
An IO is not, as you may think,
an intelligence officer,

64
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,882
<i>still less an intelligent officer,
he is an investigating officer.</i>

65
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:19,438
If something dodgy happens, like someone
with the same name turns up at a peace rally,

66
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,963
then our case is referred to an HEOPVA,

67
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:26,676
who is, in his glory,
a Higher Executive Officer Positive Vetting...

68
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,282
- You’re drunk!
...Assessor. How dare you say I'm drunk?

69
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,646
Should you be talking like this?
I mean, the Official Secrets Act and all that.

70
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:39,086
No, no. You’re quite right, Dad.

71
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:44,639
We shouldn’t. It is, after all, a method devised
to let people like Dodgson get away with it.

72
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:48,322
- That’s not fair. Dodgson was clever.
- This isn’t the Soviet Union.

73
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,398
A timely reminder.

74
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:56,962
<i>- Right.
- Oh, look. Isn’t Tiger beautiful?</i>

75
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,197
<i>- Tiger?
- Beautiful?</i>

76
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,006
You know that cat? He’s abnormal.

77
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:05,557
He gets himself right down there
and he can’t get back up again.

78
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:10,084
Then he howls, and who do you think has to
get up at four in the morning to let him in?

79
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,158
Me.

80
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,200
Come on. Come here, you little monster.

81
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:19,040
Yes. Look at you.

82
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:22,244
I sometimes think
if I could assemble a cat-like ladder

83
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,205
then he could make his own way back.

84
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:27,846
It’s nearly 30 feet.

85
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:32,478
I’m going to phone for a taxi
to take me to the station.

86
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,718
- We ought to wash up lunch.
- OK.

87
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:39,277
<i>- You, too, Mark.
- Bossy cow.</i>

88
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,357
- Bob?
- Mm?

89
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,802
I told Allen.

90
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:53,766
- How did he take it?
- Terrible.

91
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,838
Bob, hold me.

92
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,396
Make it in about an hour, could you?

93
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:05,126
Fine. Thank you.

94
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:32,486
<i>... second thoughts?
- No, of course not.</i>

95
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,764
I just wish we didn’t have to
hurt anyone else.

96
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,364
Bob.

97
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:49,679
- Do you fancy a walk?
- Um, yeah, sure.

98
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,122
And then again, no.

99
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:56,246
No, I... I want to have a word with you,
so let’s go.

100
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,798
Oh...

101
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,526
I’m so clumsy. It’s bloody ridiculous.

102
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,121
You intend to chuck the job. That’s it, isn’t it?

103
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,721
- Yeah.
- Why?

104
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:13,595
- Well, it’s a bit complicated.
- Yes, I thought it would be.

105
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:17,885
Don’t be so aggressive, Dad.
It’s not very helpful.

106
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:21,277
In an odd way,
this Dodgson business focused how I feel.

107
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,165
I wondered if you knew him
when I read about the trial.

108
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:27,842
There are 7,000 of us working at GCHQ.

109
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,839
It’s an industry. Ordinary.

110
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:34,636
Accepted.
I didn’t even know Dodgson by sight.

111
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:41,446
The net result is the business of informing on
one another has now become respectable.

112
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,839
All of us are encouraged to report anything
that strikes us odd about colleagues.

113
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:50,682
Can you imagine what it’s like
to be at the mercy of a secret report

114
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:54,760
from someone you’re living with
or working with?

115
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:58,157
Is that what’s happening, Bob?
Someone informed on you?

116
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,522
- You’re being asked to resign?
- No way.

117
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:03,167
I’m not being judged. It’s the other way round.

118
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:07,160
<i>The security people
had egg all over their faces-</i>

119
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,238
<i>Ten years he got away with it-</i>

120
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,763
<i>And then there are the lies-
They start the very first day-</i>

121
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,601
<i>Nobody's what they seem-
Nothing is what it's made out to be-</i>

122
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,997
And you never realise till later,
years later in my case,

123
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,681
that from the very first day,
the truth recedes.

124
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,680
- Don’t forget, what they do is necessary.
- That’s a fatal argument, Dad.

125
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,440
It’s common sense.
You need a posting or a holiday.

126
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,439
Take one, but don’t throw away
six years of seniority.

127
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,836
- God, there’s more to life...
- Listen to me.

128
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,999
When I came out after 12 years,
it was no joke making a living

129
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:42,444
and it’s taken me over 20 years since then
to find my way, and it’s still very dodgy.

130
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,486
Cleverer men than me go bankrupt every day.
Times are bad and getting worse.

131
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:50,355
Let’s face it, you’re not a computer man
or an engineer or a doctor.

132
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:53,007
You’re a linguist. Who needs them?

133
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:57,319
- Are we going to have an argument?
- I shouldn’t be surprised.

134
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,762
- Tea?
- All right.

135
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:10,357
- Go ahead. Knock on the door.
- OK.

136
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,837
<i>- Ta-da! Surprise.
- Oh!</i>

137
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:21,203
<i>- Ta-da! Happy birthday!
- That’s really kind.</i>

138
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,041
We couldn’t do the honours
with the cake without you.

139
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,687
Right. Look at that.

140
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,997
- Shall I blow them out?
- Mm-hm.

141
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,476
One, two, three.

142
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,365
- Don’t forget to wish.
- No, I won’t.

143
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,836
<i>- Is everything all right?
- Yes.</i>

144
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,806
Your room, Bob,
is even more of a tip than mine.

145
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:46,244
- Would you like us to tidy it?
- No. Not at any price.

146
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,761
I'd never find anything, would I? Hm?

147
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,645
- It may look a bit chaotic, but...
- It surely does.

148
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:55,515
- Basically, it’s very clean.
- And it is his room.

149
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,799
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...

150
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,197
Well, I’m going to watch television
with Mark and Rose.

151
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,403
All right. Will that be OK?

152
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,842
Yeah. Here, look, um...

153
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:12,283
- Bribe them.
- Yes. See you later.

154
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,641
- Bye.
- Bye.

155
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,958
Sit down, Dad.

156
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:28,003
- Is it all right?
- Very nice.

157
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,197
Here we are. A cup of tea.

158
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,598
Thank you.

159
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:42,078
Listen, it seems to me
that underneath ordinary life...

160
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,443
God, it’s so hard to put this clearly.

161
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,405
Underneath the commonplace -

162
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:54,963
buses in the street, newspapers,
cricket scores, paying the bloody mortgage -

163
00:15:55,047 --> 00:16:01,077
underneath all of that,
there is another, an entirely secret world.

164
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,997
Now, the people who run it,
thousands of them,

165
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:09,079
appear to live in the light, but they don’t.

166
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,362
And I don’t.

167
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:16,396
You see, every day, or nearly every day,
I go to this place to translate surprising,

168
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:20,799
sometimes terrifying,
and occasionally appalling things.

169
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:27,677
Look, you know how much
I love the Russian language.

170
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,598
And their literature.

171
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,201
Yes, I do.

172
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:38,840
Pushkin, for example, killed in a duel
provoked by his unfaithful wife.

173
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:43,284
Tolstoy, stinking rich and all that guilt.

174
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,916
Dostoevsky missing the firing squad,

175
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,919
gambling like a maniac.

176
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,079
Chekhov, Stanislavsky. You know?

177
00:16:56,167 --> 00:17:02,276
You see, I have a... a world inside my head,

178
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:08,681
a perspective of Russian life to set against
interminable telephone conversations from...

179
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,718
party officials.

180
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:18,646
You listen to telephone conversations
with Russian party officials?

181
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,877
Yeah. Out of the Kremlin, even.

182
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:26,363
<i>I don't care whether professional sceptics,
the hard-boiled boys who run the world,</i>

183
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:30,838
<i>talk casually of the Bolshoi Ballet
being a cultural weapon, which it is,</i>

184
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,487
<i>and feel nothing as they say it-</i>

185
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:37,242
I feel something. It hurts me personally.

186
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:43,367
<i>If the Bolshoi comes,
if I watch and listen to Romeo and Juliet,</i>

187
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:46,996
I mean, the joy of it
is poisoned by the certainty

188
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:50,875
that the KGB man
is sitting in the bloody prompt corner.

189
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:56,844
Their secret world
has put out the light of the ordinary world.

190
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,200
All the more reason
to stick at what you’re doing.

191
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,164
No.

192
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,239
I believe, with all my heart,

193
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:10,796
that our secret world
is on exactly the same tack as theirs.

194
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,361
Enough. Self-righteous little prick.

195
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:18,677
Our best advice is that he’s not a serious risk.

196
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,486
But naturally, we'll keep him covered.

197
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,959
<i>Bother, he’s not back yet.</i>

198
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,198
You go in, darling, and I’ll put the car away.

199
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,842
God! God, Allen! No!

200
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,357
It’s Dodgson, sir.
The duty officer didn’t like the look of him.

201
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,756
He says there’s hardly any pulse.

202
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,158
Call Hammersmith Hospital.

203
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,126
- Ambulance?
- No, car. Quick, we could lose the bugger.

204
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:57,446
<i>- Fool!</i>

205
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:32,446
<i>- It’s all right. Shh. It'll be all right.</i>

206
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:37,885
Shh. Listen to me. L"II deal with the police.
You go and look after Tiffany.

207
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,083
It’ll be all right. Go on.

208
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:28,765
Now, either I’m mad,

209
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:33,716
or somebody killed Allen
and faked it to look like suicide.

210
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,402
- Why on earth should they do that?
- Well, he knew Dodgson, right?

211
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:42,560
Just suppose Allen
was mixed up in what he was doing.

212
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,480
Hm? The last thing security want
is another scandal.

213
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,400
You don’t seriously think
they’d go to those lengths?

214
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:51,524
I don’t know. I don’t even know who to ask.

215
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,802
I thought you might have a bright idea.

216
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,959
Not off the top of my head. I mean...

217
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,285
- Let me think about it.
- Fancy a beer?

218
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:06,885
Thanks. There’s a panic on to calculate
the track of this new Russian spacemongery.

219
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,686
- Well, some other time, then.
- Sure.

220
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:36,201
<i>Good morning, good morning.</i>

221
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,676
You have slept like a hero.

222
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,804
The woman will make you
the bacon and eggs now.

223
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:45,800
Is it morning, Alex? It is Alex, isn’t it?

224
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:48,720
Correct. Ah, you remember my name.

225
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:53,198
Yes, it is morning.
To tell you the truth, it is afternoon.

226
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:58,122
There’s something...
familiar about this place.

227
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,246
It was here that you met your controller
when he came over in "83.

228
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,318
- That’s right.
- Do you remember?

229
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:07,240
We smuggled you in
in the bottom of the school bus.

230
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:11,605
Russian territory in England.
That appeals to me.

231
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,082
It is amusing, yes?

232
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:20,400
But you must,
on no account, touch the curtains.

233
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:22,955
Outside, the British are like crazy men

234
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:26,676
trying to find you
before the press learn of your escape.

235
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:31,045
When they do, there will be
the most enormous outcry.

236
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:36,724
We do not believe that the British security
services know you came here before,

237
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:42,439
but we must assume they will have all our
properties under surveillance with cameras.

238
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,597
You must stay low.

239
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,800
This chap tried to recruit me.
I couldn’t tell you before.

240
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:56,763
He used to be a tearaway -
ripping up telephone directories,

241
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,236
taking the tops off bottles with his teeth.

242
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:04,117
I can’t imagine what made him think
I could get into all that. Anyway, he'll see you.

243
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:06,516
I’ve got his address in the car.

244
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:26,397
- Morning. Is my guest here?
- Ah, Mr Greig. Ah, yes, Mr Jones.

245
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:28,682
Yes, he’s just through here.

246
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,081
Frank!

247
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:38,160
Charlie Greig, as I live and breathe.
I couldn’t believe it when you called.

248
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:41,478
- What’s your poison?
- No, no. This is my treat. Pinkers?

249
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:45,037
- What else, Commander?
- Same for me and make them large ones.

250
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:46,606
Let’s sit down over there.

251
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:49,679
- This is a turn-up for the book.
- It’s been a few years.

252
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,678
Mm-hm.

253
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:55,521
The only pilot who enjoyed the rocket takeoff
when the catapult failed.

254
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:57,802
We said we did,
but you meant it, you mad sod.

255
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,276
Well, we were younger in those days.

256
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:05,282
I remember you blowing your commission,
taking a swing at that chief petty officer

257
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,676
cos you thought he was a bully.

258
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, he was, too. CPO Pratt.
Pratt by name and prat by nature.

259
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:18,525
I know, I know. All the same, I couldn’t have
spent my life savings on that kind of gesture.

260
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:21,075
Well, I wasn’t into promotion like you were.

261
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,840
<i>HMS Hawke - white band round your cap.</i>

262
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:27,602
Thank you.
No dipping your biscuits in your tea.

263
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:31,123
It was the only way a pilot
could crash the class barrier.

264
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,643
Yeah, well, as you said,
in those days we were younger.

265
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,879
Thank you.

266
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:47,959
Just when we thought we got civvy street
squared away, Kathy developed this lump.

267
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,756
It wasn’t much to speak of.
Turned out to be cancer.

268
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:55,760
- Dear old boy.
- At least she went quickly.

269
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,281
There didn’t seem to be
much point in going on,

270
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,325
especially as my son
wasn’t interested in the business.

271
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,682
That’s right. Of course, you had a boy.

272
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,804
Yeah, Bob. Apple of his mother’s eye.

273
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:10,118
Mine, too, but you wouldn’t want
to share a cabin with him.

274
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:12,960
- What? Untidy?
- Shambolic.

275
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,117
What’s he doing now?

276
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,119
He’s a Russian-language specialist at GCHQ.

277
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,516
Bright boy, then.

278
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:25,283
A bit too bright for his own good. More brains
than sense, you know what I mean?

279
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:30,680
No, that’s not quite fair, but I went down there
the other day for his birthday

280
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:35,522
and, number one, he’s got himself mixed up
with a married woman with a kid.

281
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:38,724
On top of that,
he’s talking about leaving the job.

282
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:42,436
He’s got it in his head that
what the Russians do in that line of country

283
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:45,200
is not a lot different from what we do.

284
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,676
- Student talk.
- He’s 28.

285
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,965
Well, it’s just the time
for pulling the old man’s beard.

286
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:55,960
I was surprised. I mean, he shouted the odds
from time to time, we all did,

287
00:26:56,047 --> 00:27:00,359
but he went for the quiet life
at the end of the day.

288
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,722
He’d run a mile rather than risk trouble.

289
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:06,197
- Not like you, then?
- No. Takes after his mother, thank God.

290
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:08,278
Well, that’s nice.

291
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:17,525
What about you? Don’t tell me none of those
Wrens managed to drag you to the altar?

292
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,519
You know what they say -
safety in numbers.

293
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:25,283
The last time I heard of you,
you’d joined the cloak-and-dagger brigade.

294
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:27,642
Still at it, are you?

295
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:31,640
Retired. In so far as they ever let you retire.

296
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:36,676
They’ve set me up with a nice little sideline -
vetting firms to make sure they’re kosher,

297
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:40,680
which, not to beat about the bush,
is why I’m here.

298
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:46,841
A little bird told me you’ve been supplying
some fair-sized outlets lately.

299
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,566
Satisfied customers, one and all.

300
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:53,879
Now, there’s a government department -
no names, no pack drill -

301
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:59,564
on the brink of elbowing their quill pens
in favour of word processors.

302
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:03,276
It’s not a contemptible contract, so, um...

303
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:08,236
always provided your beamish boy isn’t
seriously intent on upsetting the apple cart...

304
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:09,601
Thank you.

305
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,277
...it’s yours.

306
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,278
I’m sorry.

307
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:25,399
What?

308
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:28,477
This just feels all wrong.

309
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,917
Well, you wouldn’t let me come to your place.

310
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,396
Would you, Bob?

311
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:44,038
If I’m not under surveillance,
I bloody well should be.

312
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:46,846
- It’s not funny.
- I’m not laughing at you.

313
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,565
No?

314
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:53,038
It’s just the thought of some SAS type
trying to recruit Mark.

315
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:57,244
Yes, it’s a pretty bizarre idea, isn’t it?

316
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,438
- Rose, well...
- Yes, Rose.

317
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:05,236
I can just see her
laying someone out with her handbag.

318
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:14,885
Do you really have to go and see
that man Mark put you on to?

319
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:17,242
Yes, I do.

320
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,682
It’s not just going to go away, you know.

321
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,127
- Hello, Mahroof.
- Hello, sir.

322
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:56,086
- Hello.
- Is it wise to smoke on top of that brandy?

323
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:59,398
- You think I’ve been on the town, right?
- Dead right.

324
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:04,117
In fact, thanks to my service connections
and a willingness to risk liver and lungs,

325
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:06,926
we are in the running
for a government contract.

326
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,520
That’s fantastic, Frank.

327
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,724
Yes, and if we get it right this time,
there’s plenty more.

328
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,718
- Any messages?
- The bank.

329
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:16,367
Oh, on the strength of this,
I can face even them.

330
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:21,202
And Bob called. Could you phone him?
Something about meeting him in Gloucester.

331
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,278
Gloucester?

332
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:30,686
<i>Sorry to drag you all this way, Dad,
but I think I’m close to something</i>

333
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:34,760
that makes my original misgivings
about GCHQ seem like pleasant dreams.

334
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:39,682
To understand, you’ve got to remember what
the American secret world has done for years.

335
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:43,919
I don't just mean
in the way of secret ways and secret codes,

336
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:47,795
but in perjury, bribery, blackmail,

337
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,355
drug trafficking all over the world,

338
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,007
and, yeah, plain old-fashioned murder.

339
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:59,162
I mean, Watergate proved the extent these
people can work against their own people.

340
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:02,956
- That was the end of it.
- No. That just pushed it further underground.

341
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:05,607
We could never have
a Watergate in this country.

342
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:10,522
<i>Our secret world is beyond the norm,
which brings me back to what I was saying-</i>

343
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:16,682
GCHQ Cheltenham is hugely funded by,
and totally integrated with,

344
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,758
the Americans.

345
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:25,126
Now, you don’t believe
we don’t do anything they do, hm?

346
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,925
All right.

347
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:32,205
I don’t know what you know
and I don’t read what you read,

348
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:37,361
but I do know that no one in his right mind
risks a secure job these days.

349
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:41,156
You do have the right to give it up,
so for God’s sake leave it at that.

350
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,238
Resign and walk away.

351
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:48,481
It would be conniving of me to...
to do nothing, knowing what I know now.

352
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:51,400
- Don’t you see?
- No, I don’t. I bloody well don’t.

353
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:57,084
I’m sorry, I didn’t want to get you going.
I just wanted you to know, that’s all.

354
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,517
- Well...
- Yes?

355
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:09,324
- Mind how you go.
- And you.

356
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:13,480
Dad, you know
all my movie heroes were American?

357
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:17,276
Do you remember when we used to be
glued to the telly when I was a kid?

358
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:22,487
We used to watch them go to the moon and
walk on it. Christ, wasn’t that marvelous?

359
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,684
Yeah, well, the world’s changed, that’s all.

360
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:30,477
I still believe the man in the white hat always
wins in the end, and I intend to prove it.

361
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,558
You do, do you?

362
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,605
Yes, sirree.

363
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,319
Bye.

364
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,442
So...

365
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,724
now we see. Please stand up.

366
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,526
It’s wonderful. I can hardly recognise myself.

367
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,882
This calls for a toast.

368
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:20,995
And see, I brought
the comrade colonel something else.

369
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,957
Now, isn’t that something?

370
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,686
Alex.

371
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,403
- Thank you.
- No, no, please. It’s for you to keep.

372
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,803
<i>- To Russia.
- To Russia.</i>

373
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:53,279
I wish the comrade colonel
a pleasant journey.

374
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:57,840
- Thank you for all your help.
- L"II see our friend safely off the premises.

375
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:00,202
Don’t drink all the vodka before I get back.

376
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,562
<i>Trust me.</i>

377
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,396
<i>Let’s look before we leap.</i>

378
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:13,803
All clear.

379
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,838
- You see, you can’t fault our security.
- Safe journey.

380
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:40,076
<i>- 0331 -
- May I speak to Sir Adrian Chapple, please?</i>

381
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,316
<i>Speaking-</i>

382
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:45,002
Château Direct here.
Sorry for being so long in getting back to you.

383
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:50,719
It appears your order was detained in bond,
but I’m assured it'll be released very shortly.

384
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:53,446
Thank you for letting me know.

385
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:55,798
This way, please, sir.

386
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:27,882
One of my better productions.

387
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:35,679
- They made a wonderful job of the furniture.
- They did indeed, Flecker. Well, well.

388
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,523
Incidentally, what’s happening
to Dodgson’s prison contact?

389
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:44,360
The one who passed him the pills and so on?

390
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:47,519
He’s having ten years off his sentence

391
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:51,600
and then we’re sending him
to Northern Ireland.

392
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:55,362
You do take away with one hand
what you give with the other.

393
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,438
Coming from you?

394
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:08,277
<i>I don’t think
you should find that displeasing.</i>

395
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,040
Good God. Chapple?

396
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:16,042
We'll never hear the end of it if the Americans
find that out. Well done. Excellent.

397
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:21,042
He was a very good subject. It helped he’d
been to the flat to see his controller before.

398
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:23,322
- Is it all on video?
- Of course.

399
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,478
- How good of you to come.
- How good of you to ask me down.

400
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,445
First thing first, you like this, I believe?

401
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:08,518
- Quite right.
- Water? Ice?

402
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,758
- Just as it comes.
- Spoken like a Scotsman.

403
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,645
- There we are.
- Your good health.

404
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:20,084
My dear fellow. Well, rather different
from the last time you were down here.

405
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,237
Very.

406
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,795
It’s as well the Irish are besotted by racing.

407
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:27,321
Bomb here and the country
would grind to a halt.

408
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,046
- A sobering thought.
- Come and mingle.

409
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:34,277
Sorry.

410
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,676
I agree with your solution, by the way.

411
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:42,964
It avoids the courts on the one hand
and on the other...

412
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,756
Quite. It used to be thought,
and I was inclined to agree,

413
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:50,123
that such mistakes were forgivable

414
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:55,076
because, unlike the enemy,
we err on the side of decency and trust.

415
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,727
When we pry, we do so blunderingly

416
00:39:57,807 --> 00:40:02,323
and even our most hardened snoopers
are given to thoughts of fair play.

417
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,921
However, that’s in the past.

418
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:12,283
With regard to Chapple, there have been talks
with the attorney general and he has agreed.

419
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:18,078
But since Blunt, those sort of people,
senior people, have been very, very cagey.

420
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,284
They don’t want old age ruined
by a journalist writing a book

421
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:25,076
or some prime minister making a statement
so they’re publicly blown,

422
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,158
lose their cane, all that.

423
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,398
- Of course.
- I mean, one can understand it.

424
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:33,479
When it comes to Chapple,
we are not dealing with a grocer.

425
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:36,206
Immunity should mean immunity,
wouldn’t you say?

426
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,883
- Oh, absolutely.
- Let’s go down and see the parade.

427
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:51,245
My view is that we let him get on with it until
we find out how much damage he has done

428
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:55,639
and have him dead to rights,
which we do not at the moment, legally.

429
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:59,766
Then we turf out his Soviet contacts
and give him the choice.

430
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:02,805
Now, as for the other fellow,
he’s in the grocer class.

431
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,878
I propose we leave him to Flecker.

432
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,401
Flecker has a very creative bent.

433
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:12,241
It really is useful having the two of them
in our sights at the same time.

434
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:14,887
I think we have a knack for this sort of thing.

435
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,958
In the matter of Jones...

436
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:20,005
Yes, I understand your man
failed to read him right.

437
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:24,683
It would seem so. Although had the good
friends been less precipitative or more deaf...

438
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:26,644
Speculation.

439
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:30,720
The matter is,
if that young man blows the whistle on it,

440
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:34,561
this entire operation will have been
much worse than pointless.

441
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:36,797
I hear you.

442
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:40,800
I’m looking to you
to preserve the special relationship.

443
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,286
Or what’s left of it.

444
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:46,155
<i>Sir Adrian Chapple
will be presenting the owner and trainer</i>

445
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:49,637
<i>of Sea Captain with a trophy,</i>

446
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:55,836
<i>and a special trophy will be presented to
the winning jockey in the winners' enclosure-</i>

447
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:11,280
- Mr Jones?
- Yes?

448
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,837
Can I have a word with you a moment, sir?

449
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:18,283
- Yes. Who are you?
- I’m a police officer.

450
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,006
I’ve got a bit of bad news.

451
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,885
- What?
- It’s about your son, sir.

452
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,398
It seems he fell off a roof.

453
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:31,320
It’s very bad news, I’m afraid, sir.

454
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:32,206
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

455
00:43:32,287 --> 00:43:34,517
Is he your son?

456
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:37,246
You formally identify him
as Robert Arthur Jones?

457
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,318
- Yes.
- Thank you.

458
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,962
This has all your son’s gear in it.

459
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,677
- It’s very light.
- It’s all he had on him. It’s been examined.

460
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,281
He was dressed. The bed wasn’t slept in.

461
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:20,440
Did you see him often?

462
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,404
Sir?

463
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:26,162
- His bed wasn’t slept in, you say?
- Correct.

464
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:30,479
- How do you know?
- Well, from the scene-of-crime officer.

465
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,526
Who let him in? The first thing I was told
by your Inspector Brown...

466
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:37,758
- Bourne.
- Inspector Bourne.

467
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:40,122
...on the phone this morning

468
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:46,396
was that Bob was alone in house
over the weekend. The other two were away.

469
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:52,835
My colleagues borrowed a ladder, went
onto the roof and into the house that way.

470
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:58,320
I suppose these are cheaper
than a cardboard box or something decent?

471
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:01,080
It’s all there, sir. If you’d just sign for it.

472
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,158
Where do I sign?

473
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:40,284
- Mr Jones?
- Yes?

474
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,437
Bill Pickett.

475
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:47,799
I had an appointment to talk to your son.
I’m very sorry to hear what happened.

476
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:49,684
- Who are you?
- A journalist.

477
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:53,123
I don’t want to talk. Which paper?

478
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,005
<i>A weekly. The Senator.
Bob may have mentioned me.</i>

479
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,600
No.

480
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:01,043
- Who did you say you are?
- Bill Pickett.

481
00:46:01,127 --> 00:46:02,845
<i>- The Senator?.
- That’s right.</i>

482
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,918
Prove it.

483
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:13,477
Well, what did he want to talk to you about?

484
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,762
- Bob?
- Yeah, Bob.

485
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:20,045
- I don’t really know.
- Don’t fuck about with me! He’s dead!

486
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,002
- You’re a lefty, aren't you?
- What else?

487
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:35,443
You want to stir up the Dodgson business.
That’s it, isn’t it?

488
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,643
Now Bob’s dead, you want to use him.

489
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:41,242
I don’t need to use him to do that,
I assure you.

490
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:44,763
- How did he get in touch with you?
- He telephoned me.

491
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,441
I checked up on him and called him back.

492
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:49,199
What?

493
00:46:49,287 --> 00:46:52,802
You don’t take it on trust
when someone you’ve never heard of phones

494
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:56,004
and says they work at GCHQ
and they want to talk.

495
00:46:56,087 --> 00:47:00,399
I mean, there are laws, and things have been
very jumpy since brother Dodgson.

496
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,797
- When was this?
- Last week.

497
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,675
So why the delay?
I mean, in you two getting together?

498
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,759
Bob said what he wanted to discuss
involved someone else.

499
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,396
The other person didn’t want to talk to me.
He hoped to persuade him.

500
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:18,275
- That’s the lot.
- No, it isn’t. Why the appointment today?

501
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,404
He said he’d be in touch
with the other person this weekend.

502
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:24,399
- In touch?
- Yeah.

503
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:27,285
I brought this to discuss with him.

504
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,358
Look...

505
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:34,043
I’ll give you my telephone number.
You might want to call me.

506
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:36,197
Not on your life.

507
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:40,358
- Who told you he was dead?
- That one.

508
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,717
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Bob?</i>

509
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:44,038
<i>- No, this is his father.
- Oh, yes, Mr Jones- We've met-</i>

510
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:47,005
<i>This is Cynthia Goodburn- Is Bob there?</i>

511
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:50,124
<i>- Uh, no.
- OK, I'll call back- When do you think... - ?</i>

512
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:53,358
Uh... He’s dead.

513
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:54,880
<i>What?</i>

514
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:58,403
<i>- It was an accident.
- Oh, my God!</i>

515
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:01,957
<i>Oh, my God! Poor Bob!
Oh, God-</i>

516
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:04,277
<i>- Mrs Goodburn.
- Oh, my God! Not Bob!</i>

517
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:07,598
<i>- Cynthia.
- Oh, God-</i>

518
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:24,437
<i>- Mr Jones? I saw you arrive.</i>

519
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:27,246
I thought you might like some tea.

520
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,241
- I’d like to thank you, Rose.
- Why?

521
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:48,637
- For clearing the place up.
- I didn’t. What makes you think...?

522
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:51,287
Someone did.

523
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,801
- Mr Jones. Mr Jones.
- Perhaps Mark?

524
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,878
- You were in the navy.
- Yes.

525
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,403
- So you'll understand about orders.
- Oh, yes.

526
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:06,926
I’m a section leader, and I have to say this
now and then we’ll all know where we stand.

527
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:08,676
Oh.

528
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:13,397
You must be very shocked. Believe me,
it hasn’t been easy at my end, either.

529
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:16,797
- In what way?
- I can’t discuss that.

530
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:18,878
So...

531
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,959
what I have to say is this.

532
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,322
We have orders, Mark and I,

533
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,046
not to discuss Bob’s...

534
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:30,243
What happened.

535
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,158
- Orders?
- Yes.

536
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:36,160
Particularly with relation to the press,
but with everyone, really.

537
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:39,876
So if we can just observe that, Mr Jones.

538
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:42,117
Even relatives?

539
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:45,958
You can’t talk to a father about his dead son?

540
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:52,160
You can’t say anything,
even though it might be comforting?

541
00:50:53,527 --> 00:50:57,076
Do you know what I find difficult, Rose?

542
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:01,126
Is why it is against the national interest

543
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:04,563
for the press to print
that you and Mark liked him,

544
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:09,846
and that, although he tended to have
two left feet and fall over the cat,

545
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:13,283
he was a decent person with a good heart.

546
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,403
That’s not absolutely fair.

547
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:19,480
You’re perfectly aware of the way
the press twist things and make them up.

548
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:23,276
- We have our jobs and our futures, too.
- Yes. Yes, I know.

549
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:27,356
I can see you’re really going to miss him.

550
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,563
How dare you say that?

551
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:33,080
I’m sleeping here tonight. This is Bob’s room.

552
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:38,605
You can put a notice on his food cupboard
and a label on his towel in the bathroom.

553
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:10,163
Dozy bugger. You nearly had me over.

554
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,959
Is that what happened?
You got under his feet?

555
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:19,198
No. You were down there.

556
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:47,362
- Apparently, he fell off the roof in the dark.
- I don’t understand.

557
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:50,245
What was he doing out there?

558
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:55,242
Rescuing the cat. At least that’s what
everybody seems to want me to believe.

559
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:58,125
Either that or he committed suicide.

560
00:55:01,727 --> 00:55:03,718
Bob, too?

561
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:13,756
You must feel pretty bruised,
one way and another.

562
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,437
I thought you didn’t like me.

563
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:25,283
I just thought you were bad news for Bob.
I mean, married with a kid and everything.

564
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:29,279
None of that seems to matter much now.

565
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,358
We’ve both lost him.

566
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:35,436
Not that I’m not prejudiced, you understand.

567
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:40,726
It’s just that my prejudices
don’t always seem to stand up to actuality.

568
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:44,767
- That’s what Bob said.
- He did?

569
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:47,077
Actually, what he said was

570
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:52,161
that you weren’t really the old
stick in the mud you made yourself out to be.

571
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,238
That sounds like Bob.

572
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:59,796
Is there something wrong
with your telephone?

573
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:02,276
No, I don’t think so.

574
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:07,599
"They have put out the lights
in the ordinary world."

575
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:09,803
What?

576
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:13,799
It was something Bob said.

577
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:22,478
- Mr Jones?
- Yes, very good of you to see me.

578
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:25,764
What’s the trouble
that the coroner couldn’t deal with?

579
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:31,080
Just to clear my mind,
I'd be very grateful if you would tell me...

580
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:36,560
I’d be grateful if you could tell me whether
your officer took away anything as evidence?

581
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,717
Is something missing? Is that it?

582
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:41,401
- Yes, I think so.
- You think so.

583
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:44,763
I think my son’s diaries
for this year and last year,

584
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:48,123
some letters written to him
and some books are missing.

585
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:53,361
Presumably, because you knew they were
in the room on Sunday last? You’re definite?

586
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:57,156
No, Inspector. Was anything taken away?

587
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,603
Nothing was removed from the premises
to my knowledge.

588
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:03,838
I find it a bit difficult to sink in.

589
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:07,566
Your men went through the house?

590
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:09,638
Yes.

591
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:14,482
None of the beds had been slept in and there
was no evidence of anyone having broken in?

592
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:18,162
- Correct.
- Which leaves the security people.

593
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,478
- What security people?
- GCHQ, of course.

594
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,762
You must’ve been in contact with them.

595
00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:28,398
- What we do is our business, Mr Jones.
- L"II remember that for the interview.

596
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:34,241
- What interview?
- The BBC phoned me.

597
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,636
Right.

598
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:39,287
We informed your son’s place of work.

599
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:42,996
A sergeant interviewed
some of his colleagues.

600
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:47,558
We received full cooperation
and there was nothing unusual to report.

601
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:50,480
I hope that puts your mind at rest.

602
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,082
- How did he die?
- Well, that’s for the coroner to decide, sir.

603
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:58,046
How do you think he died
based on reports you received?

604
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:03,607
It was almost certainly an accident.

605
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:07,042
But it could have been a suicide.

606
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:10,481
There’s no evidence either way. No witnesses.

607
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:14,162
There’s me. Bob was the last person
in the world to commit suicide.

608
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:18,525
- Oh, people do it every day.
- Your men took away nothing?

609
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:22,202
So there was no note and no letter?

610
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:27,839
If my son had committed suicide,
he would have said why.

611
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:31,044
- And there was the state of his room.
- What do you mean?

612
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:33,402
Tidy, really squared away.

613
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:36,602
Someone else did that. Not Bob - never.

614
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:40,282
With respect, sir,
you’ve been watching too much television.

615
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,562
I’m sorry I’m late.

616
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:53,799
<i>What do you think of this wine, eh?</i>

617
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:07,157
- Thanks for coming.
- How was it?

618
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:11,843
Infuriating. The inspector
was too condescending by half.

619
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:16,478
And there was another bloke there -
plain clothes. Never opened his mouth.

620
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,320
I’ve asked Bill Pickett to join us.

621
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:24,322
You could see I was trying to get in there.

622
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:26,523
Oh, tough titty.

623
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:29,279
All I know is that since Dodgson,

624
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:33,155
there have been three sudden deaths
at GCHQ Cheltenham in as many months.

625
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:37,399
The last thing I want to find out is that
our security services had a hand in them.

626
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:39,478
Why should they?

627
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:43,958
Do you know what was the most
surprising thing about the CIA revelations?

628
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,038
Their paranoia.

629
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:49,164
People who spy and tell lies
are like mental patients.

630
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:53,525
It’s a form of flight from reality.
They’re not answerable and they know it.

631
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:56,201
There’s no reason for them not to overreact.

632
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,596
And it won’t do.

633
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:02,885
They’re completely incapable of
distinguishing between dissent and treason.

634
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:08,200
As far as they’re concerned, anyone
who rocks the boat is a threat. To what?

635
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:11,563
Their idea of good order.

636
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:15,196
All right. The point is,
what are we going to do?

637
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:18,165
Bob didn’t tell you the name of the man
Mark put him onto?

638
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:23,526
He said, uh, what I didn’t know
wouldn’t hurt me or Tiffany.

639
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,519
Yeah, but he went down
to see this Mr X at East Grinstead

640
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:30,679
the weekend before he called me.

641
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:32,598
And came back absolutely certain

642
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:36,999
that our side wouldn’t have thought twice
about murdering Allen if it had suited them.

643
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:42,445
Presumably that’s what he hoped to
persuade this character to confirm to me,

644
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:46,281
at which point... Bob falls off a roof.

645
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:49,677
When he was conveniently
alone in the house.

646
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:52,406
Well, I’d better get on and find this Mr X.

647
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:57,277
There can’t be that many dirty-tricks men
living in retirement in East Grinstead.

648
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,564
Although on second thoughts...
I’ll be in touch.

649
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:04,640
- Pickett, I want the truth.
- Don’t we all?

650
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:09,801
I am not interested in making political capital
out of the death of my son.

651
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:14,881
If this story holds up,
you might not be able to avoid it.

652
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:18,596
In fact, with a bit of luck,
it might bring down the government.

653
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:20,279
See you.

654
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:24,040
I’m not out to change the system.

655
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:27,324
No, but we need someone
with that kind of commitment.

656
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:32,037
If we’re right,
what happened to Bob and Allen and us

657
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:35,244
doesn't affect 98% of the population,

658
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:39,206
but it could hit any one of them
like a car crash.

659
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:41,926
The least we can do is tell them the odds.

660
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:46,801
<i>Let’s just stay with the facts.</i>

661
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:51,278
The people who live there, the police,
the security services, all agree

662
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:57,636
that there was no suspicion of anything
except an accident or suicide.

663
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,763
- Not suicide.
- OK.

664
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:02,680
You say that’s out of character.
You should know.

665
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:05,804
In which case, pace the coroner,

666
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:10,438
the verdict has got to be a tragic accident.

667
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,962
But one -just one -

668
01:02:14,047 --> 01:02:19,280
not very distinguished
politically motivated journalist is in there

669
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:22,325
trying to whoop it up
into another GCHQ scandal.

670
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,398
And what do you do? You cry murder.

671
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:26,557
There was his room.

672
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:31,242
For God’s sake, couldn’t your son
have decided to clean up his own room

673
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:33,841
just once in 28 years?

674
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:37,716
You may be right.

675
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:41,366
There’s no "maybe" about it.

676
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:46,997
Look, I’m going to be based in your friendly
neighbourhood Sheraton Hotel for a bit,

677
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:50,238
so if you feel like drowning your sorrows,
give me a bell.

678
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:52,238
Right.

679
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:53,885
Take it easy.

680
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:05,157
If you tell the majority of people that a bloke
was about to breach our security service,

681
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:10,162
but he fell off a roof and was killed, they’d
say, ‘serves him right. What do you expect?"

682
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:13,637
And so would I, because up until now
I was part of that majority.

683
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:17,242
I would have said you don’t sign on for that
and then break your word.

684
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,318
- And now?
- I don’t know.

685
01:03:19,407 --> 01:03:24,845
I don’t have any powerful friends. I can’t go to
my lawyer or my MP. The verdict’s already in.

686
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,920
The only way of telling ordinary people
is to go over the heads of that lot.

687
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:32,966
And that, God help me,
puts me in bed with a bastard like Bill Pickett.

688
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:42,676
<i>- Hello?
- It's Bill Pickett- Is Frank there?</i>

689
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:46,442
<i>- Yes.
- We've found our man-</i>

690
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,325
Frank, it’s Bill for you.

691
01:03:49,407 --> 01:03:51,637
He’s found Mr X.

692
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,125
<i>He wouldn't
give me the name over the phone,</i>

693
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:02,565
<i>but we were to meet him
at the junction of the A4 and the A217-</i>

694
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:36,355
Shit!

695
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:47,204
No!

696
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:07,997
You might as well take your time, lads.

697
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,760
<i>Move along, please, sir.</i>

698
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:18,759
<i>For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy</i>

699
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,363
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear brother, Robert Jones...

700
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:28,801
We therefore commit his body to the ground.

701
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,117
Earth to earth,

702
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:32,799
ashes to ashes,

703
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,764
dust to dust.

704
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:39,796
In sure and certain hope of resurrection to
eternal life through Our Lord, Jesus Christ,

705
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:45,519
who shall change our vile body
that it may be like unto his glorious body,

706
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:47,837
according to the mighty working

707
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:53,285
whereby he is able
to subdue all things to himself.

708
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:29,079
I never understood about revolutionaries.

709
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:32,638
I do now.

710
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:36,526
But I don’t have the stomach for it.

711
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:45,003
I don’t know what else I can do, Bob.

712
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:52,915
And that’s the truth.

713
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:14,522
- I was relieved about the verdict, Mr Jones.
- Oh?

714
01:07:14,607 --> 01:07:16,677
I, um...

715
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:22,637
Sorry to be conspiratorial. There’s nothing to
be conspiratorial about, but since Dodgson...

716
01:07:22,727 --> 01:07:28,916
Look, we were all told to do it after him.
They said it helped keep people on the rails.

717
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:34,365
And in my position... When they PV’d me,
I kept something back, so when Bob...

718
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:38,042
I told them he’d been asking questions
about Goodburn’s suicide.

719
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,597
Well, you can’t blame yourself
for telling the truth.

720
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:44,804
No. No, of course not. I just...

721
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:50,765
Look, there’s been a terrible atmosphere
at work and every kind of rumour.

722
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:53,315
I can’t imagine how bad it must be for you.

723
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:56,240
I just wanted to get it off my chest
that I’m very sorry.

724
01:07:56,327 --> 01:08:01,481
Don’t worry about it. I know you were
Bob’s friend and wouldn’t let him down.

725
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:05,355
I wouldn’t let them bring in
a verdict of suicide, anyway.

726
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:10,157
- I can’t tell you what a relief it is.
- You see, I think he was murdered.

727
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,524
Oh, Christ.

728
01:08:13,607 --> 01:08:16,201
No, that’s impossible. I didn’t mean to...

729
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:20,041
- Look, I’d better go.
- Yes, go and tell them what I think.

730
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:23,199
No, I’d never do that,
but I don’t believe Bob was murdered.

731
01:08:23,287 --> 01:08:26,882
Oh, yes, you do. You believed it when I said it.

732
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:29,606
You felt it like I did.

733
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:31,757
Why do you feel like that, Mark?

734
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:34,359
Bob was...

735
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:36,438
like Dostoevsky’s idiot -

736
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:39,280
no help to anybody.

737
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:45,044
All the same, I loved him. I’m not gay,
but I loved him because he had this quality.

738
01:08:46,607 --> 01:08:50,646
I don’t know why I betrayed him. The quality
he had was to show you what you are.

739
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:55,596
I don’t know.
If it was, I’m a sort of natural Judas.

740
01:08:56,887 --> 01:08:59,162
I did it in a dream, almost.

741
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:04,322
I never meant to, right up to the moment
I knocked on the HEO’s door.

742
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:07,319
The same as now -
I never meant to betray them to you.

743
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:10,956
You sent him to see someone, we know that.
Who was it?

744
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:15,717
- I can’t say it. I can’t say it to you.
- You fucking fruitcake!

745
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:18,560
Who did you send him to? Eh?

746
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:20,524
Greig.

747
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:24,524
Greig?

748
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:29,437
They told you to send him to Charlie Greig?

749
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:32,405
They said he was a friend of the family.

750
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:22,397
Come in, come in.

751
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:25,716
Get an eyeful, huh?

752
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:30,879
Thank God for the old expense account.
Where would we be without it?

753
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:33,720
- Where indeed.
- Take your coat off.

754
01:10:33,807 --> 01:10:36,082
Sit down. What'll it be?

755
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:38,522
Vodka with anything, really. Tonic.

756
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:40,404
Right.

757
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:43,718
Well, it’s not the real thing,

758
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,525
so, um...

759
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:48,838
we don’t have to be too frugal, do we?

760
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,558
- Are you all right?
- I’m fine.

761
01:10:56,047 --> 01:11:00,165
Remember that time
the old man went bananas?

762
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:03,796
He came onto the main deck,
he said to the marine corporal...

763
01:11:03,887 --> 01:11:09,120
I was there. He said to the marine corporal,
"Get that horse out of my cabin."

764
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:13,643
Marvellous.
He was a two-bottle-a-day man, he was.

765
01:11:15,607 --> 01:11:18,075
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

766
01:11:21,567 --> 01:11:25,116
Nobody remembers
any of that, do they? Korea.

767
01:11:25,207 --> 01:11:29,883
By God. If we’d had the same publicity
they gave the Falklands, eh?

768
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:33,004
All those smartarses saying it wouldn’t work,

769
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:35,999
then when it did,
saying it shouldn’t have happened.

770
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:42,720
I mean, there we were in Korea
flying piston-engined aircraft against MiGs.

771
01:11:42,807 --> 01:11:45,605
How many pilots did we lose
in those two years, eh?

772
01:11:45,687 --> 01:11:47,996
And that was just us.

773
01:11:49,647 --> 01:11:53,117
- We did it, though.
- Yes, we did, didn’t we?

774
01:11:57,367 --> 01:12:04,079
You were the best Carmen Miranda
I ever saw.

775
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:07,921
And you were the best pilot I ever met.

776
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:09,235
No.

777
01:12:09,327 --> 01:12:14,321
"Fixed wing", as they say now,
but definitely a natural.

778
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,763
So, cheers, old boy.

779
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:19,838
Cheers.

780
01:12:24,447 --> 01:12:27,678
It’s bite-on-a-bullet time.

781
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:31,919
I’m finally beginning to get myself
sorted out about old Bob.

782
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:36,602
I’ve been a bit of a bore about it,
I know, but...

783
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:38,996
I really miss the silly bugger.

784
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:41,840
Of course you do.

785
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:45,237
Oh.

786
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,761
Time to pump ship.

787
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,202
The old bladder’s beginning to shrink.

788
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:52,847
You want to watch that - that’s the first sign.

789
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:57,560
Hold hard!

790
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:10,236
I can’t get over you
doing the old James Bond.

791
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:13,922
I should be so lucky. No birds,

792
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:17,441
nothing stirred and not much shaken.

793
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:22,435
Ooh, God. It’s... it’s my turn now.

794
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:24,245
Oh! Oh!

795
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:27,842
Oh, God! Oh!

796
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:29,804
Oh!

797
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:32,037
Oh! Oh-ho!

798
01:13:32,127 --> 01:13:33,799
Oh, the relief!

799
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:41,001
Did you... did you hear the one
about the blind man out for a walk?

800
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:44,284
The guide dog cocks its leg all over him

801
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:49,236
and the blind man stops
and fishes out a dog biscuit.

802
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:52,558
He’s just about to offer it
to the faithless hound

803
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:55,764
when this Barbara Woodhouse character
dashes across...

804
01:13:55,847 --> 01:14:00,363
<i>"Look here," she says,
"you can’t reward the animal for doing that!"</i>

805
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:04,281
"Reward it?" the man says. "Reward it?!"

806
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:07,677
"I may be blind but I’m not daft."

807
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:11,203
"I’m just trying to find out
which end his head is

808
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:14,006
so as I can kick his arse in!"

809
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:19,916
- Christ, it’s warm in there.
- Here we are. Double-O Charlie.

810
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:23,079
- Double-O Charlie.
- Bottoms up.

811
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:27,884
- Up spirits.
- Stand...

812
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,401
stand fast the Holy Ghost.

813
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:34,278
Jesus.

814
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,198
- You want some tonic?
- Tonic, yes.

815
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:39,324
Here we are.
Here we are. Here’s some tonic.

816
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:40,999
- Ice.
- You want ice with that?

817
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:43,681
- Yeah.
- Here we are.

818
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:47,043
There’s some ice, Charlie.
Cheers. Cheers.

819
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:51,926
- Oh, lovely.
- Oh!

820
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:01,402
- I keep thinking about that weekend.
- Eh?

821
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:04,206
Bob alone in the house.

822
01:15:05,407 --> 01:15:07,602
He was my son.

823
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,883
My son.

824
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:13,401
<i>My son.</i>

825
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:18,083
Old pal. Old pal.

826
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:24,924
That’s why I didn’t want to get involved.
I told them. I said, "I don’t want any part of it."

827
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:27,282
But...

828
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:29,642
once you’re in, you’re in for life.

829
01:15:29,727 --> 01:15:33,561
They’ve got you by the short and curlies.
You know how it is.

830
01:15:33,647 --> 01:15:36,241
Yeah, I know.

831
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:40,038
And you... you weren’t any help.

832
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:43,800
Making out Bob was a timid sort of bloke.

833
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:51,160
- So you tried to scare him off, eh?
- I knew I bloody could.

834
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:55,604
"Oh, all right", I said. "Leave it to me", I said.

835
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:59,885
But because of what happened
to Cynthia’s husband,

836
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:04,119
Bob was so shocked,
he became even more suspicious.

837
01:16:04,207 --> 01:16:07,563
You can imagine where that left me.

838
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:11,925
"You got us into this, Commander,
you get us out of it."

839
01:16:12,007 --> 01:16:13,838
Bastards.

840
01:16:13,927 --> 01:16:17,636
"Oh, yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full."

841
01:16:22,647 --> 01:16:26,435
I still don’t see why you had to kill him.

842
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:34,880
Kill your son? Me?
Come on, Frank. I know you.

843
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:37,401
I flew with you.

844
01:16:37,487 --> 01:16:41,719
Besides, we don’t do that sort of thing
to our people. Don’t look at me like that.

845
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:46,164
Don’t you realise what happened?
Can’t you... put it together?

846
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:50,957
There was no sign of a struggle,
there was no break-in that Sunday.

847
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,998
- Bob was expecting you.
- Nice, but...

848
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:57,124
Now, if you didn’t kill him,

849
01:16:58,207 --> 01:17:02,803
I don’t know many ways to fix an accident,
but I’ve read about three,

850
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:06,846
and one of them
is where you jab a certain point

851
01:17:06,927 --> 01:17:12,365
and the bloke blacks out
without leaving any mark. Eh?

852
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,038
Was that your job?

853
01:17:16,127 --> 01:17:21,121
When I’d done it,
I went out, left the door unlocked.

854
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:26,443
But I swear to God, Frank,
he was only unconscious!

855
01:17:26,527 --> 01:17:28,882
I didn’t know those bastards...

856
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,003
Fr... Frank.

857
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:33,679
Forgive me.

858
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:35,041
I forgive you.

859
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:37,595
My job was...

860
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:42,166
to make sure the other lot
could get in without any aggro.

861
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:47,924
I thought they were just going to, you know,
lean on him a little bit. I mean, I didn’t know...

862
01:17:48,007 --> 01:17:50,282
Which other lot?

863
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:54,280
- You what, old dear?
- Which others, Charlie?

864
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:56,835
Oh, well,

865
01:17:56,927 --> 01:18:01,239
whoever the Yanks sent in
to do their dirty work for them.

866
01:18:02,607 --> 01:18:05,167
Yanks?

867
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,475
Uh...

868
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:10,082
The whole setup was...

869
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:15,678
was so that the Yanks
wouldn’t rumble who the real villains were.

870
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:22,081
- Do you know who they are?
- Oh. Some cipher clerk at GCHQ and...

871
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:24,283
Who else, Charlie?

872
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:28,285
No. I’ve talked enough already.

873
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:32,599
That’s cos I’m feeling rotten about Bob.

874
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:36,919
Anyway, knowing won’t do you any good.
They'll just lock you up,

875
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:39,680
or worse, and me if I tell you.

876
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:42,201
You’re still going to.

877
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:45,404
Oh!

878
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:48,001
Chapple!

879
01:18:48,087 --> 01:18:50,647
For God’s sake, Frank!

880
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:53,764
Sir Adrian bleeding Chapple.

881
01:18:58,487 --> 01:19:01,877
Now do you see? Bob got too close.

882
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:04,765
That’s why they threw him to the wolves.

883
01:19:05,767 --> 01:19:10,238
There’s not a blind thing that you and me...
We can’t do anything about it. No.

884
01:19:10,327 --> 01:19:14,240
Because they’re establishment,
they’re the closed ranks!

885
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:17,046
So, for God’s sake, Frank...

886
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,402
Oh, Jesus!

887
01:19:19,487 --> 01:19:23,162
I used to be able to drink, you know.

888
01:20:24,607 --> 01:20:28,646
There’s no reason for Mrs Goodburn
or the child to come to any harm,

889
01:20:28,727 --> 01:20:30,957
providing you’re sensible.

890
01:21:31,807 --> 01:21:35,800
You must understand that
our special relationship with the Americans

891
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:37,878
is at a low ebb.

892
01:21:40,207 --> 01:21:45,645
Our record in the matter of security
has been quite appalling.

893
01:21:45,727 --> 01:21:50,198
40 years of damage
inflicted on the alliance by vassals.

894
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,246
Blake, Blunt, Prime, Bettaney,

895
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:56,761
old uncle Kim Philby and the rest.

896
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:05,127
We are at the beck and call of the Americans.
Our national survival depends upon it.

897
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:13,757
The so-called "independent British deterrent"
is a meaningless indulgence to the past.

898
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:19,843
The days when nuclear stalemate
meant no nuclear war are long gone.

899
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:23,602
Now, nuclear war is expected and planned for.

900
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:28,236
All that remains in question
are its timing and extent.

901
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,485
Such warning as we get
will be from electronic espionage

902
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:38,164
by GCHQ Cheltenham
and its linked stations at home and abroad.

903
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:45,965
The consequences were the Americans to
deny us access to their giant spy machine

904
01:22:46,047 --> 01:22:49,005
are simply too awful to contemplate.

905
01:22:54,607 --> 01:22:58,566
I could justify a great deal
in terms of the coming wrath.

906
01:22:58,647 --> 01:23:04,961
It is not, happily, my task
to justify the sequence of events

907
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:08,437
which resulted in your son’s tragic death.

908
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:16,046
I am merely authorised by Her Majesty’s
government to set the matter in its context.

909
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,758
The Americans believed

910
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:27,398
that Dodgson had two named associates
involved with him at GCHQ Cheltenham,

911
01:23:27,487 --> 01:23:30,365
and they suspected there was a third man.

912
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:33,519
Do you see now
why we had to go along with that?

913
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:38,800
You’re telling me that this whole thing
was to prevent the Americans,

914
01:23:38,887 --> 01:23:41,685
our allies,
from finding out that the real traitors

915
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:45,442
were higher placed than Kedge or Goodburn?

916
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:47,961
One of them, certainly.

917
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:50,959
It was the only chance we had
to uncover him.

918
01:23:51,047 --> 01:23:53,607
- Well, have you?
- Yes.

919
01:23:53,687 --> 01:23:55,359
What did you do with him?

920
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,756
Left him until we assess
the damage he’s done

921
01:23:57,847 --> 01:24:01,396
and how most effectively to use him
to embarrass the Russians.

922
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:07,517
When you’ll do a deal with him so he can
draw a pension and have tea with the queen.

923
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:12,522
And you expect me to shut up about the fact
that my son, among other innocents,

924
01:24:12,607 --> 01:24:15,167
were expendable in this charade?

925
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:20,684
You don’t have any alternative, Jones.

926
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:23,725
What will you do? Arrange another accident?

927
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:26,838
That won’t be necessary.

928
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:31,205
Any attempt on your part
to publish or broadcast, expose, sue, litigate

929
01:24:31,287 --> 01:24:37,157
on the basis of what you know or may
surmise will simply never see the light of day.

930
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:40,319
I have killed people before.

931
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:44,320
And when my best friend
was shot down over Korea,

932
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:46,967
I also did it with pleasure.

933
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:52,724
And if I were to kill you,
the publicity surrounding my trial...

934
01:24:52,807 --> 01:24:56,482
Cases involving national security
are held in camera.

935
01:24:56,567 --> 01:25:01,561
If you’re thinking of other ways of drawing
public attention to yourself, don’t bother.

936
01:25:01,647 --> 01:25:06,516
We would merely arrange for you
to be taken into psychiatric care.

937
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:10,919
A breakdown following
your son’s tragic accident.

938
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:14,397
As for Mrs Goodburn,
well, you wouldn’t be here

939
01:25:14,487 --> 01:25:19,641
if you didn’t realise that the child makes her
much more vulnerable than you are.

940
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:37,320
I had a phone call.

941
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:40,365
Anonymous. They were polite but, uh...

942
01:25:42,407 --> 01:25:45,797
I’ve already lost two people that I loved.

943
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:50,039
I couldn’t bear it
if anything were to happen to Tiffany.

944
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:52,595
Or you, come to that.

945
01:25:53,527 --> 01:25:58,237
I never, ever thought I’d be beaten,
not in my ordinary life.

946
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:03,640
I always knew I’d have to fight,
but I always reckoned I’d win.

947
01:26:05,007 --> 01:26:08,124
That’s the worst part of it. I let you down.

948
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:11,243
You and Bob.

949
01:26:12,247 --> 01:26:14,397
What do you want, Frank?

950
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:17,637
L"II tell you what I want.

951
01:26:17,727 --> 01:26:19,797
I want to believe in England again.

952
01:26:57,607 --> 01:27:01,282
Ah. Collecting for the British Legion,
I imagine?

953
01:27:01,367 --> 01:27:05,565
You’re fortunate. It’s my man’s day off.
He lacks charity. Do come in.

954
01:27:15,407 --> 01:27:18,717
Can I offer you a drink?
I expect you’d like a beer.

955
01:27:18,807 --> 01:27:22,641
I may not be able to accommodate you there,
but gin or whisky?

956
01:27:22,727 --> 01:27:23,716
No, thank you.

957
01:27:23,807 --> 01:27:27,925
Oh, you don’t drink while on duty.
Very laudable, I’m sure.

958
01:27:32,927 --> 01:27:34,724
Here.

959
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:39,762
I don’t get it.

960
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:43,406
- Who are you?
- My son was killed because of you.

961
01:27:43,487 --> 01:27:45,603
You’re clearly deranged.

962
01:27:45,687 --> 01:27:48,918
He got too close to finding out
that our security people

963
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:52,079
were letting the Americans eliminate stooges

964
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:55,842
so that they could get a line
on the real villain - you.

965
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:57,804
So why haven’t I been arrested?

966
01:27:57,887 --> 01:28:01,004
They wanted you to stay in place
until they found out enough

967
01:28:01,087 --> 01:28:04,124
to make you an offer you couldn’t refuse.

968
01:28:08,127 --> 01:28:10,516
If you’re right, there’s nothing you can do.

969
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:13,838
Not a lot. They made that clear.

970
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:19,957
Just tell me...
I mean, my son was killed because of you.

971
01:28:20,047 --> 01:28:25,121
I don’t understand how someone like you
with everything going for you

972
01:28:25,207 --> 01:28:27,437
could become a traitor.

973
01:28:27,527 --> 01:28:32,043
I can’t be expected to explain my thoughts
to someone of your intellectual calibre.

974
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:37,565
Oh, I thought the whole point was
that you were on the side of the workers.

975
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:40,683
Very well.

976
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:48,285
I had an average, upper-class education.
Genuinely of the right. Churchill was my hero.

977
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:52,918
I went up to Oxford
and joined the civil service as a high-flyer

978
01:28:53,007 --> 01:28:56,283
content with Britain’s part in the world.

979
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:58,676
- So, what happened?
- Nothing.

980
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:02,396
By which I mean
there was no blinding flash of revelation.

981
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:06,799
Just gradually I became aware
how insignificant we were.

982
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,720
The world had to choose
between the two superpowers.

983
01:29:09,807 --> 01:29:12,321
I chose Russia.

984
01:29:12,407 --> 01:29:16,366
It wasn’t a moral judgment initially,
more an aesthetic one.

985
01:29:16,447 --> 01:29:21,965
It took the Suez affair to bring home
the total futility of the British position.

986
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:27,723
We tried and failed humiliatingly
to halt the march of progress,

987
01:29:27,807 --> 01:29:30,640
and we had no alternative to offer.

988
01:29:30,727 --> 01:29:34,925
Paradoxically, it was the way
in which the Americans, our allies,

989
01:29:35,007 --> 01:29:40,400
sabotaged that desperate venture that
confirmed my commitment to the other camp.

990
01:29:40,487 --> 01:29:43,479
Nothing that’s happened since
has caused me to change it.

991
01:29:43,567 --> 01:29:48,243
Our own political posturing
is neither moral not relevant.

992
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:54,844
As for America, the standard-bearer
of the West, she’s not simply in decline,

993
01:29:54,927 --> 01:30:00,320
she’s dying from a combination of greed,
paranoia and social injustice.

994
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:05,959
And her death throes drive her to
ever more dangerous feats of brinkmanship,

995
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,959
both in Europe, Central America and in space.

996
01:30:10,687 --> 01:30:16,603
If you really believe all that,
why don’t you go and live in bloody Russia?

997
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:19,201
I knew I was wasting my time.

998
01:30:19,287 --> 01:30:25,078
L"II tell you why. Because your sort
always manages to have its cake and eat it.

999
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,965
I mean, look at this place.

1000
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:33,483
- It makes me sick.
- Well, what is it you want?

1001
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:39,961
I want your written confession of what you’ve
been giving to the Russians and for how long.

1002
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:41,799
It won’t do you any good.

1003
01:30:41,887 --> 01:30:44,799
I know it won’t bring my son back,

1004
01:30:44,887 --> 01:30:50,120
but it’ll stop you living off the fat of a country
you’ve been betraying for so long

1005
01:30:50,207 --> 01:30:54,723
from your secure, pensionable position
near the top of the heap.

1006
01:30:55,687 --> 01:30:59,475
- You can’t force me...
- Just do it.

1007
01:31:01,927 --> 01:31:04,077
As you wish.

1008
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:12,047
I imagine you’ll want to vet it.

1009
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:28,442
This will do.

1010
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:32,718
<i>- And now perhaps you’ll return it.</i>

1011
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:37,444
One hates to be melodramatic, but, um...

1012
01:32:47,727 --> 01:32:49,843
Argh!

1013
01:33:01,847 --> 01:33:07,763
<i>"Any attempt on your part
to publish, broadcast, expose, sue or litigate</i>

1014
01:33:07,847 --> 01:33:10,236
<i>will simply never see the light of day-"</i>

1015
01:33:29,287 --> 01:33:34,645
<i>And to God’s gracious mercy
and protection we commit you.</i>

1016
01:33:34,727 --> 01:33:37,685
The Lord bless you and keep you,

1017
01:33:37,767 --> 01:33:43,558
the Lord make his face to shine upon you
and be gracious unto you.

1018
01:33:43,647 --> 01:33:48,596
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you
and give you peace,

1019
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:51,679
both now and evermore.

1020
01:33:51,767 --> 01:33:53,758
Amen.

1021
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:02,282
<i>Quick march!</i>

1022
01:35:52,607 --> 01:35:58,603
<i>It would be conniving to do nothing,
knowing what I know now, don't you see?</i>

1023
01:36:00,247 --> 01:36:04,638
<i>Their secret world
has put out the light of the ordinary world-</i>

1024
01:36:14,007 --> 01:36:17,477
<i>I still believe that the man in the white hat
always wins in the end,</i>

1025
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:20,001
<i>and I intend to prove it-</i>

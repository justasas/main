I would take you holding your hand

00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,445
What would the whole world think

7
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,575
I don't have to come in your hands

8
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:39,899
I am afraid that you'll make some excuse

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,000
and leave me and go

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,347

30
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,046
And beware of guys

31
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:37,060

32
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,261
No, I won't come in anyone's hands

34
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:43,873
Whatever I do, I won't get anyone

36
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,208
The wish to do something

37
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,350
to move a bit ahead

38
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,870

42
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,022
Come close, match your lips and

43
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:13,123

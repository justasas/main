1
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:06,715
These bad guys are always late.
- They'll be here.

2
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:09,953
When, Tony?
We've been sitting here two hours.

3
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:15,792
The meeting's been planned for weeks.
They'll be here. Be patient, alright?

4
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,983
Yeah, so will the Easter bunny,
and my next birthday!

5
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:22,862
And guess what...

6
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,583
It's about goddamn time!

7
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:42,345
Got the money?

8
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,101
No, food stamps.
- I don't trust this dude.

9
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:50,583
I deal in stolen merchandise.
I'm not very trustworthy.

10
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,264
You show up late...

11
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,026
and then you ask dumb questions.
- Could be a cop.

12
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,621
Or Elvis or the Wizard of Oz.
Do you want to deal or not?

13
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,467
Alright, show him the stuff.

14
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,142
Come on. Hurry up. I'm late.

15
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,301
Back off!
- Really?

16
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,424
Police! Stop!

17
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,544
Nobody listens.

18
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:36,501
Tony, get over here!

19
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,304
Come on!

20
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,177
I'm hit.

21
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:46,612
Where? I can't move my leg.
It's not your leg,

22
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,538
you've got glass in your ass!

23
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:05,698
First these guys show up late,
and then they ask dumb questions.

24
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:09,059
Then they shoot you in the ass.
They're pissing me off!

25
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,569
Beginner's luck!

26
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,492
68...

27
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,297
69...

28
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,012
70...

29
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,932
Joe, she's not in.
- She's in, I know it.

30
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:39,930
Then why don't she answer?

31
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:43,807
Knows it's me. She's just watching
the phone ring and not answering.

32
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:48,256
I can feel it.
She's trying to grind me down.

33
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:50,567
You're crazy, Joe.

34
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:54,446
You're out of your tiny Jersey mind.

35
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,052
80...

36
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:13,967
81...

37
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:38,159
Hey, it's Detective Alka-Seltzer!
- Not today, okay, Ross.

38
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:45,927
Thanks, Ray. - Is it true
you used Tony's butt for cover?

39
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,688
Boy, there's a butt
I could use for cover.

40
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,877
Watch what you say about Gwen.
- About "Gwen"?

41
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,166
I'm sorry, Joe.
Are you and the lieutenant involved?

42
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:02,163
If I thought you were involved,
I never would have said a word.

43
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:06,765
Joe, Lieutenant wants to see you.
I think she's in a weird mood.

44
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:09,366
Lovers' tiff?

45
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,599
Morning!
- Sit down.

46
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,641
Know what I was just thinking about?

47
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,759
Remember Catalina? - Of course.
- Great weekend. - The best.

48
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:31,602
It was great because I was in love.
- Me too.

49
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:40,116
Remember what I said Sunday morning
when we were sitting on the terrace?

50
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:43,401
That you'd like me to nibble all...
- Not that.

51
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,521
I was the first man to...

52
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:47,392
The other stuff.

53
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,233
Oh, the feelings stuff.

54
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:52,030
Right.

55
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:57,038
Feelings and responsibilities stuff.
- Come on, Gwen.

56
00:06:57,442 --> 00:07:00,717
If this is about the bust...
- I'm not talking about that fiasco.

57
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:05,273
You go out getting drunk,
while I stay up worrying!

58
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,318
You didn't call!

59
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,188
It was late.
Didn’t want to wake you.

60
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,868
Here, hold this.
- Why?

61
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,315
Pretend we're talking business.

62
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,153
Don’t want the precinct knowing.

63
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,868
I think they already know.
- What was I to think?

64
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,269
They said somebody got hit.

65
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,227
Then that Tony got hit
and you went to get more beer!

66
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:32,754
Honey, it's true.
I had a few drinks with the guys.

67
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:34,146
Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:39,069
That's funny, because Lou told me
you spent the evening on the phone.

69
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,351
So tell me,

70
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,987
who were you calling?
It sure wasn't me!

71
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,068
My mom.

72
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,234
Excuse me?

73
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,591
I was calling my mom.

74
00:07:57,555 --> 00:08:00,512
You were calling your mom
at 2:30 in the morning.

75
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,792
That's the most pathetic excuse!
Tell me who she is.

76
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,707
She isn't anybody, she's my mom.

77
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:11,345
It doesn't really matter.
Could be your mom or a Dial-a-Bimbo.

78
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:16,348
It's over! - You don't mean that.
- I mean every word.

79
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,625
It's embarrassing me in my work.
You run away from responsibility.

80
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:24,582
I'll pack your... - I'm not going to
listen to this. - Where you going?

81
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,060
Fishing!

82
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,824
Get back in here!

83
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,984
Get back in this office, Bomowski!
That's an order.

84
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,230
Mom, I know you're there.

85
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,869
Come on!

86
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,459
Please God,
make her pick up.

87
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,978
Okay, that's it.
I've had it. I've really had it.

88
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,501
I'm a dead man.

89
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,335
This the New York flight?
- Yes, coming out right now.

90
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,854
Relax, kid, relax.

91
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,057
I think that's him. Yeah, it is.

92
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:40,532
Little Joey!

93
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:46,060
You must be Joe?
- Yes. Why?

94
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,654
I was a bed-wetter too.

95
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,652
It was so sweet!

96
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,690
He said, "Mommy,
my pee-pee got stuck in my zipper!"

97
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,370
Joey! There's my Joey!
There's my little boy.

98
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,576
Come here!

99
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,454
You've given up shaving.
- No, I shave.

100
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,849
Call that a shave?
- I shaved.

101
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,657
Did you use a lawnmower?

102
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,289
What girl is going to marry you,

103
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,575
if you don't shave!
- Hi, Tutti!

104
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:26,256
This is little Joey?
- Looks a lot different in clothes.

105
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:30,650
We've got to be getting along now,
but thanks for showing us the photos.

106
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:34,492
You looked real sexy in diapers.

107
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:39,208
Sally, if things don't work out
with the doctor, Joey's single!

108
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:43,324
I've always been a sucker
for a guy in Pampers!

109
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:48,973
What?

110
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,889
I can't get over you driving.
- I've been driving for 20 years!

111
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,604
You'll always be my little Joey.

112
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,443
Where were you the last few days?

113
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:07,130
At home in New Jersey. Where else?
- I must've called you 50 times.

114
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,968
That was you?
- Why didn't you answer?

115
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:14,722
For 5 years,
every time I'm about to visit,

116
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:18,407
you call and say it's a bad time.

117
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,689
This time I decided
I wouldn't answer the phone.

118
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,365
That's the most...
- Watch out!

119
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,125
Moron!
- Up yours, pal!

120
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:42,763
Sorry.
- Shall I drive? - No!

121
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,806
No, Mom.

122
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,039
I'm okay.

123
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,042
That was a close call, Pixie.

124
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,438
All cars near 4th and Main,

125
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:59,156
Please respond
to 486 South Main Street. Code 2.

126
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:08,521
What's going on? - Got a jumper
up there. Looks like he'll do it.

127
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,523
Did the shrink show up?
- He's on his way.

128
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,356
Stay here.

129
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,913
Where are you going?
- Up there.

130
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,915
It's too dangerous. Listen.

131
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:30,962
I do this all the time.
I'm not bad at it.

132
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:34,479
I want you to stay here
and let me take care of this.

133
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:37,032
Be careful!
Don’t do anything foolish!

134
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:48,115
What seems to be the man's problem?
- He wants to talk to his mother.

135
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,511
They've been having problems.

136
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,634
Really?

137
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,748
I'll take care of this, officer.

138
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,952
Hey, how are you doing? Alright?
- Leave me alone. Don’t touch me!

139
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,951
Stay back, I'm gonna do it!
- I just want to talk to you.

140
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,268
Don’t tell me what to do!

141
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:24,225
Stay there, I'm going to do it!
- Hey you, young man!

142
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,752
Down here! I'm not your mother,

143
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,353
but I am a mother
and you could talk to me,

144
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:34,509
if that's alright. - Officer,
this is serious. - Let her talk.

145
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,224
What do you want?

146
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,910
I just want you to know
the man next to you is my son.

147
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:44,273
We've had our difficulties.
- Mom, stay out of this, okay?

148
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:48,222
Joe, wave to the crowd.
- Mom. Goddamnit!

149
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,669
You don't swear to your mother.

150
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:54,270
Butt out, it's my mother.
- So do what she tells you.

151
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:56,902
Start waving or I'm jumping.

152
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,270
Start waving!
Start waving or I'm jumping!

153
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:03,745
I'm waving. See?
Mom, hi.

154
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:08,941
By the way, Joe's still single.
How do you like that?

155
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,024
He's a very nice boy.
A bit rough round the edge,

156
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:16,946
but nothing the right girl couldn't
smooth out. - Secure the megaphone.

157
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,821
We used to fight all the time.
He was very small for his age.

158
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,347
I was not! I was average height!
About your height. What's the deal?

159
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:30,742
Bet she's got pictures.
- I've got pictures, wait a minute.

160
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:34,379
She's got pictures.
- Mom, get rid of the pictures!

161
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,705
Isn't he adorable?

162
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,745
I thought I had things bad.
- Not close.

163
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,580
I'm ready to go in now.

164
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:47,137
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Yeah.

165
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,417
That guy needs help.

166
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:57,182
Lesley Carnel, Channel 8 News.
We're downtown at 4th and Main,

167
00:14:57,585 --> 00:15:00,099
where a man is on a ledge,

168
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:04,544
apparently despondent
about his mother. - Make her stop!

169
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,098
Are we here?

170
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,573
Is that your house?

171
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,455
What?

172
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,730
It's very, very nice.
- What's the matter. - Nothing.

173
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:36,654
You sniffed.

174
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,608
No, it's nothing. Only...

175
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,294
Only what?

176
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,691
Won't get a girl if you don't clean.

177
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,739
I clean this house every morning.
I clean and I clean.

178
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,291
It's not clean.
Filled with dust. Look at this!

179
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,930
You could grow things on it.

180
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,130
What's this? There's stuff under it.
Is that the closet?

181
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:05,769
No!
- What?

182
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,685
I've had a few problems
since my cleaning lady left.

183
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:13,452
Maybe she's lost in there.

184
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,853
Pineapple chunks?
- They're your favorite!

185
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,813
We've got them here too.

186
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:30,851
They don't taste the same.
- It's canned, exactly the same.

187
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:35,692
My son, the gourmet? Ha, ha.
Come on up, darling.

188
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,330
This is the way we clean the house,
clean the house, clean the house.

189
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:57,122
This is the way we clean the house,
early in the morning...

190
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,002
Oh God, make her stop!

191
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,968
Thank you, God.

192
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,767
I owe you.

193
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:30,605
What's this?

194
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,998
Oh, Joe's gun.

195
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,561
Look at this, all greasy and dirty.

196
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,798
Let's see...

197
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:43,156
There we go.
This and this...

198
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,284
Some of this...

199
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:49,397
Let's see... A little of that...

200
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,118
That's gonna be good!

201
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:58,477
Where do they keep the bullets?

202
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,796
Oh, not in there.

203
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:05,080
What's this little thing here?

204
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:10,477
Oh, goodness gracious.
Yes, that's where they are.

205
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,350
Okay, we'll wash those too.

206
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:22,476
This is the way we wash our gun,
wash our gun, wash our gun...

207
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:28,236
This is the way we wash our gun,
early in the morning.

208
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,552
Going to clean that out
really well. That's fine.

209
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,674
Go ahead, make your bed!

210
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:51,355
What did you do to my gun?
- Nothing, I cleaned it.

211
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,635
You ruined it!

212
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:55,471
You took all the bluing off!

213
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:59,074
Chlorox? Great!
It's going to blow up in my hand now.

214
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,388
Try to do something helpful...

215
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,389
Nice and original.

216
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:07,429
You get barked at! Come on, Pix!

217
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:13,069
Mom, I'm sorry. It's an old gun.
I don't use it any more.

218
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:21,867
Breakfast!
- Mom!

219
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:26,984
Nothing I haven't seen before.
- Would you turn around please?

220
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:28,983
Both of you!

221
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,422
God.

222
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:36,582
Pixie and I thought we'd pop
into the station, see where you work.

223
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,471
Did you cut yourself?

224
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:43,501
No!
- Need some iodine? - No!

225
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:47,902
A Band-Aid? - No!
The station is out of the question.

226
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,744
Absolutely unequivocally.

227
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:53,427
We'll talk over breakfast.
- I'm serious.

228
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,539
What did I always tell you?
Breakfast is the most important meal.

229
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,546
Start on these, and I'll scramble
some eggs. - I don't like eggs.

230
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,783
If you don't eat them for breakfast,
they'll be waiting for you at dinner.

231
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:20,060
Bye, sweetie, have a nice day.
Oh, Joey...

232
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,981
You forgot your lunch!

233
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,781
We're not off
to a very good start, are we, Pixie?

234
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,062
Know what we should do?

235
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:43,935
We should get
Joey something a little special.

236
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,378
Let's see...

237
00:20:58,503 --> 00:20:59,731
You want to get out here?

238
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,452
I mean, look at this place...

239
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,898
Ridiculous! I'm from Newark.

240
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:11,740
If you want stopping power,
this is your baby.

241
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,133
Charter Arms,.44, Bulldog.

242
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,613
No, my son's is bigger.
I got a bottle brush down the barrel.

243
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,739
You put a brush down the barrel?

244
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:23,650
Yeah, I wanted to clean out...
Never mind.

245
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,211
Okay, bigger. How about this?

246
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,609
That's it!

247
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,012
Taurus, PT,.99, long barrel.
Punch a hole through a Pontiac.

248
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,651
How much? - $450. - $450?
- The Bulldog is only $325.

249
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:44,169
No, I want the big one.
Don’t suppose you gift-wrap? - No.

250
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:47,375
I'll take it like that.
- There's a cooling-off period.

251
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:51,053
Give me your driver's license.
I'll do the paperwork.

252
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:54,130
In 2 weeks it's yours.
- I need it today!

253
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:57,130
Sorry, that's the law.

254
00:21:57,936 --> 00:21:59,494
Can I have it back?

255
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,055
Come on, Pixie.

256
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,128
Hey, lady!

257
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,204
You want to buy a gun today?

258
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:19,684
You got a gun for sale?

259
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,211
You do?
- Step into my office.

260
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:28,127
Lightweight, adjustable stock.
- No!

261
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,807
I want a Taurus.99 long barrel.

262
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:32,884
Your son will love this.

263
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:36,921
What'll he do with that? He carries
his gun under his jacket. - Wait!

264
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,481
Wait a minute. Here, here.

265
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,763
What about one of these?
You've seen Miami Vice.

266
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:48,642
This is a Mac 10.
All the big dealers love this gun.

267
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,166
I don't think that's exactly my Joey.

268
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,243
That's a full automatic. That means

269
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,642
30 shots in 2.5 seconds.
You can cut down trees with it.

270
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,119
How much?
- $500.

271
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:05,277
$350.

272
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,718
They're there.
- Great.

273
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:22,765
Bless you.
- I'm coming down with something.

274
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,078
You've got allergies.
- I've got a fever.

275
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:28,204
The Santa Anna wind's very heavy.

276
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,641
What do you know about it!

277
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:39,195
Yeah? - Mr. Parnell, we've located
the misappropriated merchandise.

278
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,401
If you're certain it's ours...

279
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,677
then repossess it.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,632
Bless you. - Let's go?
- To work! - Let's go.

281
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:54,561
Do you want to sell me the gun,
or sit dreaming about $500?

282
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,161
Okay. Don’t forget that extra clip.

283
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,512
Nice doing business with you.

284
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,831
Come on, Pixie!

285
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:40,188
He's going round the front.

286
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,026
Damn!

287
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,191
Morning!

288
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,580
There you go.
- Thanks.

289
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:51,981
Hangover?

290
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,907
Heartburn.

291
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,459
What did you eat for breakfast?

292
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:01,822
Juice, fruit, milk,

293
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,980
eggs, bacon and sausage,

294
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:07,855
hash browns,

295
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,500
toast, pancakes,

296
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:16,335
honey rolls,

297
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:19,579
Cocoa Puffs. There's more.

298
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:24,456
You must've been starving.
- I wasn't hungry.

299
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,099
My mother's visiting.

300
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:33,699
Well, when your mamma cooks,
she cooks.

301
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:36,819
Mind you...

302
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:41,252
breakfast is supposed
to be the most important meal.

303
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,255
Thank you, Tony.

304
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,256
Have a nice day.
- Hey, Joe. - Yeah?

305
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,617
Thank God you've arrived.
- Why?

306
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:59,297
Your mom's here.
- My mom? - Yes.

307
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,459
Chicken pox?

308
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,532
Looks very good in spots.

309
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,500
Told everybody it was freckles.

310
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,171
Mom, are you okay?
- Fine. These things happen.

311
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:17,571
What things? - She witnessed
a murder. - A murder?

312
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:20,970
Yeah, downtown.
- What were you doing downtown?

313
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:24,415
Shopping. Just relax. Have a cookie.
- Shut up!

314
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:29,776
Maybe I should get the lieutenant...
- What's going on?

315
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,895
Nothing.
- I'm a witness.

316
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:34,015
Who is this?
- I'll introduce you.

317
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:38,125
Ross, you better shut up, I mean it.
- This is Tutti, Joey's mom.

318
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,924
Joey's mom?
- That's right, Gwen.

319
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,294
My mom.
As you can see,

320
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:48,448
it's been a shock for her,
so I'm taking her home.

321
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:53,087
Mrs. Bomowski is one of my
principle witnesses. - Your witness?

322
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:58,614
It's my case. Your mom's happy
to stay to the end of the month.

323
00:27:59,014 --> 00:27:59,969
You said what?

324
00:28:00,534 --> 00:28:05,243
You are so beautiful, Gwen.
That lovely hair and that smile.

325
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:08,725
Joey, if you'd worn your retainers,
you could've had teeth like that.

326
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,488
Say goodbye, we're going home.
- Not so fast.

327
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:13,883
I want to interview the witness.

328
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:18,687
What are you trying to do? - To you?
- This is just ridiculous!

329
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:20,922
It's ridiculous
your mother witnessed a murder?

330
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:24,243
No, Ross sticking his head into it.

331
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:28,041
I can't transfer it to you.
- He's told her to stay in town.

332
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:32,602
She's supposed to go back Monday.
- That was before the killing.

333
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,844
Can't we fly her back? If she stays
past Monday, I'll kill her myself.

334
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,128
What's wrong with you?
She seems wonderful. Warm, caring...

335
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:45,680
Obviously crazy about you.
- Crazy is right.

336
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:49,558
She talks to total strangers
about my diaper rash!

337
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:52,926
She loves you, Joe.
- Her love is driving me nuts!

338
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:55,363
Either way, she's staying.

339
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,875
Joe, come on. How bad can it be?

340
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,119
Two, three weeks tops.

341
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,641
This is about us, right?

342
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,354
This is about revenge?

343
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,001
Are you suggesting
I would use my rank? - Yes!

344
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:24,237
Don’t let the door hit you
on your way out, Detective.

345
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,473
You can call me Lieutenant.

346
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:38,920
Don’t be so gloomy! Think of all
the time we'll spend together.

347
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,561
Don’t you want to hear my plan?

348
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:45,237
I want to brush my teeth
and go to bed.

349
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:48,552
You and I can crack this case.

350
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:51,555
When we find the killer,
you'll probably be promoted.

351
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:53,997
And things will work out with Gwen.

352
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,992
Goodnight.

353
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:15,148
I didn't tell Ross what I really saw.

354
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:17,549
I held it all back for you.

355
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,314
You're joking, right, Mom?
- No, it's not a joke.

356
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:27,311
You can't fool around with homicide.

357
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,786
You need this to get promoted.

358
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:34,030
I don't want a promotion.
- You're only a sergeant. - I like it.

359
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,631
Next you'll tell me
you like where you live.

360
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,993
I do. Mom, I'm happy.
I don't want to get promoted.

361
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:43,785
I don't want to get married.
I like my life.

362
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:48,073
I can wear my underwear more than
once, leave the toilet seat up...

363
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:52,183
Watch what I want on TV.
Mom, I like my life!

364
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:55,312
You call this a life?

365
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,352
Goodnight, Mom.

366
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,827
Back off, back off!

367
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,788
I'm going in.
- He has an automatic.

368
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,066
Joe, are you crazy?

369
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,698
Mom, what are you doing here?

370
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,858
Mommy's got to change you.

371
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,137
I don't want to be changed.

372
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:03,856
I've got to change you.
- I can change you.

373
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,544
Stop trying to change me!

374
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,019
Joey, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

375
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:29,052
Sounded like you were having
a bad dream. - No, I'm fine, really.

376
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:32,260
I should tuck you in.
- Don’t, Mom.

377
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:35,859
Let me tuck you in.
- I don't wanna be tucked in.

378
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:38,657
Joey, let me tuck you in.

379
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,734
You just snuggle down.
- I don't wanna snuggle.

380
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,530
You were just having a bad dream.

381
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,094
Remember when you were little
and I used to sing to you.

382
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,138
Oh, God!
- Aw, shush.

383
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,851
See if we can remember how that goes.
- Mom, please don't.

384
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:08,496
Lullaby and goodnight,
thy mother's delight.

385
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:14,449
With down overspread,
here's baby's wee bed.

386
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:17,417
Lullaby and goodnight,

387
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:20,933
lay thee down now and rest.

388
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:24,289
Lullaby and goodnight,

389
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:29,052
may thy slumber be best.

390
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,652
Goodnight, Joey.

391
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,606
Morning, Mom.

392
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:53,041
Better get going or we'll be late.
- I didn't want to wake you.

393
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:59,449
Better get you to the station
for your 9:30 appointment with Ross.

394
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,042
I'm not saying anything.
- I won't argue.

395
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:07,764
If he arrests you for withholding
evidence, that's your problem.

396
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:11,046
Suppose you don't want your present?

397
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,958
Present?
- Just a little something...

398
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,799
A present?

399
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,247
You don't deserve it.
- Come on, Mom. Please.

400
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,248
I love presents.

401
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,367
It's heavy.

402
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:39,882
Jesus!

403
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:44,121
Is it the wrong kind? - Wrong kind?
It's illegal. Where did you get it?

404
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:46,801
From those guys who got shot.

405
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:48,958
A machine gun off the back of a van?

406
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:51,675
In the store
they said I had to "cool off."

407
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:54,519
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:58,034
I wanted it to be a surprise.

409
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:00,242
It is!

410
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,152
You're saying it was a big car?

411
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:07,757
Don’t know
if I'd call it big exactly.

412
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:10,120
So it was a small car.

413
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:14,675
Difficult to say. To me it was big.
To you it might have been small.

414
00:35:16,643 --> 00:35:18,918
Like a Cadillac?
- Which model?

415
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:20,550
Any model!

416
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,157
A few years ago...

417
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:26,759
there was a small one.
- Was it like the Cimarron?

418
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:29,640
No.

419
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,032
Definitely not like the Cimarron.

420
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:36,278
Let's take a break.

421
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,310
You're tired.
Are you eating right?

422
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,757
I could bring you
some lentil soup. - Be right back.

423
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,069
So far, so good, Pixie.

424
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:54,436
Gwen, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

425
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:59,756
Jesus! That's a full automatic.
- I know.

426
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,070
And your mother... Okay, Joe.
I'll trace the gun. - Thanks.

427
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,108
No telling what she'll come home with.
- I know.

428
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:10,633
I really appreciate it.
If you don't mind?

429
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:14,472
Try not to kill anyone with it.
- She's too little. Wouldn't hit her.

430
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:20,430
Who's the little boy by the pool?
- Joey, only 9 and all those muscles!

431
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:23,827
You can already see
he's going to have nice equipment.

432
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:28,783
Don’t be embarrassed.
I'm old, but I'm still a woman.

433
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:32,311
Tell me, do you love my Joey?

434
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:36,912
I don't know.
I did love him. Maybe I still do.

435
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:39,463
He loves you.
- He never shows it.

436
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:43,422
That's Joey.
Doesn’t mean he doesn't love you.

437
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,983
If he'd just show me how he feels!

438
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:50,429
A box of candy,
a bunch of flowers...

439
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:54,540
He never sent you flowers?
- Never. - Oh, Joe...

440
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,511
And me being a lieutenant
just makes things worse.

441
00:36:58,151 --> 00:36:59,823
Did you see this one?

442
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:03,188
Very serious looking.
How old is he there?

443
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,060
13. This was taken
just after his father died.

444
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,104
I went to pieces,
no good for anything for days.

445
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,340
Joey did everything.

446
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:17,025
He arranged the funeral,
called the family...

447
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,179
picked out the casket...

448
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,738
talked to the priest...

449
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:25,139
But he never cried.

450
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,904
I know Joe loved his father.

451
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:32,300
But to this day
I don't know if he ever cried.

452
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:47,583
You were talking about something.
- It was nothing.

453
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:51,773
You were both crying!
- Girl talk. You wouldn't understand.

454
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,744
You have a gift for starting trouble.

455
00:37:55,144 --> 00:37:58,978
Don’t interfere with Gwen and me.
- Well, somebody has to.

456
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:02,102
She's a lovely girl,
and you never send her flowers.

457
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,855
I'll get the door.

458
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:11,299
Mom, this is the point of no return!

459
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:12,612
I've had it.

460
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:16,014
I've completely had it.
I'm taking you to the apartment,

461
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:21,131
I'm going to handcuff you to a sink,
and put you on the first plane home.

462
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,816
Here you are. Let's go.

463
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,216
Ask me what I saw!
- I don't want to know.

464
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,610
Ask me.
- No!

465
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,538
Ask me what I saw.

466
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:46,327
You're an old lady from Newark.

467
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:50,174
You knit, make jam,
talk on the phone. That's it!

468
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:53,850
What did you see?

469
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:58,405
The man who sold me the gun.
The one that got away. And his van.

470
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:00,933
Really? Was he little? Big?

471
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:04,533
Big, 6' 3", 320 lbs.

472
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:09,248
He had a tattoo of a coiled snake
with "God Rides a Harley" above it.

473
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:14,729
Will you remember this?
A Chevy van, gun-metal gray, an '82.

474
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,046
The year with the longer wheelbase.

475
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,649
License plate:

476
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,363
JL2-661.

477
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:29,809
This is 90W2,
give me 90W90.

478
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:31,606
Go ahead, 90W2.

479
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:36,609
Could you find Tony and tell him
I need another favor. - 10-4.

480
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:41,564
Where's your boyfriend and the guns?
- What are you talking about?

481
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:44,644
I hardly know the guy.

482
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,406
Paulie, nothing down there.

483
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:52,407
Check the garage. - I did,
there's nothing. - Well, check there.

484
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,487
Is this the house?
- That's where the van's registered.

485
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:08,359
Shall I cover the back?
- We're not partners!

486
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,088
Okay, okay.

487
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:16,839
We're not connecting here, honey.

488
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:22,599
Keep her quiet!

489
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,042
Wrong house?

490
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:28,724
Help me! Help me!

491
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:30,961
Come on.

492
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:36,919
Oh gosh, no!

493
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:40,394
Okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,876
Joey, are you alright?

495
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:48,153
Don’t jump!

496
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,389
Get in, sweetie!
We're gonna nail those turkeys!

497
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,077
Okay, Ma. Make a right!
- Okay. - That's good.

498
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,588
Sorry.
- It was an accident.

499
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:02,345
Jump!
Use the road!

500
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:08,190
Watch it!

501
00:42:09,915 --> 00:42:11,586
Way to go, Mom!

502
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,107
Floor it!

503
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:20,708
They're going left.
- Slow down.

504
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,186
Left! Slow it down!

505
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:24,988
Be careful!

506
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:33,789
There's nothing in there.
I already looked.

507
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:39,580
What's in the file?
It's the trace on the gun, isn't it?

508
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,506
What does it say, Joe?
- I haven't read it.

509
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,344
I'm giving it to Ross.

510
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,820
I don't believe this.
- Believe it!

511
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,108
Look who it is.
Norman Bates and his mom!

512
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,545
Cut it out!
- You're going to tell him?

513
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:56,821
My mother lied.

514
00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:01,426
She got the license plate
and I traced the address.

515
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:04,342
Shit!
- Watch your mouth.

516
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:09,663
That's rich coming from the most
pathetic cop ever in this precinct.

517
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,782
Is there anything else...

518
00:43:14,187 --> 00:43:16,417
I should know?
- Yes, Detective.

519
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,335
We think you're an asshole.

520
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,143
Take a walk with me.

521
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:35,335
Think I'm going to take that?

522
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:38,338
She's just an old lady.

523
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:42,783
A monster, that's what she is.
And her cookies suck!

524
00:43:43,184 --> 00:43:45,777
Watch what you say!
- I'm not watching anything!

525
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:49,016
If you even look at this case...

526
00:43:49,423 --> 00:43:51,618
I'll throw your mom in a county can

527
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:56,174
before you can say "Golden Ager"!
- Are you threatening my mother?

528
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:57,731
You, your mom...

529
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:00,702
Your whole goddamn family.

530
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:04,457
Ross, you just made
a big mistake. - Oh, sure.

531
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,216
What are you doing?

532
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,734
Jesus Christ!

533
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:20,091
Hi.
- Hi.

534
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:25,617
You forgot to dry your hands.
- Ross needs the towels more than me.

535
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,897
Ross needs the towels?
- Long story. - Oh, excuse me.

536
00:44:33,098 --> 00:44:35,975
I have your toothbrush.
- My toothbrush?

537
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:37,571
Yeah.

538
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:42,253
With the frog's head.
I forgot to pack it.

539
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:44,444
Thanks.

540
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:48,975
Lieutenant!

541
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:53,493
I want to file a complaint
against him and his mom...

542
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:56,170
for assault
and withholding information.

543
00:44:56,575 --> 00:45:00,045
What, Ross?
Nothing, just flushing him out.

544
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:03,093
I'm gonna see you suspended.

545
00:45:05,094 --> 00:45:07,813
Ross! - What?
- Get back to your desk.

546
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:10,932
Oh, Lieutenant...
- Now! Please.

547
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:25,687
It's a man thing.
I'd better get back to my desk too.

548
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,967
Oh, Gwen. Thanks for the brush.

549
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:37,239
The gun was part of a shipment...

550
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,210
that wound up downtown.

551
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,727
The warehouse burnt down and
the watchman was killed in the fire.

552
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:48,007
Big explosion of ammunition.

553
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:51,765
Guns destroyed,
cause of the fire never established.

554
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:57,367
Company goes broke.
Insurance pays 12 million.

555
00:45:58,768 --> 00:46:00,042
Are you listening?

556
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:04,679
Like Mr. Krueger. He burnt his
luncheonette down for the insurance.

557
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:08,204
They found the silver at home.
- Same thing here.

558
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:10,836
Your gun didn't get burned.

559
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:16,843
Mama knows! When we get home,
I'm gonna make you a fresh hamburger.

560
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:22,914
She doesn't like fast food.
- It's not that. - What?

561
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:26,794
Ross' face when you said,
we think you're an asshole.

562
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,035
I gave it to him good.

563
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:33,995
Blew him away. - His ass was grass,
and I was the lawnmower.

564
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:39,311
You're really something, Mom.

565
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:48,797
I'm going to go up
and talk to these guys. Be right back.

566
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:56,996
We could do "good cop, bad cop"!
- I can handle it. Thanks.

567
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:03,236
Do you really want to go?
- You know I do. - Okay.

568
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,313
Go downstairs and sniff around.

569
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,552
I'll be upstairs with the big boys.

570
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:12,470
It's that cop.

571
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:16,349
Get in the side office
till he's gone. Move it!

572
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:20,911
Yeah, show the officer in.

573
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:26,348
Detective Joseph Bomuwski.
- Bomowski. - Good afternoon.

574
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:27,985
What can I do for you?

575
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:33,994
I'm investigating a warehouse fire,
a lot of weapons were destroyed.

576
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:36,705
You collected the insurance.
- Yes.

577
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:40,711
I hope there isn't any problem.
- What would say if we had evidence

578
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:43,754
that the weapons
weren't destroyed in the fire.

579
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:48,071
That we were the victim of a fraud.

580
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:52,753
You don't look like a victim,
you look more like a beneficiary.

581
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:58,823
Excuse me.

582
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:07,147
A woman out there
is claiming to be your mother. - No!

583
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:11,864
Sorry. - That's alright.
- They tried... - I'll handle this.

584
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:14,661
I say we work them over!
- Just wait outside.

585
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:17,028
It's almost under control.
- Joe...

586
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:22,585
they're being audited.
I know an audit when I see one.

587
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:26,869
Mom, later!
- It's the motive.

588
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,669
Gesundheit!

589
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,943
Lot of accusations flying around.

590
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,987
What do you want?

591
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:39,699
To look at the warehouse.
Any problem with that?

592
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:42,669
Do you have a warrant?

593
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:44,865
Or your mother?
- No.

594
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:46,940
But I've a good mind...

595
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:50,897
to give you
a spanking you won't forget.

596
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:57,778
Do I go to the warehouse
or do I get a warrant?

597
00:49:03,226 --> 00:49:06,104
Give the detective
the address of the warehouse...

598
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:10,418
where we had that fire,
with the keys and whatever else.

599
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:16,738
Thanks for your time. Mom, let's go!

600
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:19,704
For now you can keep your pants on.

601
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:21,981
But just remember:

602
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:25,376
I'll be back!
What? Did I embarrass you?

603
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:27,580
Yeah, "I'll be back"!

604
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:32,181
I heard a cop say that.
- Terminators say that, not cops.

605
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:33,891
Get out here!

606
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:39,092
You idiots! Not only do you
let ten cases of guns get stolen

607
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:41,891
and screw up their return.
I've now got...

608
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:45,737
some cop's weird mother
threatening to spank me!

609
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:49,895
We'll take care of them. They won't
bother you. - They'd better not.

610
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:54,416
I'll get the plane tomorrow.
All you've got to do is make sure...

611
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,129
everyone keeps quiet for 24 hours.

612
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,213
Make it look like an accident.

613
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:16,809
Don’t like the look of this.
It's dangerous, don't go.

614
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:18,935
It's not dangerous.

615
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:22,170
So I can go too?
- Oh no.

616
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:24,454
We're working so well together.

617
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:29,088
Right, and working well together
means looking out for each other.

618
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:30,975
What are you doing?

619
00:50:32,256 --> 00:50:36,248
Answer me! What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

620
00:50:36,815 --> 00:50:41,172
Looks like you're locking me in.
- Got my detective skills from you.

621
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,369
That's not gonna work.

622
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:29,999
Let's put that in here.

623
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:33,038
How does this thing go?

624
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:41,078
Hello, hello.

625
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:45,038
This is a police radio band.
Please identify yourself.

626
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,563
Tutti Bomowski, Joe's mom.

627
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:53,563
Hi, Mrs. Bomowski, this is John.
Thanks for the cookies. What's up?

628
00:51:57,086 --> 00:51:59,600
I'm so embarrassed.

629
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:04,795
Somehow I managed to lock
myself in Joe's car. Is that silly?

630
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,002
No problem, Mrs. Bomowski.

631
00:52:07,405 --> 00:52:11,716
You're going to look for a Slim Jim,
a long, thin piece of metal.

632
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:39,156
Shoot!

633
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:43,872
Jesus! - I don't want to live
in a world where my son locks me in.

634
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,875
Enough bullets in that gun?
- Quiet!

635
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,395
Because if you don't, I do.

636
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:57,872
Where did you get that?
- From your messy glove compartment.

637
00:52:58,359 --> 00:52:59,916
Give it me.
- No.

638
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:03,276
Give it to me.
- No.

639
00:53:04,278 --> 00:53:05,313
Mom, down!

640
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:11,545
Jump!

641
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:27,071
Is Pixie okay?
- She's okay.

642
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:36,708
Shit!

643
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:43,502
What are you going to do?

644
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:49,424
- Take the dog.

645
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:52,904
Get over there. - Where?
- Against the wall. - Okay.

646
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:55,706
Get back!

647
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:10,300
Stop! Police!

648
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,900
Get down!
- They're getting away!

649
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:22,058
Stop!

650
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:25,102
Or my mom will shoot!

651
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:34,505
A little high,
but not bad for a beginner.

652
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:41,021
Paulie! Start it up fast!

653
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:49,498
Turn around.
- I'm not going nowhere.

654
00:54:49,906 --> 00:54:52,897
Take it easy!
- Great collar, Joe.

655
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:57,184
Think you could mess with my boy?

656
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:00,097
Gesundheit.

657
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:08,501
Dusty here.

658
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:10,655
Put it in that chair.

659
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:14,100
Alright, file this.
- I want to see a lawyer.

660
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:16,698
And a doctor.
- You're spreading germs.

661
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:20,981
Tell Ross me and my mother
cracked his case wide open.

662
00:55:21,382 --> 00:55:24,021
Before you say anything...

663
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,732
What was that?

664
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,418
I'm just happy you've unlocked
those hidden feelings. - Feelings?

665
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,097
What do you mean? - The flowers.
I've never seen so many roses.

666
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:50,657
I don't believe it.
- What?

667
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:54,971
She's always got to interfere.
Drives me crazy! - What?

668
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,450
It was my mom.

669
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:03,686
You mean you didn't send the roses?

670
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,531
Of course I didn't.

671
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:09,369
I didn't mean it...

672
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:19,246
Mom, get your
senior citizen's butt in here!

673
00:56:19,895 --> 00:56:20,850
What?

674
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,893
Don’t say a word!

675
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,206
Something about Gwen?
- I want to talk to you!

676
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:30,084
No need to shout.
- This is my house.

677
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:34,611
I know this is hard for you,
but I've drawn up a list of rules.

678
00:56:35,013 --> 00:56:36,810
I don't like the tone of your voice.

679
00:56:37,213 --> 00:56:40,683
Rule no. 1: Never say
you don't like the tone of my voice!

680
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:42,286
Rule no. 2...

681
00:56:42,812 --> 00:56:46,202
You've written a list?
- Yes, and don't interrupt.

682
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:47,688
No. 2:

683
00:56:48,092 --> 00:56:50,844
Don’t interfere with my love life.

684
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,970
She didn't like the flowers?
- They were a big hit!

685
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,686
3: Don’t clean!
4: Don’t iron my underwear!

686
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,799
5: Never tell anyone the embarrassing
things from when I was a kid!

687
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,600
Just a minute...
- This is non-negotiable.

688
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,246
6: Don’t clean, buy, or shoot guns!

689
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:14,437
7: Here's a public
safety message: No driving!

690
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,596
8: Never say breakfast is
the most important meal. And 9:

691
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:23,045
The photos stay in New Jersey.

692
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:24,927
Anything else?

693
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:29,718
10: Sometimes forget I'm your son
and treat me like a human being.

694
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:35,685
You can't treat me like this.
- Yes, I can. Think about it.

695
00:57:44,285 --> 00:57:48,278
You think making me follow
these rules will improve your life?

696
00:57:48,685 --> 00:57:54,520
I'm not listening.
- I'll tell you what your problem is.

697
00:57:54,924 --> 00:58:00,281
Rule no. 11: Don’t tell me
what my problem is. I know what it is.

698
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:02,878
An old lady with a dog.

699
00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:07,276
You don't love enough. If someone
gets close, you shut them out.

700
00:58:07,683 --> 00:58:09,513
Like me and Gwen.
- You see this?

701
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:12,152
She turned into Or. Ruth!

702
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:14,996
It scares you that Gwen loves you.

703
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:19,758
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them.

704
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:22,436
What are you talking about?
- About waking up...

705
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:25,274
and finding you're 60 years old...

706
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,752
in a little apartment
all by yourself, wishing you had...

707
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,832
someone as special as Gwen.

708
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,236
She's right.
- She's really upset.

709
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:37,072
Finished?

710
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:44,627
For your information:
I didn't dump Gwen, she dumped me.

711
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:36,428
Gwen, I just...

712
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:40,986
I just called to say you're special.

713
00:59:41,392 --> 00:59:43,859
Oh Christ, that's ridiculous.

714
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,543
I just called...

715
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:50,628
to say that you're so special.

716
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:55,859
And when you meet
someone special, you should...

717
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,465
grab hold.

718
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:01,265
You should grab hold of them.

719
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:02,940
Oh, come on!

720
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,180
Just do it right.

721
01:00:05,589 --> 01:00:09,501
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them. - Joe?

722
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:14,897
What are you doing here so late?

723
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,866
Just catching up on paperwork.

724
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,655
I had to pick some stuff up.

725
01:00:26,346 --> 01:00:28,337
Want to catch up on paperwork, too?

726
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:30,736
Sure.

727
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,461
To paperwork.

728
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:45,863
Look...

729
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:48,855
I'm sorry that I hit you.

730
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:52,733
I was just
disappointed about the flowers.

731
01:00:53,143 --> 01:00:56,135
I deserved to get hit.
I made a mess of everything.

732
01:00:56,543 --> 01:01:00,501
I wish I'd sent you the flowers.

733
01:01:00,982 --> 01:01:01,971
Really?

734
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:11,619
You're so special.

735
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:16,455
When you meet
someone as special as you,

736
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,851
you should grab them.

737
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,934
Otherwise, one morning
you'll wake up and you're 60,

738
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:29,376
living alone in a little apartment.

739
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:31,895
And you wish...

740
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:36,088
you had the chance
to love someone as special as you.

741
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,210
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's said to me.

742
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:58,206
My mother said it, Gwen.

743
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:03,893
Your mother? - She was right.
Jesus, it kills me.

744
01:02:06,175 --> 01:02:07,812
Does this kill you?

745
01:02:33,171 --> 01:02:35,890
Hey, boss. What's happening?
- There you are.

746
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:38,725
Take a look at this note.

747
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,889
"I regret my life of crime.

748
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:48,043
I can't live anymore. J. Parnell."

749
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,519
Well, what do you think?

750
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:55,168
You've been under pressure lately.

751
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:58,129
You might be overreacting.

752
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:01,247
We've got the weapons,
we're going to South America,

753
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:05,197
and claiming lots of money.
Why are you so depressed?

754
01:03:05,608 --> 01:03:08,201
I'm not going to kill myself.

755
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:10,845
It's part of the plan.

756
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:15,683
They read the note, we disappear.
Then they don't come looking for us.

757
01:03:17,446 --> 01:03:18,720
Good idea.

758
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:21,640
No, no. That's a great idea.

759
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:24,513
There's one for you too. You sign that

760
01:03:24,925 --> 01:03:26,836
and we can get out of here.

761
01:03:28,565 --> 01:03:31,238
Make sure you sign it clearly.

762
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,998
Let me take a look at that.

763
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:46,922
Very nice.

764
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:56,234
That hurts.

765
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:24,550
"Dear Joe. I'm sorry. I can't
help myself. I love you too much.

766
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:28,155
I've left to be
out of your way. Love, Mom. PS:

767
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,829
About the flowers.
I've ruined it for you and Gwen.

768
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:35,593
Maybe one day
you can forgive me. PPS:

769
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,989
There's a pineapple
upside-down cake in the icebox."

770
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:40,432
Damn!

771
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:50,387
Hey!
- Sorry!

772
01:04:58,634 --> 01:04:59,623
Excuse me!

773
01:05:31,191 --> 01:05:32,908
Wait!
- Hey, slow down.

774
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,939
You alright?

775
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,585
Mom, stop!

776
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:43,182
No, Joe,
you got to live your own life.

777
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:46,308
You were right.
I don't want you to go.

778
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:50,223
Slow down. - You were right
about grabbing onto Gwen.

779
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:52,061
I was wrong.

780
01:05:52,468 --> 01:05:54,777
When I told her,
it changed everything.

781
01:05:55,988 --> 01:05:59,457
It did?
- Yes. Mom, I want you to stay.

782
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:02,062
Quick, stop the cart!

783
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:10,059
Really?

784
01:06:11,626 --> 01:06:13,059
You know I do.

785
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:20,496
Now tell me.

786
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:23,260
What did Gwen say when you told her?

787
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:26,815
That it's the sweetest thing
anyone ever said to her.

788
01:06:27,224 --> 01:06:30,341
And then?
- That's what she said.

789
01:06:30,744 --> 01:06:34,941
You didn't propose to her?
- No, but I mean it's a beginning.

790
01:06:35,343 --> 01:06:39,131
It's a missed opportunity.
- Wait. Wait.

791
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:42,375
Stop right there.
- What?

792
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:45,573
You're doing it again.
- What?

793
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:48,893
Interfering. Rule no. 2.

794
01:06:49,302 --> 01:06:51,895
You can't be serious about the rules?

795
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,654
Gate 18, fast!
Don’t want her to miss her flight.

796
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,778
What are you doing?

797
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:03,616
Have a nice ride home.
- What are you doing?

798
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,732
Thank you. Joey!

799
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:11,217
Joseph A. Bomowski,
this is your mother talking.

800
01:07:12,739 --> 01:07:16,367
Wait a minute!
Can't we discuss these rules?

801
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:20,976
They're non-negotiable.
- What about a little flexibility?

802
01:07:21,378 --> 01:07:26,087
Flexibility? Give you an inch,
you take the entire turnpike. - Okay.

803
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:28,215
Okay what?

804
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,535
The rules.

805
01:07:30,937 --> 01:07:32,289
You got a deal.

806
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:36,768
You got a deal.

807
01:07:45,655 --> 01:07:50,170
It'll be the best weekend
we ever spent together. - Maybe not.

808
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,729
Stay here.

809
01:08:42,608 --> 01:08:46,123
Got him! - I told you
to wait outside. - Yeah, yeah.

810
01:08:46,528 --> 01:08:49,088
You promised to leave me alone.

811
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:51,239
So, I'll start tomorrow.

812
01:08:51,647 --> 01:08:53,285
I give up.

813
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:59,200
Holy moley!
That's the guy who sold me the gun.

814
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:01,437
It is?
- Yeah.

815
01:09:02,926 --> 01:09:06,474
More chocolate, Mitchell?
- No thanks, Mrs. Bomowski.

816
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:08,762
You, sweetie?
- No, I'm fine.

817
01:09:09,165 --> 01:09:12,521
Why'd you come here?
It's not even my case.

818
01:09:12,925 --> 01:09:15,074
To save my girlfriend's life.

819
01:09:17,164 --> 01:09:19,837
My house ain't safe.
My brother's dead.

820
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,597
I got nowhere to go.

821
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:24,198
Any idea who these people are?

822
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:30,474
We stole a few cases of shooters
but there were thousands of them.

823
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:35,480
The ones supposed to have
been destroyed. We got them. - Where?

824
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:39,591
Brunswick airstrip.
Outside of Ventura. It went bankrupt.

825
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:44,677
A savings and loan took it over.
- Great. Joe and I'll check it out.

826
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:50,478
Remember when I was in school,
every week you would call my teachers

827
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,189
to see if I was doing good
and cutting class.

828
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,830
Embarrassed the hell out of me.

829
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,276
It wasn't you didn't trust me...

830
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,237
you just wanted to make sure...

831
01:10:01,639 --> 01:10:04,551
I didn't get into trouble.

832
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:08,275
You finally understand.
- I do understand.

833
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:12,914
And I want you
to understand why I have to do...

834
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:15,592
this!

835
01:10:18,477 --> 01:10:19,546
Whoa, bummer!

836
01:10:26,196 --> 01:10:29,427
I once did this before
when Joey was 9.

837
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:33,993
He got his head caught in a railing.
The problem was his ears.

838
01:10:34,675 --> 01:10:39,146
They were so big for his age.
They kept getting caught on the bars.

839
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:42,713
I got it. I did it.

840
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:47,227
I'm out! I did it!
- Yo, Mrs. B! Way to go, babe!

841
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:50,022
Sometimes I impress myself.

842
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:52,185
Could you help me off?

843
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,541
Where's my gun? I'm outta here.
- With your keys in the bathroom.

844
01:10:57,952 --> 01:10:59,271
Thanks, babe.

845
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,098
Major bummer.

846
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,626
Sorry, Mitchell.
I need your car.

847
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:27,624
And I don't think
Joey wants you going off to Mexico.

848
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:31,385
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.

849
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:37,577
Be back to get you, babe.

850
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:09,453
Get back.

851
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:37,338
Sergeant Bomowski. I need assistance
at Brunkswick airstrip, right away.

852
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:09,856
Let me go!
- Hurry up.

853
01:13:14,976 --> 01:13:17,729
Move it. Come on.

854
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:21,728
Where's your little boy?

855
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:25,172
You won't get away with this.
My Joe will be all over you.

856
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,647
Get her on the plane,
so her son can't interfere.

857
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:32,649
When we get her over the ocean,
we'll see how well she can swim.

858
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:35,204
Move it! Move it!

859
01:13:41,813 --> 01:13:42,802
Sit down.

860
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:36,606
Shit!

861
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,391
Get out there and find him.

862
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:57,226
Get off. Take her down.

863
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,150
Oh God!

864
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,388
Where are you taking me?

865
01:16:03,797 --> 01:16:05,787
Shut up!
- Joey!

866
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:19,630
There you are. Drop it!

867
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:24,984
You okay?
- Why are you here?

868
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:27,749
I came to back you up.
- Get him inside!

869
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,067
Let her go.

870
01:16:31,473 --> 01:16:34,783
Do you think
I'd be content with just killing you?

871
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:36,911
Let her go!

872
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:38,632
Or what?

873
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,426
It's over. Parnell, it's all over.

874
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:48,629
Get the car.
I'll tell you what's over.

875
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:52,746
Say goodbye to your little boy.

876
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,745
You're next. Hold it!

877
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,459
You know...

878
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:06,267
this is really going
to give me a great deal of pleasure.

879
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:26,976
Nobody hurts my baby.

880
01:17:44,905 --> 01:17:48,374
Gee whiz. You shot him.

881
01:17:50,144 --> 01:17:51,975
No shit.

882
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:54,821
Mom, you saved my life.

883
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:57,778
That's what moms are for.

884
01:18:09,302 --> 01:18:12,294
I can't believe it,
but I'm sad to see you go.

885
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:17,172
Don’t worry. I'll be back.
- Not too soon, I hope. Just kidding.

886
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:20,097
It's been great, Tutti.
- Such fun.

887
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:24,334
I can see why you like police work.
It's so stimulating. - Yeah.

888
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,652
Can I see the ring?
- Okay.

889
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,857
Beautiful. I couldn't have done
better if I'd picked it out myself.

890
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:36,649
I thought you did.
- Mom, that's your flight.

891
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:42,810
Well, thanks for everything.

892
01:18:47,937 --> 01:18:50,132
I think that man is a criminal.

893
01:18:51,257 --> 01:18:53,452
I recognize him from TV.

894
01:18:53,857 --> 01:18:56,768
I don't think so. You'll be late.
- Joe, look.

895
01:18:57,176 --> 01:18:59,007
He's trying to avoid the detector!

896
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:00,735
Please!
- Hey, young man!

897
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,366
Don’t give me that innocent look.

898
01:19:03,776 --> 01:19:08,007
My son is a police officer.
Draw your gun. He's getting away.

899
01:19:09,815 --> 01:19:11,806
Rule no. 12: Listen to your mother!

900
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,328
Move!

901
01:19:24,853 --> 01:19:26,491
Here. Cuffs!

902
01:19:26,893 --> 01:19:29,771
Let us through. Police.

903
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:33,927
Joey, now I remember what he did.

904
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:36,251
He shot his mother!

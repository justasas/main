1
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,612
These bad guys are always late.
They'll be here.

2
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,989
When, Tony?
We've been sitting here two hours.

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:44,078
The meeting's been planned for weeks.
They'll be here. Be patient, alright?

4
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,448
Yeah, so will the Easter bunny,
and my next birthday!

5
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,450
And guess what...

6
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,331
It's about goddamn time!

7
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,769
Got the money?

8
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,685
No, food stamps.
I don't trust this dude.

9
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,359
I deal in stolen merchandise.
I'm not very trustworthy.

10
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,112
You show up late...

11
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,035
and then you ask dumb questions.
Could be a cop.

12
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,913
Or Elvis or the Wizard of Oz.
Do you want to deal or not?

13
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,095
Alright, show him the stuff.

14
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,969
Come on. Hurry up. I'm late.

15
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,522
Back off!
Really?

16
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,864
Police! Stop!

17
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,074
Nobody listens.

18
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,244
Tony, get over here!

19
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,124
Come on!

20
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,163
I'm hit.

21
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,788
Where? I can't move my leg.
It's not your leg,

22
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,839
you've got glass in your ass!

23
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,691
First these guys show up late,
and then they ask dumb questions.

24
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,197
Then they shoot you in the ass.
They're pissing me off!

25
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,285
Beginner's luck!

26
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,504
68...

27
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,429
69...

28
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,261
70...

29
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,306
Joe, she's not in.
She's in, I know it.

30
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,389
Then why don't she answer?

31
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,433
Knows it's me. She's just watching
the phone ring and not answering.

32
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,072
I can feel it.
She's trying to grind me down.

33
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,483
You're crazy, Joe.

34
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,527
You're out of your tiny Jersey mind.

35
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,887
80...

36
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,884
81...

37
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:15,112
Hey, it's Detective Alka-Seltzer!
Not today, okay, Ross.

38
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:23,213
Thanks, Ray. - Is it true
you used Tony's butt for cover?

39
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:28,179
Boy, there's a butt
I could use for cover.

40
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,546
Watch what you say about Gwen.
About "Gwen"?

41
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,977
I'm sorry, Joe.
Are you and the lieutenant involved?

42
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,145
If I thought you were involved,
I never would have said a word.

43
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,944
Joe, Lieutenant wants to see you.
I think she's in a weird mood.

44
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,656
Lovers' tiff?

45
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,199
Morning!
Sit down.

46
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,457
Know what I was just thinking about?

47
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,794
Remember Catalina? - Of course.
Great weekend. The best.

48
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,844
It was great because I was in love.
Me too.

49
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,723
Remember what I said Sunday morning
when we were sitting on the terrace?

50
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,149
That you'd like me to nibble all...
Not that.

51
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,360
I was the first man to...

52
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,311
The other stuff.

53
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,274
Oh, the feelings stuff.

54
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,148
Right.

55
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:37,370
Feelings and responsibilities stuff.
Come on, Gwen.

56
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,207
If this is about the bust...
I'm not talking about that fiasco.

57
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,957
You go out getting drunk,
while I stay up worrying!

58
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,091
You didn't call!

59
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,083
It was late.
Didn’t want to wake you.

60
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,964
Here, hold this.
Why?

61
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,516
Pretend we're talking business.

62
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,475
Don’t want the precinct knowing.

63
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,306
I think they already know.
What was I to think?

64
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,811
They said somebody got hit.

65
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,938
Then that Tony got hit
and you went to get more beer!

66
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,616
Honey, it's true.
I had a few drinks with the guys.

67
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,079
Yeah?
Yeah.

68
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,201
That's funny, because Lou told me
you spent the evening on the phone.

69
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,581
So tell me,

70
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,373
who were you calling?
It sure wasn't me!

71
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,629
My mom.

72
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,930
Excuse me?

73
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,473
I was calling my mom.

74
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,563
You were calling your mom
at 2:30 in the morning.

75
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,983
That's the most pathetic excuse!
Tell me who she is.

76
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,024
She isn't anybody, she's my mom.

77
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,860
It doesn't really matter.
Could be your mom or a Dial-a-Bimbo.

78
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,077
It's over! - You don't mean that.
I mean every word.

79
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,494
It's embarrassing me in my work.
You run away from responsibility.

80
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,664
I'll pack your... - I'm not going to
listen to this. - Where you going?

81
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,205
Fishing!

82
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,045
Get back in here!

83
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,339
Get back in this office, Bomowski!
That's an order.

84
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,768
Mom, I know you're there.

85
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,562
Come on!

86
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,349
Please God, make her pick up.

87
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,105
Okay, that's it.
I've had it. I've really had it.

88
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,736
I'm a dead man.

89
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,762
This the New York flight?
Yes, coming out right now.

90
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,946
Relax, kid, relax.

91
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,285
I think that's him. Yeah, it is.

92
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,867
Little Joey!

93
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,631
You must be Joe?
Yes. Why?

94
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,380
I was a bed-wetter too.

95
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,506
It was so sweet!

96
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,716
He said, "Mommy,
my pee-pee got stuck in my zipper!"

97
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,640
Joey! There's my Joey!
There's my little boy.

98
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,155
Come here!

99
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,198
You've given up shaving.
No, I shave.

100
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,697
Call that a shave?
I shaved.

101
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,582
Did you use a lawnmower?

102
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,326
What girl is going to marry you,

103
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,710
if you don't shave!
Hi, Tutti!

104
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,549
This is little Joey?
Looks a lot different in clothes.

105
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:20,131
We've got to be getting along now,
but thanks for showing us the photos.

106
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,138
You looked real sexy in diapers.

107
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,055
Sally, if things don't work out
with the doctor, Joey's single!

108
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,348
I've always been a sucker
for a guy in Pampers!

109
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,240
What?

110
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,323
I can't get over you driving.
I've been driving for 20 years!

111
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,197
You'll always be my little Joey.

112
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,286
Where were you the last few days?

113
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,174
At home in New Jersey. Where else?
I must've called you 50 times.

114
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,176
That was you?
Why didn't you answer?

115
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,091
For 5 years,
every time I'm about to visit,

116
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,934
you call and say it's a bad time.

117
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,356
This time I decided
I wouldn't answer the phone.

118
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,147
That's the most...
Watch out!

119
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,240
Moron!
Up yours, pal!

120
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,333
Sorry.
Shall I drive? No!

121
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,463
No, Mom.

122
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,792
I'm okay.

123
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,052
That was a close call, Pixie.

124
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,551
All cars near 4th and Main,

125
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,428
Please respond
to 486 South Main Street. Code 2.

126
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:02,194
What's going on? - Got a jumper
up there. Looks like he'll do it.

127
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,753
Did the shrink show up?
He's on his way.

128
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,665
Stay here.

129
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,331
Where are you going?
Up there.

130
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,419
It's too dangerous. Listen.

131
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,596
I do this all the time.
I'm not bad at it.

132
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,264
I want you to stay here
and let me take care of this.

133
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,926
Be careful!
Don’t do anything foolish!

134
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,484
What seems to be the man's problem?
He wants to talk to his mother.

135
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,983
They've been having problems.

136
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,239
Really?

137
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,829
I'll take care of this, officer.

138
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,471
Hey, how are you doing? Alright?
Leave me alone. Don’t touch me!

139
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,598
Stay back, I'm gonna do it!
I just want to talk to you.

140
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,014
Don’t tell me what to do!

141
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,141
Stay there, I'm going to do it!
Hey you, young man!

142
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,776
Down here! I'm not your mother,

143
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,531
but I am a mother
and you could talk to me,

144
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,865
if that's alright. - Officer,
this is serious. - Let her talk.

145
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,654
What do you want?

146
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,498
I just want you to know
the man next to you is my son.

147
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,047
We've had our difficulties.
Mom, stay out of this, okay?

148
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:46,166
Joe, wave to the crowd.
Mom. Goddamnit!

149
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,718
You don't swear to your mother.

150
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,472
Butt out, it's my mother.
So do what she tells you.

151
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,218
Start waving or I'm jumping.

152
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,730
Start waving!
Start waving or I'm jumping!

153
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,353
I'm waving. See?
Mom, hi.

154
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:07,772
By the way, Joe's still single.
How do you like that?

155
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,987
He's a very nice boy.
A bit rough round the edge,

156
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,120
but nothing the right girl couldn't
smooth out. - Secure the megaphone.

157
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,203
We used to fight all the time.
He was very small for his age.

158
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,924
I was not! I was average height!
About your height. What's the deal?

159
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,506
Bet she's got pictures.
I've got pictures, wait a minute.

160
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,300
She's got pictures.
Mom, get rid of the pictures!

161
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,768
Isn't he adorable?

162
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,981
I thought I had things bad.
Not close.

163
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,895
I'm ready to go in now.

164
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,604
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Yeah.

165
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,110
That guy needs help.

166
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:58,080
Lesley Carnel, Channel 8 News.
We're downtown at 4th and Main,

167
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,121
where a man is on a ledge,

168
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,756
apparently despondent
about his mother. - Make her stop!

169
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,934
Are we here?

170
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,515
Is that your house?

171
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,734
What?

172
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,236
It's very, very nice.
What's the matter. Nothing.

173
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,242
You sniffed.

174
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,323
No, it's nothing. Only...

175
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,081
Only what?

176
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,580
Won't get a girl if you don't clean.

177
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,758
I clean this house every morning.
I clean and I clean.

178
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:54,506
It's not clean.
Filled with dust. Look at this!

179
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,300
You could grow things on it.

180
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:03,723
What's this? There's stuff under it.
Is that the closet?

181
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,604
No!
What?

182
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,730
I've had a few problems
since my cleaning lady left.

183
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,615
Maybe she's lost in there.

184
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,463
Pineapple chunks?
They're your favorite!

185
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,507
We've got them here too.

186
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:35,761
They don't taste the same.
It's canned, exactly the same.

187
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,808
My son, the gourmet? Ha, ha.
Come on up, darling.

188
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:58,159
This is the way we clean the house,
clean the house, clean the house.

189
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:03,157
This is the way we clean the house,
early in the morning...

190
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,203
Oh God, make her stop!

191
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,467
Thank you, God.

192
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,386
I owe you.

193
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,074
What's this?

194
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,569
Oh, Joe's gun.

195
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,284
Look at this, all greasy and dirty.

196
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,617
Let's see...

197
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,162
There we go.
This and this...

198
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,381
Some of this...

199
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,671
Let's see... A little of that...

200
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,593
That's gonna be good!

201
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,140
Where do they keep the bullets?

202
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,643
Oh, not in there.

203
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,026
What's this little thing here?

204
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:19,653
Oh, goodness gracious.
Yes, that's where they are.

205
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,650
Okay, we'll wash those too.

206
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,167
This is the way we wash our gun,
wash our gun, wash our gun...

207
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:38,173
This is the way we wash our gun,
early in the morning.

208
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,631
Going to clean that out
really well. That's fine.

209
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,229
Go ahead, make your bed!

210
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:02,282
What did you do to my gun?
Nothing, I cleaned it.

211
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,660
You ruined it!

212
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,574
You took all the bluing off!

213
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,332
Chlorox? Great!
It's going to blow up in my hand now.

214
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,745
Try to do something helpful...

215
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,831
Nice and original.

216
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,045
You get barked at! Come on, Pix!

217
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:24,926
Mom, I'm sorry. It's an old gun.
I don't use it any more.

218
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,102
Breakfast!
Mom!

219
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:39,437
Nothing I haven't seen before.
Would you turn around please?

220
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,533
Both of you!

221
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,034
God.

222
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:49,446
Pixie and I thought we'd pop
into the station, see where you work.

223
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,460
Did you cut yourself?

224
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:56,662
No!
Need some iodine? No!

225
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,252
A Band-Aid? - No!
The station is out of the question.

226
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,172
Absolutely unequivocally.

227
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,013
We'll talk over breakfast.
I'm serious.

228
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,301
What did I always tell you?
Breakfast is the most important meal.

229
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,522
Start on these, and I'll scramble
some eggs. - I don't like eggs.

230
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,941
If you don't eat them for breakfast,
they'll be waiting for you at dinner.

231
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,786
Bye, sweetie, have a nice day.
Oh, Joey...

232
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,833
You forgot your lunch!

233
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:53,266
We're not off
to a very good start, are we, Pixie?

234
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,646
Know what we should do?

235
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,684
We should get
Joey something a little special.

236
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,231
Let's see...

237
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,157
You want to get out here?

238
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,994
I mean, look at this place...

239
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,545
Ridiculous! I'm from Newark.

240
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,680
If you want stopping power,
this is your baby.

241
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,219
Charter Arms,.44, Bulldog.

242
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,847
No, my son's is bigger.
I got a bottle brush down the barrel.

243
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,064
You put a brush down the barrel?

244
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,100
Yeah, I wanted to clean out...
Never mind.

245
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,814
Okay, bigger. How about this?

246
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,283
That's it!

247
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,863
Taurus, PT,.99, long barrel.
Punch a hole through a Pontiac.

248
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:56,744
How much? - $450. - $450?
The Bulldog is only $325.

249
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,498
No, I want the big one.
Don’t suppose you gift-wrap? - No.

250
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,842
I'll take it like that.
There's a coolingoff period.

251
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:09,677
Give me your driver's license.
I'll do the paperwork.

252
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,885
In 2 weeks it's yours.
I need it today!

253
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,015
Sorry, that's the law.

254
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,479
Can I have it back?

255
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,235
Come on, Pixie.

256
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,698
Hey, lady!

257
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,948
You want to buy a gun today?

258
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,534
You got a gun for sale?

259
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,298
You do?
Step into my office.

260
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,339
Lightweight, adjustable stock.
No!

261
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,134
I want a Taurus.99 long barrel.

262
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,300
Your son will love this.

263
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,509
What'll he do with that? He carries
his gun under his jacket. - Wait!

264
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,180
Wait a minute. Here, here.

265
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,644
What about one of these?
You've seen Miami Vice.

266
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:09,733
This is a Mac 10.
All the big dealers love this gun.

267
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,365
I don't think that's exactly my Joey.

268
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,573
That's a full automatic. That means

269
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:20,161
30 shots in 2.5 seconds.
You can cut down trees with it.

270
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,744
How much?
$500.

271
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,092
$350.

272
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,139
They're there.
Great.

273
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,317
Bless you.
I'm coming down with something.

274
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,772
You've got allergies.
I've got a fever.

275
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,989
The Santa Anna wind's very heavy.

276
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,531
What do you know about it!

277
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:02,451
Yeah? - Mr. Parnell, we've located
the misappropriated merchandise.

278
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,751
If you're certain it's ours...

279
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,167
then repossess it.
Yes, sir.

280
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:12,292
Bless you. - Let's go?
To work! Let's go.

281
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:18,474
Do you want to sell me the gun,
or sit dreaming about $500?

282
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,400
Okay. Don’t forget that extra clip.

283
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,195
Nice doing business with you.

284
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,613
Come on, Pixie!

285
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,056
He's going round the front.

286
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,058
Damn!

287
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,158
Morning!

288
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,120
There you go.
Thanks.

289
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,924
Hangover?

290
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,975
Heartburn.

291
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,680
What did you eat for breakfast?

292
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,186
Juice, fruit, milk,

293
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,480
eggs, bacon and sausage,

294
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,478
hash browns,

295
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,279
toast, pancakes,

296
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,321
honey rolls,

297
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,704
Cocoa Puffs. There's more.

298
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:54,790
You must've been starving.
I wasn't hungry.

299
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,631
My mother's visiting.

300
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:04,429
Well, when your mamma cooks,
she cooks.

301
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,682
Mind you...

302
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:12,306
breakfast is supposed
to be the most important meal.

303
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,522
Thank you, Tony.

304
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,823
Have a nice day.
Hey, Joe. Yeah?

305
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,286
Thank God you've arrived.
Why?

306
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,123
Your mom's here.
My mom? Yes.

307
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,378
Chicken pox?

308
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,583
Looks very good in spots.

309
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,678
Told everybody it was freckles.

310
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:46,635
Mom, are you okay?
Fine. These things happen.

311
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,180
What things? - She witnessed
a murder. - A murder?

312
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,725
Yeah, downtown.
What were you doing downtown?

313
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,317
Shopping. Just relax. Have a cookie.
Shut up!

314
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:02,908
Maybe I should get the lieutenant...
What's going on?

315
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,118
Nothing.
I'm a witness.

316
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,328
Who is this?
I'll introduce you.

317
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:11,615
Ross, you better shut up, I mean it.
This is Tutti, Joey's mom.

318
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,576
Joey's mom?
That's right, Gwen.

319
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:19,090
My mom.
As you can see,

320
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,380
it's been a shock for her,
so I'm taking her home.

321
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:27,217
Mrs. Bomowski is one of my
principle witnesses. - Your witness?

322
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:32,981
It's my case. Your mom's happy
to stay to the end of the month.

323
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,441
You said what?

324
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:39,894
You are so beautiful, Gwen.
That lovely hair and that smile.

325
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,525
Joey, if you'd worn your retainers,
you could've had teeth like that.

326
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,406
Say goodbye, we're going home.
Not so fast.

327
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,904
I want to interview the witness.

328
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:53,913
What are you trying to do? - To you?
This is just ridiculous!

329
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,254
It's ridiculous
your mother witnessed a murder?

330
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,708
No, Ross sticking his head into it.

331
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,668
I can't transfer it to you.
He's told her to stay in town.

332
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:08,425
She's supposed to go back Monday.
That was before the killing.

333
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,892
Can't we fly her back? If she stays
past Monday, I'll kill her myself.

334
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:18,359
What's wrong with you?
She seems wonderful. Warm, caring...

335
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,062
Obviously crazy about you.
Crazy is right.

336
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,107
She talks to total strangers
about my diaper rash!

337
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,619
She loves you, Joe.
Her love is driving me nuts!

338
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,161
Either way, she's staying.

339
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,994
Joe, come on. How bad can it be?

340
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:43,378
Two, three weeks tops.

341
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,222
This is about us, right?

342
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,051
This is about revenge?

343
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,897
Are you suggesting
I would use my rank? - Yes!

344
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,271
Don’t let the door hit you
on your way out, Detective.

345
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,775
You can call me Lieutenant.

346
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,584
Don’t be so gloomy! Think of all
the time we'll spend together.

347
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,380
Don’t you want to hear my plan?

348
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,170
I want to brush my teeth
and go to bed.

349
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,628
You and I can crack this case.

350
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,759
When we find the killer,
you'll probably be promoted.

351
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,306
And things will work out with Gwen.

352
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,730
Goodnight.

353
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:55,363
I didn't tell Ross what I really saw.

354
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,867
I held it all back for you.

355
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,922
You're joking, right, Mom?
No, it's not a joke.

356
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,047
You can't fool around with homicide.

357
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,628
You need this to get promoted.

358
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:15,054
I don't want a promotion.
You're only a sergeant. I like it.

359
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,766
Next you'll tell me
you like where you live.

360
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,272
I do. Mom, I'm happy.
I don't want to get promoted.

361
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,226
I don't want to get married.
I like my life.

362
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,698
I can wear my underwear more than
once, leave the toilet seat up...

363
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:33,984
Watch what I want on TV.
Mom, I like my life!

364
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:37,248
You call this a life?

365
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,588
Goodnight, Mom.

366
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,769
Back off, back off!

367
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,158
I'm going in.
He has an automatic.

368
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,533
Joe, are you crazy?

369
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,091
Mom, what are you doing here?

370
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,344
Mommy's got to change you.

371
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,849
I don't want to be changed.

372
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,727
I've got to change you.
I can change you.

373
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,530
Stop trying to change me!

374
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,754
Joey, are you alright?
I'm fine.

375
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:15,003
Sounded like you were having
a bad dream. - No, I'm fine, really.

376
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,348
I should tuck you in.
Don’t, Mom.

377
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,100
Let me tuck you in.
I don't wanna be tucked in.

378
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,019
Joey, let me tuck you in.

379
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,270
You just snuggle down.
I don't wanna snuggle.

380
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,185
You were just having a bad dream.

381
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:39,031
Remember when you were little
and I used to sing to you.

382
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:42,206
Oh, God!
Aw, shush.

383
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:47,120
See if we can remember how that goes.
Mom, please don't.

384
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:56,135
Lullaby and goodnight,
thy mother's delight.

385
00:34:56,555 --> 00:35:02,344
With down overspread,
here's baby's wee bed.

386
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,439
Lullaby and goodnight,

387
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,106
lay thee down now and rest.

388
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,605
Lullaby and goodnight,

389
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:17,573
may thy slumber be best.

390
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,584
Goodnight, Joey.

391
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,921
Morning, Mom.

392
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:42,588
Better get going or we'll be late.
I didn't want to wake you.

393
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,271
Better get you to the station
for your 9:30 appointment with Ross.

394
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,975
I'm not saying anything.
I won't argue.

395
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:57,942
If he arrests you for withholding
evidence, that's your problem.

396
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,364
Suppose you don't want your present?

397
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,402
Present?
Just a little something...

398
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,333
A present?

399
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,917
You don't deserve it.
Come on, Mom. Please.

400
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,132
I love presents.

401
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,384
It's heavy.

402
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,436
Jesus!

403
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:35,856
Is it the wrong kind? - Wrong kind?
It's illegal. Where did you get it?

404
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,652
From those guys who got shot.

405
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,901
A machine gun off the back of a van?

406
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,734
In the store
they said I had to "cool off."

407
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:46,700
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,365
I wanted it to be a surprise.

409
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,668
It is!

410
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,746
You're saying it was a big car?

411
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,505
Don’t know
if I'd call it big exactly.

412
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,969
So it was a small car.

413
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,719
Difficult to say. To me it was big.
To you it might have been small.

414
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,143
Like a Cadillac?
Which model?

415
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,846
Any model!

416
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,564
A few years ago...

417
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,320
there was a small one.
Was it like the Cimarron?

418
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,325
No.

419
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,820
Definitely not like the Cimarron.

420
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,247
Let's take a break.

421
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:34,452
You're tired.
Are you eating right?

422
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,046
I could bring you
some lentil soup. - Be right back.

423
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,672
So far, so good, Pixie.

424
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,184
Gwen, do you have a minute?
Sure.

425
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:54,731
Jesus! That's a full automatic.
I know.

426
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,230
And your mother... Okay, Joe.
I'll trace the gun. - Thanks.

427
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:03,440
No telling what she'll come home with.
I know.

428
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,073
I really appreciate it.
If you don't mind?

429
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:10,077
Try not to kill anyone with it.
She's too little. Wouldn't hit her.

430
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:16,291
Who's the little boy by the pool?
Joey, only 9 and all those muscles!

431
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,833
You can already see
he's going to have nice equipment.

432
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:25,002
Don’t be embarrassed.
I'm old, but I'm still a woman.

433
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,680
Tell me, do you love my Joey?

434
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,479
I don't know.
I did love him. Maybe I still do.

435
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:36,139
He loves you.
He never shows it.

436
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:40,267
That's Joey.
Doesn’t mean he doesn't love you.

437
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:43,981
If he'd just show me how he feels!

438
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:47,574
A box of candy,
a bunch of flowers...

439
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:51,862
He never sent you flowers?
Never. Oh, Joe...

440
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,960
And me being a lieutenant
just makes things worse.

441
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,370
Did you see this one?

442
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:00,880
Very serious looking.
How old is he there?

443
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,918
13. This was taken
just after his father died.

444
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,135
I went to pieces,
no good for anything for days.

445
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,467
Joey did everything.

446
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:15,309
He arranged the funeral,
called the family...

447
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,599
picked out the casket...

448
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,267
talked to the priest...

449
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,771
But he never cried.

450
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,655
I know Joe loved his father.

451
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:31,239
But to this day
I don't know if he ever cried.

452
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,177
You were talking about something.
It was nothing.

453
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:51,545
You were both crying!
Girl talk. You wouldn't understand.

454
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,644
You have a gift for starting trouble.

455
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:59,059
Don’t interfere with Gwen and me.
Well, somebody has to.

456
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,318
She's a lovely girl,
and you never send her flowers.

457
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,316
I'll get the door.

458
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,909
Mom, this is the point of no return!

459
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,371
I've had it.

460
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,825
I've completely had it.
I'm taking you to the apartment,

461
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:22,161
I'm going to handcuff you to a sink,
and put you on the first plane home.

462
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,961
Here you are. Let's go.

463
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:39,978
Ask me what I saw!
I don't want to know.

464
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,475
Ask me.
No!

465
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,528
Ask me what I saw.

466
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,437
You're an old lady from Newark.

467
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:52,448
You knit, make jam,
talk on the phone. That's it!

468
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,282
What did you see?

469
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:01,032
The man who sold me the gun.
The one that got away. And his van.

470
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,668
Really? Was he little? Big?

471
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:07,422
Big, 6' 3", 320 lbs.

472
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:12,339
He had a tattoo of a coiled snake
with "God Rides a Harley" above it.

473
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:18,055
Will you remember this?
A Chevy van, gun-metal gray, an '82.

474
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,471
The year with the longer wheelbase.

475
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,142
License plate:

476
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,973
JL2-661.

477
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,781
This is 90W2, give me 90W90.

478
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:35,655
Go ahead, 90W2.

479
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:40,872
Could you find Tony and tell him
I need another favor. - 10-4.

480
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:46,039
Where's your boyfriend and the guns?
What are you talking about?

481
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,252
I hardly know the guy.

482
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,132
Paulie, nothing down there.

483
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:57,346
Check the garage. - I did,
there's nothing. - Well, check there.

484
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,944
Is this the house?
That's where the van's registered.

485
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:13,982
Shall I cover the back?
We're not partners!

486
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,784
Okay, okay.

487
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,825
We're not connecting here, honey.

488
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,832
Keep her quiet!

489
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,422
Wrong house?

490
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:35,220
Help me! Help me!

491
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,552
Come on.

492
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:43,766
Oh gosh, no!

493
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,400
Okay?
Yeah.

494
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,106
Joey, are you alright?

495
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,492
Don’t jump!

496
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:33,268
Get in, sweetie!
We're gonna nail those turkeys!

497
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:37,115
Okay, Ma. Make a right!
Okay. That's good.

498
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,804
Sorry.
It was an accident.

499
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,851
Jump!
Use the road!

500
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:18,945
Watch it!

501
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,487
Way to go, Mom!

502
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,287
Floor it!

503
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,000
They're going left.
Slow down.

504
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,584
Left! Slow it down!

505
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,510
Be careful!

506
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,641
There's nothing in there.
I already looked.

507
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:51,680
What's in the file?
It's the trace on the gun, isn't it?

508
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,774
What does it say, Joe?
I haven't read it.

509
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,734
I'm giving it to Ross.

510
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:01,316
I don't believe this.
Believe it!

511
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,744
Look who it is.
Norman Bates and his mom!

512
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,286
Cut it out!
You're going to tell him?

513
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,659
My mother lied.

514
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:14,462
She got the license plate
and I traced the address.

515
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:17,503
Shit!
Watch your mouth.

516
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:23,051
That's rich coming from the most
pathetic cop ever in this precinct.

517
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,347
Is there anything else...

518
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:30,094
I should know?
Yes, Detective.

519
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,138
We think you're an asshole.

520
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,237
Take a walk with me.

521
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,822
Think I'm going to take that?

522
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,955
She's just an old lady.

523
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:57,590
A monster, that's what she is.
And her cookies suck!

524
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,713
Watch what you say!
I'm not watching anything!

525
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:04,090
If you even look at this case...

526
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,803
I'll throw your mom in a county can

527
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:11,555
before you can say "Golden Ager"!
Are you threatening my mother?

528
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,178
You, your mom...

529
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:16,276
Your whole goddamn family.

530
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:20,192
Ross, you just made
a big mistake. - Oh, sure.

531
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,027
What are you doing?

532
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:24,652
Jesus Christ!

533
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,496
Hi.
Hi.

534
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:42,258
You forgot to dry your hands.
Ross needs the towels more than me.

535
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:46,722
Ross needs the towels?
Long story. Oh, excuse me.

536
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,061
I have your toothbrush.
My toothbrush?

537
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,725
Yeah.

538
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:59,607
With the frog's head.
I forgot to pack it.

539
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:01,892
Thanks.

540
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,617
Lieutenant!

541
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:11,329
I want to file a complaint
against him and his mom...

542
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,120
for assault
and withholding information.

543
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:18,161
What, Ross?
Nothing, just flushing him out.

544
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:21,340
I'm gonna see you suspended.

545
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:26,262
Ross! - What?
Get back to your desk.

546
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,515
Oh, Lieutenant...
Now! Please.

547
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:44,901
It's a man thing.
I'd better get back to my desk too.

548
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:49,365
Oh, Gwen. Thanks for the brush.

549
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,949
The gun was part of a shipment...

550
00:47:57,377 --> 00:48:00,046
that wound up downtown.

551
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:04,757
The warehouse burnt down and
the watchman was killed in the fire.

552
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:08,178
Big explosion of ammunition.

553
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:12,096
Guns destroyed,
cause of the fire never established.

554
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:17,938
Company goes broke.
Insurance pays 12 million.

555
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,728
Are you listening?

556
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:25,564
Like Mr. Krueger. He burnt his
luncheonette down for the insurance.

557
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:29,239
They found the silver at home.
Same thing here.

558
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:31,985
Your gun didn't get burned.

559
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:38,248
Mama knows! When we get home,
I'm gonna make you a fresh hamburger.

560
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:44,580
She doesn't like fast food.
It's not that. What?

561
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,626
Ross' face when you said,
we think you're an asshole.

562
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,963
I gave it to him good.

563
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:56,135
Blew him away. - His ass was grass,
and I was the lawnmower.

564
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,679
You're really something, Mom.

565
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:11,571
I'm going to go up
and talk to these guys. Be right back.

566
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,121
We could do "good cop, bad cop"!
I can handle it. Thanks.

567
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:26,629
Do you really want to go?
You know I do. Okay.

568
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,837
Go downstairs and sniff around.

569
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,216
I'll be upstairs with the big boys.

570
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:36,258
It's that cop.

571
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,303
Get in the side office
till he's gone. Move it!

572
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:45,061
Yeah, show the officer in.

573
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:50,730
Detective Joseph Bomuwski.
Bomowski. Good afternoon.

574
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:52,438
What can I do for you?

575
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:58,704
I'm investigating a warehouse fire,
a lot of weapons were destroyed.

576
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,531
You collected the insurance.
Yes.

577
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,709
I hope there isn't any problem.
What would say if we had evidence

578
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,883
that the weapons
weren't destroyed in the fire.

579
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:13,384
That we were the victim of a fraud.

580
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:18,267
You don't look like a victim,
you look more like a beneficiary.

581
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,596
Excuse me.

582
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:33,277
A woman out there
is claiming to be your mother. - No!

583
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,196
Sorry. - That's alright.
They tried... I'll handle this.

584
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:41,113
I say we work them over!
Just wait outside.

585
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,581
It's almost under control.
Joe...

586
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:49,376
they're being audited.
I know an audit when I see one.

587
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,844
Mom, later!
It's the motive.

588
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:55,721
Gesundheit!

589
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,220
Lot of accusations flying around.

590
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,353
What do you want?

591
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:07,223
To look at the warehouse.
Any problem with that?

592
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,320
Do you have a warrant?

593
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,611
Or your mother?
No.

594
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:14,775
But I've a good mind...

595
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,901
to give you
a spanking you won't forget.

596
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,076
Do I go to the warehouse
or do I get a warrant?

597
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:34,759
Give the detective
the address of the warehouse...

598
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:39,258
where we had that fire,
with the keys and whatever else.

599
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:45,848
Thanks for your time. Mom, let's go!

600
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,942
For now you can keep your pants on.

601
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,316
But just remember:

602
00:51:51,736 --> 00:51:54,856
I'll be back!
What? Did I embarrass you?

603
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,155
Yeah, "I'll be back"!

604
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:01,953
I heard a cop say that.
Terminators say that, not cops.

605
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,736
Get out here!

606
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:09,160
You idiots! Not only do you
let ten cases of guns get stolen

607
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:12,079
and screw up their return.
I've now got...

608
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:16,090
some cop's weird mother
threatening to spank me!

609
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:20,426
We'll take care of them. They won't
bother you. - They'd better not.

610
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:25,141
I'll get the plane tomorrow.
All you've got to do is make sure...

611
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,970
everyone keeps quiet for 24 hours.

612
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:31,185
Make it look like an accident.

613
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:48,492
Don’t like the look of this.
It's dangerous, don't go.

614
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,710
It's not dangerous.

615
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,083
So I can go too?
Oh no.

616
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:56,465
We're working so well together.

617
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:01,298
Right, and working well together
means looking out for each other.

618
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,265
What are you doing?

619
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:08,765
Answer me! What are you doing?
What does it look like?

620
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:13,899
Looks like you're locking me in.
Got my detective skills from you.

621
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,818
That's not gonna work.

622
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,817
Let's put that in here.

623
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,986
How does this thing go?

624
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:16,371
Hello, hello.

625
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:20,501
This is a police radio band.
Please identify yourself.

626
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,134
Tutti Bomowski, Joe's mom.

627
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:29,391
Hi, Mrs. Bomowski, this is John.
Thanks for the cookies. What's up?

628
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:35,686
I'm so embarrassed.

629
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:41,104
Somehow I managed to lock
myself in Joe's car. Is that silly?

630
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,405
No problem, Mrs. Bomowski.

631
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:48,321
You're going to look for a Slim Jim,
a long, thin piece of metal.

632
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:16,983
Shoot!

633
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,855
Jesus! - I don't want to live
in a world where my son locks me in.

634
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:29,157
Enough bullets in that gun?
Quiet!

635
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:31,786
Because if you don't, I do.

636
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:36,454
Where did you get that?
From your messy glove compartment.

637
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:38,586
Give it me.
No.

638
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:42,090
Give it to me.
No.

639
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:44,214
Mom, down!

640
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,713
Jump!

641
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,904
Is Pixie okay?
She's okay.

642
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:16,954
Shit!

643
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:24,039
What are you going to do?

644
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,214
Take the dog.

645
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,844
Get over there. - Where?
Against the wall. Okay.

646
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,765
Get back!

647
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,985
Stop! Police!

648
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,996
Get down!
They're getting away!

649
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:04,246
Stop!

650
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:07,420
Or my mom will shoot!

651
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:17,227
A little high,
but not bad for a beginner.

652
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,021
Paulie! Start it up fast!

653
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:32,861
Turn around.
I'm not going nowhere.

654
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:36,406
Take it easy!
Great collar, Joe.

655
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:40,876
Think you could mess with my boy?

656
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:43,915
Gesundheit.

657
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,679
Dusty here.

658
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:54,925
Put it in that chair.

659
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,517
Alright, file this.
I want to see a lawyer.

660
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,226
And a doctor.
You're spreading germs.

661
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:05,693
Tell Ross me and my mother
cracked his case wide open.

662
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,863
Before you say anything...

663
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,076
What was that?

664
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:25,962
I'm just happy you've unlocked
those hidden feelings. - Feelings?

665
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,842
What do you mean? - The flowers.
I've never seen so many roses.

666
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,639
I don't believe it.
What?

667
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:41,139
She's always got to interfere.
Drives me crazy! - What?

668
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:44,766
It was my mom.

669
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:50,227
You mean you didn't send the roses?

670
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:53,193
Of course I didn't.

671
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:56,154
I didn't mean it...

672
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:06,453
Mom, get your
senior citizen's butt in here!

673
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,173
What?

674
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:10,256
Don’t say a word!

675
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:13,712
Something about Gwen?
I want to talk to you!

676
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:17,755
No need to shout.
This is my house.

677
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:22,477
I know this is hard for you,
but I've drawn up a list of rules.

678
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,770
I don't like the tone of your voice.

679
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,808
Rule no. 1: Never say
you don't like the tone of my voice!

680
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:30,481
Rule no. 2...

681
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:34,564
You've written a list?
Yes, and don't interrupt.

682
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:36,326
No. 2:

683
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,405
Don’t interfere with my love life.

684
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,665
She didn't like the flowers?
They were a big hit!

685
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,539
3: Don’t clean!
4: Don’t iron my underwear!

686
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:50,829
5: Never tell anyone the embarrassing
things from when I was a kid!

687
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:54,792
Just a minute...
This is nonnegotiable.

688
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:59,638
6: Don’t clean, buy, or shoot guns!

689
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:04,008
7: Here's a public
safety message: No driving!

690
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:09,388
8: Never say breakfast is
the most important meal. And 9:

691
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,985
The photos stay in New Jersey.

692
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:14,947
Anything else?

693
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:19,944
10: Sometimes forget I'm your son
and treat me like a human being.

694
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:26,167
You can't treat me like this.
Yes, I can. Think about it.

695
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:39,298
You think making me follow
these rules will improve your life?

696
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:45,808
I'm not listening.
I'll tell you what your problem is.

697
01:00:46,229 --> 01:00:51,816
Rule no. 11: Don’t tell me
what my problem is. I know what it is.

698
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:54,524
An old lady with a dog.

699
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:59,110
You don't love enough. If someone
gets close, you shut them out.

700
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,443
Like me and Gwen.
You see this?

701
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,195
She turned into Or. Ruth!

702
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,161
It scares you that Gwen loves you.

703
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:12,127
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them.

704
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,919
What are you talking about?
About waking up...

705
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,880
and finding you're 60 years old...

706
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:21,506
in a little apartment
all by yourself, wishing you had...

707
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,675
someone as special as Gwen.

708
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:28,268
She's right.
She's really upset.

709
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:30,183
Finished?

710
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:38,061
For your information:
I didn't dump Gwen, she dumped me.

711
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,081
Gwen, I just...

712
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,834
I just called to say you're special.

713
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,830
Oh Christ, that's ridiculous.

714
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,629
I just called...

715
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:46,890
to say that you're so special.

716
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:52,344
And when you meet
someone special, you should...

717
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:55,061
grab hold.

718
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,982
You should grab hold of them.

719
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:00,071
Oh, come on!

720
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,064
Just do it right.

721
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:06,571
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them. - Joe?

722
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,197
What are you doing here so late?

723
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:17,379
Just catching up on paperwork.

724
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:21,330
I had to pick some stuff up.

725
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,213
Want to catch up on paperwork, too?

726
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:28,809
Sure.

727
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,685
To paperwork.

728
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,490
Look...

729
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,610
I'm sorry that I hit you.

730
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:51,654
I was just
disappointed about the flowers.

731
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:55,202
I deserved to get hit.
I made a mess of everything.

732
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:59,755
I wish I'd sent you the flowers.

733
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:01,299
Really?

734
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:11,349
You're so special.

735
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,393
When you meet
someone as special as you,

736
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:18,891
you should grab them.

737
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:26,277
Otherwise, one morning
you'll wake up and you're 60,

738
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,866
living alone in a little apartment.

739
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:32,493
And you wish...

740
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,866
you had the chance
to love someone as special as you.

741
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,251
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's said to me.

742
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,931
My mother said it, Gwen.

743
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:05,862
Your mother? - She was right.
Jesus, it kills me.

744
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:09,949
Does this kill you?

745
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:39,230
Hey, boss. What's happening?
There you are.

746
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,186
Take a look at this note.

747
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:48,614
"I regret my life of crime.

748
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,903
I can't live anymore. J. Parnell."

749
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,485
Well, what do you think?

750
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:59,333
You've been under pressure lately.

751
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,421
You might be overreacting.

752
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:05,673
We've got the weapons,
we're going to South America,

753
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:09,791
and claiming lots of money.
Why are you so depressed?

754
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,925
I'm not going to kill myself.

755
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:15,682
It's part of the plan.

756
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:20,727
They read the note, we disappear.
Then they don't come looking for us.

757
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:23,894
Good idea.

758
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:26,939
No, no. That's a great idea.

759
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,936
There's one for you too. You sign that

760
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,358
and we can get out of here.

761
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,948
Make sure you sign it clearly.

762
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,912
Let me take a look at that.

763
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:53,304
Very nice.

764
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:03,014
That hurts.

765
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:32,544
"Dear Joe. I'm sorry. I can't
help myself. I love you too much.

766
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:36,303
I've left to be
out of your way. Love, Mom. PS:

767
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:40,134
About the flowers.
I've ruined it for you and Gwen.

768
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,060
Maybe one day
you can forgive me. PPS:

769
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:47,601
There's a pineapple
upside-down cake in the icebox."

770
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:49,105
Damn!

771
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:59,488
Hey!
Sorry!

772
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,131
Excuse me!

773
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:43,830
Wait!
Hey, slow down.

774
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,990
You alright?

775
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,749
Mom, stop!

776
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:54,544
No, Joe,
you got to live your own life.

777
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:57,803
You were right.
I don't want you to go.

778
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,886
Slow down. - You were right
about grabbing onto Gwen.

779
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:03,803
I was wrong.

780
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,635
When I told her,
it changed everything.

781
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:11,516
It did?
Yes. Mom, I want you to stay.

782
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,232
Quick, stop the cart!

783
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,572
Really?

784
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,700
You know I do.

785
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,455
Now tell me.

786
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,338
What did Gwen say when you told her?

787
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,045
That it's the sweetest thing
anyone ever said to her.

788
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:43,722
And then?
That's what she said.

789
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:48,520
You didn't propose to her?
No, but I mean it's a beginning.

790
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:52,888
It's a missed opportunity.
Wait. Wait.

791
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:56,272
Stop right there.
What?

792
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,607
You're doing it again.
What?

793
01:10:00,992 --> 01:10:03,068
Interfering. Rule no. 2.

794
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:06,200
You can't be serious about the rules?

795
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:12,205
Gate 18, fast!
Don’t want her to miss her flight.

796
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,420
What are you doing?

797
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,422
Have a nice ride home.
What are you doing?

798
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,715
Thank you. Joey!

799
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:26,349
Joseph A. Bomowski,
this is your mother talking.

800
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,720
Wait a minute!
Can't we discuss these rules?

801
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:36,526
They're non-negotiable.
What about a little flexibility?

802
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:41,856
Flexibility? Give you an inch,
you take the entire turnpike. - Okay.

803
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:44,075
Okay what?

804
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,494
The rules.

805
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:48,324
You got a deal.

806
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:52,994
You got a deal.

807
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:06,971
It'll be the best weekend
we ever spent together. - Maybe not.

808
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:14,853
Stay here.

809
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:05,320
Got him! - I told you
to wait outside. - Yeah, yeah.

810
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:08,411
You promised to leave me alone.

811
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:10,655
So, I'll start tomorrow.

812
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:12,789
I give up.

813
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:18,957
Holy moley!
That's the guy who sold me the gun.

814
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,290
It is?
Yeah.

815
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:26,543
More chocolate, Mitchell?
No thanks, Mrs. Bomowski.

816
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:28,929
You, sweetie?
No, I'm fine.

817
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,848
Why'd you come here?
It's not even my case.

818
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,512
To save my girlfriend's life.

819
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,478
My house ain't safe.
My brother's dead.

820
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,313
I got nowhere to go.

821
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:45,026
Any idea who these people are?

822
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:51,570
We stole a few cases of shooters
but there were thousands of them.

823
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:56,791
The ones supposed to have
been destroyed. We got them. - Where?

824
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:01,078
Brunswick airstrip.
Outside of Ventura. It went bankrupt.

825
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:06,382
A savings and loan took it over.
Great. Joe and I'll check it out.

826
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:12,432
Remember when I was in school,
every week you would call my teachers

827
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:15,259
to see if I was doing good
and cutting class.

828
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:18,012
Embarrassed the hell out of me.

829
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,607
It wasn't you didn't trust me...

830
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:23,651
you just wanted to make sure...

831
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:27,107
I didn't get into trouble.

832
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:30,991
You finally understand.
I do understand.

833
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:35,828
And I want you
to understand why I have to do...

834
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:38,621
this!

835
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,744
Whoa, bummer!

836
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,048
I once did this before
when Joey was 9.

837
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:57,810
He got his head caught in a railing.
The problem was his ears.

838
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:03,184
They were so big for his age.
They kept getting caught on the bars.

839
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:06,904
I got it. I did it.

840
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:11,611
I'm out! I did it!
Yo, Mrs. B! Way to go, babe!

841
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:14,526
Sometimes I impress myself.

842
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:16,782
Could you help me off?

843
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,367
Where's my gun? I'm outta here.
With your keys in the bathroom.

844
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,171
Thanks, babe.

845
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,804
Major bummer.

846
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:49,570
Sorry, Mitchell.
I need your car.

847
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:53,738
And I don't think
Joey wants you going off to Mexico.

848
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:57,660
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.

849
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:04,117
Be back to get you, babe.

850
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:37,370
Get back.

851
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:06,438
Sergeant Bomowski. I need assistance
at Brunkswick airstrip, right away.

852
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:40,349
Let me go!
Hurry up.

853
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:48,559
Move it. Come on.

854
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:52,729
Where's your little boy?

855
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:56,321
You won't get away with this.
My Joe will be all over you.

856
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:59,945
Get her on the plane,
so her son can't interfere.

857
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,119
When we get her over the ocean,
we'll see how well she can swim.

858
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:06,783
Move it! Move it!

859
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:14,718
Sit down.

860
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:10,815
Shit!

861
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:30,888
Get out there and find him.

862
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:34,888
Get off. Take her down.

863
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:36,894
Oh God!

864
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:41,313
Where are you taking me?

865
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,816
Shut up!
Joey!

866
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:58,251
There you are. Drop it!

867
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,835
You okay?
Why are you here?

868
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,718
I came to back you up.
Get him inside!

869
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,179
Let her go.

870
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:14,053
Do you think
I'd be content with just killing you?

871
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,272
Let her go!

872
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:18,067
Or what?

873
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:25,152
It's over. Parnell, it's all over.

874
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:28,493
Get the car.
I'll tell you what's over.

875
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,786
Say goodbye to your little boy.

876
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,913
You're next. Hold it!

877
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:39,798
You know...

878
01:20:42,592 --> 01:20:46,886
this is really going
to give me a great deal of pleasure.

879
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,482
Nobody hurts my baby.

880
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:30,797
Gee whiz. You shot him.

881
01:21:32,642 --> 01:21:34,552
No shit.

882
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,519
Mom, you saved my life.

883
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:40,603
That's what moms are for.

884
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:55,740
I can't believe it,
but I'm sad to see you go.

885
01:21:56,166 --> 01:22:00,828
Don’t worry. I'll be back.
Not too soon, I hope. Just kidding.

886
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,878
It's been great, Tutti.
Such fun.

887
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:08,297
I can see why you like police work.
It's so stimulating. - Yeah.

888
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,757
Can I see the ring?
Okay.

889
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:17,185
Beautiful. I couldn't have done
better if I'd picked it out myself.

890
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:21,139
I thought you did.
Mom, that's your flight.

891
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:27,564
Well, thanks for everything.

892
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:35,200
I think that man is a criminal.

893
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:38,662
I recognize him from TV.

894
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:42,120
I don't think so. You'll be late.
Joe, look.

895
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,455
He's trying to avoid the detector!

896
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:46,257
Please!
Hey, young man!

897
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:49,000
Don’t give me that innocent look.

898
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:53,840
My son is a police officer.
Draw your gun. He's getting away.

899
01:22:55,725 --> 01:22:57,802
Rule no. 12: Listen to your mother!

900
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:05,646
Move!

901
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:13,116
Here. Cuffs!

902
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,536
Let us through. Police.

903
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,870
Joey, now I remember what he did.

904
01:23:21,752 --> 01:23:23,294
He shot his mother!

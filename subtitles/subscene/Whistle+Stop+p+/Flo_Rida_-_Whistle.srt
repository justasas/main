00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:18,660


6
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,970
You just put your lips together

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,100
There's only one Flo, and one Rida

00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:56,670

00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,020


45
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,080
Permission not approved

46
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:49,270

Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles

54
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:04,120
So amusing, now you can make a whistle with the music

55
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,240

1
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,919
According to some medical research,

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,038
only 10% of the normal human brain is active.

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,949
The other 90%

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,720
is dormant or repressed.

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,838
Even for a genius like Einstein,

6
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,389
his brain

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,035
was only 3-5% more active than others.

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,634
So you can imagine
if our brain is 100% active,

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,516
how smart and powerful we will be!.

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,079
But the world is full of extraordinary things.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,795
Someone might have already
developed this potential

12
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,918
and become a superhero!.

13
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,759
So if you see

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,314
someone doing something incredible,

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,750
don't be scared. It's not witchcraft!.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,389
It's only

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,835
a science-defying experience,

18
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,834
a witness to a magical power

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,879
that we all yearn for!.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,714
Magic To Win

21
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,549
Macy Cheng.

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,438
Macy Cheng.

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,069
Macy Cheng!.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,838
Superman returns!.

25
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,598
Good morning, Prof Kang.

26
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,679
In that film,

27
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,710
by flying around Earth in super speed,

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,671
Superman spins Earth backwards
and reverses time.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,754
If we are to formulate this concept,

30
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,958
then Time is equivalent to Earth.

31
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,359
Macy, you just returned to reality.

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,875
What's the mass of Time?.

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,752
Well, it depends on...

34
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,797
how heavy your watch is.

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,076
That's what you think.

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,759
The correct answer is...

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,953
5.975x...

38
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,312
Hey!. The game is about to start!.

39
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,876
But he still has the volleyball.

40
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,439
Let him keep it as a souvenir.

41
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,711
10 to the power 21 ton!.

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,672
That's the mass of Earth.

43
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,279
That's also the mass of Time.

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,958
If men are so powerful,

45
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,188
can they reverse time?.

46
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,592
According to the law of conservation,

47
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,991
energy can be transferred or absorbed.

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,951
So in theory, the answer is yes.

49
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,512
But in reality...

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,870
Catch it!.

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,152
Men simply cannot withstand such power.

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,437
How can they reverse time?.

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,232
Stop daydreaming.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,871
Don't waste time!. Macy!.

55
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,350
In order not to waste time, we better go now!.

56
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,798
Hey!. What are you doing?.

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,313
off to a game?. Yes!.

58
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,277
Bye-bye!.

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,589
Good luck!.

60
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,750
Look,

61
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,193
our opponents seem formidable!.

62
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,112
We better watch out!.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,115
How you look is more important than you hit!.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,517
Formidable or not, we'll wait and see!.

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,228
Look how fit our team is!.

66
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,349
And look at them...

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,231
What's our strategy today?.

68
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,834
We'll take the offensive
and spike the ball at them.

69
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,516
Great?.

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,908
Great!. They'll die.

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,952
What's so funny?.

72
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,318
Never mind. Coach Liu will deal with him!.

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,676
By the way, what's taking Coach Liu so long?.

74
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,429
oh yes!.

75
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,788
Good morning!. Sorry!.

76
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,033
In a hurry, Coach Liu?.

77
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,314
We have a game.
Come root for us if you're free!.

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,354
How fast the elevator goes

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,234
is not related to how fast
you press the button.

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,110
Is that so?.

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,315
Pressing it too fast

82
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,795
might short-circuit...

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,234
...the board.

84
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,875
If you carry on, you may damage the elevator.

85
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,156
What's going on?.

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,719
We're stuck in the elevator!.

87
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,394
Help!.

88
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,716
You should have come earlier

89
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,633
to root for your team.

90
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,790
If they lose any more points, they're doomed.

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,110
Really?. Let's just take this
as a handicapped game.

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,758
Winning...no,

93
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,556
friendship is...more important.

94
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,711
Macy...are you all right?.

95
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,876
You're giving us so much face!.
You used your face to hit the ball!.

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,189
So thick-skinned!.

97
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,789
Thick-skinned?.

98
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,712
What's going on?.
Where is Coach?.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,513
We have no idea.

100
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,432
90% of elevator accidents are man-made.

101
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,512
only 10% are due to mechanical malfunctions.

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,514
This one belongs to the former,

103
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,352
so we're safe.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,950
Come here and kneel down.

105
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,950
Why should I kneel down?.

106
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,955
just do it.

107
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,870
Hey...

108
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,029
That's dangerous.

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,548
It won't be.

110
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,876
You won't be in danger, but I will!.

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,313
We're both in danger!. But I'm in a hurry!.

112
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,549
I'm already late!.

113
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,076
just hit the ball back. How hard can it be?.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,797
Macy!. Macy...

115
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,076
Macy, don't hit the ball with your face again!.

116
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,309
Are you playing or killing?.

117
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,395
What's wrong with you?.

118
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,876
Time out!.

119
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,318
Hey!. Why time out?.

120
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,954
just lose the game, so I can do my groceries!.

121
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,956
None of your business!.

122
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,952
Where have you been?.

123
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,758
Go straighten them out!.

124
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,628
Come over!.

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,835
Well done!. Well done!.

126
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,029
Is that the first time you played volleyball?.

127
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,799
The front line roofs the ball;
the back row follows up.

128
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,071
No.6 outflanks at the baseline.

129
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,231
These are basic positions. Have you forgotten?.

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,237
use your brain when you're in the court!.

131
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,193
We've done our best.

132
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,396
They are really strong.

133
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,074
Can you speak up?.

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,918
Strengthen your defense.
Don't lose one more point.

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,750
oK?.

136
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,034
If we've tried our best

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,313
and they're too strong,

138
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,829
it's fine even if we lose.

139
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,155
Spike the ball at their faces. Got it?.

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,309
Spike at them, oK?.

141
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,834
Spike till they cry, all right?.

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,508
I think we still have a chance.

143
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,749
We can still beat them.

144
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,870
oK, buddies?.

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,949
victory!.

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,357
victory!.

147
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,029
victory...

148
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,550
Don't be robots!. Howl when you hit back!.

149
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,191
Coach Liu!. Come to my office after this!.

150
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,430
You!.

151
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,908
Principal Gao is leaving!.

152
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,073
It's only 21 to 0.

153
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,751
oh no, should be 22 to 0!.

154
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,353
How to do?.

155
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,154
Good morning, Principal Gao!.

156
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,390
Morning?.

157
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,749
Are you oK?.

158
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,194
Do you know how I'm feeling right now?.

159
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,713
I don't think you understand.

160
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,794
Someone I trust has betrayed me.

161
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,518
She's cheated my feelings.

162
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,589
She lied to me that
our team would win this game.

163
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,559
But we're 0...

164
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,157
...to 25 already!.

165
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,753
I'm going to replace the whole team!.

166
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,430
Principal Gao.

167
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,718
They only lack experience.

168
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,239
Give them a chance!.

169
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,750
only well prepared people...

170
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,398
...deserve opportunities.

171
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,351
our university

172
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,393
has risen from top 100 to top 10.

173
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,193
To go higher...

174
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,316
we need to excel...

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,036
...in sports as well.

176
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,074
You understand?.

177
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,836
I need...

178
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,751
...results!.

179
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,356
Kang!.

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,433
Why didn't you knock?.

181
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,909
Because you didn't close the door?.

182
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,512
oK then. What can I help you?.

183
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,396
I'm warning you,

184
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,353
don't mess with me anymore!.

185
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,396
Mess with you?.

186
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,759
Are you in trouble?.

187
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,231
Tell me. I might be able to help you.

188
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,193
our team lost,

189
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,553
but you were gloating.

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,989
I saw that.

191
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,878
I think you're a very mean person.

192
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,275
Gloat?.

193
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,159
Why would I gloat?.

194
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,829
You're mistaken.

195
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,395
How will you explain
the elevator accident then?.

196
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,990
Explain?

197
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,910
I think you rigged the elevator...

198
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,348
...to make me late.

199
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,073
You wanna be the vice principal?.

200
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,316
Let's race fairly.

201
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,234
You wanna use tricks?. Fine by me too!.

202
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,677
But if you involve my team,

203
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,748
I won't let you off!.

204
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,431
just let me off!.

205
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,909
It was an accident!.

206
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,949
This is an accident too!.

207
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,876
You're Gu Xinyue, the author of this book?.

208
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,433
Yes, you want me to autograph for you?.

209
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,073
You see the future.

210
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,839
You should know what I want.

211
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,793
I'm an author, not a clairvoyant!.

212
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,236
You're too obsessed with my novels.

213
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,152
I know you're a Wood magician.

214
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,110
What?.

215
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,434
Don't pretend!.

216
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,590
You turn what you foresee into sci-fi novels.

217
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,554
You knew I would come.

218
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,873
Then why are you still asking?.

219
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,672
Let me ask you something I don't know then.

220
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,079
After amassing the magic of all 5 elements,

221
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,796
is it true that you can return to the past?.

222
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,110
If I haven't written it,
that means I don't know.

223
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,912
Wait for my next book.

224
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,274
How can you not know?.

225
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,115
I don't wanna know!.

226
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,669
Since you don't know,

227
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,359
then do as you've written.

228
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,638
Lend me your Wood magic!.

229
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,190
What for?.

230
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,035
What a humiliating defeat!.

231
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,918
our opponents were too strong today.

232
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,951
0 to 25 is too embarrassing!.

233
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,431
There're 6 of us.
We lost on average 4 points each.

234
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,268
I must have lost the extra point.

235
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,351
We should always look on the bright side!.

236
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,954
Winning 1 point next time is an improvement!.

237
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,791
So great!.

238
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,916
Food is more important than volleyball!.

239
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,995
Let's eat!.

240
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,389
Macy!. open the door!.
open the door!. Hurry up!.

241
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,556
Coach...

242
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,070
Eggs?.

243
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,954
Haven't you had enough today?.

244
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,352
We're trying to

245
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,273
get it out of our system.

246
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,391
Yes, we're trying to feel oK about ourselves.

247
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,350
Shut up!.

248
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,390
Aren't you shameless?.

249
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,349
Assemble at the volleyball court in 3 minutes!.

250
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,518
Accuracy is essential to playing volleyball.

251
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,115
As long as you can hit the ball accurately,

252
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,837
you can control the rhythm of the game.

253
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,838
There are lots of numbers in the court.

254
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,592
Go to the baseline

255
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,353
and hit them down in order.

256
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,237
Hurry up!.

257
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,035
Hit harder!

258
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,150
Hit accurately!

259
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,595
Carry on!.

260
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,393
Coach, we can't hit them!.

261
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,516
Can we move up a bit?.

262
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,159
Stop negotiating with me.

263
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,393
You wanna come up here and be the coach?.

264
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,594
You gave up before you even started?.

265
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,916
I wanna tell you,

266
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,394
volleyball is a sport, an athletic event.

267
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,392
You need to transcend your dream
in this event.

268
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,031
If you lose your fighting spirit,

269
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,995
you're lost already...

270
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,636
...before the game starts.

271
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,871
Because you're rubbish!.

272
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,232
Rubbish!. Rubbish!.

273
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,719
Your lives are over!.

274
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,716
Absolutely over!.

275
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,511
Enough!.

276
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,435
Coach, I'm thirsty.

277
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,279
Are you?. I'll get you a drink.

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,757
Shit!.

279
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,996
Macy?.

280
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,637
Macy.

281
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,715
Are you oK?.

282
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,638
Want me to take you to the clinic?.

283
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,955
Are you oK?.

284
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,832
No, thanks. I'm fine.

285
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,156
just leave me alone.

286
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,508
You're still oK after the collision?.

287
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,669
No need to go to the clinic?.

288
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,555
But I do.

289
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,309
The 5 elements

290
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,510
counteract one another!.

291
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
Water breeds wood, wood fire, fire earth...

292
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,791
You must be an Earth magician.

293
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,638
I'm here for Prof Kang.

294
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,199
You shouldn't be here.

295
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,632
Why do you want others' magic?.

296
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,515
Since you're here,

297
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,593
Iend me your magic.

298
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,789
Be cooperative.

299
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,870
Sorry!.

300
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,556
hurry...hurry...hurry...

301
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,033
Macy sleeps like a log!.

302
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,239
Macy wake up!. Get up!.

303
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,838
What's all this noise?.

304
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,554
We must be late...hurry...

305
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,238
They keep calling!.
We must be late...

306
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,511
Where are you going?.

307
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,199
off to the game!.

308
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,076
Why are you so hot?. You got a fever?.

309
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,795
I don't think so!. Then get changed!.

310
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,796
You talked back to the coach last time.

311
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,915
If we're late, we're dead meat!.

312
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,790
up!.

313
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,633
How comes my magic is gone?.

314
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,075
Hold on!.

315
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,869
Why?.

316
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,791
Great!.

317
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,874
Macy, are you all right?.

318
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,360
Tell me, can I still trust them?.

319
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,355
I believe in them!.

320
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,518
You're very hot!. Are you ill?.

321
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,750
I'm fine.

322
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,716
I'm filled with energy!.

323
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,674
The game has started. Stop chatting!.

324
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,759
All right!. Keep it up!. Hold up!.

325
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,917
We have a chance!. Focus and spike!.

326
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,955
We've got the point...

327
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,513
We've got the point!. Keep it up.

328
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,431
Hey!. Watch out!.

329
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,115
Good shot!. Go for it point by point!.

330
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,956
Good shot!.

331
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,231
That's bad!.

332
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,633
Leave the ball!. It's going out of bounds!.

333
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,550
Don't go out of bounds!.

334
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,719
A spin with her pinkie?.

335
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,632
We won!. Coach!.

336
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,193
We've regained all our honors!.

337
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,715
Well done!.

338
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,238
Thank you, Coach!.

339
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,510
Macy, why were you so good today?.

340
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,949
I don't know...

341
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,191
Seems like if I focused,

342
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,998
I could will things.

343
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,714
That's incredible!.

344
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,511
That's incredible!. Can you do it now?.

345
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,869
Yeah!. No idea.

346
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,833
Try to take a pack of juice out!.

347
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,630
Go!. Go!.

348
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,836
This one!. This one!.

349
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,229
Wow!. It's real!.

350
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,750
Who wants it?.

351
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,559
Me!. Me!. Me!.

352
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,915
Me!. Here!.

353
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,829
Here!.

354
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,110
Me!. Me!. Me!.

355
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,433
Shit!. All wet!.

356
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,750
What a hassle!.

357
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,273
No hassle!. We'll be rich!.

358
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,116
What do you mean we'll be rich?.

359
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,111
We can use magic to earn money!.

360
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,589
Good idea!.

361
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,073
How do we earn money?.

362
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,999
Set up a club to help people win games!.

363
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,918
Good!. I think I can handle that!.

364
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,953
Let's think of a name first!.

365
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,832
Something simple.
Let's call it victory Club"!.

366
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,790
Good!.

367
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,036
victory!.

368
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,988
How about that?.

369
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,751
That's great!. You deserve an award!.

370
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,919
Press there and see what happens!.

371
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,916
Hurry up!.

372
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,351
You have to press here to enter first

373
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,876
Then hit whatever they want you to hit.

374
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,311
Then we get our money here!.

375
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,079
We'll be rich!.

376
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,157
of course!.

377
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,952
We have business!.

378
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,032
So quick?.

379
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,959
A bowling game.

380
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,316
oK?.

381
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,916
What do you think?. of course!.

382
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,958
Really!. Count on you!.

383
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,192
No need to look.

384
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,958
The trophy is yours for sure!.

385
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,996
Really?.

386
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,751
Imagine there's a kind of magic

387
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,518
that allows you to live
without making a living,

388
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,199
achieve excellent results without studying,

389
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,151
and do the impossible in just one click.

390
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,032
Effortlessly you can do everything.

391
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,071
Stay at home all day long and do nothing

392
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,912
Apparently that will be a perfect.

393
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,917
Your life will become easy,
admirable and outstanding.

394
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,593
Get rid of the unwanted,

395
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,438
Ieave the uninterested undone.

396
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,238
But as the days slip away

397
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,436
you will realize what you need is very simple

398
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,358
A bicker with your lover

399
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,192
or an attempt to spend
all the savings at one sweep.

400
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,077
So-called "magic"...

401
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,191
wipes out the joys of life.

402
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,198
Happiness and youthfulness...

403
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,550
are short-lived.

404
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,032
Doesn't matter anyway.

405
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,509
Let's make a time of it!.

406
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,436
You'd be fascinated by this magic for sure.

407
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,272
Become slim and pretty no matter
how much you eat

408
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,152
cast a spell to date
whoever you have a crush on

409
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,231
and have unlimited amounts of money to spend.

410
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,913
Such magic should
be called "reap without sowing"

411
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,917
making your entire life easy and comfortable

412
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,638
yet indolent and ignorant

413
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,958
You get the results, but not the happiness.

414
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,913
Happiness and youthfulness...

415
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,150
are short-lived.

416
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,831
Doesn't matter anyway.

417
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,910
Let's make a time of it!.

418
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,713
Let's see if they're pretty!.

419
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,233
What is it?.

420
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,358
We received lots of "victory" requests.

421
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,789
It's record breaking!.

422
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,836
Quiet!.

423
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,270
Listen to my financial report first!.

424
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,033
our business has been booming.

425
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,272
our account has reached 5 figures!.

426
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,391
We should donate everything to charities!.

427
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,114
Sure!. After deducting all operational costs.

428
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,192
Transportation fee,
Accommodation fee, Diet costs

429
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,515
Conversation fee,
Entertainment expenses, Shopping fee...

430
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,749
Agreed!.

431
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,917
Thanks, Macy!.

432
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,556
Energy transfer.

433
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,793
What will you eat today?.

434
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,036
What should I eat?.

435
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,954
urgent matter to discuss in volleyball court.

436
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,830
Prof Kang?.

437
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,509
Why does Prof Kang wanna see you?.

438
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,633

Bye!. Bye!.

441
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,869
Can you see me?.

442
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,549
Can anyone see me?.

443
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,268
Please answer me!.

444
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,113
Can anyone see me?.

445
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,319
Wait...show you something!.

446

Is it fun?.

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,828
Why did you bump against me, Prof Kang?.

453
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,598
I wanna get my magic back.

454
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,989
What magic?.

455
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,070
What are you talking about?.

456
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,315
Don't play dumb!.

457
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,869
After you bumped into me last time,

458
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,550
my magic was transferred to you.

459
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,633
It's fair that I get my magic...

460
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,954

461
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,676
You mean this kind of magic?.

Give me back my magic!.

463
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,074
Can you prove it's yours?.

464
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,075
That means you can't!.

465
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,438
The magic is inside me.

466
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,876
It's mine!.

467
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,789

You want money?.

476
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,114
Nobody can see me but you!.

477
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,116
Please help me.

478

You're cute

479
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,076
but your pick-up line is lame,

480
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,038
though it's still quite original!.

481
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,158
Are you practicing your monologues?.

482
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,276

Pegasus athlete throws
the javelin out of the arena.

Great!.

568
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,798

Long jump finals

571
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,873
What are you doing?.

572
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,070
What's wrong with you?.

573
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,073
It's decathlon. I've just lost one event!.

574
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,437
If you don't help me,
I won't let you help him.

575
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,759
Winning 9 events is good enough.

576
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,276
Stop messing around!. Scram!.

577
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,269
Don't mess up again!.

578
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,671
I have to win high jump later!.

579
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,794

580
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,115
What's wrong?. I got through!.

581
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,349
Disqualified!.

582
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,319
You... What's going on?.

583
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,919
I lost again!.

584
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,718
You should have told me you couldn't do it!.

585
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,113
If I lose again, I won't pay you.

586
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,635
Don't worry!. There are 8 more events!.

587
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,869
Are you leaving or not?.

588
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,709
Will you help me?.

589
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,429
You wanna play?. I'll fight you!.

590
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,196
What...again?.

591
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,634
In front as well?.

592
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,755
Hey...what's wrong?.

593
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,149
Shit!.

594
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,272
Fatso is badmouthing victory Club!.

595
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,118
our failure today...

596
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,156
has jeopardized our name.

597
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,354
That's oK!. Macy has tried her best already!.

598
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,230
Next time, I will win for sure!.

599
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,797
Why don't you take a rest?.

600
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,875
You're exhausted.

601
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,749
How about this.

602
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,639
You brainstorm how to get more business.

603
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,953
I'll make supper.

604
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,950
Will call you when it's ready.

605
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,951
So generous of you!. Hurry up!.

606
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,670
Let's go!.

607
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,955
How can we cheer Fatso up?.

608
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,518
Give his presents back.

609
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,436
But I love my padpad!.

610
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,272
We can give you to him!.

611
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,430
Me?.

612
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,796
I should send you there to pamper him!.

613
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,955
It'd be better you go!.

614
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,916
Macy Cheng...

615
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,792
I'm back!.

616
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,555
You again!.

617
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,268
Haven't you done enough damage?.

618
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,677
Macy, are you all right?.

619
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,550
I'm fine!.

620
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,998
I don't wanna harm you. I need your help!.

621
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,633
oK!. I'll help you!.

622
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,950
Really?.

623
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,076
Yes!.

624
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,559
I'll help you crush your bones!.

625
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,836
Macy!.

626
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,275
Go!. Hurry!.

627
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,509
Hurry!. Go!.

628
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,275
Go!. Hurry up!.

629
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,916
Go!.

630
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,633
What's the matter, Macy?.

631
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,638
Blowing off steam?.

632
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,837
Are you all right, Macy?.

633
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,110
Her scream was so scary!.

634
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,116
It's oK!.

635
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,678
Don't be scared by everything!.

636
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,872
Let's go in and see.

637
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,831
Is it a good idea?.

638
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,839
We're just going back to our room.

639
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,996
Macy!.

640
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,110
Macy!.

641
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,679
What happened, Macy?.

642
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,749
I'm oK!.

643
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,675
Please clear the room. I need to step out!.

644
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,233
We better come back later!.

645
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,759
Yes!. We better go now.

646
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,354
Help!. Prof Kang...

647
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,749
What's happened to me?.

648
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,790
Please help me!.

649
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,678
I bumped into you; you refused to help me up.

650
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,996
Now you dare to see me with a covered face!.

651
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,869
Are you too ashamed of yourself?.

652
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,989
That's your payback for abusing magic!.

653
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,948
Help me first!.

654
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,270
I don't wanna looK like this.

655
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,592
I can help you with a condition.

656
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,755
As long as I can be normal again,
I'll do whatever you say.

657
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,315
You'll obey my orders and report to me.

658
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,432
And you'll come whenever I summon you.

659
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,670
Anytime!.

660
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,511
I'll do anything to become normal again!.

661
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,628
oK, deal!.

662
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,070
Come.

663
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,910
Follow me!.

664
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,558
Exhale...

665
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,510
Inhale...

666
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,200
Magic is controlled by will power.

667
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,839
That's why it drains your energy.

668
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,679
Lack of control or abuse...

669
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,076
will harm your body!.

670
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,673
Let's practice how to control it.

671
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,272
Relax!.

672
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,828
Now look at the mirror.

673
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,756
oK.

674
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,233
Magic is fantastic,

675
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,432
but it's also dangerous.

676
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,030
I advise you not to use magic again.

677
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,800
Prof Kang, don't you want your magic back?.

678
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,559
If I'm destined to lose my magic to you,

679
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,073
what else can I say?.

680
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,595
I hope you can help others with magic.

681
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,840
You know, helping others is helping yourself.

682
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,549
Even an ordinary person likes to help others,

683
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,510
Iet alone someone...

684
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,278
with superpower like you. oK, oK!.

685
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,589
Stop pestering me!. I'll help others!.

686
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,556
What?. You think I'm a pest?.

687
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,114
So you're playing me?.

688
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,199
Such an ingrate!.

689
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,632
You're so tenacious.

690
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,199
You even followed me here?.

691
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,116
Sorry.

692
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,554
I just wanna make sure you're better.

693
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,029
Since you're oK,

694
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,273
I won't bother you anymore.

695
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,590
Bye!.

696
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,911
Hey, where are you going?.

697
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,954
I don't know.

698
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,195
oK, I'll help you.

699
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,554
Please don't bother again tomorrow.

700
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,872
Come!. Let's go!.

701
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,310
What's your name?.

702
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,550
I don't remember.

703
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,156
Then why did you come to this university?.

704
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,274
I really don't remember.

705
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,753
I can't help you if you remember nothing.

706
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,357
I remember there's something important.

707
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,912
That's why I'm here!.

708
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,191
You're so contradictory.
It's hard to help you.

709
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,112
I really can't remember.

710
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,075
Why don't you read my mind?.

711
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,790
Read your mind?.

712
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,231
Yes. Aren't you a magician?.

713
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,199
Yes, I am.

714
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,191
Hey, what are you doing?.

715
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,595
Reading your mind.

716
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,749
You're so lousy!.

717
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,509
You don't read minds there!. It's here!.

718
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,598
So you think you're so smart?.

719
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,759
Haven't you forgotten everything?.

720
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,353
I see visuals.

721
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,918
You were in the library before?.

722
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,633
Sounds familiar.

723
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,398
But why was I there?.

724
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,872
I see some electric towers.

725
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,712
There're plants and flowers.

726
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,149
Are you a florist?.

727
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,231
Flowers?.

728
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,230
What else do you see?.

729
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,517
Write them down

730
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,351
and take me there!.

731
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,638
What?. Are you serious?.

732
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,229
Hurry up!.

733
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,594
So hot!. It's oK to forget things.

734
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,318
I do that all the time.

735
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,437
Hey!. Looks like it's ahead of us!.

736
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,354
Does it ring a bell over there?.

737
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,674
I saw this plate when I was reading your mind!.

738
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,430
Are these flowers?. So weird?.

739
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,749
Don't touch.

740
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,349
This flower is very fragile.

741
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,117
I never saw these flowers before!.

742
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,119
Is it a rare species?.

743
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,388
Is this your home?.

744
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,192
It's quite pretty!.

745
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,669
So your name is Ling Feng!.

746
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,197
An ecologist!.

747
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,428
oh, the computer is still on.

748
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,070
Do you remember your password?.

749
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,757
Are you an ecologist...

750
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,594
or an astronomer?.

751
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,237
That's our school's logo!.

752
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,035
What's the one beside it?.

753
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,714
I have no recollection.

754
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,198
Don't be sad. Let's take a picture first.

755
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,148
What's the matter with you?.

756
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,310
I decompose when in contact with electricity.

757
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,114
So you're afraid of electricity.

758
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,039
Did it hurt?.

759
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,673
It hurts every time I decompose.

760
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,398
Be careful!.

761
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,591
Look!. I couldn't take your picture!.

762
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,517
Hey, it's someone calling me!.

763
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,279
Go answer it far away from here!.

764
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,033
So you want me to go?.

765
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,151
oK!.

766
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,315
I'll go!.

767
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,669
Now that I've brought you here, we're quits.

768
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,034
Let's not meet again!.

769
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,109
Where are you?. It's so late!.

770
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,630
Go back in!. Leave it to me here!.

771
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,958
Don't just mind the flowers.

772
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,672
Mind yourself too!.

773
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,997
If there're no more plants on Earth,

774
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,272
men won't have enough oxygen to survive.

775
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,829
Do you want this world to be over?.

776
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,351
If you don't recover

777
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,114
and always need my help,
then I'll be over instead!.

778
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,155
30 years from now, this world...

779
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,236
will require twice
the resources of Earth to survive!.

780
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,150
Enough!.

781
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,959
I'm so tired!. I need to sleep!.

782
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,113
Shit!. I'm late!.

783
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,792
These are books about magic.

784
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,875
Study them first.

785
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,031
I'll explain to you later.

786
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,194
How can I read so many of them?.

787
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,719
So you think it's easy to be a magician?.

788
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,837
Any questions?. Feel free to ask me now.

789
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,394
How many magicians...

790
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,959
...are there in the world?.

791
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,835
So-called magic, voodoo, or superpower

792
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,913
actually refers to an inexplicable power.

793
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,749
It's inherently the same.

794
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,271
I've no idea how many magicians...

795
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,316
there are,

796
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,713
but I'm sure you're not the only one!.

797
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,154
Who can...

798
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,918
...have superpower?.

799
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,429
Every common person

800
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,075
can have superpower.

801
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,270
Take you for instance,

802
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,593
It takes a big illness or an accident

803
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,916
that causes physical or emotional trauma

804
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,674
to stimulate your brain cells to expand

805
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,671
and absorb tremendous energy.

806
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,673
It's still unknown...

807
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,076
...how the power is absorbed.

808
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,593
If one's magic is lost,

809
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,557
how can one get it back?.

810
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,873
I wanna know that too.

811
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,754
Do you know what this symbol means?.

812
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,952
It's only a magical stratagem.

813
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,037
Taoists use spells,

814
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,238
witches use brooms,

815
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,351
Harry Porter uses his magic wand,

816
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,432
and some people use magical stratagems.

817
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,432
They're just tools,

818
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,229
same as using your hands.

819
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,756
How did you get this picture?.

820
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,836
I took it in Ling Feng's studio.

821
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,154
Ling Feng?. A man?.

822
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,753
How did you meet him?. And where?.

823
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,676
Does he have bad habits?.

824
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,875
Easy!.

825
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,676
That's a picture we took together.

826
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,874
Are you kidding?. Together?.

827
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:02,796
It's just you.

828
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,756
It's true!.

829
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,871
He said he's a magician who lost his magic.

830
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,558
He wants my help

831
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,511
but don't know what.

832
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,275
He said I saw him because I'm a magician.

833
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,316
It's true!. I'm not pulling you leg!.

834
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,352
Why didn't you tell me earlier?.

835
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,954
It takes...

836
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,795
...a lot of energy to decompose the body.

837
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,398
If someone can do it,

838
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,236
he must be incredible.

839
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,550
Ling Feng!. You've come!.

840
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,716
I'm Gu Xinyue,

841
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,235
a Wood magician.

842
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,954
I knew you would lose your memory.

843
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,958
Have you read my novel?.

844
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,153
I put all my predictions there!.

845
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,752
I know you won't believe me.

846
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,548
just start with the first 25 pages.

847
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,594
You're Ling Feng, an Earth magician.

848
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,719
You believe me now?.

849
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,439
Freaking out?.

850
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,309
Listen up.

851
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,837
There's one Fire magician.

852
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,398
When he amasses all 5 elements,

853
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:32,030
he'll have the energy to go back to the past.

854
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,356
I don't know why he want to do.

855
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,117
If he changes the past,

856
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,035
the present is warped.

857
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,669
All hell will break loose.

858
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,315
I gave you a magic stone before.

859
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,434
It's because you were wearing that stone

860
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,197
which manifested its power

861
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,156
when you met the Fire magician

862
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,714
that your life could be spared.

863
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,553
That's why you can still come here today.

864
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,072
Watch the visuals.

865
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,790
Remember.

866
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,388
Your goal...

867
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,838
...is to look for Prof Kang

868
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,273
and that blond magician Charlie!.

869
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,868
only when you guys...

870
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,118
pull your power together
can this disaster be averted!.

871
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,072
Life is important to everyone.

872
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,832
In a magician's world,

873
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,873
his hands are more important than his life!.

874
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,752
But your hands are as important...

875
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,188
...to me!.

876
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,311
Let's go!. Showtime!.

877
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,550
Who are you?.

878
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,591
I'm here to help you finish your magic show.

879
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,270
What do you want?.

880
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,116
Take it easy.

881
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,632
I know you're a Metal magician.

882
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,237
A magic show without the use of magic.

883
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,193
Lend me your magic.

884
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,278
We help each other.

885
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:30,950
Fair enough!.

886
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,439
Don't disappoint my audience!.

887
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,995
It will be absolutely spectacular!.

888
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,710
Let's start!.

889
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,914
What's next?.

890
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,396
just watch!.

891
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,916
And then?.

892
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,793
Pull out your knife!.

893
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,512
If the audience knows the secret of the magic,

894
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,908
They'll be even happier!.

895
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,868
The show is about to end!.

896
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,148
Buddy, who are you?.

897
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,559
Hello, Prof Kang.

898
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,719
I'm a Fire magician.

899
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,518
Lend me your magic.

900
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,629
What happened?.

901
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,039
What happened to your magic?.

902
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,070
What magic?.

903
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,272
Know how long I've waited for today?.

904
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,831
You're telling me you don't have magic?.

905
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,352
I really don't.

906
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,709
What happened to your magic?.

907
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,555
I don't know.

908
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,395
I found it!.

909
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,514
Run!.

910
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,310
So you got his magic!.

911
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,515
Prof Kang!. Prof Kang!.

912
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,116
Wake up!.

913
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,708
Wake up!. Prof Kang!.

914
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,676
Macy!.

915
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,110
Coach Liu?.

916
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,915
Are you all right?.

917
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,875
Watch out!.

918
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,712
The guy who hurt me may come back!.

919
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,311
Prof Kang!. Don't worry. I'm here to help.

920
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,513
Aren't you a magician?.

921
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,954
Why can't you see me?.

922
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,875
There's nobody.

923
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,990
You're too tired!.

924
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,830
Take care, Prof Kang.

925
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,031
I'm here to say goodbye.

926
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,033
Prof Kang!. Look at the blackboard!.

927
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,232
Don't be scared!. He's a friend.

928
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,668
He's just transparent.

929
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,835
You see him?.

930
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,871
I can't, but I know.

931
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,429
You're Ling Feng.

932
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,280
Macy mentioned you.

933
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,279
A magician kidnapped her. Let's rescue her.

934
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,110
I'm going too.

935
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,919
Don't!. It's very dangerous!.

936
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,234
Macy is my student too!.

937
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,874
Then put down your stuff first!.

938
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,153
What a big bottle of wine!.

939
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,036
Wine...

940
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,593
a big bottle of wine...

941
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,270
I've found Macy!. over there!.

942
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,716
Let's go rescue her right away.

943
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,874
There's an electric net.

944
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,676
What should we do?.

945
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,115
Don't let him amass all 5 elements!.

946
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,319
Stop him!. Hurry!.

947
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,752
1, 2, 3!.

948
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,233
My magic is back!.

949
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,358
He's absorbed all the energy.

950
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,112
Don't let him drop the coin in!.

951
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,151
or else the time portal will open!.

952
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,556
Stop fighting!.

953
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,518
You're fire!. I'm water!. You can't beat me!.

954
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,390
Stop,

955
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,393
or you'll die!.

956
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,598
Why do you have to go back to the past?.

957
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,271
Shit!.

958
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,118
We failed to stop him after all!.

959
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,195
We're dead!.

960
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,834
You'll only see...

961
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,630
...the images of the past.

962
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,156
Men cannot change the past.

963
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,433
Even with magic,

964
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,989
we can't do that.

965
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,319
I can give up my magic...

966
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,517
for my family.

967
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,031
The horse is out of service.

968
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,834
Come back!.

969
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,030
Keep the coin. Let's play next time.

970
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,876
Mommy!.

971
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,076
Where's mom?.

972
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,029
Hubby!.

973
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,395
Mommy!.

974
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,271
The past...

975
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,313
...is just memories.

976
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,313
We got no choice.

977
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,234
We pay our parents...

978
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,792
back by living happily.

979
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,713
our life is here and now.

980
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,755
Happy or not, we definitely have a choice.

981
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,270
I hope you won't make the wrong choice.

982
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,717
Take back Ling Feng's magic stone!.

983
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,279
or he'll be helpless.

984
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,035
Hey!. Come help me!. Hurry up!.

985
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,439
Are you serious?.

986
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,995
Get me out right away!.

987
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,793
How do I get you out?.

988
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,834
just give me a piece of cloth!.

989
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,309
What's the use of a piece of cloth?.

990
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,553
To help me get out!.

991
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,399
I know!. It's magic!.

992
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,793
It's very dangerous!. Leave now!.

993
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,634
Shit!. Too late!.

994
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,959
Get something to stop up!.

995
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,230
Help me!.

996
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,631
Ling Feng!. Wake up!.

997
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,759
Wake up!. Wake up!.

998
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,634
You're awake!.

999
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,949
Are you ok?.

1000
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,630
I'm fine.

1001
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,229
He's angry!.

1002
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,349
Come on!. Pegasus!. Come on!.

1003
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,876
Fighting!.

1004
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,595
Fighting!. Fighting!. Fighting!.

1005
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:34,357
Yes!.

1006
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,878
Who's using magic?.

1007
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,192
In his book, Gu predicts that.

1008
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,788
the ball will be out of bounds.

1009
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,159
I'm just helping them.

1010
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,513
Prediction?.

1011
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,835
Any of you believe that?.

1012
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,956
They play quite well!.

1013
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,030
They should win!.

1014
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,396
No need to guess!.

1015
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,076
just put the ball in the court and that's it!.

1016
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,198
They're playing well with their own skills.

1017
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,153
You guys don't need to interfere.

1018
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,352
Even if they lose this point,

1019
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,949
they'll strive to win it back.

1020
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,436
It's oK!.

1021
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,191
Yeah!. victory!.

1022
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,509
We won!.

1023
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,396
We're doomed this time!.

1024
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,029
Coach!.

1025
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,875
Coach...

1026
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,197
Well done!.

1027
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,996
You really have

1028
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,639
the Midas touch!.

1029
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,077
I'd like to hire you...

1030
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,353
as our university's coach.

1031
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,757
She's no longer a coach.

1032
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,150
She's our vice principal.

1033
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,396
vice principal!.

1034
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,630
Welcome back!.

1035
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,233
Thanks for your trust, Principal.

1036
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,708
But I don't want to be the vice principal.

1037
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,070
What do you want then?.

1038
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,278
I only want to be their coach.

1039
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,319
Coach!.

1040
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,714
Then I'll be the vice principal!. oK?.

1041
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,309
I approve!.

1042
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,235
We approve too!.

1043
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,796
Everyone approves, and so do I!.

1044
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,233
You need my help again?.

1045
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,191
No!.

1046
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,276
But I never expected

1047
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,597
you could play so well without magic!.

1048
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,749
of course!.

1049
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,434
Pass me your cell.

1050
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,514
My cell?. What for?.

1051
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,115
just give it to me!.

1052
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,190
Take a picture.

1053
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,111
A picture?.

1054
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,271
A picture together?.

1055
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,070
Good!.

1056
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,079
1, 2, 3.

1057
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,518
You're quite photogenic!.

1058
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,513
ok?. I want a picture too!.

1059
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,679
A picture together. Good!.

1060
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,028
Come!.

1061
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,275
YEAH!.

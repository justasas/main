1
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,657
Come over.

2
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,060
Nah, I can't do it.

3
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:26,829
Why not?

4
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:30,370
I kinda got a date.

5
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:32,609
You kind of
got a date.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,978
Lies.

7
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,717
Seriously...

8
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:38,420
Did you
call a hooker?

9
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:42,461
Nah, she seems like
a nice, clean girl.

10
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,532
A nice, clean girl.

11
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,703
And since when was
that a priority for you?

12
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:48,506
Her name is Kathy.

13
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,010
I don't think you know her.

14
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,446
You don't think
I know her.

15
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,149
Kathy, the fuckin' tramp!

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,452
I know her.

17
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:57,156
She works down
the fuckin' street.

18
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:00,295
<i>[cell phone ringing]</i>

19
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,111
Hey, babe.

20
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,484
No, I'm just out with Alex.

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,592
I'll be home soon.

22
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,130
No, I'm not smokin'.

23
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,066
Fuck off!

24
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,506
Yeah, I paid it...

25
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,943
A few weeks ago.

26
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,549
Look, I paid it three
weeks ago, and I...

27
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,586
I'll call you later, okay?

28
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:29,588
All right.

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,394
Whatever...
I'm going.

30
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:33,830
I'm going now...

31
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,632
Okay, bye.

32
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,317
Oh, fuck.

33
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,488
Wanna go get some breakfast?

34
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,724
Nah.

35
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,562
I think I'd rather sleep
a couple of hours tonight.

36
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:54,637
You're fuckin'
whipped already - see?

37
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:00,014
A man can't own his
own cock in this world.

38
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:07,930
Fuck!

39
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,037
Please!

40
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,442
Forget it.
I work in three hours.

41
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,279
I know you don't
know what that's like.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,617
I make my own hours, buddy.

43
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:21,390
Right...
Go fuck yourself.

44
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:06,165
What do you want?
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,569
I'm so wrong.

46
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,038
I'm a horrible boyfriend...

47
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,307
So you don't care?

48
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:11,744
I care, I just...

49
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,313
Okay, relax.
It's one bill.

50
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:15,450
Have I ever missed
a payment before?

51
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,620
Yes!

52
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:18,624
Okay, but not utilities.

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,394
Hydro, Mark!

54
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:24,201
They called last night,
ready to kill our power.

55
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,474
Well, they didn't.

56
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,380
You'd be giving yourself
pedicures in the dark.

57
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:33,820
Not to mention
your friend down there.

58
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,759
It's not like your
record's spotless.

59
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:41,869
Anyway, he's the only
reason we can afford

60
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,173
the mortgage on this place.

61
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,675
Don't get me started
on the mortgage.

62
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,944
Look, my fuckin' grandmother...

63
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:48,583
Your grandmother chained
us to this sinking ship,

64
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,554
with all due respect.

65
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,891
As for Alex, he's got
the sweetest deal in town.

66
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,899
Son of a bitch.

67
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,376
What the hell is this?

68
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,082
Every towel I own is soaked.
I'm late for work.

69
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,653
Can we just pretend
for one second

70
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,222
that you're my
responsible landlord

71
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,360
and not my shitass friend?

72
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,596
Fuck.

73
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,470
Let me throw some
clothes on and I'll take a look.

74
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:16,539
Hurry up.

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,775
I'm supposed to be
in at noon.

76
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,734
Deadline today?

77
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:32,636
Yep.

78
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,178
Hey, I'm just ordering
a pizza here.

79
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,580
We'll get two meals
out of it

80
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:38,850
and I'm short on cash...

81
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,453
Mark, that card's
almost at its limit.

82
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:41,789
I don't get paid
again till next week.

83
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,227
Well, I get an El check
on Friday, so don't worry.

84
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,398
I don't even think I'll
be around for dinner, hon.

85
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,801
No time.

86
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,671
There's still Chinese
in the fridge.

87
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:53,112
I'd like to order an
extra large cheese pizza.

88
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:54,748
It doesn't make sense!

89
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:56,018
You're not staying, are you?

90
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,455
No, I can't.
I have to go to work.

91
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,391
Yeah, just cheese.

92
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,794
No, no.
Just cheese.

93
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,232
Hey, I gotta go to work.

94
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,667
Can you just look into...

95
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,171
And can you throw in
just a little bit

96
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,542
of that dippy garlic
sauce there?

97
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,579
Yeah, just put it
right in the box.

98
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,615
- Later, Alex.
- Thanks.

99
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,422
I need you to stay a few
hours late again today.

100
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,228
Paulie's wife
has an appointment.

101
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,798
I can't tonight.

102
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,401
Why?
What's the matter with you?

103
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:41,406
Nothing - just family plans.

104
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,590
Med school?
That's really something.

105
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,795
It's what I've always
wanted to do.

106
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,199
When I was a little girl and
adults asked me what I wanted

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,603
to be when I grow up,
I always said doctor.

108
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,696
So did you go
to university?

109
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:11,734
Well, Mark needed me.

110
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,271
I had some acceptances, but...

111
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,012
Wait a sec.

112
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,214
So, you and Mark -

113
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,983
You guys aren't
in school or anything?

114
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:20,985
Want some more wine?

115
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,189
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

116
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,199
Well, what do you do?

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,103
Kinda long story.

118
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:37,151
<i>[voice message]
Dangler, what's up?</i>

119
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,155
<i>Your key's in the mailbox.
Pick it up,</i>

120
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,226
<i>go downstairs,
tell me what you think.</i>

121
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,662
<i>I had a guy down there.</i>

122
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,265
<i>He said it's gonna
be done any time now.</i>

123
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,702
<i>It's practically done.</i>

124
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:48,373
<i>I swept the floor.
It's all over to the side,</i>

125
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,545
<i>so you can just put that
in a garbage bag or whatever.</i>

126
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,849
<i>Um, the pipes
are pretty much...</i>

127
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,452
<i>You can't even see
them hardly anymore,</i>

128
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,055
<i>and nothing's really
on the floor,</i>

129
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,592
<i>so you'll be all right.</i>

130
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,596
<i>Hopefully we'll drink
one down later, buddy.</i>

131
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,632
<i>Gimme a call.
Bye.</i>

132
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,678
The good ol' days.

133
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,517
It was just
you and me back then.

134
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,690
What the hell
are you doing here?

135
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,594
I dunno.

136
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,133
Tom asked me to come down
here and deal with this, so...

137
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:21,237
Well, deal with
it later, all right?

138
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:25,447
Did the pathetic
mating ritual not go so well?

139
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,186
I see she didn't come back here
to conceive your first born.

140
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,690
Gimme a break, huh?

141
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,075
Hey, there's no water.

142
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:41,980
So if you're gonna shit,
shit in a bucket.

143
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,185
And if you're gonna
fuckin' jerk it,

144
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:48,358
you better use a towel
or somethin' to wipe your hands.

145
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,164
Why don't you just take a
second and calm the fuck down

146
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,901
before you go and blow
a hundred dineros

147
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,704
on a fuckin' bus ticket?

148
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,974
I'm calm, I'm calm.

149
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,911
I just need to get outta here.

150
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,547
Okay, seriously,
it wasn't my fault.

151
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,751
It's fuckin' Tom.
He's been on my case all week.

152
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:36,455
You don't have to
apologize for anything.

153
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,826
The plumber's been called,
things will be back to normal

154
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,129
in two, three days tops.

155
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,998
Can you not do that?

156
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,814
Take a look at that.

157
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:57,730
Okay, so?
You've aged really poorly?

158
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,638
I spend every cent I make.
I've worked three years

159
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,974
and I've got nothing
to show for it.

160
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,945
What the fuck did you expect?!

161
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,082
Kids have fuckin'
stupid dreams, man.

162
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,487
You're 28 years old now.
Grow up!

163
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:10,890
What is that supposed to mean?

164
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:13,362
It means have fun,
make the most of it, indulge.

165
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,464
That's what life's about.

166
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,267
Well, life is too long
for it to suck this bad.

167
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,503
Oh, fuck.

168
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:19,173
Suck this bad?

169
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:21,210
Seriously, man, you spent
four years of your life

170
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:25,118
in Toronto and now it's your
big vacation destination?

171
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,688
I'm stuck here with
Tom with his panties

172
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,391
all in a little fuckin' ball -

173
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:29,828
bitchin' at me all the time.

174
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,632
We haven't had sex
in three months.

175
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,468
I mean, seriously.
Stay.

176
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,640
We'll go out,
we'll get trashed.

177
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,844
What about that fuckin' bitch?

178
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,716
Kathy is staying in
to do some pleasure reading.

179
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:41,785
Pleasure reading?

180
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,254
Sounds like she's probably
taking it in the ass

181
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,858
from her old man.

182
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:47,162
I'm kidding - she's probably
just suckin' him off.

183
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,599
I need to get outta here.

184
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,541
Wait!

185
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,679
Hold on.

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,915
What's up with you, man?

187
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,551
Is something going on
between you and Tom?

188
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,223
No, everything's
fine in paradise.

189
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:03,127
Look, he's got his
own shit to deal with.

190
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,830
I dunno, it's...

191
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,767
Anyway, I was thinking...

192
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,972
Wait a couple hours,
catch the next bus.

193
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:10,475
I'll get my stuff.

194
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:11,844
Mark!

195
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,848
It's not like you're a rich man.
We'll split the hotel room,

196
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,619
probably get a deal
on the bus tickets.

197
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:20,026
Don't leave me
here alone, man.

198
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah!

199
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:32,953
I hate you.

200
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:35,223
Seriously, do you know that?

201
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,040
You see that?

202
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,109
Oh, come on!

203
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,745
Take a picture
inside my mouth.

204
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,848
Would you grow up?

205
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,521
You want a picture
of your mouth?

206
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,525
Can you get...

207
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,062
- I'm reading.
- I'm trying to take a photo.

208
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,398
- I'm trying to read.
- You don't read!

209
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,281
I said turn it off!

210
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,525
What are you doing?

211
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:46,298
Oh, God...

212
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,468
That's disgusting.

213
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,213
Are you gonna take it off?

214
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,761
Shut up.

215
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,401
Shut up!

216
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,371
Would you stop it?

217
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:12,317
Sorry, I'm gonna have to
take a raincheck on dinner.

218
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,187
<i>It's not our evening
I'm worried about.</i>

219
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,523
<i>Why are you on a bus?</i>

220
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:16,993
Mom, relax.

221
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,497
<i>What did you
tell them at work?</i>

222
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,609
Your friend's been
in the bathroom a long time.

223
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:30,819
I'm Julie.
This is Crystal.

224
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:32,990
Hi.

225
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:34,661
Hi.

226
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,171
<i>Alex, what are you
doing with yourself?</i>

227
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:41,842
Mom, I'm an adult.
I'm not going back to school.

228
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,146
My life is here.

229
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,822
So are you guys
headed to Toronto?

230
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,631
What are you doing?
Let go of my camera.

231
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,888
They were afraid you maybe
jerked yourself to death.

232
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,896
So, what are you boys
doing in the city?

233
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,267
Well, we're actually not...

234
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,670
Hang on.

235
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,106
It's a long ride.

236
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,610
Why don't we change
up seats for a bit?

237
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,881
So it's easier to talk.

238
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:19,783
Smart idea.

239
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,422
Can I have the
fuckin' window seat?

240
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,192
Yeah.

241
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,807
Thanks.

242
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,456
Tell me how old you are.

243
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,694
How old do you
think I am?

244
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:43,164
28, wow.

245
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,268
Yeah, it just kinda
snuck up on me.

246
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,806
So how long have you
two known each other?

247
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,210
Forever.

248
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,581
Well, we've been pretty
tight since high school.

249
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:54,486
The further I get away from my
high school friends, the better.

250
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:58,326
I've just grown up a lot
this past summer, you know.

251
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:11,888
Well, what do you
do for a living?

252
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,029
I'm an independent consultant.
Got a couple of jobs on the go.

253
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,298
Yeah, I'm actually...

254
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,935
We're actually kinda
shootin' from the hip here,

255
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:23,009
because Alex there's havin'
a bit of a nervous breakdown.

256
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:24,880
We figured we'd get
him away from the cruel,

257
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,284
wicked world
for a little while.

258
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,792
Favorite evolutionary
ancestor of man?

259
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,830
Australopithecus Afarensis.

260
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,838
Homo Erectus.

261
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:41,345
Piltdown Man
all the fuckin' way.

262
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,025
Parry Sound.

263
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,733
We're gonna hit the
ladies room and freshen up.

264
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,070
Cool.

265
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,606
I think we're kinda starvin',
so we're just gonna grab...

266
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,209
No, not enough time!

267
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,845
I'm gonna grab
something over there

268
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,082
and stretch my legs
out for a minute.

269
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,718
Dude, we got 15 minutes!

270
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,288
We'll eat the subs on the bus.

271
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,457
Come on -
14 minutes.

272
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,232
Okay, fine.

273
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,802
Quit it!

274
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,871
Sweet.

275
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,675
Can you spot me for this one?

276
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:16,047
Dude, I don't even know
if I have enough cash on me.

277
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:22,260
Smells like someone's been
smoking a little reef in here.

278
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,806
Hello?

279
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:39,394
Hey, I'll have veal on a bun
with extra roasted red peppers.

280
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:43,202
I'll have the same,
but with hot peppers.

281
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,279
Dude, that sign's
calling my name.

282
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,950
It's my new mission in life.

283
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:53,355
You keep Cheech distracted.

284
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,173
So, it's just you here today?

285
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:04,311
No, man.
It's just me here.

286
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:05,880
Right...

287
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,490
Not too busy, huh?

288
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,960
No, man, slow day today.

289
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:21,912
The deed is done.

290
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,728
Am I wrong or is that
our fuckin' bus?

291
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:31,365
You fucking idiot!

292
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,634
Hey, you wanted
the fuckin' subs.

293
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,873
Oh, great.
The bus is here,

294
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:36,909
now you threw your sandwich.

295
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,512
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

296
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,016
Not throw your fuckin' sandwich.

297
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,293
Cocksucker...

298
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:51,904
Get up off
the fuckin' ground, you cunt.

299
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,053
Get up!

300
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:01,123
Fuck!!!

301
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,026
Here, take it...

302
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:55,330
I've got a vest.

303
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,850
Look, just go get yourself
another sandwich

304
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,719
and we'll figure this out.

305
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:09,693
All right.

306
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:13,033
There should be some
change in my wallet.

307
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,408
There should be some change
in my wallet,

308
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,912
which is on the bus.

309
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,289
Well, I got mine,
but it's just plastic.

310
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,859
And it's not like
I actually carry any money

311
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,195
in my bank accounts.

312
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,511
All right, fun's over.
We head back.

313
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:38,952
Call your mom or Tom and...

314
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:39,954
I don't know -

315
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:41,924
just get our
asses back to Sudbury.

316
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,662
Probably be home
in time for Conan.

317
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,541
Jesus...
Take it easy, man.

318
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,045
It's not the end of
the fuckin' world here.

319
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,549
I mean, you could be

320
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,455
living under some
military dictatorship.

321
00:19:57,456 --> 00:20:00,361
Fuckin'... people starving
in the streets,

322
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,298
selling their kid
for two bucks.

323
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,901
Mom's out working
the fuckin' hooker shop,

324
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,571
tryin' to pay the bills,

325
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,241
and dad's out there pickin'
cans in the garbage.

326
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:09,445
- Kids dyin' all over the place.
- Just shut up!

327
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:13,286
We're not going back anywhere.
We'll make this work.

328
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:16,491
Just leave your sandwich and
let's get the fuck out of here.

329
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,405
I'm not leaving the chips.

330
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:32,892
Oh, the name on this
credit card is Tom?

331
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:35,230
Uh, yeah, he's my partner.

332
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:38,102
We're living together.

333
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,106
You know, we're married,

334
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,443
for all intents and purposes.

335
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,420
That's a great sweater.

336
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,791
Thanks.

337
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:53,699
Don't you think she looks
pretty in that sweater?

338
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,236
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,307
Okay, I'm sure you'll
understand, sir,

340
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:03,219
that we're always very careful
with our customer security.

341
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,360
And in a case like this
we like to call

342
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:10,967
the cardholder
to authorize the purchase.

343
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,504
That wouldn't be a problem,

344
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,207
except for I didn't
explain this correctly.

345
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,977
Sorry, let me do it again.

346
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:19,351
Actually, my partner is on
his way to Toronto right now.

347
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,020
He's actually flying
to meet us there,

348
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,524
so we're supposed
to take the car

349
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:23,993
and then we're
gonna go join him.

350
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,432
So he's not actually available.

351
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,168
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

352
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:29,771
Anyway, it's not your fault.

353
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:33,611
We can't actually
do that, but it's all right.

354
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,351
Oh, okay, no problem...

355
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:38,355
Sorry about the confusion.

356
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:40,625
It's not a problem.

357
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,672
Do you need a second
key for your...

358
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,941
Friend.

359
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,977
Single friend.

360
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,416
And no, no key.

361
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,386
Just one's good.

362
00:21:56,425 --> 00:22:00,532
So if we add up the
driver's insurance

363
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,505
and the vehicle insurance...

364
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,144
And the 'where the fuck did
that come from' insurance.

365
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,847
What are you talkin' about?

366
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,018
Well, you need insurance
to rent...

367
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,222
That's included in the $29.95?

368
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:15,095
No, it's extra.

369
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,266
We want the $29.95 deal, okay?

370
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,303
That's what you told me
when we came in the door.

371
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,276
You're sittin' here
in your little sweater.

372
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:24,380
That's our policy, sir.

373
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:25,716
I understand,

374
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:29,022
but my policy is I don't get
fucked around by people.

375
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:30,993
Would you like
to speak to my manager?

376
00:22:30,994 --> 00:22:34,131
Why don't you just give the
old fuckin' manager a call?

377
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:37,306
George, I have a problem...

378
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,575
George!

379
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:39,910
Can I please
talk to you?

380
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,046
Mark, will you shut up?

381
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:42,983
- Can I please talk to him?
- I'll be outside.

382
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,754
Just one second.

383
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:46,356
Thank you very much.

384
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,159
Hello, George.

385
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,031
Yes.

386
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:51,901
My colleague and I
were just trying to get

387
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:54,205
to Toronto and we're running
into some trouble here.

388
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:11,739
On the road again...

389
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,618
You know - maybe I just
don't want to drive anymore.

390
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,055
Would you just...

391
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:21,559
I don't want
to drive anymore.

392
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,030
Jesus!

393
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,077
So the grandiose
adventure continues.

394
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,248
Despite your best efforts.

395
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,552
Dude, those fucking
charges were bullshit.

396
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:36,390
That fuckin' bitch is there
to serve us, not...

397
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,093
She's a stuck-up
wage slave!

398
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:40,798
Probably lining her own
pockets with that cash.

399
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,468
Besides, all this is
on Tom's credit card,

400
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:44,172
so I'm the one
who's fucked anyway.

401
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,309
Look, I'll pay for the car.

402
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,715
We'll get our bags
as soon as we get to Toronto.

403
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:57,765
See those old ladies?

404
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,068
Pretend like you're
giving me a blow job.

405
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,404
Would you keep
your eye on the road?

406
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,706
Pretend like you're
giving me a blow job!

407
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,242
I don't wanna die.
All right?

408
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:04,979
Come on!
It'll be fuckin' hilarious.

409
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,215
Pretend like you're blowing me!

410
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,186
Just bob your head a little bit.
Come on...

411
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:09,856
Will you grow up, man?

412
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:13,096
You used to be a hell of a lot
more fun than you are now.

413
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,666
Well, I didn't ask you
to come along.

414
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,527
If you'd just let me explain
and complain to that guy,

415
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,597
we could have got the
return tickets for free.

416
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:50,436
I just wanted our bags.
The driver was right there.

417
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,841
It was about to
turn into a fuckin' fiasco.

418
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:55,914
Well, paying for
two rooms is stupid.

419
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:57,951
Look, I'll pay the difference.

420
00:24:57,952 --> 00:24:59,954
Whatever, man.

421
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:04,864
My key's fucked.

422
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,210
Get up, buddy!

423
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,286
Forget it.
I'm not up yet.

424
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:25,292
You'll waste the whole day.

425
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,896
I can't talk.
I'm sleeping.

426
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:32,171
Would you get out of here!

427
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,710
Come on!
You'll waste the whole day.

428
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:36,280
I can't talk!
I'm sleeping!

429
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,617
You look up.

430
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,456
Get out of here.
Seriously.

431
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:44,028
I've got stuff
I want to do alone today.

432
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:45,832
All right.

433
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,068
Don't be all surprised.

434
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,738
You're the one
that wanted to tag along.

435
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:53,012
Then I'll just take a scenic
drive of beautiful Toronto.

436
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:56,486
It is a beautiful city,
you fuckin' ingrate.

437
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,894
See ya.

438
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,665
Wait a sec.

439
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,502
I need the car.

440
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:34,229
What the fuck's your problem?

441
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,098
This seems like
a reasonable compromise.

442
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,735
I just want to
do this on my own.

443
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:40,506
Last time I was here
I didn't even know you.

444
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:43,146
Yeah, must have been
fuckin' wicked.

445
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,516
Can you just wait in the car?

446
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:50,126
Hi there.

447
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,164
Um, I'm just wondering
if you can help me out.

448
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,538
I used to live here when
I was younger, and...

449
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,374
Well, there used to be
some houses here.

450
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,011
Do you know...?

451
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,449
Well, actually...
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,486
I think the door downstairs
is supposed to be locked.

453
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:05,590
Yeah, I just, um...

454
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:07,762
The construction here -
do you know how recently...

455
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:10,333
Actually, you know,
it's private property.

456
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:12,270
I just wanted to ask you...

457
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:16,578
Yeah, I got some business
I need to do, so...

458
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:21,822
Hold on.

459
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:24,728
Why do you
have to be like that?

460
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,304
I'm asking you - why do you
have to be like that?

461
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,208
The guy's got a question
for you, he used to live here -

462
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,779
you can't answer?

463
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:37,587
I've got some work
I need to do here.

464
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:40,360
That's all right.
You don't have 15 seconds.

465
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,063
You got some work to do?

466
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:44,768
I'm just kiddin', man.

467
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:47,339
Fuck ass!

468
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,647
Let's go.

469
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,463
I used to live here, you know.

470
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,034
You're gonna die here, you know.

471
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,736
Convenient.

472
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:13,893
See, that's what
I'm talking about, man.

473
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,164
That's what people
are like in this world.

474
00:29:16,165 --> 00:29:19,068
Yeah, thanks for what
you did back there.

475
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:24,147
I've never really
told you this, but I...

476
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:26,184
Well, goddamn!
Look who it is!

477
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:27,988
Our female counterparts.

478
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:30,860
Just tell them that you're gay
and that I'm not interested.

479
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:32,029
Shut up.

480
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,366
Let's have some fun with this.

481
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,045
Surprise, surprise!

482
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,083
Look who it is.

483
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,220
Our two most favorite
ladies in the whole wide world.

484
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,291
Why hello, gentlemen.

485
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,097
What are you two lovely ladies
doing on this fine afternoon?

486
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:50,099
We're headed down

487
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,601
to Queen Street
for a little shopping.

488
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:52,837
Wanna come?

489
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,507
Be nice, say hi to the boys.

490
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:55,809
Hi.

491
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,115
Sure, we're not really
doing anything anyway.

492
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,486
Right...
Um, not me, sorry.

493
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,624
I'm just gonna go back
to the hotel and take a nap.

494
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:05,662
What?

495
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:07,466
What are you guys doing
that I can't afford to miss?

496
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:08,502
What did you
come here for

497
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:11,339
if you're just not
gonna do anything?

498
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,043
Have a good time, guys.

499
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,181
Suit yourself, buddy.

500
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:18,186
Leave me with the two ladies.

501
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,330
So, how was
the rest of your trip?

502
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,869
It was bumpy.
We missed you guys.

503
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,240
Yeah, no shit.

504
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,879
We thought that maybe
you ditched the trip.

505
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,115
Oh, yeah.

506
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,652
Look, I don't even
wanna go there.

507
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,954
Are you hungry?

508
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,523
Um, yeah.
I am hungry.

509
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:38,427
I want something sweet
and Torontoey though -

510
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:39,496
like nothing you can get in...

511
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:41,066
What's something
sweet and Torontoey?

512
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,469
Like a big fat cookie

513
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,139
with some white chocolate
on it or something?

514
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,475
Mmm, nothing you
can get in Sudbury.

515
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,812
Yeah, no shit.

516
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,653
Hands off my swing, bitch!

517
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:53,557
It's mine now, baby.

518
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:55,628
What about you there, talkative?

519
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,332
What about me?

520
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,701
Did you buy anything?

521
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:01,206
- Yeah.
- Like?

522
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:04,179
She got an
organic ice cream cone.

523
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,049
An organic ice cream cone.

524
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,019
Gee, that's about as
exciting as your shirt.

525
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,025
Gee, that's about as exciting
as your entire conversation!

526
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:12,328
Oh, I kinda liked it.

527
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,766
- Be nice.
- We were having fun.

528
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,997
Oh, wow.

529
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:48,601
Hey.

530
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,370
What are you doing
in the city?

531
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:53,242
Uh, I'm just visiting.

532
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,251
Look, I don't know
what to say...

533
00:31:57,252 --> 00:32:00,858
I was hoping maybe
we could sit down and...

534
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,929
Yeah...
You can come on in.

535
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:11,344
Looks like you're
doing okay for yourself.

536
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,616
I guess I'm all right.

537
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,453
Just when I think
the well's run dry,

538
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,691
something else comes along.

539
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:21,632
I did manage to save
enough money to do all this.

540
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,972
How's your mother?

541
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:28,279
I dunno.
She's... fine.

542
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,184
She's found a good
thing for herself.

543
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:35,092
How's Richard?

544
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,771
Christ, I didn't even
know you knew his name.

545
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:46,180
Richard's been gone
for a year now.

546
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,852
I'm sorry.

547
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:52,461
I don't know if Sudbury's
working out for me anymore.

548
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:55,634
I mean, you left...

549
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:58,973
The city isn't cheap, Alex.

550
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:01,177
You know what you'd pay
for an apartment in Toronto?

551
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,982
I could work around that.

552
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,154
You need a plan first, Alex.

553
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:08,892
Dad...

554
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,730
Just don't rush
into anything -

555
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,066
that's my advice.

556
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,602
Sure.

557
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:15,806
Thanks.

558
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,714
Did you come all this
way just to see me?

559
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,217
No.

560
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:25,692
No, Mark was in town,
so I tagged along and...

561
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,354
Hey, no.
Not necessary.

562
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:40,356
Just in case.

563
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,659
No, it's okay.

564
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,329
Please.

565
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,442
Take care of yourself, eh?

566
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,645
Yeah.

567
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:06,306
<i>[cell phone rings]</i>

568
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,187
Hello?

569
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:15,224
<i>Alex?
It's Tom.</i>

570
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:16,728
Hi.

571
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:18,598
Is Mark with you?

572
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,703
No, actually.
He's not.

573
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:23,975
We kinda split up for the day.

574
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:27,215
<i>Had enough of him
on the bus ride?</i>

575
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:29,519
Your boyfriend's a sick man.

576
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,125
I used to think
he was a laugh riot.

577
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:33,627
<i>So you're on your own then?</i>

578
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,264
Yeah, pretty much.

579
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:38,270
I got some things to sort out.

580
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,541
I can't believe he let
you out of his sight.

581
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,980
Aren't you guys supposed to be
joined at the hip or something?

582
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,883
I dunno.

583
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:47,856
Mark's being Mark.

584
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:49,493
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

585
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:51,730
<i>Yeah, I know what you mean.</i>

586
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:55,104
<i>I'm gonna leave a message
for him at the front desk.</i>

587
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:58,577
<i>If you ever do see him again,
let him know I called.</i>

588
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,248
<i>Will do.</i>

589
00:35:00,249 --> 00:35:02,217
<i>Bye.</i>

590
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:35,416
Honey, I'm home.

591
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,154
What's up?

592
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:39,191
Now what's up with that?

593
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:42,131
They deposited my
unemployment check today.

594
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:43,933
What?

595
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:46,940
We saw this lady get her
head caught in an elevator.

596
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:50,147
Like, the doors wouldn't stop...

597
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,218
So you been here
all afternoon?

598
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,157
Tom called.

599
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:57,627
Oh, thanks.

600
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:01,669
Well, are you
gonna call him back?

601
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,383
I dunno, man...
Things are fucked.

602
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:09,752
I love Tom, okay?

603
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,923
And I don't regret
moving in with him.

604
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:14,093
And I still love him.

605
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:17,501
For a while now
things have been kinda fucked.

606
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:19,505
Buddy, when you guys
got together

607
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:21,174
it pretty much tore
your parents apart.

608
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,313
That's their problem!
You're blaming me for that?

609
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,717
No, it's just sometimes
it's like you're living

610
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:27,019
in a different world.

611
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,558
You have no idea
how that felt.

612
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,261
Yeah, you were there,
but you didn't...

613
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:33,031
I don't just mean with Tom.

614
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:35,035
Do you ever look around
yourself ever and realize

615
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:38,676
that what we have here
isn't a normal friendship?

616
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:42,551
I mean, normal friends
go out for drinks, and...

617
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:43,953
Well, they aren't...

618
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,591
Let's not get
over-excited here.

619
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:53,973
All right, so here's
the plan, okay?

620
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:56,444
We'll go get a bite to eat,
then fuckin' party time tonight

621
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,549
with Julie and Crystal,
see a bit of the city,

622
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,119
maybe check out a club.

623
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:07,433
I think that crazy
chick has a thing for me.

624
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,137
What the fuck?
In case you didn't realize,

625
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:11,241
Crystal and I didn't
exactly hit it off.

626
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:12,843
We're just talking
about a fun night out here.

627
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:14,113
We're not talking about...

628
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,117
Look, do not be
a fuckin' recluse.

629
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:17,620
You mean you don't like
vaginas anymore?

630
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:19,858
You came here, you're gonna
sit in your hotel room all day?

631
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,995
I didn't come here to get drunk
with a bunch of teenage girls

632
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:24,332
I barely know.

633
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,514
Fuck yourself.

634
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,954
You've been actin' fuckin'
hostile since we left Sudbury.

635
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,358
And for a fuckin'
while now you've been

636
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,729
on this pretentious trip
where your friends

637
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,332
aren't good enough for you,

638
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:43,303
and everything I fuckin' do
is a waste of your time.

639
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:50,651
We're like twins.

640
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:53,759
Look, man, no one
understands my shit like you do.

641
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,263
You went through
all of it with me.

642
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,635
And I know you better
than you know yourself,

643
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:01,273
so just cut
the fuckin' bullshit.

644
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,582
Let's go home.

645
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,556
This, whatever it is,
it's over.

646
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:14,767
It's almost 8.

647
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:17,672
I'm going back
to the hotel and change.

648
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:31,834
<i>Hi, Kathy.
It's Alex calling...</i>

649
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,638
<i>calling from Toronto.</i>

650
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,777
<i>I had some free time
so I wanted to call</i>

651
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:38,814
and see what you're up to.

652
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:41,387
I hope everything's all right.

653
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:43,824
I had a really, really great
time the other night,

654
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:47,299
and I guess
I'll talk to you later.

655
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,771
Okay, bye.

656
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:05,200
Tell Crystal I'll be there
to brighten up her evening.

657
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,870
You can tell her
your own fuckin' self.

658
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,273
She'll be here any minute.

659
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:09,776
I didn't know they were...

660
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:11,179
<i>[knocking on door]</i>

661
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,214
Here.

662
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,186
Well, tell them
I'll be five minutes.

663
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:17,625
Fancy!

664
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:18,961
He's not ready yet,

665
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:20,798
so direct
your complaints accordingly.

666
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,738
Alex, you're ruining
the whole fuckin' evening!

667
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:26,376
Okay, well...

668
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:27,812
Do you guys
know where we're going?

669
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,215
Um, I dunno.

670
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,651
There's a pretty good
pub at the campus

671
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,221
we're staying at.

672
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:34,492
Well, go get changed!

673
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:37,129
Okay, I'll be fast.

674
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,905
Crystal, go help
him get dressed.

675
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:43,175
Right.

676
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:47,884
So, you're staying
at the university?

677
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,792
Okay, hold on.

678
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:55,901
You already told me
all that meaningless bullshit

679
00:39:55,902 --> 00:39:58,206
back on the bus, right?

680
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:01,446
So when do I get to actually
learn something about you?

681
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:04,217
You know basically
all there is to know.

682
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,789
Not really.

683
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,530
Why does it matter?

684
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:13,468
I guess it doesn't.

685
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,707
Okay, well,
I'll get the fuck outta here?

686
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,678
No, just - sit down.

687
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,851
Ask me something.

688
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,753
Okay.

689
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:27,430
Okay, if you could be
any kind of animal,

690
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:30,202
what kind of animal
would you be, and why?

691
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,777
A shark...

692
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:36,681
Because I like to swim.

693
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,389
Mark, oh...

694
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,926
No, you're boring!

695
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,695
Well, what the fu...

696
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:44,999
You're not that boring.

697
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,601
All right, and yourself?

698
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:47,938
You're so exciting,

699
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:50,309
you carry a guitar around
everywhere you go?

700
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,115
Why'd you bring a guitar here?

701
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:54,985
I was gonna...

702
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,556
I was gonna
serenade you with it.

703
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:01,898
You were gonna
serenade me?

704
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,402
Yeah.
But now I'm too shy.

705
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:07,443
Well, don't t be too nervous.
Now you have to.

706
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,846
You can't...
I hate that.

707
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:10,216
People are like,
tell you one thing

708
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,618
and then they don't do it.

709
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,788
You gotta do it.

710
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,163
Okay, well if I play,
will you play something after?

711
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:19,834
So we can just forget it?

712
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,641
Okay.

713
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,386
All right.

714
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,460
Just don't look at me.

715
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:49,560
<i> I am looking at a boy </i>

716
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:53,468
<i> Who is desperate
to play coy </i>

717
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:58,846
<i> Who is trying to employ </i>

718
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:05,058
<i> A character he thinks... </i>

719
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,531
<i> can protect him
from this world </i>

720
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:14,388
<i> Can protect him
from this girl </i>

721
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:20,388
<i> Can protect him
from this girl </i>

722
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:27,869
<i> But why hide? </i>

723
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:35,184
<i> Why waste our time? </i>

724
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:40,160
<i> It doesn't really suit you </i>

725
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,399
<i> Kind of like your shoes </i>

726
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,578
<i> Woo hoo, woo hoo... </i>

727
00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:00,300
Then it doesn't
really have an ending...

728
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,070
I don't know.

729
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,546
Magnifique.

730
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:07,716
Thank you.

731
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:10,587
Fantabulous.

732
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:12,391
I feel like...

733
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:14,262
Like a girl?

734
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:16,665
No.

735
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,272
I feel like I should
return the favor.

736
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:21,209
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

737
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,446
A little song
I wrote on the road.

738
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,553
My underhanded
reason for doing it.

739
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:28,056
- Really?
- One of the reasons.

740
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:31,261
- You knew I was a rock star.
- I totally could tell.

741
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:43,954
<i> Met a girl on the bus,
had an ugly friend </i>

742
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:49,230
<i> Said I like you, girl,
can I take your picture? </i>

743
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,502
Can I peek now?

744
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm decent.

745
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,648
You even dress like my dad.

746
00:43:57,649 --> 00:44:00,687
What, I'm not even...

747
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:02,991
Relax, I'm joking.

748
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,235
<i> But Alex is a virgin </i>

749
00:44:08,236 --> 00:44:11,709
<i> Hope that girl's a surgeon </i>

750
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,615
<i> Pull his cock right
out of his pants </i>

751
00:44:14,616 --> 00:44:17,487
<i> and make him do
something silly </i>

752
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,228
<i> He's a virgin boy </i>

753
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:24,134
<i> Never used his toy </i>

754
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:29,410
<i> But I hope he uses
it in a hurry </i>

755
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:41,468
Self-actualization,
I think, is the word for it.

756
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:43,038
Right, right, right.

757
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:45,276
It just feels like
there's these anchors,

758
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:47,347
holding me down.

759
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:49,451
This is her
favorite conversation.

760
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:52,489
Hold on, now.
The girl's opening up here.

761
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:55,495
Like what?
What anchors?

762
00:44:56,366 --> 00:44:58,735
I dunno.

763
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,575
What can I say?
Life's a bitch.

764
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,546
Wish we all could
have your problems.

765
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:07,353
Let's talk about Mark
for a second.

766
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,723
Okay, fuck off.

767
00:45:11,996 --> 00:45:13,666
Twelfth grade.

768
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,170
We got ourselves locked
in the school overnight.

769
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,878
Before long we were both
trashed in the photography lab.

770
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:21,380
Hey, this wasn't my idea!

771
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:24,286
In fact, the whole thing turns
into a typical Mark fuck-up.

772
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,491
Next thing I know
this guy's running

773
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,762
out into the hallway
like an idiot.

774
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:32,202
He said nothing about a security
guard when he convinced me

775
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:34,373
to go along with this.

776
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:37,212
I could tell some
stories myself.

777
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,952
We were terrible.

778
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:56,650
So are you as much of a ladies
man as your friend over here?

779
00:45:56,651 --> 00:45:59,288
I didn't date much during...

780
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,427
Hold on.

781
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,731
I'll be right back.

782
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:19,496
You all right?

783
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:22,267
- You care?
- What?

784
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:26,042
I feel like I'm being
fuckin' crucified out there.

785
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:29,048
You were ripping
into the poor girl.

786
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:30,552
I barely said anything.

787
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:32,288
She's acting like her
little 16-year-old

788
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,358
existentialist crisis
is the end of the world.

789
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,895
Remind you of anybody?

790
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,364
Look, you wanted to do this.

791
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:38,634
Let's just go back
to the table,

792
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:41,272
make an excuse, and bail.

793
00:46:50,158 --> 00:46:53,196
Yeah, I'll see you out there.

794
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:23,990
Driver, where are we going?

795
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,561
Where are we going?

796
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:27,131
Who the fuck...

797
00:47:27,132 --> 00:47:29,335
I dunno -
this random direction.

798
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:33,710
I don't think we should
just go in a random direction.

799
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,347
We should probably choose,

800
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:37,116
or we could wind up... -

801
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:39,054
In the what?

802
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:40,824
In the wrong part of town.

803
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:43,062
I don't think there are too
many wrong parts of town here.

804
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:44,565
I'm stuck.

805
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:48,372
I'm stuck... in the wrong part
of town!

806
00:47:56,991 --> 00:47:59,261
Are you gonna give
me a piggyback ride?

807
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:00,463
Yeah?

808
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:02,167
Stand up straight.

809
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:03,703
Shut up. I'm drunk.

810
00:48:03,704 --> 00:48:05,373
- Stand up straight!
- Shut up!

811
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:08,044
Come on.
Get on this fuckin' pole!

812
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:11,618
Wishful thinking.

813
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:15,926
- No, don't!
- Oh, yeah.

814
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,705
So are you gonna write down
your number for me, or what?

815
00:48:21,706 --> 00:48:23,075
Why?

816
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:26,048
Um, so I can call you
when I get back home

817
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,116
in the middle of nowhere?

818
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:28,252
You're gonna fall.

819
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:29,487
What are you -

820
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:31,991
permanently depressed
or something?

821
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,706
If you fall, I don't really
know what I can do for you.

822
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,445
Gee, that's romantic.

823
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:44,282
I didn't realize
you had that in you.

824
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:46,688
Romantic...

825
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:51,265
Listen, we're drunk,
and you are fucking incredible.

826
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:54,337
But I'm old
and you're young,

827
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:58,144
and I think we should probably
restrict tonight's pleasures

828
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:02,552
to just getting drunk and
falling off of these things.

829
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,964
Well, first of all... loser -

830
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:10,836
you look a lot younger
than you say you are.

831
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:12,172
Do I?

832
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:15,880
And, second of all...
I'm 21!

833
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:17,584
Hmm, well.

834
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:19,754
Why are you actually in Toronto?

835
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:22,259
Uh, um, Julie's following
some guy she met

836
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,129
from Halifax in a bar.

837
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,467
Yeah, but what about you?
Why are you here?

838
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:30,075
Um... I'm the sidekick.

839
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:31,577
I'm usually the sidekick.

840
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:34,483
That's a pretty
respectable job, you know.

841
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:37,789
Sidekick to your friend,
the shithead?

842
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:40,295
He has his moments.

843
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:42,164
Yeah, sure.

844
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,203
So what about you?
Do you have any moments?

845
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:47,709
I had a lot to drink.
Just give it some time, okay?

846
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,947
Oh, sorry.

847
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,653
Mark's song, right.

848
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:54,022
Is that true?

849
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:55,659
A virgin?
No...

850
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,896
Is that true?
You're a virgin?

851
00:49:57,897 --> 00:49:59,333
Let's go have some drinks.

852
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:01,370
Yeah?
And then what?

853
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:06,079
Um, I dunno.
Ultimate frisbee...

854
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,616
Nude.

855
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:13,661
Okay, this is not a good idea.

856
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:16,600
The neighborhood watch is
gonna be on you in 5 seconds.

857
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:19,138
Whatever.
You don't wanna be here,

858
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:22,244
you can go stand
outside on the sidewalk.

859
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:27,288
All right, either you're just
totally not interested in me

860
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,560
or there's something else
going on.

861
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:31,697
Either way, I wish
you'd just tell me

862
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,068
so I knew what the deal was.

863
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:35,504
What deal?

864
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,409
There's no deal.

865
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:41,582
There's no deal.

866
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:43,654
I thought your whole
American psycho thing

867
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:45,290
was charming at first,
but now you've been

868
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:49,967
stalking the streets like
a madman for, like, 2 hours.

869
00:50:49,968 --> 00:50:51,536
And you're saying
there's no deal?

870
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:53,973
- Shut up.
- Fuck off.

871
00:50:55,913 --> 00:50:58,348
You're afraid of me?

872
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:02,958
Kind of.

873
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:05,764
What do you expect?

874
00:51:05,765 --> 00:51:07,702
You're fucked.

875
00:51:07,703 --> 00:51:11,642
Why don't you just go back
to wherever it is you came from.

876
00:51:15,084 --> 00:51:17,486
See ya.

877
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:56,365
What if Julie shows up?

878
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,737
To hell with Julie.
She's a big girl.

879
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:07,052
I hope Mark's all right.

880
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:52,027
I just want the car keys.

881
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:08,479
She's gone now.

882
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,403
I didn't want to...

883
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,669
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about this one night,

884
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,840
back when we were just
finishing high school.

885
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:47,577
You and Mark.

886
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,480
Yeah.

887
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:53,120
It was the time we both
stayed at school overnight.

888
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,160
He talks about
this all the time.

889
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:58,733
His parents
were hearing rumors

890
00:56:58,734 --> 00:57:02,706
and he just didn't want to
go home and deal with it.

891
00:57:02,707 --> 00:57:06,047
We hid in the boys' showers
until everyone else had left,

892
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:10,188
then had the school
to ourselves until morning.

893
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:13,059
What did you talk
about all night?

894
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:21,309
Mark came clean
with his folks that day.

895
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:25,350
Told them everything.

896
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,164
Can I ask you something, Alex?

897
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:33,466
Shoot.

898
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:36,741
I need to know
what happened in Toronto -

899
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:38,844
with Mark.

900
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:41,551
Yeah, well, you know...

901
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:43,955
I guess we got on
each other's nerves.

902
00:57:43,956 --> 00:57:46,559
We're not exactly talking.

903
00:57:50,168 --> 00:57:53,006
I mean, was Mark
with someone else?

904
00:57:54,143 --> 00:57:55,377
What?

905
00:57:55,378 --> 00:57:58,484
No, we just hung around.

906
00:57:58,485 --> 00:58:00,687
Where would you get that from?

907
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:02,691
Alex.

908
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,534
Nothing happened.

909
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:13,748
Mark did mention that you
guys were having some trouble.

910
00:58:13,749 --> 00:58:15,651
Yeah.

911
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:20,461
So...

912
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:23,734
What happened with this
date you had the other night?

913
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:24,970
Seeing her again?

914
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:27,241
- It didn't work out.
- How come?

915
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,777
Lack of interest.

916
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:30,548
On whose side?

917
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,885
Oh, that sucks.

918
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:37,528
I dunno, you just kinda
looked all... sprightly

919
00:58:37,529 --> 00:58:38,964
when you walked in here.

920
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:40,534
I thought maybe
something was up.

921
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:42,905
I guess you haven't
heard the latest news.

922
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:45,811
The short version's that
I'm leaving town for a while.

923
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:47,582
That's the first
I've heard of it.

924
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,451
Does Mark know?

925
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,794
<i>[voice message]
Buddy, it's me.</i>

926
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:55,898
<i>I'm at a gas station
in somewhere</i>

927
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,971
<i>that is not Toronto
and not Sudbury.</i>

928
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:02,845
<i>So, uh, look, anyway,
have you heard from Tom?</i>

929
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:05,016
<i>I can't get a hold of him
and I'm worried that</i>

930
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:06,820
<i>that fuckin' car rental bitch
might have called</i>

931
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:10,660
<i>or whatever, so...
Okay, bye.</i>

932
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:13,032
<i>[new message]
Hey, I'm back.</i>

933
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:14,334
<i>Are you down there or what?</i>

934
00:59:14,335 --> 00:59:15,938
<i>I called your mom and she
hasn't heard from you either,</i>

935
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:17,675
<i>so fuckin' give me
a shout when you get back</i>

936
00:59:17,676 --> 00:59:19,211
<i>and we'll drink some beers.</i>

937
00:59:19,212 --> 00:59:21,114
<i>Bye.</i>

938
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,193
<i>[cell phone rings]</i>

939
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:29,799
<i>Alex...</i>

940
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,303
<i>Get up here, man.</i>

941
00:59:40,287 --> 00:59:43,224
He left last night.

942
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:48,636
His sister came here
this morning with a van.

943
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:52,175
Apparently she has an
extra room at her place.

944
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:54,982
Moving the furniture?

945
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:56,452
I mean,
give it some time...

946
00:59:56,453 --> 00:59:58,723
No... I don't think so.

947
00:59:58,724 --> 01:00:00,526
You don't...

948
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:03,866
No, 'cause we talked.

949
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:09,745
He's gone for good.

950
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,915
It's over.

951
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:16,926
I don't know what
I'm gonna do now.

952
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:20,432
I don't know.

953
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:23,337
It'll be all right.

954
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,877
It's okay.

955
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:27,914
It's not even just
the obvious stuff.

956
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,454
Like, you know, I can't
make the mortgage on my own -

957
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:35,495
even if I do get
someone else in downstairs.

958
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:38,001
I need you to stay here
with me in Sudbury,

959
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:41,574
you know,
just for a little while.

960
01:00:44,381 --> 01:00:47,151
I'm not staying, man.

961
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:01,080
So you're just
gonna fuckin' leave me?

962
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:03,752
Would you relax!
I gotta go.

963
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:05,589
I was thinking -

964
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,259
you could move
into the basement.

965
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,597
It's cozy when it's not flooded.

966
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:11,534
Thanks for the advice.

967
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,941
Seriously, you bastard,
you'd make twice as much rent,

968
01:01:14,942 --> 01:01:16,076
why don't you...

969
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:18,613
Get the fuck out!

970
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:23,958
Get out!!!

971
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:04,072
You all set then?

972
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:05,675
Yeah...

973
01:02:05,676 --> 01:02:08,012
Yeah, I think so.

974
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,857
Sure you gave
your ride the right time?

975
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:17,297
Yeah, he's still okay.
It's only five to.

976
01:02:28,388 --> 01:02:30,224
See ya' then, man.

977
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:33,697
Yeah.
Take care of yourself.

978
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,172
Keep in touch, eh?

979
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:40,710
For sure.
I'll be around.

980
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:43,417
Oh, I almost forgot...

981
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,120
Brand new, actually.

982
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:47,925
Only used it a couple times.

983
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:51,666
Yeah, I just washed
my hands down there

984
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,704
and it looks like
the plumbing's broken.

985
01:02:53,705 --> 01:02:56,041
Go figure.

986
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,444
Well, good luck.

987
01:02:57,445 --> 01:03:00,483
The landlord of this place
is a fucking asshole.

1
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,855
I could have lied there
forever, but the phone rang.

2
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,381
Hello?

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,901
Hello?

4
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,902
Good morning.
Is this Mr. Rosow?

5
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,904
Mr. Rosow?

6
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,905
Yeah.

7
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,907
Yeah, hi. I'm Drexler Hewitt,
an attorney.

8
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,911
Shit, I'll pay your bill
tomorrow. Promise.

9
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,914
No, it's not that kind, not
that kind of attorney.

10
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,917
You're Mr. John Rosow, aren't
you? Private Investigator?

11
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,419
ROSOW MUMBLES

12
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:04,924
Yeah? Okay. I want you to board the
California Zephyr at 7 o'clock this morning.

13
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,927
There will be a middle- aged
man on board.

14
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,432
We've had someone tailing him from the
East Coast and... well, it doesn't matter.

15
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,933
Now we need a fresh face.

16
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,435
You mean your spy got spied.

17
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,440
Yeah, I guess. Now, we have reasons
to believe the middle-aged man,

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,443
or the Subject, let's call him,
is on his way to Los Angeles.

19
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:28,448
I'd like you to follow him, wherever he goes,
whatever he does, you report. Understood?

20
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,949
Zephyr is wind, right?

21
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,452
I think it is, yeah. Wind.

22
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,455
My secretary will be coming by
your office in ten minutes.

23
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,858
And you can reach me here at this
number twenty-four hours a day.

24
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,361
I get paid for this?

25
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,365
Five hundred dollars a day.
Plus expenses. Not including gin.

26
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,870
It says Banquo on my buzzer.

27
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,872
But I thought you were Rosow?

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,874
And I thought you needed a P.I.

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,379
Touch?. Miss Charley will have a
retainer and some expense money for you.

30
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,881
Hey, coach, how did you get my
name and number?

31
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,384
Oh, a business associate of
ours with the NYPD.

32
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,887
A buddy of yours from your past
life. Gus Papitos. A good guy.

33
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,389
Gus?

34
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,890
Yeah.

35
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,891
Pappy.

36
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,892
Pappy.

37
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,894
What exactly did he say?

38
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,398
We know your history,
Officer Rosow.

39
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:23,804
He was very complimentary.
Gus. Pappy. Funny guy. But

40
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,807
Hang on.

41
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,310
Who's there?

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,312
Miss Charley.

43
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,314
Miss Charley who?

44
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,317
Miss Charley, an associate of
Drexler Hewitt.

45
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,433
May I come in?

46
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:09,949
Take it easy, Drexler.

47
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,571
How did you get here so quick?

48
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:36,075
You were on a conference call.
I know how to keep quiet.

49
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,579
Some guy the your building
opened the front door for me.

50
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,781
I bet he did.

51
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,988
It's a little early in the
morning for flirting.

52
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,491
Hey, you got a good arm.

53
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:56,496
You're pretty now, but you used
to be a tomboy.

54
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,998
You got three older brothers.

55
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:03,102
Perceptive.

56
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,906
No. I played with dolls and was
an only child.

57
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,408
Open the envelope.

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,128
He's got an okay face.

59
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,633
Chicago L.A.
Any other questions?

60
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:38,640
Yeah. What makes this Drexler Hewitt think
I'll tail this guy without any more information?

61
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,847
Good day, Mr. Rosow.

62
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:53,354
So far, I guess.

63
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,459
Where's Drexler?

64
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,361
I'm sorry, Mr. Hewitt is in a
meeting. May I take a message?

65
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,763
Who's the kid?

66
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:24,663
I'm sorry?

67
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,365
Yeah, me too. Who's the kid?

68
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,567
I don't know what you're
talking about.

69
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
You should've told me this was
one of those.

70
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,971
You'll have to talk to Mr. Hewitt
about this. I can't help you.

71
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,774
Yeah. I would've charged more if
I knew.

72
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,977
He's hiding in plain sight,
his door is open.

73
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,679
Like he's no more on the lam
than I am.

74
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,280
I'll have Mr. Hewitt call you.

75
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,583
Yeah, right. Thanks.

76
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:53,255
What can I get you? Sir? Sir?

77
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,358
Chicken, fish or vegetable
lasagna?

78
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,861
You pick one.

79
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,363
Chicken.

80
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,866
Martinis any good?

81
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,869
Well, you mix them yourself.
We have mini-bottles.

82
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:14,874
One gin one vermouth,
with olives and ice.

83
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:19,880
Everything but the olives, sir.
Sorry about that.

84
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,911
The 8 o'clock dinner is now
being served.

85
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,414
8 o'clock dinner in the dining
car is now being served.

86
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,917
And here's your pennant race of
date.

87
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:03,422
Manny Ramirez has tied the game
with a home run.

88
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,447
Um... ok, why don't you go
this... go on.

89
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:33,452
Excuse me.

90
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,669
Hey, you can't smoke in here.

91
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,474
Sorry about that.
I'm almost done.

92
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:21,080
No, no, no.
We have to follow someone.

93
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,082
He's friend of yours?

94
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,084
What's the difference?

95
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,087
We don't do that kind of thing
in L.A., you know.

96
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,888
It's too much hassle.

97
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,197
Look.

98
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,700
Ok but I have to report all this
to the dispatcher,

99
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,704
and the dispatcher, he has to
report it to the police. Okay?

100
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:55,214
All right. My guy's cab is
pulling out. You see it?

101
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,117
Yeah, I see it.

102
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:24,143
Hey, you think twenty dollars
buys you smoking privileges?

103
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,647
I don't hear you on the radio
reporting any of this.

104
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:34,453
I pick my spots. No hurry.

105
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:39,058
Looks to me like your friend is
going to Saint Monica.

106
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:44,063
Do you know Saint Monica?

107
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
No.

108
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,973
She's the patron saint of widows, unhappy
wives, and mothers of wayward children.

109
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,630
Rosow, does your cell phone
have a camera?

110
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,132
A camera? In my phone?

111
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,136
Please purchase one. Go to a cell phone
store, get a cell phone with a camera,

112
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
and send us photographs of the
man you are following.

113
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,140
I don't have a computer.

114
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,642
You don't need one. You send it
through the cell phone,

115
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
the one you're going to buy.

116
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
And make sure to keep the
receipt.

117
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:12,153
Can I just transmit an image of
the receipt back to you

118
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,156
instead of keeping little pieces
of paper all over the place?

119
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,659
All right, Rosow, transmit an
image of the receipt.

120
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
Will my new cell phone receive
images?

121
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
Why?

122
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:30,170
I don't know. You spark my
imagination, Charley.

123
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:48,987
Hi.

124
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,989
Hi. I hear you have rooms here.

125
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,992
Do you have a reservation?

126
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,494
Unexpected visit.

127
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,995
How many in your party?

128
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:57,996
No parties.

129
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,000
How long will you be staying
with us?

130
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,503
As long as he does.

131
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,004
As long as who does?

132
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,209
That man who just checked in.
He had a little boy with him.

133
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
So you know the man?
Or you know the kid?

134
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:18,022
All right. You know what? I'm just
going to be honest with you, Missy.

135
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
My name's not Missy.

136
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,526
Oh, I see. What's your name?

137
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,027
Mabel.

138
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:34,735
Mabel. This man, the man who just
checked in, he's my best friend.

139
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,238
So?

140
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,541
I'm worried about him.
He drinks too much.

141
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,545
I see.

142
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,547
Yeah. See what?

143
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,550
I have a friend in AA is all.

144
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,051
Yeah.

145
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:59,058
I just want to be close to him so
I can hear if he needs some help.

146
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,261
I mean, really, I don't want to
get you into.

147
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:08,268
Trouble's my middle name.

148
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,271
Room 101. Right next door.

149
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:17,782
Thanks a lot. I mean really.
It's an ugly thing.

150
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,785
Hey, I'm gonna' need a rental
car. Can you arrange that?

151
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,387
Done.

152
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:44,202
The merciless pressure of warfare has
developed highly specialized types of planes.

153
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:49,208
The dropping of grenades and
hand bombs

154
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,715
led to a new and terrible
instrument of war: the bomber.

155
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:18,740
Javier, do you mind if I play
some music?

156
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,745
Do you like jazz?

157
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:31,750
I love jazz.

158
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,155
When I traveled, on business,

159
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:42,662
every city I'd go to had a jazz
club, and I'd stay up all night.

160
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:49,169
I couldn't go when I was home, because my
wife was only interested in classical music.

161
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,183
Ah, just listen to him play.
Bud Powell.

162
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,814
He loves Stravinsky.

163
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,015
Who doesn't?

164
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,316
You know Stravinsky?

165
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,318
Yeah, I do now. But you're still
strangers.

166
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:24,122
Strangers? No. Chambers.
Special Agent Anne Chambers.

167
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:28,126
This is my partner. Special Agent
Tom R. Craig. We've been watching you.

168
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,630
You have a sad disposition,
Mr. Rosow.

169
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,634
Sit still and let them examine
you. That's what I always say.

170
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,336
That's a really funny motto for a guy
who's always running from everything.

171
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:42,440
You know, you're gonna' need
some sunglasses out here.

172
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,445
We have a couple of extras from our
7-11 excursion. Would you like a pair?

173
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,748
You're not trying to bug me, are
you?

174
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,051
No. We just got carried away at
7-11.

175
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,554
It's the Slurpees, right?

176
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,455
No, for you, it's the beer!

177
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,359
Be nice.

178
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,862
Here.

179
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,365
Yeah, I got them for two
dollars. They shine in the dark.

180
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,369
Oh, brilliant! Sunglasses that
shine in the dark!

181
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,872
Two dollars though! It's a hard
deal to pass up.

182
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:18,276
Well gee, I get paid a thousand dollars
a day to tail this guy. How about you?

183
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,580
You know, some of us in here, Rosow,
aren't really doing it for the money.

184
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,583
So, are you really a private
detective?

185
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,985
That's what they tell me.

186
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,987
We were just talking about that.

187
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,991
We didn't know they still had
those private detectives.

188
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:37,996
Well, you know what? If I call 911 and tell
them I got a couple of peeping toms in my alley

189
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,899
we could make a really big
scene, scare someone away.

190
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:45,907
You know, the thing is, you really just don't
know what you're dealing with yet, is all.

191
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,710
My partner is right.

192
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,412
You better stay sober for this
one.

193
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:58,416
Well, I'll drink to that.
When you two vamoose.

194
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,035
Good evening.

195
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,836
Hi, how are you?

196
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,840
Pretty good. I hear they got
phones that take pictures.

197
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,842
Oh yeah, we've got plenty of
those.

198
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,843
Oh yeah?

199
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,344
You saw the special that we're
having, right?

200
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,345
No, I didn't.

201
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,346
Okay, we got plenty.

202
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,848
You sell balloons?

203
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,850
We've got balloons. We've got a
special every day especially for you.

204
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,351
All right, let's get some phones
out for you.

205
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,353
Do you have anything in mind
specifically?

206
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,855
Yeah, a phone that takes
pictures.

207
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:41,359
Okay. Now, I'd be cheating you if I didn't
tell you that we have top of the line phones.

208
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,162
George Lucas bought this one
right here.

209
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,664
George Lucas?

210
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,666
He's a famous guy, a director or
producer, or something like that.

211
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,668
What's your name?

212
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,169
Me? Boogle.

213
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,170
Boogle?

214
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,171
Yeah.

215
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,675
I just want a phone that takes
pictures, Boogle.

216
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,976
Okay.

217
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,183
Hey, don't you see the walkway
there?

218
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,685
What?

219
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,186
There's a walkway over there.

220
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,189
You can't just cross wherever you want.
I could give you a ticket for jaywalking.

221
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,691
A ticket for jaywalking?

222
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,893
You mocking my job, dude?

223
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,097
No. I mean, you're a cop, right?

224
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,101
Let me see your I.D., please.

225
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,110
You're from New York?

226
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,612
Originally, yeah.

227
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,115
We do things different here.

228
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,118
Because of the earthquakes,
right?

229
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,622
Okay, lay off the jokes, guy.
Is that supposed to be a joke?

230
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,624
Sure.

231
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:53,031
Well we're in Hollywood, okay? We
leave the entertainment to Soupy Sales.

232
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,034
I suggest you go home.

233
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,739
There's no smoking on the
Promenade, fuck wad!

234
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:32,271
From a woman at the bar. She
wants you to know her name is Lana.

235
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,288
May I?

236
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:03,303
Hey. Hey, you're not one of those gals
that uses sex as a weapon, are you?

237
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,808
No. I don't like violence.

238
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,311
That's good.

239
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,315
Are you like everyone else here?
You in show business?

240
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,620
No. I'm in the hide and seek
business.

241
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,123
No. That is a game that kids
play.

242
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,726
Yeah but if you add some money
to it, it's for adults.

243
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:34,333
Well, what are you doing right
now, hiding or seeking?

244
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:40,338
Right now I'm drinking.

245
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,351
Do you want another drink?

246
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,464
No, come on. Come on.

247
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:11,871
I got to go to the bathroom.

248
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,779
What's wrong, lover?

249
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,323
Are these the kind of games
you're into?

250
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:09,827
No, they're for work.

251
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:15,335
Come on. It's alright.
You want me to cuff you up, huh?

252
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,537
You want to cuff me up?

253
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,368
Slow dance.

254
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:55,377
May I have this dance?

255
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:35,713
Lana. I never did figure out if
that was her real name.

256
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:40,718
Maybe it was, just for the
night.

257
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:45,724
She ended up passing out on her
pillow, and sleep-talking into the dawn.

258
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:52,231
She was asking her mother for the
extra-special blueberry pancakes.

259
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,734
There was a lot of cursing.

260
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,420
Hello, Drexler Hewitt's office.

261
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,622
Hey, Charley. Is Hewitt in?

262
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,625
No, Rosow, he is not.

263
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,628
I would've told him I am still in
contact with the Subject and the Boy.

264
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:36,134
Am presently tailing them south
to Mexico, I'm guessing.

265
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,136
Guessing, Rosow?

266
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,037
Guessing, Miss Charley.

267
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,539
I haven't received the image
yet.

268
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,543
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
I'll do it right now.

269
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:49,547
This is instantaneous, huh?

270
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,361
What is this? Who is this?

271
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,862
It's just a trial run, Charley.

272
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,864
I just want to make sure the new
technology really works.

273
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,867
Don't hang up on me, okay?
You're always hanging up on me.

274
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,869
What do you want, Rosow?

275
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,372
See, I just want you to talk to
me for a little while.

276
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,374
And why would I do that?

277
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm out here on this old spooky
desert highway,

278
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,384
following some defective bastard
with a poor little Mexican boy.

279
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,387
You and me, we work together.

280
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:34,892
I figure you could find a couple of
moments to tell me something about yourself.

281
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:35,893
Tell you about myself?

282
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,895
Nothing too personal.

283
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,398
I'll tell you one thing about
myself, Rosow...

284
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,399
Goodie.

285
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,400
and one thing only

286
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,401
What is it?

287
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,404
I'm hanging up the phone now.

288
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:55,413
Your loss. Your loss.

289
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,924
This is some prime real estate.

290
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,783
Hey, baby.

291
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,286
Hey.

292
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,793
Looks like you need a light,
huh?

293
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,597
There.

294
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:25,102
Hero Furillo. Hello.

295
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:29,707
Yeah.

296
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,709
That's nice.

297
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:36,213
I already got customers.

298
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:37,715
I know.

299
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,718
So, what do you want?

300
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,722
Where are you taking them? Here.

301
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:50,232
See? Mine.

302
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,236
No, you keep it. You might want
to call me sometime.

303
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,238
I got my cell phone on there.

304
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:05,343
Look, I got this new cell phone.
It takes pictures.

305
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,845
What do you want with those two?

306
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:12,350
An American man, a Mexican boy.
You see what I mean?

307
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:17,855
Yeah. But I'm not allowed to
talk about destinations.

308
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,358
I can get in big trouble.
I don't know you.

309
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,861
Where are you from?

310
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,863
What do you care?

311
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:30,868
What's a guy from New York doing
all the way out here, huh?

312
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:36,375
If you must know, because
New York is crazy now.

313
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,779
I used to have a place on West 4th
Street for four hundred bucks a month!

314
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,281
You can't even get a place in
Red Hook for that much anymore.

315
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,784
It's crazy. The guppies took
over.

316
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,787
You lived on West 4th?
By the cage?

317
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,789
Yeah, why? You been there?

318
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,290
I grew up on Minetta Lane.

319
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,292
Get the fuck out of here!

320
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:56,794
Get the fuck out of here!

321
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,295
Yeah.

322
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:02,800
No shit? You know, that's where
they shot the movie "Serpico".

323
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,804
My dad knew Serpico.
The real Serpico.

324
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,407
Yeah, he grew up on Perry and
Greenwich.

325
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,409
Get the fuck out of here!

326
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,910
Get the fuck out of here!

327
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,412
Get out of here! No shit?

328
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
Yeah.

329
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:21,921
Let me ask you something. Did he really
have one of them big dogs like in the movie?

330
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,425
Oh, yeah, right. I can't
remember. I was just a baby.

331
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,429
Because in the movie, Serpico's
got one of them big dogs, you know?

332
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,433
Like the kind in Peter Pan that goes
flying through the air with Wendy.

333
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,437
No, that's a flying Saint
Bernard.

334
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,439
Saint Bernard. Saint Bernard.

335
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,242
Yeah, but Serpico's dog was one of them
shaggy dogs with the hair in its eyes.

336
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,745
What, are you telling me that's
not a Saint Bernard?

337
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,746
I don't think so.

338
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:54,455
I think you might be wrong. I'll
google it.

339
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,958
Yeah, I'm gonna' google that
shit.

340
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,162
Look, I'd love to talk movies,
and New York, and dogs,

341
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,164
and googleplex configurations
all day long,

342
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,666
but you got to make a decision
here, all right?

343
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,167
I'm not going to get you into
any trouble.

344
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,670
I just want to know where this
man and the little boy are going.

345
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,174
You looking to hurt somebody,
man?

346
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,176
No, no, I'm trying to help
somebody.

347
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,679
Here, take this money and tell
me where they're going.

348
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,687
Santa Reyes, through the hills
and down by the ocean.

349
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,188
But the only way to get there is
to follow me.

350
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,190
That's what I had in mind.

351
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,692
Yeah, but everybody's gonna' see
you.

352
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,193
I mean, everybody's gonna' see
you.

353
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,695
You stick out like a broken
nose.

354
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,196
Hey, you make money at this
shit?

355
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:44,201
Oh yeah? Well, this five hundred
dollar bill says that I'm smashing.

356
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,703
Five hundred?

357
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,705
Yeah, or is that against the
rules, too?

358
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,809
I'm no cabbagehead. I know that
cabs are expensive in L.A.

359
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,312
You get this half, and I'll give you the
other half when we get to our destination.

360
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,315
Now, come on, pop the trunk.

361
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,818
What? What are you, crazy?

362
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,820
Come on. The trunk!

363
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,823
You're putting me in a very
idiosyncratic spot here.

364
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:10,829
I hope you can breathe in there.

365
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,331
I've had apartments smaller than
this in New York.

366
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:18,335
I heard that.

367
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,235
Here's the other half.

368
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,237
Which way did they go?

369
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,741
I can't see anything.

370
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,242
The glasses.

371
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,745
Oh, right.

372
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,779
Doggy. Okay. Good. Good boy.

373
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,739
How are you doing, my friend?
How's your stomach?

374
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,241
It hurts.

375
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:49,146
Can I offer you some coffee?
Delicious.

376
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,548
Sure.

377
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:52,549
How's the coffee coming?

378
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,151
It's coming, sir.

379
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,153
In the meantime, if I may
inquire.

380
00:45:56,153 --> 00:46:00,257
what are you doing sneaking around
in the dark on private property?

381
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,760
You upset my dog.

382
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,962
Are you with the FBI?

383
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,966
The FBI? No, I'm with myself.

384
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,468
I'm not after you or your dog.

385
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,871
So it's Harold?

386
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:18,375
Harold? Yeah, right, Harold.

387
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,379
I'm just trying to figure out
what Harold's doing.

388
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,982
He works for us.
For the orphanage.

389
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,886
He goes out and he finds children who
are in trouble and he brings them here.

390
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:34,091
He has saved the lives of
countless children.

391
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,594
Harold could be the only saint
I've ever met.

392
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,296
Saint?

393
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,198
That's correct, my friend.

394
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:45,702
So that's all?
That's why you're here?

395
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:50,707
That's it.

396
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:54,711
Would you like some sugar or
some cream?

397
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,715
No. No, thanks.

398
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:08,725
This is good, right?
Having coffee together?

399
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:14,832
I'm in a good mood. What can I
say? I went surfing tonight.

400
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,834
Oh?

401
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:21,941
It was great. Over at a place
called Punta Abreojos.

402
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:29,450
Punta. I know what that means.
What's Abreojos?

403
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,453
It means "open eyes".

404
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:41,662
Means I can see you, man.

405
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,867
Oh, man. I like you, brother.

406
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,369
Well, that's great, I like you,
too.

407
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,372
I don't have any reason to, but
I just like you.

408
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,874
Sometimes that's just the way it
goes.

409
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,879
Sometimes you meet somebody, you don't
like them. That ever happen to you?

410
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,881
Sometimes.

411
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,886
That's why I don't go out a lot,
you know?

412
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,891
People, they can hurt you.

413
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:19,199
My wife... I'm having some
trouble with her, you know?

414
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,706
So I stay by myself a lot of
times. It's okay.

415
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:35,312
Oh, man. You're a nice guy.

416
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,815
I'm going to have to take your phone
and delete the photos in the gallery.

417
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,824
Fine.

418
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:52,329
You know, if I didn't like you, I'd take this
phone and I'd just smash it into the wall.

419
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,033
I appreciate that you don't.

420
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:01,338
Hey, that's a good shot of me!
Too bad.

421
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,840
Everything all right, don Edgar?

422
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,346
I think so. Our friend here was
just leaving.

423
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:14,855
Take care, my friend. And please
tell whoever is wondering about Harold

424
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,259
that he is doing fantastic.
He is a very virtuous man.

425
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:26,263
Do you know where that diner is
out of town? The truck stop?

426
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:31,468
Let me talk to Coach Hewitt.
Please.

427
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,970
Hold on.

428
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,472
Drexler Hewitt.

429
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,976
His name is Harold. He's not a
pederast.

430
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,479
Why am I finding out things that
other people already know?

431
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,482
You have to give me more
information before I go any further.

432
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,484
Of course I will. And some more
money, too.

433
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,486
Where is Harold Fullmer now?

434
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,489
Harold Fullmer? That's his name?

435
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,991
Yes.

436
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,494
Well, why don't you tell me why
I'm following Harold Fullmer,

437
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,496
and I'll tell you where I'm
following him.

438
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,498
Okay, okay. I have a counter
offer, Mr. Rosow.

439
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,501
Why don't you retrieve him, and
deliver him to New York.

440
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,003
New York?

441
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,505
No. No, thanks.

442
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,507
There is more money in it than
you've ever earned.

443
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,009
I don't do that sort of thing.

444
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,513
How does $500,000 sound?

445
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,517
I can wire the money into your checking
account when the Subject is delivered.

446
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,019
Delivered to whom?

447
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,522
His wife. She's my client. She
loves him. She misses him.

448
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,024
She just wants to talk to him.

449
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:32,029
She must want to talk to him
real bad. That's a lot of money.

450
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,532
He might turn tail and run again
after a couple of words.

451
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:40,037
Well, Mr. Rosow, that's not
your problem.

452
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,040
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

453
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,044
We thought that with your history,
you would comprehend the situation.

454
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,046
You could sympathize.
You would understand.

455
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,049
I don't understand anything.

456
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:56,153
Okay, he's coming back now, I get
it. What do you want me to say to him?

457
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,155
Just say hello.

458
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,658
Hi, Rosow, I just decided to stay in
your motel room for twenty-four hours

459
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,660
waiting for you to come back to
my loving arms.

460
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,661
There you go.

461
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,164
I convinced him that I was
lonely and desperate.

462
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,166
I don't think even he believed
that I was that lonely but...

463
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,168
Just pour him a drink.

464
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,679
Are these the kind of games you
like to play?

465
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,982
No, it's not what you think.

466
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,885
Hey, I promise, I have no idea
at all.

467
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,388
I don't know what you're doing
or who you're working for.

468
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,989
I work for myself.

469
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,491
Who was on the phone?

470
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,494
Ex-boyfriend.

471
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,995
How long have you been here?

472
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:45,102
You work for Harold? Hewitt? Don
Edgar? The Feds?

473
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,106
No, no, no and no.

474
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,608
You're hurting me!

475
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,111
Yeah, come on, Miss Lonely hearts.
Tell me something I don't know.

476
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,712
Papitos.

477
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,214
Gus?

478
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,216
Let go.

479
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,217
You work for Gus?

480
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,719
Let me go.

481
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:08,726
Pappy. Oh, shit.

482
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:14,733
Care for a cocktail? I sure do.
It's been a long night.

483
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,345
Gus.

484
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,857
Oh, damn! That hurt!

485
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:10,987
All right, all right.

486
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:14,491
Hello?

487
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:19,498
It's Hero Furillo. I just dropped off
your guy at Union Station. You need a ride?

488
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,818
You saved my bacon.

489
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:47,524
You better be doing the right
thing, you know.

490
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,525
Yeah.

491
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,028
I mean it. You know, I'll
probably never see you again,

492
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,530
so it's not like I'll ever
really know.

493
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,034
But you better be doing the
right thing, homes. You know?

494
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:02,038
I like to think that you're on
the right side. The Serpico side.

495
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,541
Because that's the side I want
to get on.

496
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,543
I wish it was that simple.

497
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,545
Oh, don't give me that, man.

498
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,946
Come on, don't give me that.

499
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,950
I won't let you down, Hero.

500
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:52,689
Aren't you a little tired of
trains?

501
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,692
Do I know you?

502
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,194
You recognize me all right.
I've been following you.

503
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,196
Why?

504
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,698
I'm getting paid.

505
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:05,201
Oh. For the money.

506
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,704
Why is the FBI tailing you?

507
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,206
I don't know.

508
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:14,210
I'll try another question. You
ready to come back with me, Harold?

509
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,212
Back to your wife?

510
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,714
Absolutely no.

511
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,717
If you don't come with me,
I'll cause a ruckus.

512
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:24,220
I'll scream that you robbed me, or
propositioned me, I'll probably punch you,

513
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,224
the miso soup will go flying everywhere,
the little waitress will call the police,

514
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,726
and we'll both get arrested.

515
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,528
Which is fine for me, but not
for you.

516
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:36,032
If I were you, I'd rather talk to
my wife than to the authorities.

517
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:40,036
And you could start by talking
to me.

518
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:45,047
I find children that are in distress,
and I take them to a safe haven.

519
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,550
Doesn't anybody miss these kids?

520
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,354
The world is filled with
children no one wants.

521
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,958
This last kid, from Chicago, he
seemed okay enough.

522
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:08,365
Javier? He was in twenty porno
films before I found him.

523
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,468
He tried to kill himself twice.

524
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,970
His mother had eight children,
husband gone.

525
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,475
Someone offered her a thousand
dollars to take Javier to America,

526
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,778
to feed him, clothe him, enroll
him in a good Catholic...

527
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,180
All right, all right, that's
enough. We got a plane to catch.

528
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,181
I can't fly.

529
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:25,882
What?

530
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,183
You heard me.

531
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,885
No, we're not taking a train
back to New York.

532
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,887
Those sleeping cars are like
coffins.

533
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,390
New York?

534
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,895
Yeah. You're going back to her.
She's worried about you.

535
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,298
I don't like flying myself. I'm
not a big fan of New York either.

536
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:45,201
Why? What happened in New York?

537
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,214
Sometimes when you try to make things
better, you end up just making them worse.

538
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:02,919
That's bullshit. Harold, what about
your wife, huh? You don't just drop out.

539
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,221
The life I lead now is the very
contrary of dropping out.

540
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:10,728
Most people can't wait to get home
to their house, their apartment,

541
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,731
shut the door and turn on the
TV.

542
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,232
To me, that's dropping out.

543
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:17,734
Right.

544
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:22,238
I've never felt myself as a
civilian.

545
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:26,242
This kind of life, being
missing, it suits me.

546
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,451
It all changed so fast.

547
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,456
One day I was one person, then came the
explosions, then I was another person.

548
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:44,963
Some things are too terrible to
be true.

549
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,967
Explosions?

550
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,969
Didn't they tell you?

551
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,971
No. What? Tell me what?

552
00:57:54,971 --> 00:58:00,278
I worked in the World Trade Center.
I barely made it out in time.

553
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:10,288
I ran down those steps out of
the north tower.

554
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:16,793
I haven't seen my wife since.

555
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:21,798
You were a missing person?

556
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,000
I am a missing person.

557
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:29,912
I thought of calling home and trying to tell
her I was all right, but I couldn't do it.

558
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:41,319
I didn't know why. The next day it occurred
to me that she probably thought I was dead.

559
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,724
I was relieved.

560
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:52,832
She'd always think of me as a
hero of sorts. A reluctant hero.

561
00:58:55,832 --> 00:59:01,341
How the hell do you do that? How
do you leave your wife like that?

562
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:10,450
We lost a child, Megan and I.
A kidnapping.

563
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:19,959
It changed everything. Nothing
was right after that.

564
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:28,172
Well, I'm sorry. That's
terrible, but still... still...

565
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,232
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll
look outside your window,

566
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,234
you'll see the lights of New
York City coming up.

567
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,238
We're about a half hour outside
of JFK. The weather is beautiful.

568
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,240
Baby, what floor are you on?

569
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,742
We're on the fiftieth floor.

570
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,243
Fiftieth floor?

571
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,245
We have seven people here, and
we can't get out.

572
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:53,249
Babe, don't worry. The guys are on their way
there now, and I'm gonna' be running up there, too.

573
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,251
You're gonna' see me before you
know it. Okay?

574
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,252
Okay, baby.

575
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:01,758
The line's on Broadway! Bryant
and Broadway, Doug!

576
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,761
Stand back! The tower is coming
down!

577
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:09,465
The towers are coming down!

578
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,468
They're coming down!

579
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,972
The second tower is down!

580
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:54,510
Does my wife know what I've been
doing?

581
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:59,015
How much is she paying you?

582
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:05,021
Hey, do you have any idea what it's
like to be abandoned by somebody?

583
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,522
I have an idea what it's like.

584
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,226
Hey just shut the fuck up!
I'm tired of you.

585
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,028
Excuse me.

586
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,830
Can I have another bloody mary?

587
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,033
Sorry, we're on our descent.

588
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,036
Better make it a double.

589
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,851
Charley!

590
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,854
I didn't know you'd be
accompanying us. Terrific!

591
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,355
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

592
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,657
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

593
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,660
The Seymour Hotel, midtown.

594
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,963
That's not what the lady said,
boss.

595
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,665
Well, are you gonna' listen to the
lady or are you gonna' listen to me?

596
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,267
What are you up to?

597
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,770
You cannot smoke in here, boss.

598
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,273
It was a long flight. Give me a
break, Kit-Kat.

599
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,075
I thought we were going straight
to my wife.

600
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,576
Why the Seymour?

601
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:04,080
There's some business to take care
of. I want to make sure it goes right.

602
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,083
Sorry boss, you cannot smoke in
here, boss.

603
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,084
Okay.

604
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,087
I'm glad you're here, Charley.

605
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:16,392
I could use your help. Closing out the
ninth inning has never been my strong suit.

606
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,895
I'm still trying to find your
strong suit.

607
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,798
Oh, but I forgot. You never
played baseball.

608
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,800
If you insist on smoking, boss,
I will have to ask...

609
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,103
No, okay, okay. See?

610
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:29,605
Thank you, boss.

611
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:35,112
Oh, you're most welcome. And please stop
calling me boss. I am not Bruce Springsteen.

612
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,815
You can drive now.

613
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,127
So, this your first time in New
York, buddy?

614
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:49,986
Who's there?

615
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:55,492
Who? Whooo? Don't cry.
It's just me.

616
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:59,495
Yeah.

617
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,999
They made you a lieutenant?
Lieutenant Pappy?

618
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:06,502
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

619
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,104
It's crazy.

620
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,605
Do my eyes deceive me?

621
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:10,806
Gus.

622
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,108
Harold.

623
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,110
The homecoming gets larger.

624
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,611
How did you know?

625
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,113
Little birdie.

626
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,614
Lana sends her love.

627
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,116
What love?

628
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,619
I know, I owe you an explanation.
Give me a drink, will you?

629
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:28,625
I was responsible for you, John.

630
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,628
You were my recommendation, so I
had to send Lana down to keep an eye.

631
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:36,132
Oh, she learned some weird
stories about you.

632
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:41,139
I had to make sure you were still
compis mentis. You blockhead.

633
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,142
God, it's good to see you!

634
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:51,548
Why are you so serious? Move
along. Shove off, sailor.

635
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,550
Who's Lana?

636
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,453
You weren't in on that?

637
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,955
No. Who is she?

638
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:04,463
This lady. She dropped Gus's name, I didn't
see a connection, so I did some googling.

639
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,465
You found out that Gus worked on
our case, the kidnapping.

640
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,267
I did.

641
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,770
And then Gus called me and volunteered
to help out when we got to New York.

642
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:20,576
It didn't work out the way we wanted,
but Gus was a good man. Throughout.

643
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:24,780
I still have some bad nights
about that, Harold. You know I do.

644
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:29,787
I'm sorry it's going down like this,
but Miss Megan, she's beside herself.

645
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:36,092
And then she finds out you're still
alive, I mean, you can imagine...

646
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,294
What are you doing here, Gus?

647
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:43,600
I'm gonna' baby sit you, Harold,
while John and Miss Smiley over there

648
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,102
take care of some business.

649
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,104
Whose side you on?

650
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:53,911
Whose side am I on? I'm on your wife's side.
Don't you think she's been through enough?

651
01:06:55,911 --> 01:07:00,919
Besides, I got a soft spot for
New Yorkers who stay in New York.

652
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,534
Hey, Miss Charley.

653
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,536
Yes?

654
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,540
Do me a favor?

655
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,485
Yeah, well.

656
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,422
Hello?

657
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:51,427
Mr. Rosow, I presume.
Sit down, please.

658
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,949
I'm sorry about the darkness.

659
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,454
I'm afraid I've become quite a bit of
a cave dweller over the past few years.

660
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:23,963
Please don't smoke that in here.
I'm sorry.

661
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:32,970
No, that's all right. It's a
nasty habit, I should quit.

662
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:39,475
I like your place.
It's very nice.

663
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:44,482
Thank you. Can I get you
anything? Some water? Coffee?

664
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,386
No that's all right. I don't
think your maid likes me very much.

665
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,889
What makes you say that?

666
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:58,394
I was just kidding, I guess.

667
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:03,899
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I got
your joke.

668
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,403
I've never had any dealings with
private detectives, Mr. Rosow.

669
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,406
I've seen them in Bogart films
though.

670
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:15,411
Was that one of those kind of jokes?
Those dry and sardonic detective jokes?

671
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:19,915
It was my sad attempt.

672
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:24,420
So you make jokes and you smoke
cigarettes.

673
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,425
Do those ancient customs make
you a more efficient, detective?

674
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:34,432
Probably not, but I'm not really a
detective on this case anymore, am I?

675
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:40,436
I'm more what you'd call a
delivery boy.

676
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:45,441
Don't underestimate your value,
Mr. Rosow.

677
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,244
How did you find out Harold was
alive?

678
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:53,751
A friend ran into him in Mexico.
Of all places.

679
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,754
Some small village on the west
coast of Mexico.

680
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,757
Impossible, I thought.
She was certain.

681
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,263
She swore it was Harold despite the fact that
the medical examiner had just ruled him...

682
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,771
Where is he?
Where is my husband?

683
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,276
He's close by. He's ok.
But I gotta' tell you...

684
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,278
Why is he not here? With you?

685
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,779
That was the agreement.

686
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,282
It's about the money.

687
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,385
We can arrange for more.

688
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:35,392
I don't want more money. I want what
I'm owed, up front, now, beforehand.

689
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:40,896
Paid on delivery is what I
understood.

690
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:46,409
Mrs. Fullmer, Harold's not the
same man. He's different, you know?

691
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,910
I mean, I didn't know him
before...

692
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,413
Everything is different. Of
course Harold is different.

693
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:02,421
I just want to make sure he is okay. And
I know when he sees me, he'll remember.

694
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,424
He'll remember himself.

695
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:12,428
So I'll write you a check.

696
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:17,933
I understand you. I really do, but sometimes
when you try and make things better...

697
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:23,439
I know you do understand.
Because they told me about you.

698
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,441
Oh.

699
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:30,952
About your wife. They told me about her
and, Mr. Rosow, I'm very sorry for your loss.

700
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:42,460
Yes, thanks.

701
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,964
Sorry.

702
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:53,469
You know, thanks.

703
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:58,976
Whatever my chances are,
I need to take them.

704
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,487
Could you make the check out to
cash?

705
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:16,495
I'll deliver Harold tomorrow
morning after this check clears.

706
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:25,003
Yes. And tell him one thing for
me, Mr. Rosow. Will you?

707
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,505
Sure.

708
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:35,013
Tell him I can't wait to be with
him.

709
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,525
Bad news.

710
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,627
Want a hit?

711
01:13:55,631 --> 01:14:00,135
That kid blocks the plate like
Thurman Munson.

712
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:05,142
I drank too much. Harold's gone.

713
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:12,151
No. You think I drink too much, too
much to bring this guy back to his wife.

714
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:20,656
You were banking on that. Lana
almost pulled it off.

715
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:24,159
You always did like your
conspiracy theories, John.

716
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,663
You sure you don't want a pop?

717
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:32,670
No. Can I have a couple of
scallion pancakes though?

718
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:39,678
Knock yourself out.
Don't forget the sauce.

719
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:48,687
Yum. I do miss the take-out
Chinese.

720
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,189
There's no place good in Chicago
that delivers.

721
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,393
I could've told you that, and
I've never even been in Chicago.

722
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:02,898
What about the pizza? They got
that Chicago style, right?

723
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:06,301
Yeah, they got your Chicago style
pizza, sure, but you know what that is?

724
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:12,307
And I just found this out
myself. It's just Sicilian style.

725
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:16,311
It's just a different name for
Sicilian.

726
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:20,315
We went over to Difara's the
other night and got seven pies.

727
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,318
I think he's still making them.

728
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:27,322
The boys miss you, John.
We all miss you.

729
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:32,528
How long have you been on
Drexler Hewitt's payroll?

730
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,530
Here we go.

731
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:39,535
You get paid by Miss Fullmer to
find Harold,

732
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,038
but you get paid even more by
Hewitt not to find him.

733
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:48,544
Is that it? So you hire me to
bring him back to Miss Fullmer,

734
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:53,550
but you hire me more for Drexler,
because you figure I'll muck it up.

735
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,052
You got a napkin?

736
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,556
I earn my money.

737
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:05,562
You get the medex to forge
Harold's death certificate.

738
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,566
With Harold officially dead,
case closed.

739
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,068
All the insurance and
compensation money gets collected,

740
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:18,574
and the estate gets divvied up, and Drexler
Hewitt gets his piece of the Fullmer pie.

741
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:23,584
I'm sure you got your crumb. But then, oh,
a friend of the missus sees Harold in Mexico.

742
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:34,089
Harold wasn't coming back. He was
gone, might as well have been dead.

743
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:38,594
It was high time she figured
that out for herself.

744
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,095
Why do you care?

745
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:45,100
9/11 families were paid by the
government

746
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,604
according to how much the victim
would have earned in a lifetime.

747
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:54,610
I know. And Harold was a big
deal broker.

748
01:16:55,110 --> 01:17:00,618
That's a lot of money. Enough for a greedy
lawyer to want to make sure he stays dead.

749
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,622
So Drexler bought you to help
him.

750
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:11,627
He knew how much Miss Fullmer
trusted you.

751
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:17,137
Listen, John. Harold wasn't
going to stay home. He's nuts.

752
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:27,145
His old lady is a kookjob. All
that money, for what?

753
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:35,153
It's crazy. People like that,
they're not like us.

754
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:43,661
She just wanted to talk to him,
Gus.

755
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,575
I'm gonna' need you to leave
your cell phone.

756
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:05,580
It's got all those nice pictures
on it.

757
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:10,990
Oh well. I had the feeling it
was gonna' get old anyway.

758
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,496
Oh, John, one more thing.

759
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:24,499
Your old buddy, Don Edgar?

760
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:29,504
Taking care of all the little
kiddie widdies down Mexico way?

761
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,006
What about him?

762
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,507
That orphanage is a front.

763
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:37,012
Don Edgar, the most major dope
dealer in Tijuana.

764
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:43,018
Yeah, that's right. Whether Harold knew it or
not, he was in cahoots with a very bad hombre.

765
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:45,020
I don't believe you.

766
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:50,026
No? It's true. Why do you think
the FBI was snooping around?

767
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:56,531
Christ, what happened to those
kids?

768
01:18:56,531 --> 01:19:01,036
Don Edgar says he sends them
back to their families.

769
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:06,542
Right. And I'm Tinkerbell.

770
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:13,048
You seem upset, John.
What are you thinking?

771
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:17,052
You thinking you want to come
over here and hit me?

772
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:22,059
No. I'm just trying to remember
what I ever saw in you.

773
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,688
Did he give you any trouble?

774
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,691
No. He was very nice.
No trouble at all.

775
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,694
Put your hands under the table.
Yeah.

776
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:42,898
He plays like an angel,
doesn't he?

777
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:48,207
Tomorrow morning, you go back to
her.

778
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,210
The gig is up. This is the old
reality, Harold.

779
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:59,714
You're in New York. You ain't
dead, there aren't any angels,

780
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,716
and the missus wants to see you.

781
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:06,721
Matter of fact, she said she
can't wait to see you.

782
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,224
You know about angels, Rosow.

783
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:11,226
Oh, I do?

784
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,728
I saw you listening to the song.

785
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,231
Did you see him, Miss Charley?

786
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:18,233
No, I did not.

787
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:21,536
You know the music is okay, but
the service stinks.

788
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:24,539
We're empty here.
Where's the waitress?

789
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,473
Good morning.

790
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,295
What the fuck are you doing,
you idiot?

791
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,318
Who's the saint who looks after
money?

792
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,319
I can't hear ya.

793
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,821
Never mind.

794
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:50,725
Do you have a problem with me
smoking?

795
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:53,028
NO!

796
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,033
Come on!

797
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,049
I appreciate this, Charley.

798
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,050
Oh, that's okay.

799
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,053
No, I really do.

800
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,555
You want me to go up with you?

801
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,558
I think I should go alone.

802
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,561
Okay. Well, I have some business
with Drexler Hewitt, so...

803
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,563
Good luck.

804
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,065
Good luck.

805
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,682
Memories flooding you right
about now, huh?

806
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,684
No, not really.

807
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:53,188
Hey, listen. There's no way you're going
in with this kind of attitude, okay?

808
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,691
You stand up straight and look
happy to see her. Come on.

809
01:24:56,691 --> 01:25:01,296
Remember me, darling?

810
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,205
Is that you, sir?

811
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,007
Don't be rude to the lady.

812
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,510
I need to use the bathroom.

813
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:27,424
Hey, this is what, one of those
recreations of a famous painting?

814
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:30,925
Yeah.

815
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,428
Kind of funky looking, isn't it?

816
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,930
Julian, Mr. and Mrs. Fullmer's
son.

817
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,434
He won the contest at school
with that piece.

818
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:43,438
The theme was Masterpieces of
American Art.

819
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,941
Julian was only eight years old
when he painted it.

820
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:52,448
Pretty good for an eight year
old, I guess.

821
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,450
Don't touch it.

822
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:31,486
John?

823
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:45,100
John?

824
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:50,805
Let me go, please.

825
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:55,911
Please let me go.

826
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:00,575
You wake up one day and you're
an adult.

827
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:05,982
And all the people you were just
dreaming about have gone or changed.

828
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:13,087
So you shake the sleep dust
from your eyes and you say,

829
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:18,593
was it really so long ago that
you and I sat together in fun?

830
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:23,601
No. Not so long ago. But life
goes by in the blink of an eye.

831
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:32,409
Sobriety, after all this time, isn't
as bitter as I thought it would be.

832
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:39,917
Recently, for a second or two, I almost
felt like things were okay with the world.

833
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,921
Strange to feel that way, when
you know there are wars everywhere,

834
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:50,425
and everything is going to hell
in a hand basket.

835
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:55,933
But still, I must admit, for a
moment, I felt some kind of peace.

836
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:04,442
Charley, she finally said yes
to a date with me.

837
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,445
I have a confession. I lied.

838
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:13,448
You were right.

839
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,451
I have four older brothers.

840
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:21,456
And I was an All-Star shortstop in the
boy's little league three years in a row.

841
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:24,459
Till they kicked me out.

842
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:43,578
Remember when it was like that?

843
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:48,585
When we were all together? And I
figured we'd play forever.

844
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:52,086
I had no idea.

845
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:01,996
She's not a half bad girl,
Charley.

846
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,499
She's looking for a job now.

847
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:09,504
I told her she could be my secretary
once I got a few more assignments,

848
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:13,508
but she said she didn't mix
business with pleasure.

849
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:19,013
I promised her I was no
pleasure. Yuk, yuk, yuk.

850
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:24,521
Sometimes I think back to that day at
Miss Fullmer's place, and I ask myself,

851
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:29,023
did you do the right thing?

852
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:34,030
I don't know.
What is that, the right thing?

853
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:41,536
A police reporter once said that when we
pass beyond the lights of a precinct station,

854
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:47,041
we go into another world, a
place beyond right and wrong.

855
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:52,047
I don't really mind living this
way. Quiet.

856
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,049
Not much to say.

857
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:59,554
But sometimes, every once in a
while,

858
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:04,058
I remember back to when I had
you.

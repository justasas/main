1
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:35,510
The first blast was set offby five terrorists.

2
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,512
It took two million years...

3
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,017
for some of the radioactive cloudsto allow some sun in.

4
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:46,111
By then, only a handfulof humans survived.

5
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,749
The rest of humanity hadchanged into hideous mutants.

6
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:53,488
These mutant speciesfloundered in the bad areas...

7
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:57,862
radioactive lands that never allowedthem to become human again...

8
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:01,369
and made each birth a new disaster.

9
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,803
Then, in the good lands...

10
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,310
they came back,arising from their long sleep...

11
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,608
fairies, elves, dwarves...

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,205
the true ancestors of man.

13
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:16,808
They lived happily in the good areas.

14
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,146
It was a big day in Montagar.Delia, queen of the fairies...

15
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:24,158
was presiding over the feast of plenty...

16
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,854
celebrating 3,000 years of peace.

17
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,659
In the midst of the celebration...

18
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,326
Delia felt a pull from the skies.

19
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,767
She looked upand saw dark clouds...

20
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:38,603
forming on the horizon in every direction.

21
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:42,872
She fell into a tranceand left the party...

22
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,812
heading for her home on a high hill.

23
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,213
At first, the fairies were puzzled.

24
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:52,653
But then they too felta force drawing them to follow.

25
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,985
Delia was alone inside.

26
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:58,515
The storm grew untilit was a raging cyclone...

27
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,721
hovering over the dwelling.

28
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:04,994
One of the older fairiesventured inside the house.

29
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:08,195
There lay Delia on her bed...

30
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,933
holding a pair of twins in her arms.

31
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,998
The older fairy instantly knew that...

32
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:18,638
these were not ordinary twins,but magical wizards.

33
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,649
The baby wizards werepolarized like magnets...

34
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,686
one attracting with a magnetic draw...

35
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:28,484
the other repellingand impossible to get near.

36
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,651
Avatar, the kind and good wizard...

37
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,161
spent much of his boyhood...

38
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,222
entertaining his motherwith beautiful visions.

39
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,665
Blackwolf, the mutant wizard...

40
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,670
would never visit his mother...

41
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:47,232
and spent his timetorturing small animals.

42
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:50,676
More years passed,and Delia continued to slip.

43
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,681
Finally, all life drained out of her...

44
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:58,186
and Avatar held her hand tryingdesperately to use his magic to restore her.

45
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,553
He cradled her in his arms and wept.

46
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:06,584
When Blackwolf found thathis mother had died, he was excited...

47
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:12,396
for now he felt he would take overher leadership and rule the land.

48
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:15,403
When Avatar confrontedBlackwolf, he was enraged.

49
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,635
They began a furious battle.

50
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,471
Each using his magic, they continued...

51
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:24,569
until they had nearly destroyed each other.

52
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,152
But Avatar's magic was stronger...

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,556
because he had the emotional lossof his mother that drove him on.

54
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,321
Blackwolf was defeated.

55
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,920
"The day will come, my brother,when I will return...

56
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:45,592
and make this a planetwhere mutants rule. "

57
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:50,002
Blackwolfheaded off,leaving Avatar very disturbed.

58
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,685
The time has come.

59
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,695
Kill!

60
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,645
Well, hello, handsome.

61
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:01,270
Hello, honey.

62
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:09,081
He is called Necron 99.

63
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,177
He is one of Blackwolf's assassins.

64
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:16,190
He travels the land destroyingthe believers of magic.

65
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:49,248
"My children,the only true technology is nature.

66
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,656
"All the other formsof manmade technology...

67
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,161
"are perversions.

68
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,164
"The ancient dictators used technology...

69
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:59,826
to enslave the masses."

70
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:43,296
- Weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?- No.

71
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:46,306
Just for a few hours' rest.

72
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:49,810
- I sense something.- But the road is clear.

73
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:52,812
We haven't seen an assassin for days.

74
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,314
A clever assassin stays hidden.

75
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,647
Avatar must be warned.

76
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:01,654
Our mission is nearly over, Westwind...

77
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,917
but now it's time for one final run.

78
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,584
Damn it!

79
00:11:56,197 --> 00:12:00,600
- Well?- They're not back yet, my president.

80
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,367
- They're really late now,aren't they, old wizard?

81
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,374
Bad magic, isn't it?

82
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,376
And if they don't show...

83
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,709
you'll know no more than you did before.

84
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:18,013
- How true, fairy goddessof the New World...

85
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,315
but if they don't show...

86
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:23,824
I think that will tell us something too.

87
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,189
Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger...

88
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:31,789
maybe we should...maybe we should arm our states.

89
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:36,303
- Science and technology?- There's no time for that.

90
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,703
Even if we could impressour people with the danger...

91
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,208
science and technology were outlawed...

92
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,574
millions of years ago...

93
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,704
and, we must admit...

94
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,648
it's been a peaceful world since then.

95
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,685
Enough, Wizard!

96
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,722
I demand to know what you know...

97
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,849
- or I'll banish you!

98
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,224
Banish him?

99
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,729
But, Father, who will teach me...

100
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,733
all the magic I've left to learn?

101
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,735
Only Avatar can make me...

102
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,737
a full-fledged fairy.

103
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,000
As you can see, I'm only half there.

104
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,736
All right. All right.

105
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,712
I'll tell you...

106
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,681
if you think you can handle it.

107
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,184
What do you knowabout war, about bombs...

108
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:28,881
that could turna planet molten and liquid?

109
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,686
To think it could start again...

110
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,559
ten million years after the final one.

111
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:41,696
Sometimes I get tired of being so old.

112
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,896
Sometimes...

113
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:47,702
being a wizard is lonely at the top.

114
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,642
We're waiting, old, old wizard.

115
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,702
You know about my brother.

116
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,012
Well, as the years passed...

117
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,211
I searched for my brother in vain.

118
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:03,245
He had settledin the dark land of Scortch...

119
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:06,350
where people still died of radiation.

120
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:10,363
For 5,000 years,Blackwolf studied black arts...

121
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,834
increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold.

122
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:18,030
He built a small followingof frog-like creatures...

123
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:22,007
but needed more troopsfor his evil plans.

124
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,011
He then formed an armywhose generals were called up...

125
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,139
from the black shadows of hell.

126
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:34,380
Souls who waited for untold eternitiesfor a new leader...

127
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,719
Blackwolf's tremendous power...

128
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,589
enslaved them all to carry out his will.

129
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,091
Then stories of Blackwolf's armies...

130
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,690
attacking neighboring countries came back.

131
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,203
Demons of hell armed with black magic...

132
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,399
but they would get bored...

133
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:55,408
or sidetracked in the middle of battle...

134
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,774
and give up, running home.

135
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:13,791
Fritz! Fritz, get up,for God's sake! Get up!

136
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,226
They've killed Fritz!They've killed Fritz!

137
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,730
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!

138
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,234
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!

139
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,736
Those despicable, animal warmongers!

140
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,738
They've killed Fritz!

141
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,774
Take that! Take this!

142
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,036
Take that, you green slime!

143
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,738
- You black-hearted, short bow-legged...- Max!

144
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:37,249
Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max.Just a scratch.

145
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:41,344
- Look, I'm all right.- Oh. Oh, damn.

146
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,355
There you go againstepping on my lines...

147
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,789
raining on my parade, costing me medals.

148
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,759
Oh, damn!

149
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,262
Ohh. Oh, Fritz?

150
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:54,357
Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!

151
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,767
They've killed Fritz!They've killed Fritz!

152
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,271
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!

153
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,774
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!

154
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:06,175
Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz!

155
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,978
They could easily have won,but they lacked...

156
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,347
the motivation and inspiration.

157
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,819
Blackwolfknew he needed more.

158
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,882
He sent his huge armies outto excavate ancient ruins...

159
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,019
for links to the past.

160
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:27,328
Tales reached Avatar that bits and piecesof pre-holocaust technology...

161
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,734
were being dug up and marchedback to Scortch I.

162
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,965
With these ancient pieces...

163
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,736
he built a new war machine.

164
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,744
Still, his generalsneeded more to fight with.

165
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,440
This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration.

166
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:47,214
Then one day, that frustration vanished.

167
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:51,746
I sent my elf spies to find outwhat was happening.

168
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,258
I'm sure he hasfound some great power...

169
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:57,091
that will control his armies.

170
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:01,156
You mean you sent out that elf envoy...

171
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:05,000
to investigatebased on a vague feeling of your...

172
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,224
I've failed you, my wizard.

173
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,317
I've failed you, my president.

174
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,813
What news do you bring?

175
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,553
The lights went out! The lights went out!

176
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,562
Necron 99 has destroyed himself.

177
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:41,594
It's done!

178
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,501
With the assassinationof the presidents of the free states...

179
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,505
comes their fall...

180
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:51,509
and that of my brother.

181
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,636
It's done.

182
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,943
We have four more lights left, sir...

183
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,006
four more.

184
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,018
It's not important!

185
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:06,184
The main exterminations are complete.

186
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,524
The remaining countries are now ruled...

187
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,029
by second-rate incompetents...

188
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,965
so confused...

189
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,332
that even now they blame the killings...

190
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:22,033
on those within their own ranks.

191
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,480
It's time to strike!

192
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,076
Sieg heil.

193
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,566
Hey, hey, hey.Come on, lard bottom.

194
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,001
- Get up. Blackwolf's callin'.- I don't want to go.

195
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,562
Hey, when Blackwolf calls, we go.

196
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,074
- I don't want to fight anymore.- Ya gotta.

197
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:01,170
- I don't want to hurt things anymore.- Hey, you're so stupid.

198
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:04,080
Listen, I ain't stupid. Just listen.

199
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,017
You know what I mean,trees, birds, butterflies...

200
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,145
Everything's got a rightto live. You know what I mean?

201
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,746
- Hey...- Everything! Everything's got a right to live.

202
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,088
- Hey, wait a minute!- Butterflies...

203
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,958
Blackwolf's got a secret weaponthat makes us invincible.

204
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,589
We can't lose.

205
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:24,261
Right, left. Right, left.Right, left. Right, left...

206
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:37,280
It will never work.People don't want war.

207
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,114
It destroyed this planet, its people...

208
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,952
and all records of past civilizations.

209
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:48,619
Not all records, as you'll soon find out.

210
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:53,859
Attention!

211
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,835
Leaders of tomorrow's master race!

212
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:44,138
The time has come, as I promised...

213
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:48,509
a time when I reveal to you...

214
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,380
my loyal followers...

215
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:56,114
the ancient secret of war...

216
00:22:56,221 --> 00:23:00,885
the key to creating hysteria...

217
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,052
fear...

218
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:06,689
gods.

219
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,879
Behold!

220
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:41,023
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

221
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,687
Sieg heil!

222
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,791
Blackmark's army's come again!

223
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:51,734
Our cousin elvesare already in the trenches.

224
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,101
It's our loved land too.

225
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:58,438
For Elfin and Fairyland, united we fly.

226
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,576
Hey, Elfie, do you hear those drums?

227
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:34,578
Sure do, Peewhittle.

228
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,911
I don't believe those blokesare gonna try it again.

229
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:42,147
I'm scared.

230
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,951
Now don't be, governor.You're too young to remember...

231
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,993
but Blackwolf must havelost one million men here...

232
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:52,622
last time he tried to invade.

233
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:55,962
And if Blackwolf'sstupid enough to try it again...

234
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,968
he'll lose twice more.

235
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,834
Them goblins and demons...

236
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:03,306
just look mean, but they're yellow.

237
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,343
They got no cause to fight.

238
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,004
They always give up and runwith our arrows chasing them...

239
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,015
all the way home.

240
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,917
It's always been that wayand will always be the same.

241
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,511
Ain't that the truth, boys?

242
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:55,405
Weehawk, what's thatold wizard been doing for four hours?

243
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,880
If he's looking for answersfrom that assassin...

244
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,645
my father's sword can get itquicker than brain reading.

245
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,313
Cool down.Cool down.

246
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:06,824
I got it,and it ain't good.

247
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:09,826
The key is a dream machine...

248
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:12,829
that inspires armieswith ancient war images.

249
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:15,331
It must be destroyed.

250
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,769
It is in Blackwolf's castlein the land of Scortch.

251
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,931
When do we leave?

252
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,941
Leave?What do you mean, leave?

253
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,943
You got to be kidding.

254
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,445
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

255
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,616
Just wake me upwhen the planet's destroyed.

256
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,685
- Well, I'm not too old. I'll go myself.- Very noble.

257
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:40,019
We're going.I must avenge my father's death.

258
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:43,356
It ain't no fairyland out there, kid.

259
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,361
But all right, all right.

260
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,863
I was just testing you.

261
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,230
Well?

262
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:54,869
- Well, what?- Well, what now?

263
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:58,841
Uh, I don't know.

264
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,367
Oh, why don't you sit there fora couple hours while I figure it out?

265
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:04,380
Okay.

266
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,610
- Uh, Avatar.- All right. All right.

267
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,122
How do we find this machine?

268
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,126
This creature, uh,I shall call him Peace.

269
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:20,129
Peace?

270
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:23,291
In the hopes that he will bring it.

271
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,801
He's somehow wired to the machine.

272
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,306
And the only freedom he'llever have from its painful grip...

273
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:31,307
is in its destruction.

274
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,311
Go now, both of you,and prepare for the journey.

275
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:39,475
- I'll reason with him when he awakens.- Avatar, you're not that old.

276
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,882
She's gotta be kiddin'.

277
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:46,480
Looks like my brother and Inow begin our final battle.

278
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,463
Weehawk spent a nightsaying good-bye to his tribe...

279
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,523
asking them to protect his family...

280
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,967
and to name a new chiefifhe did not return.

281
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:04,030
Elinore said good-bye to her fatherand then the other fairies of her kind.

282
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:08,044
She told them she will returnas queen of Montagar...

283
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:10,376
her father's death revenged...

284
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,679
and herself a full-fledged fairy.

285
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:18,080
Well, they're here, nut.

286
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:22,023
I'll be right down, heroes.

287
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:25,392
All right, creep.Now, before I untie you...

288
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:28,125
I wanna tell you a couple things.

289
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:31,930
And I want you to listenand listen carefully.

290
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:35,438
This has been the biggest bummerof a trip I've ever been on.

291
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:39,272
If you let me downor you hurt my friends...

292
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,436
especially the broad...

293
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:43,946
I got stuff planned for you...

294
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:47,108
- that'll take 20 years to kill you.- No pain.

295
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:51,644
And you'll be screaming for mercyin the first five seconds.

296
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:53,781
Peace wants love...

297
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:56,952
wants free, will help.

298
00:31:57,027 --> 00:32:00,622
Look, just get us there,you got it?

299
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,301
Don't be sad,Elinore.

300
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,304
I'll kill that monster as soonas he shows us that projector.

301
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,966
Are you kids ready?

302
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,807
You know, this Peace here,he knows every step towards Scortch.

303
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,848
I promised him lifewithout pain...

304
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,849
uh, life without fear...

305
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,784
- I still don't trust him.- H-Hey.

306
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:27,347
You're both forgetting you havethe protection of a powerful wizard here.

307
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,657
Damn it.

308
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:38,327
He's getting older but not much bolder.

309
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:41,337
I wonder if I packed my scotch.

310
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,343
Sing us a song, Elinore.

311
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,347
I don't want to.

312
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:55,351
But that's why we brought you. Come on.

313
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,807
Where's daddy? What is he doing?

314
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:27,180
He's guarding our home, son.

315
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:30,311
There's been a war,and this land has lost.

316
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,379
Why can't we fight and win, Mommy?

317
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:35,516
Because they haveweapons and technology.

318
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,584
We just have love.

319
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:50,305
Hey, Louie, What are wegonna do with the prisoners?

320
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:53,138
How do I know?They're findin' out right now.

321
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,144
Duuuhhh.

322
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:57,612
What is this place?

323
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:01,139
- Dumbo, it's religion, man. Ain't you heard?- Religion?

324
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:03,812
Yeah. Blackwolf saysthe responsibilities of the prisoners...

325
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,856
is up tothe priests inside.

326
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:08,357
Now, what we got to do,dumbo...

327
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:11,360
is reconnoiter the priestsand find out.

328
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,362
What is all this?

329
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,796
Bits and piecesof religion, man.

330
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:17,800
What's the matterwith you?

331
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:21,304
Holy objects they savedfor millions of years, man.

332
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:24,307
- What are we looking for?- Hey, so dumb.

333
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,640
We're lookingfor the priests, man, the priests.

334
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,645
Why?

335
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,681
I don't know.

336
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:36,015
I guess because you needGod on your side, stupid.

337
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,020
Who's that?Who's that?

338
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:40,022
- That's them. Them. Them.- Who's that?

339
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,024
Uh, listen, you guys.

340
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,026
We hates to interrupt you, you know.

341
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:46,528
- We're sorry.- Yeah. But, uh, you see, Blackwolf...

342
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,531
- you know, our f�hrer...- It wasn't our fault.

343
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,533
Uh, shut up, will you?

344
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,035
Blackwolf, the f�hrer,started this war, see.

345
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:56,334
We got all these prisonerswe don't want to feed...

346
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:59,535
We ain't got time for that.We just got time for war.

347
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,044
So, we were, uh...I want to ask you guys...

348
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:04,046
He's asking you, not me.

349
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:07,379
Yeah, I'm asking if you wantto take care of'em, it's okay with us.

350
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,715
- Me too. Me too.- Yeah, see?

351
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:11,721
- Yeah. Okay, dumbo.- Okay.

352
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,383
- My sons, you say you are the victors.- Uh-huh.

353
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,392
- But there is only one victor.- Mmm.

354
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,223
That's Him.

355
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,157
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

356
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:26,566
Patience.

357
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:30,630
- We must first observe sundown and pray.- He's got a point.

358
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,768
Hear us, O Lord. Hear our petition.

359
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:38,474
O Lord, we cry out to you.Lord, hear our prayer.

360
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:41,916
Hear the prayersof thy humble servants.

361
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:44,352
O Lord, God, Lord, God...

362
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:47,117
do not fail us in our hour of need.

363
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,592
We need you, O Lord.We cry to you, O Lord.

364
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:53,824
Lord, help us.Help us, O Lord.

365
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:57,424
We need you. We cry to you.

366
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:08,778
We cry out to you!

367
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,957
Hey, enough already.

368
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,398
O Lord, God, Lord, God.

369
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:34,038
All right, it's been five hours.Time's up.

370
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,265
Okay, Charlie. It's no good.

371
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:40,742
- Put plan "A" to work.- It's about time.

372
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:47,409
Okay, babe. They ain't gonna talk.

373
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:51,420
- Gimme plan "B".- Hey, what's plan "B"?

374
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,922
Hey, hey, hey. Watch.

375
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,596
Will the birth be soon?

376
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,605
Very soon, my Lord.

377
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:13,609
You're young to be queen.But deliver me a son...

378
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:17,374
and you shall help me rule this planet.

379
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,884
I don't want to rule this planet, my Lord.

380
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:25,217
- Just our kingdom is enough.- Enough?

381
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,224
Enough for mutants to stayin their place, huh?

382
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,728
Live with radiationso our bodies crawl with hell?

383
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:34,093
We will live in the good lands.

384
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,223
My son will growwhere there isn't death...

385
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,929
in the very waters we drinkand the air we breathe.

386
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,631
Wise men...

387
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:46,608
will my son be human or mutant?

388
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,272
Mutant, the charts say, my Lord.

389
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:53,942
The next one won't be.

390
00:37:54,017 --> 00:37:57,282
Do not have it killed, Oh, Lord!

391
00:37:57,354 --> 00:38:01,017
It is not his fault!

392
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,190
Wait a minute, Avatar.

393
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:37,853
Peace is taking us towardsthe mountain fairies' domain.

394
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,089
We should go around.

395
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,598
Avatar, why is Peace stopping?

396
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,759
Fairy bad.

397
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:47,770
Not good. Go around.

398
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,432
Coming from Mr. Nice guy here...

399
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:53,442
those fairies must be something else.

400
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,535
Go on, nut. We'd lose time.

401
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,103
Bad fairies.

402
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:01,117
Elves and fairies are bad-blood cousins.

403
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:04,052
I'm not in the mood for their pranks.

404
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:06,112
They may have useful information.

405
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,785
Don't worry. Time has passed.

406
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,956
Much of the rivalrybetween fairy and elf has subsided.

407
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:31,010
Barbarians.

408
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,649
Gee, they're adorable.

409
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:42,658
Oh. Hey!

410
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,832
# Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha #

411
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,344
Holy chrome!

412
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:11,887
Oh. Hey.

413
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:25,197
By my sword, that is no wayto treat a lady.

414
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:43,011
Hey! Oh!

415
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,023
Stop this childish display.

416
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:52,493
Why, even at elves' houses,I've seen more sophisticated magic.

417
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:56,089
All right. All right. You've had it.

418
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,566
This is Avatar the Greatyou're fooling with.

419
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:03,004
Avatar, consul and wizardof your great-grandfathers' consuls...

420
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:05,667
who was turned into Avatar the Old.

421
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:08,905
Yeah, that's me...Avatar the Old now...

422
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:11,004
but I still got my powers.

423
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,015
And you've cost me my patience.

424
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,075
I call upon all forces of darkness.

425
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:20,681
Oh, winds of abysseshowling through the stars...

426
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:24,022
and eons of centuries.

427
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:27,359
O Lords of the Whirlwind,black, gray and white...

428
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,695
I call upon you.

429
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:54,587
Oh, ever-increasing darkness...

430
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:57,092
shapeless and mindless beings...

431
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,028
corroded and rottenin your hearts, body and mind...

432
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:05,364
I summon youfrom your ancient, timeless travels...

433
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,528
to ride the winds of blackness.

434
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,799
And cabash!

435
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:29,558
Please accept our apologies for the behaviorof some our more carefree brothers.

436
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,959
I'm Sean, leaderof the Knights of Stardust...

437
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:36,055
protectors of Dolan,king of the mountain fairies.

438
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:40,229
We have prepared a feast to welcomeyou to our humble domain.

439
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:43,568
Listen here, you little winged squirt.

440
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,734
- Do you realize...- Oh, Avatar, stop being so grumpy.

441
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,906
Oh... I... Hey, Oh...

442
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,949
Ohh.

443
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:58,212
All right. Okay. Okay.

444
00:42:58,288 --> 00:43:00,256
I'm Avatar the Great, as you've heard.

445
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:03,258
Now, this here is Elinore,queen of Montagar.

446
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:05,260
What brings you here?

447
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:08,491
Oh, we're on a questto the land of Scortch.

448
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:11,500
You're heading for Scortch?I'm afraid you're in for trouble.

449
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,093
Will you tell us what you know?

450
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,105
Steady, Westwind.

451
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:19,199
We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools.

452
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,369
Meecher, where's Peace?

453
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:24,039
- Arise, you fools!- Hey, what's that?

454
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,546
Assassin! Technology...

455
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,320
By the soul of Dulac and Rackham!

456
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:40,886
- Elinore is gone!- It was Peace!

457
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:43,558
I knew we should havekilled him when we had the chance!

458
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,463
Never mind. We must find Elinore.

459
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:48,070
The fairies have takenher into the mountain.

460
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:50,902
Hey, there's no time to waste.

461
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,344
No one's ever beento the fairy sanctuary before.

462
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:05,786
- It's forbidden to all.- Drums.

463
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:09,019
It begins.Quickly now, or all is lost.

464
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:28,978
You must save Elinore. Hurry, old fool.

465
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,810
Morro crinkle frizetta.

466
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,975
Enough magic, old man. Run!

467
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:30,626
Very bad. Not good. Not good.

468
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:04,291
Destroy her! She's party to death!

469
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:07,734
Sean is dead! Killed by liesand human technology.

470
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:11,740
Will it be brotheragainst brother here too?

471
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,402
Only humans kill their own kind.

472
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:16,570
She allowed technology and death...

473
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,671
into the Golden Circle.

474
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,682
She is a traitor.

475
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,015
Traitor?You fools, release me.

476
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:26,988
Stay back!As the king's guards...

477
00:47:27,056 --> 00:47:29,490
we can't allow you nearuntil the king has ruled.

478
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,519
No one rulesover Elinore of Montagar.

479
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,531
We rule.

480
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,864
We rule over death,lies, and deceit.

481
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:42,029
We rule.

482
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:51,542
She's emoting. I feel her pain.

483
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:53,548
It hurts! It hurts!

484
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:58,887
Wow!

485
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:02,391
Avatar never told meI had full fairy powers.

486
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,892
He said I wasn't ready yet.

487
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:07,395
I told you, she's dangerous.

488
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,398
Destroy her while there's still time.

489
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:14,129
I say destroy her, king's rule or not.

490
00:48:14,203 --> 00:48:16,194
Now why'd you wantto go and do that for, love?

491
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:18,672
It's hard enoughcontrolling them as it is.

492
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:23,576
Release me, or I, Elinore,shall show all you ants something.

493
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:43,228
- Stop him, miss. Stop him!- Oh, did I do that?

494
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:47,235
Stop! I command you to cease.

495
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:51,296
Okay. Leave everyone alone.

496
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:54,400
I say, miss, you better stop him.

497
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:57,207
I think it would be betterif you released me and we all ran away.

498
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,545
Kill! Kill! Kill!

499
00:49:09,892 --> 00:49:11,826
Holy chrome.

500
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:15,159
Elinore's really gone and done it.

501
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:17,426
It's all a disaster.

502
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,834
Well, old man, what areyou going to do about it?

503
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:24,498
You better hurry, miss.

504
00:49:24,574 --> 00:49:27,941
Avatar the Great...

505
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,604
- coming.- Avatar!

506
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:37,282
Yeah.You can kill me now, I'm sure.

507
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:39,947
I've given myself to you.

508
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:43,014
- I make no attempt to save myself.- Save yourself?

509
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,686
Save yourself? Save me!

510
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:48,127
I can't, Elinore.

511
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:50,961
The only one who couldmight be the king here.

512
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:55,868
My mission, O Lord, is to savethe world from another holocaust.

513
00:49:55,938 --> 00:50:00,966
Sean was killed not by us,but by my brother's assassins...

514
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:04,877
who have been sent to killWeehawk, Elinore...

515
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:08,644
Peace, and myselfbefore we reach Scortch.

516
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:12,313
For all I know and fear,Weehawk is dead.

517
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:14,322
So might be Peace.

518
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,325
I ask for permissionto take the girl and myself...

519
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:19,384
to try to complete our mission alone...

520
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:22,693
though it does seem doomed now.

521
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:26,393
I will not allow you to hurt Elinore...

522
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:28,562
without a fight by myself.

523
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:31,072
My brother lies, my good King!

524
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:36,703
Avatar! Avatar!

525
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:40,308
What will it be, King?

526
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,317
Time's getting short.

527
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:46,082
Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?

528
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:49,124
We have been sent death...

529
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,352
images and humans...

530
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,418
each with a different story.

531
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:59,264
Something happening here.Not you, please. Oh, no.

532
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,667
I have always been very good...

533
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:04,900
and could even bebetter sometimes.

534
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,908
It starts again.

535
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:11,003
The only actthat has been real so far...

536
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,072
is the fact that Avatardid not break his word.

537
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,951
When the arrow struck him,he did not fight back.

538
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:22,957
And from what we all heardabout Avatar's power...

539
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:26,517
- that is surely the sign of truth.

540
00:51:26,595 --> 00:51:31,965
We will neither joinnor hinder nor help these two.

541
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,969
We will wait and see.

542
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:37,938
That is our decision.

543
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:55,646
Well, we're out of there.

544
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:57,659
Ouch!

545
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:59,718
Thanks.I forgot about that.

546
00:51:59,795 --> 00:52:04,732
- Let me help you.- No, no, no, no. Let me help you.

547
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,825
How's that?

548
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:09,462
It's very pretty, Avatar.

549
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:13,565
Yeah, well, it could be warmer.

550
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:15,735
We might as well begin.

551
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:18,678
This is the way, I think.

552
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:21,683
Scortch lies somewhereover these mountains.

553
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,714
Well, good morning.

554
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:54,716
Cozy morning, huh?

555
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:56,718
Avatar, we're trapped.

556
00:52:56,786 --> 00:53:00,722
It's nothing a littlehard work won't cure.

557
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,725
Here. Follow me, Snow Queen.

558
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:20,003
I'm so cold, so cold.

559
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,509
Is it much farther?

560
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,024
Elinore, we've rested long enough.

561
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,356
We'd better move on.

562
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:43,023
Just a little while longer, Avatar.I'm so tired.

563
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,032
Well, okay.

564
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:51,039
I'll go over and seeif I can see a pass or a path or a...

565
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:54,371
or a house or... something.

566
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:01,045
Oh, my God.

567
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,550
They're our own tracks.

568
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,055
We've been moving in circles.

569
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:10,057
I better not tell Elinore.

570
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:13,390
It'll do her no good.

571
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:15,396
Avatar, riders!

572
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:18,831
Run! Assassins come to finish the job!

573
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:21,836
We'll cut their throats.Let them come.

574
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,929
Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch.

575
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:26,839
They split up.

576
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:31,005
Going to come at us from each end.

577
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,176
- Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?- Yes, Elinore.

578
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:38,049
That's all anyonereally could have done.

579
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,385
Steady.Here they come.

580
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:44,290
Braxis plaxis traxis!

581
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,055
Montagar forever.

582
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,722
Death, assassins!

583
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:54,565
Peace! Peace, we found them!We found them!

584
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:57,572
What took you so long?

585
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,574
Quickly, Peace. Quickly.

586
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:02,076
Let's get them off this glacier.

587
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:04,078
The quest is saved.

588
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:12,215
The nightwas spent in the protection of a cave.

589
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:16,224
Elinore and Weehawk slept asAvatar counseled with Peace...

590
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,817
on the quickest route to Scortch.

591
00:55:18,894 --> 00:55:21,658
The journey took them past the ruins...

592
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,721
of ancient civilizations.

593
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:25,733
Strange beasts lurked about...

594
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:29,965
but the dangerous mutantsthat lived there were gone...

595
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:31,973
gone to Blackwolf's army.

596
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:36,944
All they left were their wives,hurling insults and rocks...

597
00:55:37,012 --> 00:55:40,106
as the party passed through.

598
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,014
Then finally, the desert.

599
00:55:46,755 --> 00:55:51,021
Yeah, I feel it too.

600
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:54,256
Please do not attemptto draw your gun.

601
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:05,971
Avatar, you old fool! You've come!

602
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,044
Oh!

603
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:14,048
Our father's returned.

604
00:56:16,785 --> 00:56:19,447
Avatar... fighter!

605
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:22,786
Avatar... father, mother, freedom!

606
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:24,792
Love, life!

607
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:46,480
We've been camping in the desert...

608
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:49,278
away from prying eyes.

609
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:53,287
- Where did you get the guns, Abdul?- Guns!

610
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:57,348
Well, we got themfrom old Blackwolf himself.

611
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,418
You mean you joined with...

612
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:02,430
No, no.

613
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:04,489
We ambushed a wolf patrol...

614
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:07,000
took everything except their women...

615
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:10,937
and two days from now,we attack Scortch I.

616
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:13,804
What do you mean, attack?

617
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,936
The remaining elves of the free world...

618
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:18,946
have joined under my banner.

619
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:22,609
That banner will becarried to Scortch I.

620
00:57:22,684 --> 00:57:24,618
Join us, old wizard.

621
00:57:24,686 --> 00:57:26,745
We desperately need you.

622
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,130
Is this how you're repayin' me?

623
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:41,261
Stand back.Avatar will not be touched.

624
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:45,466
When our world was young,so was mighty Avatar.

625
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,475
Misty moons ago...

626
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:50,535
he strode this planet like a messiah...

627
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:54,548
curing radiation sicknessfrom man and bird...

628
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:57,710
cleaning the planet of its filth.

629
00:57:57,786 --> 00:58:00,380
It was Avatar who foughtalongside my father...

630
00:58:00,456 --> 00:58:02,924
against the first mutant attack.

631
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:07,985
So now we haveour messiah back again.

632
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:11,999
He's going to destroyhis brother for us.

633
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,501
With what?

634
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:19,507
A woman-child, one elf...

635
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:23,510
and a moron robot.

636
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:34,522
Oh, Avatar.

637
00:58:57,312 --> 00:59:00,042
- What is it?- It's Blackwolf.

638
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:03,448
He's trying to gain control.

639
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,920
Back! Back!

640
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:08,980
Back to hell!

641
00:59:09,057 --> 00:59:10,991
You can't have him!

642
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:23,604
You did it.You beat the demon.

643
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:26,004
What's happened?

644
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:29,771
Well, I suddenlyfelt very sorry for Peace...

645
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:33,508
so I went over to him, and I tookhis hand and I tried to comfort him.

646
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:37,518
Peace is in constantmental battle with Blackwolf.

647
00:59:37,586 --> 00:59:40,749
Your kind words took his mindoff the battle.

648
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,756
It allowed Blackwolf his chance.

649
00:59:42,824 --> 00:59:45,691
Avatar. What's that?

650
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,391
Trapped.

651
01:00:08,116 --> 01:00:11,313
- Jump, Peace!- Jump, Peace!

652
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:23,555
Elinore!

653
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:40,440
Elinore!

654
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,467
Ah, I don't know.

655
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,469
I just don't know.

656
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:06,166
I don't know whathappened to Elinore.

657
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:09,404
Betrayal of Elinoreto the quest has broken his heart.

658
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:11,912
There is nothing wrongwith him.

659
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,041
Tomorrow morning, the attack begins.

660
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:20,421
- Avatar, we have to go now.- Oh, whatever.

661
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:23,424
The cliffs of Scortch can be seen.

662
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:27,428
- We have to go now to complete our mission.- Huh?

663
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:30,431
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:34,435
- How?- We have to swim in.

665
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:37,131
Oh. Okay.

666
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,536
What's happened to the world?

667
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,546
I don't know.

668
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:22,208
I can remember back...

669
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:26,355
All the fairies were so good...

670
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:30,083
We're here. Scortch.Chrome!

671
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:33,093
Come. We'll walk right up the road...

672
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:35,095
and no one will expect it.

673
01:02:35,163 --> 01:02:37,893
- We'll act like slaves.- Yeah.

674
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,697
The castle. I see it.It's quite a distance.

675
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:46,173
I had one where the whole countrywould disappear for a day.

676
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:49,938
Ohh.That was, uh...

677
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:54,004
That was really, uh...I just don't know.

678
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:56,949
Over there.That must be the entrance...

679
01:02:57,018 --> 01:02:58,952
to the lower cities.

680
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,456
Now, guards might be about. Come on.

681
01:03:02,524 --> 01:03:06,392
Hmm. How ugly.

682
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:10,227
How ugly. Kapow!

683
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:12,892
Boom. Boom.

684
01:03:24,479 --> 01:03:27,607
I just don't know.

685
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:30,412
Maybe... Maybe I shouldmake a deal with them.

686
01:03:41,496 --> 01:03:45,830
Chrome.Which way? I don't know.

687
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:48,199
You know, I should havestayed with them.

688
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,501
- They love magic.- Shh.

689
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:54,440
- Avatar, just stay quiet.- Yeah. Oh.

690
01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:56,443
Psst. Hey, General.

691
01:03:56,511 --> 01:04:00,607
Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard?

692
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:02,912
Souvenirs for sale.Precious souvenirs for sale.

693
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:07,944
- Get them while they're still hot.- No more wars, you fools... love.

694
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:10,457
Scortch can be beautiful too.

695
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:12,959
Look, look. Real, beautiful presents.

696
01:04:14,463 --> 01:04:17,125
Now, that-that...

697
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,690
that is a wonderful trick.

698
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,862
- Wonderful.- It's Avatar. Oh, General.

699
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:26,965
It's him. It's bad.It's come to hurt the f�hrer.

700
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:29,909
Kill it.Oh, master, kill it.

701
01:04:29,978 --> 01:04:33,414
That's impossible.

702
01:04:33,482 --> 01:04:36,417
That dirty old manis Avatar the Great?

703
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:39,921
If that is so...

704
01:04:39,988 --> 01:04:43,981
then I am a warthog's uncle!

705
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:45,993
Funny you should say that.

706
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,159
Kiyah!

707
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,897
Ki-Kiyah!

708
01:05:01,243 --> 01:05:04,371
Oooowah!

709
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,454
The enemy is dead.

710
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:16,047
Oh, master, the enemy is dead.

711
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:20,060
My God! What have I done?

712
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:23,894
Master loves Larry.Master feeds Larry.

713
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,897
What are elves good for?

714
01:05:30,972 --> 01:05:33,167
Avatar, good luck!

715
01:05:36,177 --> 01:05:38,202
The beast has shown usthe way to the castle.

716
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,016
I'm sorry, Weehawk.

717
01:05:43,084 --> 01:05:45,348
I'm just an old fool.

718
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,354
You know...

719
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:50,516
the world owes you much, kid...

720
01:05:50,592 --> 01:05:54,028
even if we don't take another step.

721
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:05,688
God! Avatar, get down.

722
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,820
I've seen him.You can't beat him. He's too strong.

723
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:11,593
Avatar, don't do it.

724
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,964
You may be right...

725
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:15,969
but I gotta battle my brother.

726
01:13:16,037 --> 01:13:18,972
You find an entrance into the castle.

727
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,840
Smash the projector,and tell Elinore...

728
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:26,244
that Avatar will die with her tonight...

729
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:29,249
even if we win.

730
01:13:31,152 --> 01:13:34,087
Hello.

731
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:36,589
You have aged, old fool.

732
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:39,252
The world is mine.

733
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:52,430
- Weehawk!- Slut!

734
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:55,943
Weehawk, don't!Weehawk, don't! Don't! Don't!

735
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,246
Stop, elf!

736
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:03,410
Blood on blood flowing,fathers and sons dying...

737
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:07,716
brothers and lovers spilling false hateand rivers of life flowing away.

738
01:14:07,789 --> 01:14:12,419
Fool elf! Think your swordis always quick, but what else?

739
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:14,427
Think!

740
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:19,766
Weehawk, I could not help it.

741
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,769
When I touched Peace in the desert...

742
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:25,101
Blackwolf trapped my mind.

743
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:28,438
I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts.

744
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:34,445
Avatar must know.

745
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:36,813
The trouble with you, my brother...

746
01:14:36,884 --> 01:14:38,818
is that you've always been too good.

747
01:14:38,886 --> 01:14:42,151
Well, that may be.

748
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:45,659
But I still think I lookmore like Ma than you do.

749
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,991
You know, uh, lots of character.

750
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:49,996
I'm agin' better.

751
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:55,161
Brother, there is no needfor me to destroy you.

752
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:58,034
Surrender.Surrender your world.

753
01:15:00,108 --> 01:15:03,475
You always did needan audience, you sap.

754
01:15:03,544 --> 01:15:05,842
Let me tell ya...

755
01:15:05,913 --> 01:15:08,677
I ain't practicedmuch magic for a long time.

756
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:13,346
I wanna show you a trick Mothershowed me when you weren't around...

757
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,686
to use on special occasions like this.

758
01:15:16,758 --> 01:15:20,216
Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing...

759
01:15:20,294 --> 01:15:24,025
I'm glad you changedyour last name, you son of a bitch.

760
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:45,718
Avatar!Elinore's no traitor!

761
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:48,654
She was possessed by Blackwolf.

762
01:16:03,237 --> 01:16:06,866
It is done! It is done!

763
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:09,466
The world is free!

764
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:17,208
The projector destroyed,the battle was over.

765
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:19,412
Shadow creaturesfroze in their tracks.

766
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,512
Some faded...

767
01:16:24,192 --> 01:16:26,126
some crawled back to hell.

768
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:30,726
Mutants... leaderless... ran.

769
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:36,634
Elves swept the beaches clear of the fewremaining mutants that still fought...

770
01:16:39,173 --> 01:16:43,303
- As hundreds of circling black birds...

771
01:16:43,377 --> 01:16:46,642
screamed at the carnage below.

772
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:52,142
There was some rejoicing.

773
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:59,092
But mostly, everyone wishedto return home quickly...

774
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,096
to tell their loved onesthat the war was won...

775
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:05,724
Hitler was dead again...

776
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,997
and that they could liveonce more in peace...

777
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:12,403
in the land they loved so much...

778
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:14,687
God-given. Amen.

779
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:16,902
God-given. Amen.

780
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:21,141
Avatar! Look what I caught!

781
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:24,883
Don't hurt Larry. Larry served.

782
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,215
Beast of a thousand scales...

783
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:30,051
Hey, hey, hey. Set it free.

784
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:32,216
It's harmless without Blackwolf.

785
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:35,489
Pity it. It's not its fault.

786
01:17:35,562 --> 01:17:37,655
Mmm. So be it.

787
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:41,496
Thank you. Thank you.

788
01:17:41,568 --> 01:17:44,264
Thank you, master.

789
01:17:45,338 --> 01:17:47,602
We ride back to Montagar.

790
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:50,939
Weehawk, you ride backto Montagar alone.

791
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:54,538
Avatar and I will starta new kingdom somewhere.

792
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:57,276
You will rule Montagar as their new king.

793
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:01,612
Are you and Avatar married, my Queen?

794
01:18:01,688 --> 01:18:05,351
Hey, kid, take it easy, huh?

795
01:18:05,425 --> 01:18:09,293
You did a good job,but don't get carried away.

796
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:12,729
You think Avatar'stoo old to get married?

797
01:18:12,799 --> 01:18:17,293
Weehawk, how many yearsdo wizards live, 10,000 or more?

798
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,635
And I got at least a thousand left,you know what I mean?

799
01:18:20,707 --> 01:18:24,643
Forgive me, Avatar.Forgive me, both of you.

800
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:27,145
For Montagar, forever.

801
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:40,822
Well, come on. Let's make it.

802
01:18:40,894 --> 01:18:44,159
Avatar,

803
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:47,997
You're getting older and much bolder.

804
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:51,504
Come on! I meantlet's make it out of here.

805
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:55,007
Sure you did.

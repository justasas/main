Uh.

44
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,214
- Until the weekend.

45
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,926
And at his press conference today,President Kennedy fielded questions...

46
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,845
...concerning last Thursday'stotal eclipse of the sun...

47
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:29,558
...an unprecedented astrologicalphenomenon which has baffled the nation.

48
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,247
Ah! So, she finally decides to come to work!

49
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,582
Uh, good morning, Mr. Mushnik.

50
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,003
What morning? It's almost closing time.Not that we had a customer.

51
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,882
Seymour, what in the name of Godis going on down there?

52
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,553
Unh, Audrey, would you go downand see what he's...

53
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,806

Audrey, that greasy boyfriend of yoursis beating up on you again?

56
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,898
Look, I know it's none of my business...

57
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,235
...but I'm beginning to thinkhe's maybe not such a nice boy.

58
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,030
I got these pots unloaded for you, Mr...

59
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,991
Seymour, look what you've done to the inventory!

60
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,076
Don't yell at Seymour, Mr. Mushnik.

61
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,413
- Hi, Audrey. You look radiant today.- Oh.

62
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,749
Is that new eye makeup?

63
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,042
Uh...

64
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,879
I'll help him clean it upbefore any of the customers get here.

65
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,048
That should give you plenty of time.

66
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:47,011
Oh, God, what an existence I got.Misfit employees, bums on the sidewalk...

67
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,931

Man, I wasn't loitering. Were you, Crystal?

72
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,819
Not me, Ronette. Were you, Chiffon?

Right! We went to school until fifth grade,then we split.

76
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,371
So? How do you intend to better yourselves?

77
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,834
Better ourselves? You heard what he said?Better ourselves?

I'd do I-don't-know-what to get outta Skid

139
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,991
But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid

140
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,411
People tell me there's not a way outta Skid

141
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:29,585
But believe me I gotta get outta Skid Row

142
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,492
Six o'clock and we haven't soldso much as a fern.

143
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,743
- All right!- Aah.

144
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,245
That's it! Forget it.Don't bother coming in tomorrow.

145
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,081
- Aah. You don't mean...- You can't...

146
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,166
Wha...? What don't I mean?I'm through. Forget it.

147
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,376
- Kaput.- You can't.

148
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,588
Kaput! Extinct. I'm closingthis God-and-customer-forsaken place.

149
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,465
- Ah.- Mr. Mushnik...

150
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,301
...forgive me for saying so, sir,but has it ever occurred to you...

151
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,305
...that maybe what the firm needsis to move in a new direction?

152
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,392
Uh, what Seymour's trying to say is...

153
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
Uh, Seymour,why don't you run downstairs and bring up...

154
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:34,483
...that strange and interesting new plantyou've been working on?

155
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,652
You see, Mr. Mushnik...

156
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,780
...some of those exotic plantsSeymour's been tinkering around with...

157
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,074
...are really unusual.

158
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:46,495
And we thought maybe some ofthose strange and interesting new plants...

159
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:51,625
...prominently displayed and advertised,would attract business.

160
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,965
I'm afraid it isn't feeling very well today.

161
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,385
There. Now, isn't that bizarre?

162
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,928
At least.

163
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,597
What kind of a weirdo plant is that, Seymour?

164
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,100
I don't know.I think it's some kind of flytrap...

165
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,853
...but I haven't been able to identify itin any of my books.

166
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,982
I gave it my own name though.I call it an Audrey II.

167
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,443
- After me?- I hope you don't mind.

168
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,197
You see, sir, if you were to put a strangeand interesting plant like this...

169
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,867
...here in the window, then maybe...

170
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,244
Maybe what? Maybe what?

171
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,621
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

172
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,957
Just because you put a strangeand interesting plant...

173
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,751
...in the window, people don't suddenly...

174
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,797
Excuse me. I couldn't help noticingthat strange and interesting plant.

175
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,468
- What is it?- It's an Audrey II.

176
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,596
- I've never seen anything like it before.- No one has.

177
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,014

CHORUS:Chang da-doo

185

Snip da-doo

187
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,580

Nope, da-doo

191
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,923

SEYMOUR:I could have sworn it hadn't been there before.

204
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,833

205
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,543

208
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,523
Oh, while I'm here,I might as well take $50 worth of roses.

209
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,983
Fifty dollars?

210
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,528

Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Mushnik,but I have a date.

232
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,063
With that same "nogoodnik"?

233
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,233
I'm telling you, Audrey, you don't needa date with him. You need major medical.

234
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:50,447
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik, but he...He makes good money.

235
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,282
Besides...

236

Poor girl.

00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,711
Are we still going out?

241
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,303
You're not going anywhere, Krelborn.

242
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,264
You're staying right hereand taking care of that sick plant!

243
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,268
I told you it's been giving me trouble.The Audrey II is not a healthy girl.

244
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,105
Strictly between us, neither is the Audrey I.

245
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,648
If only I knew what breed it was.

246
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,442
Who cares what breed it is?Look what it's done for business.

00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,606
I said, mention the address!

352
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,275
♫ Skid Row radio

353
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,987
Ugh. Oh, well. It's still good advertising.

354
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,614
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

355
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:15,452
I wanted to hear it so bad.I tried to be on time, but...

356
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,537
Don't tell me. You got tied up.

357
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,081
No, just handcuffed a little.

358
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,085
Girl. Hey, girl.

359
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,504
I don't know who this mess isyou been hanging out with...

360
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,298
...but he is hazardous to your health.

361
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,758
That's for sure. But I can't leave him.

362
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,011
- Why not?- Oh, he'd get angry.

363
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,223
And if he does this to me when he likes me,imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.

364
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,518
So? Dump the chump.Get another guy and let him protect you.

365
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,188
How about the little jerk with the glasses?

366
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,522
- Seymour?- That's him.

367
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,816
Oh, we're just friends.

368
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,528
I don't even deserve a sweet, considerate...

369
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,490
...suddenly successful guy like Seymour.

370
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,075
That poor childsuffers from low self-image.

371
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,453
- You got a point.- She got a problem.

372
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:04,584
♫ I know Seymour's the greatest

373
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:10,673
But I'm dating a semi-sadist

374
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:15,553
So I got a black eyeAnd my arm's in a cast

375
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:23,311
Still, that Seymour's a cutie

376
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:32,237
Well, if not, he's got inner beauty

377
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,323
And I dream of a place

378
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:41,913
Where we could be together at last

379
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,671
A matchbox of our own

380
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,926
A fence of real chain link

381
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,347
A grill out on the patio

382
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:03,017
Disposal in the sink

383
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,813
A washer and a dryer

384
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:11,651
And an ironing machine

385
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,904
In a tract house that we share

386
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,533
Somewhere that's green

387
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,838
He rakes and trims the grass

388
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:36,092
He loves to mow and weed

389
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,804
I cook like Betty Crocker

390
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:43,975
And I look like Donna Reed

391
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:48,104
There's plastic on the furniture

392
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:51,941
To keep it neat and clean

393
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:55,194
In the Pine-Sol scented air

394
00:35:55,362 --> 00:36:00,783
Somewhere that's green

395
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:38,071
Somewhere that's green

396
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:41,574
Between our frozen dinner

397
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:45,953
And our bed-time: 9:15

398
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,749
We snuggle watching Lucy

399
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:55,838
On our big, enormousTwelve-inch screen

00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:09,185
He's father, he knows best

402
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:13,147
The kids play Howdy Doody

403
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:18,194

Far from Skid Row

407
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,890
I dream we'll go

408
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:57,734
Somewhere that's

409
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,253

00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,490
Nothing in his news but gloom and doom

412
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,242
Then he lit a fuse and give him room

413
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,454
He started an explosionHoly cow

Did you send out the order for Mrs. Shiva?

438
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,712
Mrs. Shiva? I forgot!

Are you listening, customers? He forgot!

443

Audrey, quick! We've got to doan emergency arrangement.

444
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:35,975
Birthday? Wedding? Baby?

445
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,019
- Funeral.- Hand me the lilies.

446
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:42,356
Mr. Mushnik's real mad at me, Audrey.I keep forgetting things.

447
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,067
Scissors. You got a lot on your mind.

448
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,863
Mind? What mind? The Shivas areour most important funereal account.

449
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,699
A big enormous family,they're dropping off like flies!

450
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,745
Sometimes I thinkMr. Mushnik's too hard on you. Glue.

451
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:57,163
That's okay.

452
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,498
- After all, I owe him everything.- Glitter.

453
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,336
He took me out of the Skid Row Home for Boyswhen I was just a little tyke...

454
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:07,673
...gave me a warm place to stay,floors to sweep, toilets to clean...

455
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,717
...and every other Sunday off.

456
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:14,305
You know, I think you oughtto raise your expectations, Seymour.

457
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,600
Now that you're getting successful, I mean.

458
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,686
It's clear you suffer from a low self-image.

459
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,356
And it's high time you get it fixed.

460
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,776
Why don't you go outand do something nice for yourself like...

461
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:29,070
...buy some new clothes?

462
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,156
Oh, I'm a very bad shopper, Audrey.

463
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,201
I don't have good taste like you.

464
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,827
Oh.

465
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,164
Well, I could help you pick things out.

466
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,376
- You could?- Sure.

467
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,920
You'd go shopping with me?

468
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,755
Sure.

469
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:52,301
You'd be seen with me in a public placelike a department store?

470
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,136
Sure.

471
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,389
Tonight?

472
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,808
Oh, I can't tonight. I got a date.

473
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,768
Again, this date?

474
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,061
Some date.

475
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,730
A date gives you a corsage,not a multiple fracture.

476
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:08,025
I'm telling you, Audrey,he's not a good, clean kind of boy.

477
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,402
He's a professional.

478
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,821
What kind of a professionaldrives a motorcycle...

479
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:13,572
...and wears a black leather jacket?

480
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,666
♫ When I was younger, just a bad little kid

481
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,877
My momma noticed funny things I did

482
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,131
Like shootin' puppies with a BB gun

483
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,300
I'd poison guppiesAnd when I was done

484
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:37,346
I'd find a pussy cat and bash in its head

485
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,432
That's when my momma said

486
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,686
What did she say?

487
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,857
She saidMy boy, I think someday

488
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,483

494
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:09,086
Your temperament's wrong for the priesthood

495
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,797
- And teaching would suit you still less- Aah!

496
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,550
Son, be a dentist

00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,759
- It's, uh, Cedric.- No.

531
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,594
Give me a chance.

532
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,596
It's, uh, ahem...

533
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,474

534
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:11,852
- Somebody talking to you?- Oh, no. Excuse me.

535
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,270
Excuse me, what?

536
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,690
Excuse me, doctor.

537
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:19,944
That's better.

538
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,447
I know! Sure! You're the plant guy, right?

539
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:26,951
Well, hey! That meansit must be in there, huh?

00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,870
Well! That is incredible.

- What do you call that thing?- Audrey II.

542
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,168
Cute name. It's catchy.

543
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,587
Nice plant. Big.

544
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:41,215
Uh, shouldn't we be leaving now?

545
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,509
You're quite the little chatterbox tonight,ain't you?

546
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,177
- I'm sorry.- Sorry, what?

547
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:48,847
Sorry, doctor. Doctor. Sorry, doctor.

548
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,976
You've got to train them, huh, stud? Heh.

549
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:53,894
Listen, here's my card.

550
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:57,147
You ever need a root canal or anythinglike that, give me a buzz, you hear?

551
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,942
Now, I'm serious. It's on the house.

552
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,111
Audrey!

553
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,655
You got the handcuffs?

554
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,032
They're right in my bag.

555
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,524
You ought to see the way he treats her, Twoey.

556
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:44,611
She deserves a prince,not a sadistic creep like him.

557
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:48,157
The man's a total disgraceto the dental profession.

558
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:50,743
I don't know what's going on sometimes.

559
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,912
Seems like the whole world's going crazy.

560
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,415
At least we got each other, right?

561
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,544
I'm gonna turn in, Twoey.I'll see you in the morning.

562
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,385
SEYMOUR:Oh, boy. Here we go again.

563
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,221
Come on, I haven't got much left.

564
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,265
Just give me a few days to heal, okay?

565
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,352
- Then we'll start again on the left hand and...- Feed me.

566
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,187
I beg your pardon?

567
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:19,813
Feed me.

568
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,235
Twoey, you talked! You opened your trap,your thing, and you said...

569
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,613
Feed me, Krelborn! Feed me now!

570
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:28,822

- I can't!- I'm starving!

572
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,119
Look, maybe I can squeezea little more out of this one.

573
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,664
- Ooh! More! More! More! More!- There isn't any more!

574
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,583
What do you want me to do?Slit my wrists?

575
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,001
Ahh.

576
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,420
Oh, boy! Look, I've got an idea.

577
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,215
I'll go to Shmendrik'sand pick you up some nice chopped sirloin.

578
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:48,384
Must be blood.

579
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,470
- Twoey, that's disgusting.- Must be fresh.

580
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:52,763
I don't want to hear this.

581
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,641
- Feed me!- Does it have to be human?

582
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,310
- Feed me!- Does it have to be mine?

583
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,146

- I'll make it worth your while.- What?

595

You think this is all coincidence, baby?

The sudden success around here?The press coverage?

597
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,445
Look, you're a plant. An inanimate object.

598
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,407
Does this look inanimate to you, punk?

599
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:58,078
If I can talk and I can move,who's to say I can't do anything I want?

600
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:01,123
- Like what?- Like deliver, pal. Aah!

One particular girl

How 'bout that Audrey?

630
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,680

If you really gotta justify

642
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,964
Take a breath and look around

643
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,508
A lot of folks deserve to die

644
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:19,678
Wait a minute, wait a minute!That's not a very nice thing to say.

645
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:22,848
- But it's true, isn't it?- No!

646
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:26,768

00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:27,978
Mm.

No, no, noStop and think it over, pal

662
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:30,499
The guy sure looks like plant food to me

663
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:34,503
- The guy sure looks like plant food to me- Yeah, ow!

664
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,380
He's so nasty treatin' her rough

Yeah, smackin' her aroundAnd always talkin' so tough

666
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,176
You need bloodAnd he's got more than enough

667
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,679
I need blood and he's got more than enough

668
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:50,477
- You need blood and he's got more than enough- I need blood and he's got more than enough

669
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,562
So go get it

670
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:11,123
Hey, does that mean they're finished?My turn?

671
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,958
Sit.

672
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:20,215
Whoo! What happened?What did he do? Tell me everything!

673
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,722
Yeah. Well, they have to do thatto remove the jaw.

674
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:32,144
Ah, consider yourself very, very lucky.

675
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,234
- Next!- It's me, Arthur Denton! I'm next!

676
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,111
- Nurse!- Hmm?

677
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:44,364
Does, uh, that have an appointment?

678
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,243
Ask it. I'm off duty.

679
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,081
I've been saving all month for this.I think I need a root canal.

680
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:56,668
I'm sure I need a long, slow root canal.

681
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,882
- Let's go.- I have a history of dental problems.

682
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,842
ORIN:Shut up!

683
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,636
Yes, doctor.

684
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,269
I went to a terrible dentist Wednesday,who was recommended to me...

685
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:16,104
...by somebody that I saw on Monday...

686
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:18,815
...who is the brother of a manthat I usually see on Sundays.

687
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,151
And their mother taught themeverything they know.

688
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:24,613
She's gifted, but quite elderly.People think she shouldn't be working.

689
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,072
But I go to her because...

690
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,742
...I'm just incredibly devoted to her strength.- Huh.

691
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:33,413
She can't really see who you are,but she knows the sound of your voice.

692
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:37,751
If you tell her where it is, the problem, sheeventually finds the trouble and she does it.

693
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:41,421
I wish I had that stamina.I can only go so long.

694
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,841
That's how I want to be.I don't ever want to have to be just...

695
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,344
Comfy?

696
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:49,137
Yes, doctor.

697
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,432
I remember the first time I went to a dentist.

698
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,768
I thought, "What a neat job!If only I were a dentist."

699
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:59,022
The dentist I went to had the greatest car.He had a Corvette. I thought, "My gosh.

700
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,691
Everybody calls him 'Doctor, 'and he's not really a doctor."

701
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,527
Oh, my God.

702
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,617
"If only I got out of here okay."But then after everything was all finished...

703
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,161
...they gave me a candy bar.I thought, "This is what I get?

704
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:14,996
A candy bar?"

705
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:18,416
This is what you do. You go througha thing and get chocolate out of it.

706
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:23,380
Getting to work with incredible professionalswho use incredibly wonderful equipment...

707
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:25,674
Let's take a look at that mouth.

708
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,926
Say, "Aah!"

709
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:34,391
Aah, candy bar!

710
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,726
Ohh! Candy bar! Candy bar!

711
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,937
Oh, that's great. Come on!

712
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:45,277
Gosh! Oh, God. Do it again.

713
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,863
Oh, God, doctor. Whoo!

714
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,865
Yeah, aw, great!

715
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,868
Oh, you are something special.

716
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,871
You are something special!Come on! Come on! Come on!

717
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,205
Mm, aw, oh!

718
00:56:57,874 --> 00:56:59,291
Thank you!

719
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,670
Yeah, thank you!

720
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,549
Oh, my God.It's your professionalism that I respect.

721
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:11,887
Oh, God! Don't stop, doc! Don't stop!Come on! More!

722
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,222
Yeah! Yeah, come on! Yeah!

723
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:18,560
What do you want? Say, "Please!"Ah, ah, ah.

724
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,229
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

725
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,068
Great! Oh!

726
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,738
I'm gonna get a candy bar!I'm gonna get a candy bar!

727
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,823
Come on! Come on.

728
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,996
Oh, yeah! Yeah, oh!

729
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,880
Wow!

730
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,676
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

731
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,346
Yes! Yeah.

732
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,681
- Get out.- What's wrong?

733
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,808
Get out of here.

734
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:04,022
What's the matter?

735
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,401
Go on! Get out of here!

736
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:10,612
Right this way.

737
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,114
I'm gonna tell each and every oneof my friends about you...

738
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,616
...and they're gonna...- Just get...

739
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,077
- What's this?- Oops.

740
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,287
Ha-ha-ha! Sorry.

741
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,164
Goddamn sicko.

742
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,711
Let me ask you something.Does this thing scare you?

743
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,630
- Yes.- Would you like if I took this thing...

744
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:30,632
...and made straightfor your goddamn incisors?

745
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,925
- No.- It'd hurt, right?

746
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,468
- Mm-hm.- You'd scream, right?

747
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:35,428
- Mm-hm.- Well get your ass in here!

748
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,767
- Say, don't I know you?- Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.

749
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,811
Oh, your mouth's a mess, kid.

750
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:46,856
That wisdom tooth.We'll just rip that bugger right out of there.

751
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,066
- What do you say?- No!

752
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,735
There's always time for dental hygiene, Seymour.

753
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,114
You ever seen the results of a neglected mouth?

754
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,242
Look, Seymour.

755
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,661
- This could happen to you.- Uh...

756
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,790
- Unless I take immediate action.- What's that?

757
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,501
- A drill.- It's rusty.

758
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,044
It's an antique.

759
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,588
They don't make them like this anymore.

760
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,425
Sturdy, heavy...

761
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,093
...dull.

762
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,099
I'm gonna want some gas for this.

763
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,769
Thank God. I thought you wouldn't use any.

764
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:28,148
Oh, the gas isn't for you, Seymour.It's for me.

765
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,985
You see, I want to really enjoy this.

766
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:36,156
In fact, I'm gonna use my special gas mask.

767
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:41,953
I find a little giggle gas beforeI begin increases my pleasure enormously.

768
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:48,626
Here we go!

769
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,143
Oh, Seymour, I'm flying!Ha-ha-ha.

770
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:09,272
The things I'm gonna do to that mouth!Ha-ha-ha!

771
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,126
Huh? What the hell is that?

772
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,754
A gun? Ha-ha-ha!

773
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:36,216
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!Ha-ha-ha!

774
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,677
Oh, Jesus, ha, ha! I'm in trouble now, huh?

775
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,557
Wait until I turn this gas off.

776
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,895
Uh-oh.

777
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,107
Aw, give me a hand, would you? Ha, ha.

778
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,192
No, I guess you wouldn't, would you?

779
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,658
You see, Seymour, I could asphyx...

780
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,411
Asphyx...

781
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,172
What'd I ever do to you?

782
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,925
Nothing. It's what you did to her.

783
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,427
Her who?

784
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,265
Oh, her.

785
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,652
SEYMOUR:Shh! Go away.

786
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,911
Ooh! Chop it up.

787
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,455
- What?- Feed me!

788
01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:32,540
Okay, okay.

789
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:36,753
Oh, brother.

790
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:14,118
Audrey, what'd they say to you?

791
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:16,079
Uh, who?

792
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,499
- The police.- Oh, uh, nothing.

793
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,585
Audrey, talk to me. Tell me what they said.

794
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:25,922
It's Orin. They say he's disappeared!

795
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:30,426
- The police, they told you that?- They suspect foul play.

796
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:32,929
They do?

797
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:36,766
His receptionist, this morningshe found the place a shambles.

798
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,726
Gas masks everywhere.

799
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,854
Things all over the floor.

800
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,689
They think...

801
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,984
I can't even think about what they think.

802
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,161
Audrey.

803
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,499
Don't cry, Audrey.

804
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:05,503
Would it be so terribleif something had happened to him?

805
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,714
Seymour, what a thing to say!

806
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,426
Well, would it?

807
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,138
It wouldn't be terrible at all.

808
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,640
It'd be a miracle.

809
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:23,020
Not to mention all the money I'd saveon Epsom salts and ACE bandages.

810
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,313
You see?

811
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,817
But I'd still feel guilty. I mean...

812
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:32,822
If he met with foul playor some terrible accident of some kind...

813
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,908
...it'd be partly my fault just because...

814
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,162
...secretly I wished it.

815
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,748
Audrey, don't you waste another minutethinking about that creep!

816
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:48,087
There's a lot of guys that'd give anythingto go out with you.

817
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,090
Nice guys.

818
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,969
I don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

819
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,638
- That's not true.- You don't know the half of it!

820
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,807
I've led a terrible life.

821
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:05,104
I deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, D.D.S.

822
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,690
You know where I met him?

823
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,819
In the Gutter.

824
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:13,237
The gutter?

825
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:16,157
The Gutter. It's a nightspot.

826
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:19,911
I worked there on my nights offwhen we weren't making much money.

827
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,787
I'd put on...

828
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:26,042
...cheap and tasteless outfits,not nice ones like this.

829
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,378
Low and nasty apparel.

830
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,714
Audrey, that's all behind you now.

831
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:34,675
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

832
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:38,554
You're a very nice person.I always knew you were.

833
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:43,684
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs,you know what I saw?

834
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,978
A girl I respected.

835
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,064
I still do.

836
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:52,527
♫ Lift up your head

837
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,738
Wash off your mascara

838
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,740
Here, take my Kleenex

839
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,201
Wipe that lipstick away

840
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,329
Show me your face

841
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,873
Clean as the morning

842
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,167
I know things were bad

843
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:12,088
But now they're okay

844
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:18,386
Suddenly Seymour

845
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:21,430
Is standing beside you

846
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:27,520
You don't need no makeup

847
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:32,608
Don't have to pretend

848
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:37,029
Suddenly Seymour

849
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:41,576
Is here to provide you

850
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:46,455
Sweet understanding

851
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,792
- Seymour's your friend- Nobody ever

852
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,378
Treated me kindly

853
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,839
Daddy left early

854
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,716
Mama was poor

855
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:01,053
I'd meet a manAnd I'd follow him blindly

856
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,139
He'd snap his fingers

857
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:07,685
Me, I'd say "sure"

858
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:11,981
Suddenly Seymour

859
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:16,402
Is standing beside me

860
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,948
He don't give me orders

861
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:25,494
He don't condescend

862
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:29,582
Suddenly Seymour

863
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:34,086
Is here to provide me

864
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:38,716
Sweet understanding

865
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:42,053
- Seymour's my friend- Tell me this feeling

866
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,096
Lasts 'til forever

867
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:48,267
Tell me the bad timesAre clean washed away

868
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:52,313
Please understand thatIt's still strange and frightenin'

869
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:54,523
For losers like I've been

870
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:58,611
It's so hard to say

871
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:02,865
- Suddenly Seymour- Suddenly Seymour

872
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:07,119

873
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:11,540

01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:17,421
- Showed me I can- Yes you can

875
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:21,467
Learn how to be more

876
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,721
- The girl that's inside me- The girl that's inside you

877
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:34,063

Mr. Mushnik, you scared me. I...

Do you think I didn't know, huh?Oh, I knew.

885

But I didn't know the lengthsto which you'd go...

888
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,670
...the depths to which you'd sink!

889

You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.

920
01:13:56,141 --> 01:14:01,353
But considering you're almost like a sonto me, I'm thinking...

921
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:03,439
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.

922
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:08,027
- We don't?- I'm thinking...

923
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:13,407
...what if I kept my mouth shutand gave you a one-way ticket out of town?

924

You'd do that, sir?

925
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:21,123
You could lay low for a while, say 30, 40 years.

926
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:24,168
Meanwhile, I would keep the plant.

927
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:26,670
- The plant?- Of course...

928
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:30,174
...you'd have to teach mehow to take care of it while you're away.

No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.

1053
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,505
Something is very wrong here.

1054
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:15,926
I need me some water in the worst way.

1055
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,969
Look at my branches.

1056
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:21,014
I'm drying up. I'm a goner, honey!

1057
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,809
♫ Come on and give me a drink

1058
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,645
I don't know if I should.

1059
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,189
Hey, little lady, be nice

1060
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:30,857
Do you talk to Seymour like this?

1061
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:33,902
Sure do I'll drink it straight

1062
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,528
Your leaves are dry, poor thing.

1063
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,156
Don't need no glass or no ice

1064
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:39,866
Uh, I'll get the can.

1065
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:43,078
Don't need no twist of lime

1066
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:44,329
Here we go.

1067
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:46,831
And now it's suppertime!

1068
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,918
Oh!

1069
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,337
Ah, ha-ha-ha.

1070
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:55,966
Oh, relax, doll, and it'll be easier.

1071
01:24:56,133 --> 01:25:00,095
Come join your dentist friend and Mushnik,ha, ha.

1072
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:05,767
- Aah!- They're right inside. Ha-ha-ha!

1073
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:21,574
SEYMOUR:Get off of her! Get off!

1074
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:51,396
- Are you okay?- Yes.

1075
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,398
No.

1076
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,030
Don't die, Audrey. Please don't die.

1077
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:06,619
You know, the plant just saidthe strangest thing just now.

1078
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:09,456
It said Orin and Mr. Mushnik...

1079
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:11,791
...are already inside.

1080
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,295
It's true.

1081
01:26:15,463 --> 01:26:17,255
I did it.

1082
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,883
I fed them to it.

1083
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:25,055
And that's what made it so big and strong...

1084
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,808
...and you so famous?

1085
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:31,269
I've done terrible things, Audrey.

1086
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:35,732
- But not to you. Never to you.- But...

1087
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:41,529
I want you to, Seymour.

1088
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:43,656
What?

1089
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,746
When I die, which should be very shortly...

1090
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,165
...give me to the plant.

1091
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:58,088
So that it will live, and bring youall the wonderful things you deserve.

1092
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:02,050
- You don't know what you're saying.- But I do.

1093
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,970
It's the one gift I can give you.

1094
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,473
And if I'm in the plant...

1095
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:11,851
...then I am part of the plant.

1096
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,854
So in a way...

1097
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,609
...we'll always be together.

1098
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:27,450
♫ You'll wash my tender leaves

1099
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:33,706
You'll smell my sweet perfume

1100
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:38,545
You'll water me and care for me

1101
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:43,550
You'll see me bud and bloom

1102
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:48,513
I'm feeling strangely happy now

1103
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:55,728
Contented and serene

1104
01:27:56,564 --> 01:28:02,444
Oh, don't you see

1105
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:08,825
Finally I'll be

1106
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:15,081
Somewhere

1107
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,793
That's

1108
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,730
Green

1109
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,677
MAN:Hey! Watch it!

- I'm not interested.- Ah, but you will be.

1116
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:28,983
Look.

1117
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:35,114
I took the liberty of taking a cuttingfrom that amazing plant of yours.

1118
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:37,492
And look what grew in just a couple of days.

1119
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,624
The Design boys did the packaging.

1120
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,376
Cute, huh?

1121
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:47,835

This could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1129
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,195
What do you say, Mr. Krelborn?

1130
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:29,794

No shit, Sherlock.

1137
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:55,069
We're not talking about one hungry plant here.

1138
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,238
We're talking about world conquest.

1139
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:59,949
And I wanna thank you.

1140
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:03,369
You ate the only thing I ever loved.

1141
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,417
You're a monster, and so am I.

1142
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:12,211
It's gotta end. It's gonna stop right here.

01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:48,751
And the plants proceeded to grow

1231
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,045
And grow

1232
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:56,091
And began what they came here to do

1233
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:59,970
Which was essentially to

1234
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:04,308
Eat Cleveland

1235
01:41:04,476 --> 01:41:08,479

And Peoria

1237
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:16,695
And New York

1238
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:18,405
And where you live

1239
01:41:24,663 --> 01:41:27,414
They may offer you fortune and fame

1240
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:30,709
Love and money and instant acclaim

1241
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:35,339
But whatever they offer youDon't feed the plants

1242
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:40,552
They may offer you lots of cheap thrills

1243
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:43,806
Dates and discos in Beverly Hills

1244
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:48,477
But whatever they offer youDon't feed the plants

1245
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:57,987

Something's comingTo eat the world whole

1253
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,516
If we fight itWe've still got a chance

1254
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,604
But whatever they offer you

1255
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:21,690

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,599

- Twenty bucks apiece.- Twenty bucks.

14
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,848
- That's shocking.- No, I'm gonna get you one.

15
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,255
- Look what we've got here.- Dennis, you're in.

16
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,998
- I haven't seen him around, have you?- Who cares?

17
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,275
Hey.

18
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:45,278
Get a load of him.

19
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,876
- Hi.- Hello.

20
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,649

- Two or three days. Where have you been?- Two or three days?

22
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,618
How come I haven'tbeen around before this?

23
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:02,629
I don't know. Your problem.

24
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,866
What do you do?

25
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:09,371
Nothing very much.

26
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,465
Well, I'm not gonna ask youthe story of your life.

27
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,875
- You seem nice.- I wish you would.

28
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:24,549
Well, I'm making enough.I got a nice cozy place.

29
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,427
- Well, I haven't had any better offers.- What's to drink?

30
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:34,659
- Want to finish your drink?- A little bit.

31
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,728
Good boy. Big boy.

32
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:43,070
- Tonight -- What's the matter?

33
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:45,542
Well, uh...

34
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,704
I think I'm caught in this booth.

35
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,974
Come and get comfortable.

36
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,816
Oh, come on.

37
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:02,226
You come on.What do you mean by "interesting"?

38
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,034
Huh?

39
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:11,095
What do you mean by"come up to my apartment"?

40
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,642
That's a silly questionfor a big girl like you.

41
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,648
What do you do?

42
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:23,718
I'm a musician.

43
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,223
Jazz musician.

44
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,483
I play trumpet.

45
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:36,824
You didn't bringyour instrument tonight, did you?

46
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:43,264
You guys are really something.

47
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,332
Well, what have you beensitting here all night for?

48
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,347
Huh?

49
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:53,681
I thought you knew all the answers.

50
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:56,687
Well, you want to getpicked up, don't you?

51
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,748
Would you like that?I'd like to take you.

52
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,156
- I'll bet you would.- Have a great time.

53
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,560
What do you say?All right? Please?

54
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,429
- Such a baby.- What do you say?

55
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,629
I'm not kidding. I'm very serious.Would you like it?

56
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,297
- Huh?- All right.

57
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,078
- What's your name?- Nancy.

58
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:30,519
- What's yours?- Ben.

59
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:35,628
Hi.

60
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,695
That's a lousy agreement.

61
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,928
I've been a singerin this business for 10 years...

62
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,562
and I've never introduceda girlie line in my life.

63
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,901
Well, I can't change you. Hughie -

64
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,067
It's not a question of the money.

65
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:52,977
It's just that my client feelsthat it's beneath his dignity...

66
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,708
to have to introducea bunch of floozies.

67
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:58,719
I've got a few guys readyright now to take your place.

68
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,813
You aren't infallible, you know.

69
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,493
Okay. All right, cut it.

70
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,762
- Cut it! Cut it out.- All right, all right.

71
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,770
Okay, okay.

72
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:18,171
Okay, cut it. Cut it.

73
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,334
- All right. All right.- Okay, uh -

74
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,317
Now, there are 10 million people inNew York City. Half of them are girls.

75
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,684
And any one of them can sing this songbetter than you broads. Any one of them.

76
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:34,553
"A real mad chick," right?

77
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,819
And shake your bodies around!

78
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,863
Do something, will ya?Now, let's try it once more.

79
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,595
- All right, if you want me to do it.- Once more, girls. "A real mad chick".

80
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,833
But look, I'm going to feel like an awfuldamn fool introducing those girlies.

81
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,839
You're an artist.

82
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,842
If you make up your mindto do it, you can do it.

83
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,378
Look, I was an artist 10 years ago.

84
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:57,814
Now, that's when I was an artist.

85
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,875
How you doing?You want to see me for a moment?

86
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,887
- You got a minute?- Sure.

87
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,684
- Bennie -- Wait a minute.

88
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,690
Let me see him for a moment, okay?

89
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,193
A moment, man. You know.

90
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,195
- What is it, Bennie?- You got a minute?

91
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,197
Yeah, I got a minute.Let me tell you something.

92
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,531
You know what these peoplewant to do to me?

93
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:17,537
It's bad enough workingin a third-rate nightclub...

94
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:21,632
packaged with the strippers and flooziesand playing second fiddle to them.

95
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,577
They want meto introduce the girlie line.

96
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,636
Crazy.

97
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,049
- They can't even sing.- Look, Hugh.

98
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,849
I need 20 bucks to pay a guy backI borrowed from for a few beers.

99
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:36,413
- Are you ready for our deal now?- We're still making up our mind about it.

100
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,722
- Where's your boy?- He's over there talking to his brother.

101
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,921
I want to pay him back.Have you got it?

102
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:44,490
Here's my offer now. You're gonnaplay two nights. $35 a night. Yes or no?

103
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:47,230
We'll take it, Jack.We've got no problems.

104
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,238
You've got to introduce the girls,the whole line.

105
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:53,208
- We need the money, Hugh.- You got it, 20 bucks for me?

106
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:55,211
What's it gonna be?

107
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,279
- Look, we haven't decided anything.- We've decided, and he'll be there.

108
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,286
Look, man.I'll see you later.

109
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,016
You're only a kid.It's a lot of money for a kid.

110
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,423
Anything. Okay, excuse me.Bennie.

111
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:11,428
Now, Mr. Ackerman.There are no problems at all.

112
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,430
He's got a little troublewith his kid brother.

113
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:16,059
And it's going to be taken care ofin just about another minute.

114
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:19,627
Now, as we agreed, we're going to bethere tonight in Philly right on time.

115
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,639
Bennie.

116
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,440
Look, Hugh.We've gotta settle this thing.

117
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:27,756
What's the deal?

118
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:31,143
He wants to give us $35a night and third billing.

119
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,151
And you introducethe girlie line, Hughie.

120
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,847
We heard that part before.

121
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:40,383
- All right, what time do I leave?- Just be in Philly in time for the show.

122
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,656
That's all I want from you.

123
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:50,035
Rupe, you're a very lucky boy.

124
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,437
If you knew how many peoplewanted this job.

125
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,838
You guys are both very lucky boys.

126
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,470
Well, I wouldn't say thatexactly, Mr. Ackerman.

127
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,487
What's the matter?

128
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,819
What's the matter?Come on, what's the matter?

129
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,985
- I forgot your toothbrush.- Look, I'll buy one.

130
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,325
Hey, how about moving up there?

131
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,361
- How you gonna get home?- I thought I'd take a nice little walk.

132
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,370
No, look,I want you to take a cab.

133
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:23,100
Oh, please, Hugh.Don't start that again.

134
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,767
I'm 20 years old,and I've lived in this city all my life.

135
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:28,335
- I think I can manage.- Yeah, yeah, I know.

136
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,007
Look. You don't know everything,and you're a baby.

137
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,551
I mean, all you have to dois read the papers.

138
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:37,179
A girl can't walk safelydown the streets at night in any city...

139
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,851
without being hollered at andcalled names and pinched and abused.

140
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,861
I don't want my baby sister being hurtfor a few pennies. Now, you take a cab.

141
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,456
Nothing ever happens to mewhen I walk home.

142
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,559
Round trip to Philadelphia, please.

143
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:57,710
Look, nothing's gonna happen to me,nothing ever does.

144
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:01,772
I love you.Now, take care of yourself. Okay?

145
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:04,249
And do a good show.And come on, let's go.

146
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,980
- And look-- The suitcase.

147
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:10,650
- You're gonna be late.- Look, take a cab, please. All right?

148
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,659
Get out of here.

149
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,862
You're gonna miss it!

150
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:28,073
- Where you been? You're never on time.- Look, we'll make it.

151
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,077
Come on.

152
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:39,844
- No, we're gonna make it. Come on.- Man, it's too late.

153
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,051
Look, he's stopping.Come on, man, run.

154
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,424
After you.

155
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:14,018
Hey, Sam.Thanks for letting us use this pad, man.

156
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,026
- How'd you like that date?- Yeah, man, but everybody's gotta live.

157
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,394
Sure, sure. Fourth billingand introduce the girlie act.

158
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:22,331
- Now, that really burns me.- Forget it, will you?

159
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:26,565
What am I introducing a bunch ofdumb broads for? What's to introduce?

160
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,402
So they're dumb broads.So they gotta live too.

161
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,066
That's the way I feel also.

162
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,908
That beats baked beanswith baked beans, buddy.

163
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:39,283
Sam. All right, I'm a singer.And I sing a song.

164
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:43,288
Now, what am I gonna say about a bunchof dumb broads with white ribbons...

165
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:45,655
going around singing "A Pretty Girl"?Does that make sense?

166
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,522
Well, you just can't say that exactly.

167
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,293
I don't know, say a few nice wordsabout the audience...

168
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,300
like, uh, I don't know.

169
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,997
Just smile, be yourself, you know?

170
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:59,199

And singers sing.I mean, that's it. That's all, man.

172
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,435
Well, man. You can alwaystell a couple of jokes.

173
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,072
Everybody likes jokes.That makes people feel good.

174
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,741
Sam, what time is it?

175
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:12,310
You make them feel relaxed, at easy.Like Steve Allen, you know.

176
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,379
Jokes? What jokes?I don't know any jokes.

177
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:17,790
- Look, I don't even know my own name.- Now, come on, baby. Let's go.

178
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,522
- Now, hold on a minute.- To hell with jokes. You tell a joke.

00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:22,861

How's that oneabout the witch doctor?

183
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,906
Are you kidding?They'd close the joint.

184
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,910
I was just thinking out loud.

185
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:38,677
I'll tell you one a little bit,little bit more refined.

186
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,777
Uh, you like that one aboutthe rabbit in the tree?

187
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,515
I don't know that one.

188
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,580
That one about the rabbit thatfell on out of the tree and says...

189
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:50,095
"Man, that lovemaking's for the birds".

190
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,892

00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,641
Man, you won't offend anybody.You know, with dates?

00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:07,943
- Do you really think that's funny?- Yeah, come on. Give it a try, will ya?

196
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,848

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,752

Uh, ladies and gentlemen,did you ever hear-

200
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,522

Try it, man. What's to lose with us?Are we gonna kill you?

202
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:31,131
Look, if you're so smart,you do it yourself.

203
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,742
Okay, I will.

204
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,971
It's easy though, you know.

205
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,105
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:44,552
On my way over here this eveninga very funny thing happened to me.

207
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,187
Got it? I was walking down the streetlooking up at this great big tree.

208
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,197

00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,266
- Man, who are you, Steve Allen?- All I'm saying -

211
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,831
Wait. I got it. I got it. I got it.

212
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,046
I say, uh...

213
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,110

252
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:06,796

Oh, Tom! Will you cut it out?For crying out loud.

255
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,517
You guys.

256
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:23,646
You never break your pattern.You'll never go anywhere with your lives.

257
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:27,089
- Tom, take this. Drink up.- How many do I take?

258
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,094
Take just this one.

259
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:35,099
Why don't you do something,learn something?

260
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,534
There are thousands of things to doin New York City.

261
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:41,836
- Like what?- Why don't you do something different?

262
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,843
Do you want to meet new people?

263
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,970
You wanna come to a literaryparty I'm having tonight?

264
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,210
Don't invite them, David.They won't even wear ties.

265
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:52,116
- Lelia's coming.- What the hell is a literary party?

266
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:57,056
Just where people interestedin books and other literary efforts...

267
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:59,059
get together and discuss things.

268
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:01,255
Well, if they're coming,I'm not going to be there...

269
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,696
because they're gonna just act awful,and I'll be so embarrassed.

270
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:07,132
- Oh, it's all right.- Oh, a tie. You kidding?

271
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,467
You can comejust as you are.Do you want to come?

272
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,667
- Yeah, I'll read a poem.- Don't get excited, honey.

273
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:16,144
Who wants to makethat fink party anyway?

274
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:20,843
All right, something else.A concert or a museum?

275
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:25,013
A museum, I'm for it.Ben, Tom?

276
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,990
I don't think you've ever even beenin a museum, any of you.

277
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:31,654
I? I've never been in a museum?

278
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,325
We've been in plenty of museums.I bet you can't even spell it.

279
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,233
- Oh, will you stop teasing me?- Here, Tom. Pick it up.

280
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,567
Lelia has a very bright mind, Bennie.

281
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,539
- She's developing very rapidly.- Bull.

282
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,773
I don't want to sit around here andbe insulted by these creeps. Let's go.

283
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:50,681
Lelia, you should eat somethingbesides black coffee.

284
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,346
David, please.Don't start lecturing me now.

285
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:03,462
Well?

286
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,862
- Come on, David. Let's go.- Never mind. We're going.

287
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,130
What will it be, Dennis,the Margarine or the Metropolitan?

288
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:11,865
Let's go to the Metropolitan.They got mummies there and everything.

289
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,873
- What do you say?- You guys kidding?

290
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,070
- No, man. Let's cut.- Let's go.

291
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,739
- Let's go. Come on, Ben.- Hey, Bennie.

292
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,215
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

293
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,753
Hey, Bennie, Dennis.

294
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,128
I don't know what you wantedto come here for, Dennis.

295
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:46,404
This joint is nothing but a placefor a bunch of sexless women...

296
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,411
who don't haveany love in their life.

297
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,641
A lot of big deal professors.

298
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:52,876
A lot of creeps trying to showoff how much they know.

299
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,283
- You couldn't be wronger.- I suppose professors don't come here?

300
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:59,117
Well, I didn't say that.

301
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,351
All right, Dennis. Look at that.

302
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:03,918
I suppose you can tell mewhat he's about, huh, genius?

303
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,725
- He's a statue.- I know he's a statue, Dennis.

304
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,097
What kind of a statue?I know he's a statue.

305
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,433
- Well, Tom, I don't know everything.- You know something, Dennis?

306
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:14,995
- You don't know nothing.- Oh, yeah? What do you know?

307
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:17,066
- A lot more than you do, pal.- Yeah?

308
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,111
What you come here forif you know so much?

309
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,840
You have no respect for art,no respect at all.

310
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:25,251
You listen to me, Dennis.

311
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,312
You're nothing but an ignorant slob,Dennis, a little ignorant slob.

312
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:31,414
- I went to college, Dennis.- You?

313
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,290
All I ever got out of itwas dissipation...

314
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:37,388
and a lot of early bellsdisturbing my sleep.

315
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:39,399
A lot of supercilious professors...

316
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:42,595
slob professors shooting offtheir mouth about something...

317
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,367
trying to teach me something they'dalready failed at in life themselves.

318
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,933
So don't tell meI don't appreciate anything.

319
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,858
Tom, do you know whatI'm going to do with that?

320
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,523
I'm gonna put it on a Christmas card.Just a mask on a card.

321
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,499
- Won't that be wild?- Don't send one to me, pal.

322
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,230
Look, Tom, will you cool it?You know what you're talking about?

323
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,431
I suppose you really understandthat thing, huh, Bennie?

324
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:20,082
It's not a question of understanding it.If you feel it, you feel it, stupid.

325
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,274
That's what I been trying to tell you.

326
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,940
- Aw, shut up, Dennis.- Aw, shut up, yourself.

327
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,848
- Say you're sorry.- All right, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

328
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:28,852
Hey, look at that one, now.Look at that one, man.

329
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,855
- You're really sorry?- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

330
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,255
- Okay. I apologize.- Take it easy, guys, will you?

331
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,260
Hey, look at this.Now, look.

332
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:38,761
Now, look at this cat.

333
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,299
He really had a sense of humorwhen he made this.

334
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,426
That isn't supposedto be humorous, Tom.

335
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:46,734
What are we supposed to do,get serious with a can like that?

336
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:50,573
- I'm telling you right now, Tom.- Don't get excited, Dennis.

337
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:52,703
I'm not going to hurt it.It's made of iron.

338
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:54,714
A chick like that may destroy me.

339
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:57,080
What's the matter with Tom?Is he crazy or something?

340
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:58,305
No, Dennis.

341
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:00,314
Someday you may marry a girlthat looks like that.

342
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:01,742
Oh, God forbid.

343
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:04,153
- It's not funny, Dennis.- It's not funny.

344
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,764
This joint gives me the creeps, Bennie.Let's go, come on.

345
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,734
- Where are you going?- Let's get out of here.

346
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:15,793
Okay.

347
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:26,545
Lelia.

348
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,913
I'm not tryingto hurt your feelings.

349
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:32,444
But if you're going to write a story,you have to do it professionally.

350
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:35,013
David, I don't want to be a writer.

351
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,085
I didn't want to do this.You convinced me to do it.

352
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:41,290
And now all you can do is criticize.

353
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,358
I just want you to be honest.

354
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:49,805
Look, your story has some pretty goodthings. But it's very hard to be honest.

355
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,536
I don't understand your viewpoint.

356
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,637
Jean-Paul Sartre has absolutely nothingto do with existential psychoanalysis.

357
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,444
- Would you like a cigarette?- No, thank you.

358
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,780
Well, it's all a bit vague.Don't you think so, Joan?

359
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,979
I do not. The trouble with you is...

360
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,182
you suffer from self-induced hysteriaat the word existentialism.

361
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:07,250
- Are you aware of that?- Can I fix you a drink?

362
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,261
- No, thank you.- I assure you, I don't.

363
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,162
I know the article to which you refer.I've read it three times.

364
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,894
I couldn't even findthe basic precepts.

365
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,938
- Which article was that?- If you can explain it, I'd be delighted.

366
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:21,237
Well, it's perfectly obvious.Man, in contrast to other animals...

367
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,243
is conscious of his own existence.

368
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,474
Therefore, conscious ofthe possibility of non-existence.

369
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:29,015
Ergo, he has anxiety, right?

370
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:31,018
Right, absolutely.I couldn't agree with you more.

371
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:34,078
Well, it figures.

372
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,895
Now this girl here...

373
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:44,330
she has no control over herself.

374
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,768
She's been deeply hurt.

375
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:49,771
And yet she goes onas if nothing happened...

376
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,774
living her life the same as before.

377
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:55,403
It just doesn't make any sense.Life takes more than imagination.

378
00:27:55,479 --> 00:28:00,416
Well, the point is thatif you're yourself, you won't get hurt.

379
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:05,387
- Are you a writer too?- Oh, no. Do I look like a writer?

380
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:08,426
Well, I can't tell anymore.

381
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:12,521
- I'm a dancer really.- Oh, a dancer. Why, that's great.

382
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:15,725
- Are you a ballet dancer?- Oh, no, exotic.

383
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,567
- Exotic?- Oh, you don't know what that is, do you?

384
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:25,441
- Not exactly.- It's, uh, sort of modern...

385
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,446
only more exotic.

386
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,447
That sounds terrific.

387
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:32,177
Listen, would you mind if I cameto see you perform sometime?

388
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,618
Oh, no. The very next time,I'll invite you.

389
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,622
Great. When will that be?

390
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,091
Oh, I'm not dancing right now.

391
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,822
Oh, no? Why not?

392
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,456
I'm going to have a baby in March.

393
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,834
You're -

394
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:49,836
That's great.You're going to have a baby.

395
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:54,103
A baby. That sounds terrific.Congratulations. That's great news.

396
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:56,838
- We think so, don't we, honey?- Huh?

397
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:59,973
Yeah, well, that's swell.Congratulations.

398
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:02,710
- Thank you.- Listen, if it's okay...

399
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,981
I'll just excuse myselfand fix my drink a little bit.

400
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:24,705
You don't know what it is to be hurt.You can't always see it coming.

401
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:28,336
Sometimes a person could ruin your life.

402
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:32,247
And yet, all he'd be ableto honestly say is "I'm sorry".

403
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,047
Hi, David.Am I interrupting something?

404
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,817
Tony. Lelia Carruthers, Tony Russell.

405
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,483
- Hello.- Hello.

406
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,653
I was just tryingto convince Lelia that...

407
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,390
writers today have got to berealistic in their approach.

408
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:48,661
What he's trying to say is,he hates my writing.

409
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,259
You be the judge, Tony.You be the judge.

410
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:53,601
On her first day in New York this year...

411
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:56,336
Lelia's writing abouta walk down Fifth Avenue.

412
00:29:57,344 --> 00:30:01,838
She sees a stranger standingin the sunlight on a street corner...

413
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:04,816
and she walks up and kisses him,this perfect stranger.

414
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,547
It's revolting on a Sunday afternoon.

415
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:11,719
It is not.If I wanted to, I would.

416
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,569
Was that so bold?

417
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:27,235
I guess I have tochange sides, David.

418
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,302
David, would you go and get mesome more champagne?

419
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,870
It's even more revolting in real life.

420
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,684
Some more champagne.

421
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:39,882
I think you've had plenty.

422
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:49,095
- What did you say your name was?- Lelia.

423
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,725
It's a lovely party, isn't it?

424
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:55,397
Do you know you're staring at me?

425
00:30:56,408 --> 00:31:00,139
- I'm hypnotizing you.- Thank you.

426
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:02,237
Who do you belong to, Lelia?

427
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:05,316
Why, I belong to me.

428
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:07,648
What about David?

429
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:14,660
- No more champagne, Lelia.- David, I was just about to see Lelia home.

430
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:17,161
What do you mean?I'm taking Lelia home.

431
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,427
Well, uh, you're both wrong...

432
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,798
because neither one of youare taking me home.

433
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:25,805
I'm meeting Vickie andshe's spending the night at my house.

434
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:30,504
Oh. I guess my hypnotic spell isa little rusty. What about tomorrow?

435
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:33,513
Tomorrow, Lelia and Iare going to the park.

436
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,140
- Oh, well, good, good. I'll come along.- No.

437
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:39,482
- Oh.- David, don't be so unfriendly.

438
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:57,637
Don't be such an old man, David.

439
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,642
- Hi, Moe.- Moe-Moe.

440
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,077
Hey, baby.Give me one of those.

441
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,015
- Hello, stranger. There's a stranger.- Hi, Moe.

442
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,017
- Hello, Moe.- How have you been?

443
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:10,713
- Lelia, come here.- You sure look like you've got a hangover.

444
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:13,256
I've gotta go.

445
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,554
- What's the story here?- I'll talk to you later about it.

446
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:17,526
I thought you and Lelia were makingthe scene. Dave, wait a minute!

447
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:20,257
- I can't. I can't.- Oh, wow.

448
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,751
I'm really not very happy.

449
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:20,227
I mean, I'm happy, but I'm notas happy as everybody thinks I am.

450
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:22,230
- Why not?- Oh...

451
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:25,426
because I feel that I should befarther ahead than I am.

452
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:29,064
And everythingis passing me by, and -

453
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,074
- How old are you?- Twenty.

454
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:35,976
- I'd never guess.- Oh, stop. Don't laugh. I'm serious.

455
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,380
I have the feeling thatI'll never, you know, be smart...

456
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,079
and I'm never goingto get the things that I want.

457
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,955
And, uh - Oh -

458
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,992
What do you feel like?Tell me what you feel like.

459
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,052
- I feel like I'm in a -- In a cocoon and you can't get out?

460
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,063
That's right.How did you know?

461
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,793
I didn't think boys were supposed tounderstand things like that.

462
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,703
- You see, I am far behind.- Behind who?

463
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:03,675
- Now you sound like David.- I hope not.

464
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:07,406
Why not? David's one of the mostintelligent people I've met in my life.

465
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,415
But not very romantic.

466
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:12,816
No, he's not very romantic.

467
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,792
You know, I'm not a very nice person.

468
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,828
I mean,I have very romantic inclinations.

469
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,363
Be forewarned that I'm not oneof these storybook characters...

470
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,798
that's supposed to beall noble and righteous.

471
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:28,427
When I see someone I like...

472
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:32,304
and if she likes me,we accept my romantic inclinations.

473
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,275
Do you happen to knowwhere we are right now?

474
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:40,474
No.

475
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,146
That's where I live,right there, number seven.

476
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:48,754
Come on up for a drink.

477
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:54,120
You know you're beautiful?

478
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:26,999
Don't you move.

479
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:38,577
Don't move.

480
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:17,444
You've got the softest lipsI've ever felt.

481
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:26,296
Tony.

482
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,232
I love you, Lelia.

483
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:33,760
I don't want anything to drink.

484
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,376
All right, baby.

485
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:45,343
I love you, Lelia.

486
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,453
Love you, Lelia.

487
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,981
Baby, I love you.

488
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,794
So much.

489
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,251
Lelia.

490
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,517
Really, if I'd knownthis was the first time for you...

491
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,582
I wouldn't have touched you.

492
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:28,186
I didn't know it could be so awful.

493
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,333
Don't be so upset, sweetheart.

494
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,631
Baby.

495
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,233
It'll be much easier next time.

496
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,740
There isn't going to be a next time.

497
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:52,378
Want a cigarette? Huh?

498
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,450
- Come on, have a cigarette.- No.

499
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:02,824
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.I guess I did.

500
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:09,064
I was so frightened.

501
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,412
I kept saying to myself,"You mustn't cry.

502
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:19,316
If you love a man,you shouldn't be so frightened".

503
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,812
It's only natural.

504
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,690
There isn't a girl in the worldthat wouldn't feel the same way.

505
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,752
She's got to.

506
00:38:30,564 --> 00:38:33,397
- What happens now?- What happens?

507
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:38,300
Uh, what do you mean,"What happens now"?

508
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,904
- I mean, do I stay with you?- Stay with me?

509
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,472
Uh, stay with me?Do you mean live with me?

510
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,778
Yes.

511
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,619
Do you want to?

512
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:03,692
No.

513
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,735
I want to go home.

514
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:10,033
Okay, baby.

515
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:19,939
I thought being with youwould be so important...

516
00:39:21,554 --> 00:39:23,886
mean so much...

517
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:30,051
that afterwards two people would beas close as it's possible to get.

518
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,299
But instead...

519
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:42,200
- we're just two strangers.- Lelia.

520
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:45,836
- Lelia.- It's over.

521
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,883
I know that much about life.

522
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:55,512
Lelia, you can come stay with me.

523
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:57,524
I want you to.

524
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,061
But when I saythat you're close to me...

525
00:40:01,128 --> 00:40:03,995
that's all I can say,because that's the way I am.

526
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,664
But that does not mean that I don't feelthe same things that you feel.

527
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,536
Tony, please, please don't.

528
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:17,172
- Lelia, I love you.- Please don't touch me.

529
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,150
Please don't touch me.I want to go home.

530
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,022
- I want to get dressed now.- Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

531
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,925
- Please leave me alone.- Okay, sweetheart, I'll take you home.

532
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,227
Okay, sweetheart.Sweetheart, it's okay.

533
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,232
- I'm with you.- I want to go home.

534
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,292
I'll take you home.I'll take you home.

535
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,543
Seventy-five, buddy.

536
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:51,106
Look, uh, why don't you just takethe taxi wherever you're gonna go?

00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,345

Look, why don't wejust end it right here?

541
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,630
Make up your minds.

542
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,969
Because you don't want it that way,and because I don't want it that way.

543
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,907
You go with her,or end it and you stay.

544
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,536
But, uh, come on,make up your mind.

545
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:20,103

How are you?

Well, how did the thing go?I mean, big crowds?

00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:20,607
Fine. The only one bad spotin the whole thing was...

00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:24,167
this character here decides to--he's gonna rewrite everything.

593
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:26,236
You ever hearJelly Rollsung like an opera?

594
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:30,251

You didn't tell me aboutan appointment earlier.

601
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,079
I just remembered about ita couple of minutes ago.

602

- What's the matter?- I want you to go.

612

613
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:54,400
I don't want you -I don't want you to hurt my sister.

614
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:57,342
- I don't wanna hurt your sister.- Look. Maybe I can make you understand.

00:46:57,413 --> 00:47:00,176
- Lelia, I don't want to hurt you.- Look, I want you to go!

616

I'll take you and Rupe to dinner.All of us will go.

621
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,423
I can't seem tomake it clear to you.

Remember, you told me to get out.

629

Look, would you leave?

630
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:49,225
Would you leave before I do somethingI don't want to do right now.

631
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:52,465
Would you just get out of here.Go ahead.

00:49:56,673 --> 00:50:00,972
That water better be hot this morning orI'm gonna wipe that superintendent out.

641
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:06,583
Excuse me.

642
00:50:09,587 --> 00:50:12,453
Hey, how do you manage to get herethree minutes before I do?

643
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:15,686
What do you do, get up late at nightand watch the alarm or something?

644
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,888
- Too bad.- Just don't slop it up in there, okay?

645
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:21,022
Well, some people like water on them.

646
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,830
Oh, go drown yourself.

647
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:29,799
Hey, baby. How you feeling?

648
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,808
- Fine.- Great.

649
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:35,609
Looks like I'll have to go outand buy you a whole field of tobacco.

650
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,908
How you feel now?You feel like talking to me about it?

651
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,215
- Maybe it'll help you.- No, Hugh.

652
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:45,480
There's not much to say.Thanks anyway.

653
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,050
Is it just possible for somebodyto get a towel in this place?

654
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,221
Oh, I forgot to put them up.I'll get you one.

655
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,788
No, don't drag it out.It's probably someplace simple...

656
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:54,994
like in the hi-fi set.

657
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,833
Look, I better get it while it's hot.

658
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:01,602
Oh, Lelia. Look, I got some catscoming up tonight.

659
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:04,804
And, uh, if you don't feelup to it, we can cancel.

660
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:07,212
Oh, no, Hugh.It's all right, really.

661
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:11,845
I'll even order some things.It'll give me something to do.

662
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,355
Great, great. That's my baby.

663
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,024
Al.

664
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:26,835
Al told me a story yesterday about Bird.

665
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:33,031
Bird had this big limousine that had beenassessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue...

666
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,876
and he was driving it all over town,you know, like a block long.

667
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:39,382
And, uh, he was driving withtwo other people in the car...

668
00:51:39,451 --> 00:51:42,511
and Al was, like, the guyin the center who, like, told me.

669
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:45,316
And the guy on the outside he didn't likeand they were going uptown.

670
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,257
And they were going down Broadwayand they had to make a left...

671
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:50,453
and another left to go uptown.

672
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:53,498
So as they stopped at the light...

673
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:55,500
Bird said...

674
00:51:55,568 --> 00:51:59,402
"Man, would you mind getting outof the car? I have to make a left turn".

675
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:01,633
So the guy said, "Okay, Bird,"and got out of the car.

676
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:05,074
And Bird made his left turnand went uptown without him.

677
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:08,945
- Isn't that sick?- Yeah, very.

678
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:11,678
- Hey, Bennie, you got a towel for me?- Yeah.

679
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:14,816
Thanks.

680
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:18,921
Maybe I'll just joina small group in Vegas.

681
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:22,827
Bennie, what's this I hearabout you getting a job?

682
00:52:22,898 --> 00:52:25,366
I mean, that really upsets me.

683
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,598
- You're kidding, aren't you?- Very funny, very funny.

684
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:33,199
Lelia, can I get youa cup of coffee or something?

685
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,800
No, Hugh.

686
00:52:35,878 --> 00:52:38,279
What's the matter with you?Are you sick?

687
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,447
You look awful. You oughtto get some rest at night.

688
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,455
Will you shut up!

689
00:52:51,194 --> 00:52:53,128
What did I say?

690
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:56,190
Just forget it.

691
00:52:56,267 --> 00:52:58,201
I won't forget it. What did I say?

692
00:52:58,269 --> 00:53:01,238
- What's the matter with her?- Nothing you'd be interested in.

693
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:04,706
Look, she's my sister too. I wanna knowwhat's the matter with her.

694
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:07,972
Nothing, baby. Just a little problemthat came up last night.

695
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:10,412
A little problem?What is the little problem?

696
00:53:12,217 --> 00:53:17,211
Look, Bennie. It's just a problemwith the races, that's all.

697
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:24,659
Like I said, Bennie,nothing you'd be interested in.

698
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,691
Who all is comingto this party tonight?

699
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:31,066
Oh, just some people.

700
00:53:49,157 --> 00:53:51,091
You know what you need?

701
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:54,424
You need a guy to take care of youand protect your values.

702
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,364
You need a home and securityand babies, honey.

703
00:53:57,433 --> 00:53:59,367
That's what you need.

704
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:03,734
- Oh, look. There's DaveyJones. Davey!- No, Vickie.

705
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:05,740
Meet Davey. He's wonderful.You'll love him.

706
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:08,641
- Vickie, no.- Davey! DaveyJones. Davey!

707
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:12,273
Davey, I want you to meet Lelia.Lelia, this is Davey.

708
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,045
- Hello there.- Hello.

709
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,916
Sit down for a second, Davey.

710
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,918
Davey went to the same school -Your brother's school, Stuyvesant.

711
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:30,056
Vickie--How long have you known Vickie?

712
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,800
What do you do all day?

713
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,399
- I paint.- You're an artist.

714
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,246
Maybe I can drop by one afternoon.Take in a movie or something.

715
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:43,713
I don't like the movies.

716
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:47,583
Well, there are other places to go.Take you to a club then. How about that?

717
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,455
Or we'll go to an opera.

718
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:53,458
I might drop up one afternoon.

719
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:55,517
Maybe we can go for a walkthrough the park or-

720
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,530
I don't like the park either.

721
00:54:57,598 --> 00:55:00,158
Oh, give me a break.

722
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,253
Hi, Dave, daddy.

723
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:10,644
Hello, Rupert. How are you?I'm not interrupting, am I?

724
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,681
Vickie, will you help me out, put ina good word here or there somewhere?

725
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:20,714
Well.

726
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:23,781
- To talk to Lelia.- Hi, baby. How are you doing?

727
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,727
Why don't you take herto that wonderful painters' -

728
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:29,890
They're having some kind of thingover at Cooper Union.

729
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:33,595
- She'd love that.- I wouldn't dig that at all.

730
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,138
Well, that's the kind of thingI enjoy, you see?

731
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:41,034
Well, we'll go then.

732
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,851
Lelia. Hello.

733
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,217
I'd like to see youfor a second, can I?

734
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,586
- Yeah, what?- It's about Tony.

735
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:04,727
Say, uh, excuse me. Can I talk to Leliafor just a second? It's something important.

736
00:56:04,803 --> 00:56:07,294
- No, David. I'd rather not.- Honey. It's okay.

737
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:10,604
No, please. David,I don't want to discuss any of this.

738
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:13,703
- Please. Just come with me for a second.- No, David, please!

739
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,614
He called me. He was very upset aboutsomething that happened here the other day.

740
00:56:17,684 --> 00:56:21,017
- And he got me upset about it.- I know, David.

741
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,988
Yeah, but I feel I'm involved in it.And I just want to tell you...

742
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:26,389
that I didn't know at allwhat he was like, when, you know -

743
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:29,452
Hey, hey, Dave, Dave.

744
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:31,794
Come on, Dave.Leave my sister alone.

745
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:34,426
Come on, man.Come on and join the party.

746
00:56:39,507 --> 00:56:41,442
Look, I have to go.

747
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:43,445
I'll see you later, all right?

748
00:56:43,512 --> 00:56:46,709
- You're a very good dancer.- I'm not such a good dancer.

749
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:49,115
Lelia, come on over here.Come on over here.

750
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:51,175
Looks like you and herare getting along real fine.

751
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:53,484
Well.

752
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:25,417
Look, why don't you justcome on and have a drink with us...

753
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:29,655
and join in the partyand forget about your mood for a while?

754
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,663
You know, I just don't understand.

755
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,565
I think you reallywant to join in the party...

756
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:36,760
but maybe you don't know how.

757
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:39,305
You want to be coaxed a little bit.

758
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,306
You really feel that way?

759
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,137
I prefer to be coaxed.But don't you coax me, okay?

760
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:48,044
There are other ways.

761
00:57:50,852 --> 00:57:53,150
You want a drink?Want me to get you a drink?

762
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,055
- No, thanks. I don't drink.- You'll find it's good for what ails you.

763
00:57:57,125 --> 00:58:02,894
Just pull yourself together, becauseyou're not kidding anybody but yourself.

764
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:07,902
You know, you haveyour sense of values all mixed up.

765
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,904
So I can just -

766
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,406
No, don't touch me.

767
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:14,704
Come on, just a little taste.

768
00:58:25,555 --> 00:58:28,149
- Let him go, let him go.- You're crazy, baby.

769
00:58:28,224 --> 00:58:31,092
- Let me go. Let me go.- Hugh, come on.

770
00:58:31,162 --> 00:58:33,153
Let me go!

771
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:39,561
What the hell is wrong with that guy?

772
00:58:39,638 --> 00:58:41,628
What's wrong with you?You don't have to get carried away.

773
00:58:41,706 --> 00:58:43,866
He's always messing up the damn thing!What's wrong with him?

774
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:46,103
This is a party! Stop it!

775
00:59:02,096 --> 00:59:05,691
Mary had a little lamb,its fleece was white as snow.

776
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,391
Everywhere that Mary went,the lamb was sure to go.

777
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,481
- Gee, he's your brother, and I -- I know.

778
00:59:24,552 --> 00:59:27,077
I find it hard to believeyou can't talk to him.

779
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:32,184
I don't know, right now I'd just be satisfiedwith a home and a few kids, you know.

780
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,753
- Simple things.- I envy you.

781
00:59:35,831 --> 00:59:39,289
He's a pretty unhappy kid, you know.It's too bad you can't -

782
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,132
He's mixed up and for some reason,I don't know...

783
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,502
he doesn't,either doesn't want to, is afraid to -

784
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:47,008
Okay, Hugh.Let her off the hook, will you?

785
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:49,511
The night's almost over.

786
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:54,006
Let's end it off with a little smilerather than all this.

787
00:59:54,085 --> 00:59:58,487
What's with this "Leave the girl alone"?Why don't you leave me alone?

788
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:01,616
I was only attempting to remind youthat we invited her here...

789
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:03,422
to have a good time, that's all.

790
01:00:03,495 --> 01:00:05,986
She obviously wants to hearwhat I have to say.

791
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:08,793
- Maybe he doesn't wanna talk about it.- She's not complaining.

792
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:11,427
Why don't you butt out,mind your own business?

793
01:00:11,502 --> 01:00:14,097
We want to kill each other,that's my business.

794
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:17,472
Every time I turn around, it's you behind mepushing me, interfering with me.

795
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:19,637
- You could be replaced.- You sound pretty mad about it.

796
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:24,046
Okay, Hugh.Let's knock it off, huh?

797
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,610
Hey, look.I'm picking up your phrases.

798
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:30,019
The other day in Philadelphiawhen I was singing...

799
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:32,114
you know,I don't appreciate that at all.

800
01:00:32,192 --> 01:00:34,855
- Oh, yeah.- I'm getting ready to sing the song.

801
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,863
In the middle of the song...

802
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:40,492
for what reason I don't knowwhy you did it, you decided to change it.

803
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,536
This don't make sense.Does that make any kind of sense?

804
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:46,472
No, I don't think it's fair to...

805
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,637
- sort of as a last minute sort of thing.- Another little bright idea of his.

806
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,976
Without interfering with you...

807
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,677
I think what you feel moreis my attitude towards life.

808
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:59,186
Maybe that bugs you, but don't hold itagainst me. That's the way I am, see.

809
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,190
How much longer youplanning on us staying here?

810
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,922
- I don't know. What time is it now?- Five after 5:00.

811
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,500
- Here are your keys.- Where the hell have you been?

812
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:13,058
- What the hell do you care?- What do you mean, "What do I care"?

813
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,069
- There are your keys. Where's Lelia?- She's out.

814
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,333
Don't mess with me.I'm splitting. There are your keys.

815
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,241
- I want to talk to you.- No. Get out of my way.

816
01:01:20,311 --> 01:01:22,779
- I want to talk to you!- Are you gonna stop it?

817
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,645
Take your hands off!

818
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:27,378
Look, Bennie, you're my brother.

819
01:01:27,452 --> 01:01:29,852
What do you want me to do,start the whole thing all over again?

820
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:32,446
Goddamn it, if I have to whip you,I'm gonna tell you something!

821
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:35,493
- Look, wait a minute, will you?- I'm going.

822
01:01:35,561 --> 01:01:38,189
Bennie, will you listen? I love you.What the hell am I supposed to say?

823
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:45,365
Bennie. Bennie, for God's--Take the keys, please.

824
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:48,463
- Bennie.- All right.

825
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:52,876
Are we friends?Buddies? Brothers?

826
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,982
Huh?

827
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:07,060
- Hi. All ready?- Well, hello.

828
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,497
No. Where's my flowers?

829
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:14,431
I was late, so I didn't havea chance to - I just ran right over.

830
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:17,233
Well, I just don't thinkthat's very nice of you at all.

831
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:21,107
Don't you think you should bring a ladysomething when you beg to take her out?

832
01:02:21,177 --> 01:02:23,509
I can go back and get themif you want me to.

833
01:02:23,578 --> 01:02:26,070
No, just go make yourself comfortable.There's drinks in there.

834
01:02:26,149 --> 01:02:28,674
- Go, go.- Will you be long?

835
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:30,742
I'll be as long as I am.

836
01:02:35,325 --> 01:02:37,385
- Hi, there.- Oh, hi.

837
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,622
I'm Davey. I'm taking Leliato the dance tonight.

838
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:43,565
Oh, good. Pleased to meet you.

839
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:48,162
Uh, why don't you go and have a drinkwith my brother and Rupe?

840
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,471
- Thanks.- Introduce yourself, why don't you?

841
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:55,275
Hi, fellas.

842
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:57,282
- Hi.- Hi.

843
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:00,148
- It doesn't even make sense to be singing.- I don't want to talk about -

844
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:01,880
- What?- What's up?

845
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:03,888
What's up?What do you mean, "What's up"?

846
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:06,185
- You want a drink?- I'd love one.

847
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:08,920
- Good, get one over there.- Yeah, drinks over there.

848
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:11,327
Over there, man. Drinks over there.The whole song -

849
01:03:11,397 --> 01:03:14,093
It would sound ridiculousthe other way, you know?

850
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,158
- I'd want to do it, you know -- Lelia, let's -

851
01:03:16,236 --> 01:03:18,170
I'm not ready, David.David, I'm -

852
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:20,172
Do I look ready? No.

853
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,368
Therefore, wait.Be comfortable and wait.

854
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:24,377
- Lelia, it's getting late.- Well, wait.

855
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:33,109
I'm not gonna say I'm gonna singall the things like that.

856
01:03:33,187 --> 01:03:35,917
- Were you just doing "Lucky Day"?- Yeah.

857
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,221
I know that song.I'm doing it in my nightclub act.

858
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:40,227
- Great, man. Great.- Oh, boy. That's terrific.

859
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:42,628
No, but really.I know it, and he's doing it wrong.

860
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,689
Oh, really?You want to show him how to do it?

861
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:47,759
That's wrong, man. You're dragging itthrough the middle. It's a up tune, man.

862
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,031
- It has to go and swing.- You tell him, now.

863
01:03:50,105 --> 01:03:53,598
- You know, you know.- See? Now, that's the right idea.

864
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:57,840
Oh, wow. Isn't this -

865
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:01,248
Hey, Bennie. Isn't this great?

866
01:04:03,787 --> 01:04:08,725
Hey, Bennie. Isn't he a smash?

867
01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:11,490
What do you think you're doing?What do you think you're doing here?

868
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:12,616
I was explaining that song.

869
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:14,726
I didn't ask you to interruptmy brother's business.

870
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,132
- He was singing it wrong.- He makes the money, not you.

871
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:19,260
- You don't understand.- What do you mean?

872
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:22,101
I didn't ask you to come in hereand disturb my relatives.

873
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:25,076
So please sit down and be quiet.

874
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,941
Did you hear that?Wasn't it great?

875
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:32,484
Marvelous.

876
01:04:32,552 --> 01:04:35,146
- Where is he?- Are you kidding with this guy?

877
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,891
Rupe, I feel -

878
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,691
I'm a strange one.

879
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:04,484
Would you mind shaking it up, Lelia?

880
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:07,921
I've been waiting for exactlytwo and a half hours.

881
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,518
Do you want to go out with a wreck,or would you like me to look nice?

882
01:05:13,529 --> 01:05:16,328
I want you to look good, but I want youto shake it up. Do you mind?

883
01:05:16,398 --> 01:05:18,663
You want to go to the dance with me?

884
01:05:18,734 --> 01:05:22,671
- I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to.- Then you'll wait. I'm not finished yet.

885
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:24,674
Hey, hey, what's with you two?

886
01:05:24,742 --> 01:05:27,609
Lelia, do you have totalk to him like that?

887
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:30,613
I'll talk-What do you mean,"Do I have to talk to him that way"?

888
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,774
I wouldn't blame the fellaif he got up and left.

889
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:39,322
I don't know.

890
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,382
Sure wouldn't let anybodytalk to me like that.

891
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,088
You didn't tell me you hadsuch a tough sister, man.

892
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:47,654
- Does she carry on like that all the time?- Look, I'm just happy to see her going out.

893
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:51,360
I'm done.

894
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:53,962
- How do I look?- You look nice.

895
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:56,770
- You be a good boy. Be a good boy.- Yeah, thank you.

896
01:05:56,843 --> 01:06:00,177
- I'll see you. Write to me.- I'll write, and I'll send the money.

897
01:06:00,246 --> 01:06:03,579
Come on, I'm finished.

898
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:05,584
Come on, let's go.

899
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:11,225
My coat, sir.

900
01:06:39,755 --> 01:06:42,156
Hey.

901
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:46,093
- What are you doing here?- I wanted to talk to Lelia.

902
01:06:46,163 --> 01:06:49,428
Well, you can't talk to Lelia.I don't want you in here.

903
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:51,990
- Never mind, don't even talk. Just get out.- Let me tell you -

904
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:55,164
I don't want to hear anythingyou've got to say. Will you go, please?

905
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:58,072
- I don't want to hear anything.- Please listen to me for a minute.

906
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:01,738
I don't want to listen to you.Get out of the place!

907
01:07:01,813 --> 01:07:03,804
- Hugh. Let me talk to him.- Wait a minute.

908
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:08,319
- Wait a minute. This is my problem.- This is our problem, our problem.

909
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:11,219
- Okay.- So what do you want?

910
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,315
I just want youto tell her that I'm sorry.

911
01:07:13,393 --> 01:07:16,988
- All right. He's sorry, he's sorry.- Okay. Okay.

912
01:07:17,062 --> 01:07:20,055
- Will you tell her that?- Yes, I will. Most definitely I will tell her.

913
01:07:20,132 --> 01:07:24,000
Will you tell her that I realize now...

914
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,302
- there's no difference between us.- Anything else?

915
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,969
She'll always mean a great deal to me.

916
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:33,275
- Anything else?- Just tell her that...

917
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:36,248
Tony said, "I'm sorry".

918
01:07:36,317 --> 01:07:39,343
There's no differencebetween you and Lelia.

919
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:42,988
She means a great deal to you.

920
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,260
And you're sorry.

921
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:48,987
Thank you.

922
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:19,955
You must like to fight or something, man.You keep pushing people.

923
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:24,800
- See you.- Okay.

924
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:30,335
What are you doing?

925
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:32,343
Getting ready to go to Chicago, buddy.How about you?

926
01:08:32,411 --> 01:08:34,902
Wait a minute. I'll pack,and I'll be right with you.

927
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:37,608
Okay. So you meet medown at the station.

928
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:39,617
- All right.- Twenty minutes.

929
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,054
Twenty minutes.

930
01:08:49,096 --> 01:08:52,657
- You're a very good dancer.- Sure.

931
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:56,134
- You don't believe me?- I believe you.

932
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:58,433
It's just that I knowI'm a good dancer.

933
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,704
Oh, wow. What an ego.

934
01:09:02,878 --> 01:09:06,540
- Do you come here often?- Yes.

935
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:08,639
I like this place. It swings.

936
01:09:09,818 --> 01:09:12,149
Well, maybe you cantake me here next week.

937
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,189
But I didn't ask you.

938
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:17,249
Well, if I want to go,I'm sure you'll take me.

939
01:09:17,326 --> 01:09:21,593
Now, look, Lelia, where I come from,the men do the asking.

940
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:25,531
- The girls just go yes or no.- Well.

941
01:09:25,602 --> 01:09:28,765
I guess I just don't fit intothat pattern, now, do I?

942
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:33,674
No, you don't. As a matter of fact,you're just a little too much for me.

943
01:09:33,744 --> 01:09:36,713
Well, then why don't youtake me home?

944
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:39,271
- Why did you ask me in the first place?- Now, steady, girl.

945
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,375
Do you always shout downyour boyfriends that way?

946
01:09:41,452 --> 01:09:46,322
- I never shout.- Well, it would seem that way to me.

947
01:09:47,526 --> 01:09:51,292
Look, do you always go aroundembarrassing people in front of strangers?

948
01:09:51,363 --> 01:09:53,297
I mean, laughing at themin front of your family...

949
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:56,698
keeping them waiting for hoursjust to show off how masculine you are.

950
01:09:56,769 --> 01:09:58,702
Darling, I'm not masculine.

951
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:01,934
Well, it would seem that way to me.

952
01:10:02,008 --> 01:10:04,341
Well, how do you want me to behave?

953
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:08,744
Look, just dance.And be as lovely as you look.

954
01:10:08,815 --> 01:10:14,310
Look, David, I am what I am,and nobody tells me what to do.

955
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:17,186
Look, I don't know whoyou think you're fighting.

956
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:19,418
You know, I saw the wayhe looked at you back there.

957
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:22,190
And I also saw the wayhe looked at me.

958
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:54,659
You know, despiteyour horrible exterior...

959
01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:57,699
it's you I like.

960
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:29,129
- Hey!- Come on.

961
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,568
- So you finally made it.- No sweat, man.

962
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:34,267
- Hugh, I've got some bad news.- The train move?

963
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,275
No.

964
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:39,779
No, I checked withour telephone service and...

965
01:11:39,847 --> 01:11:44,113
there's no point in us going to Cincinnatibecause the job is closed out.

966
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:46,550
- What about Chicago?- It's still there.

967
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,146
- So what happened?- Ackerman.

968
01:11:49,224 --> 01:11:51,852
Ackerman called Cincinnatiat his own expense...

969
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:55,158
and told themyou were being difficult.

970
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:57,926
- So?- So that means no Cincinnati.

971
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:03,664
That means we go to Chicago fora week's billing and come back here...

972
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:07,698
and maybe some cheap, mangyclub owner will give us a job...

973
01:12:07,777 --> 01:12:10,041
- introducing the girlie line.- Wait a minute, will you?

974
01:12:10,112 --> 01:12:13,310
Or maybe you can singto a room full of drunks.

975
01:12:13,382 --> 01:12:16,045
Look, we've been in this businessfor a long time.

976
01:12:16,118 --> 01:12:20,113
I'm supposed to be a manager.You're supposed to be a singer. Right?

977
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:24,923
Now who have I ever managedbesides you? And what have you ever done?

978
01:12:24,995 --> 01:12:27,430
- Rupe, wait a minute.- The bestjob I've been able to get you...

979
01:12:27,497 --> 01:12:31,764
is in the Black Rosein Tucson, Arizona.

980
01:12:31,835 --> 01:12:34,464
Rupe, wait a minute, baby. Wait.

981
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:38,374
No, no, I've had itwith this rat race. I've had it.

982
01:12:38,444 --> 01:12:40,502
I'm busted. I'm busted.

983
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:44,174
I've been insulted by these pigs,laughed at.

984
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:48,276
And what's in it for you or for me?Look, if we've got to be failures...

985
01:12:48,354 --> 01:12:52,189
let's do so in our own cityor get the hell out ofhere.

986
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:55,284
- Out of where, man?- Here, the States.

987
01:12:55,362 --> 01:12:59,298
We'll go to Paris, France, Africa.I don't care.

988
01:12:59,366 --> 01:13:01,834
It's going to be the sameno matter where we go.

989
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:06,532
- Look, I have had it.- Rupert, wait a minute.

990
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:10,475
Do you believe in me?Rupert, do you believe in me?

991
01:13:10,544 --> 01:13:12,478
I don't mean whatthose other people think of me.

992
01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:17,211
I mean what we give each other.You know, what comes out of both of us.

993
01:13:17,284 --> 01:13:19,617
Your talent, my voice.

994
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:22,419
Man, when you're on time,you're still not on time.

995
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:25,791
Rupe, do you believe this?Because, Rupert...

996
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:29,297
I believe that you'rethe greatest manager in the world.

997
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:31,492

00:0-2:0-144,00-144420 --> 00:0-2:0-140,00-140962
the Japanese Militarists had occupied N.E. China

5
00:0-2:0-140,00-140883 --> 00:0-2:0-138,00-138585
& established the puppet state Manchoukou

00:0-2:0-137,00-137747 --> 00:0-2:0-134,00-134778
ln order to expand their Greater East Asia Empire

7
00:0-2:0-134,00-134710 --> 00:0-2:0-133,00-133243
the Japanese did a lot of preparatory work.

8
00:0-2:0-132,00-132742 --> 00:0-2:0-130,00-130308
Some of the least known work

9
00:0-2:0-129,00-129739 --> 00:0-2:0-127,00-127771
were the experiments on bacterial weapons.

10
00:0-2:0-126,00-126736 --> 00:0-2:0-124,00-124268
by the Manchu 731 Squadron

11
00:0-2:0-121,00-121230 --> 00:0-1:0-118,00-118762
This Squadron 731 had many Sub-Sections

12
00:0-1:0-116,00-116726 --> 00:0-1:0-112,00-112767
They were: Helier,

13
00:0-1:0-112,00-112555 --> 00:0-1:0-109,00-109757
Sun Wu,

14

Mu Dan Jiang,

16
00:0-1:0-104,00-104213 --> 00:0-1:0-102,00-102245
and An Da Rural Experimental Station.

17
00:0-1:0-99,00-99709 --> 00:0-1:0-97,00-97241
The main offices of 731

18
00:0-1:0-97,00-97039 --> 00:0-1:0-94,00-94411
were situated in a residential district of Harbin

19
00:0-1:0-93,00-93703 --> 00:0-1:0-91,00-91303
They covered a large area of land

20
00:0-1:0-90,00-90700 --> 00:0-1:0-88,00-88732
The headquarters were highly classified,

21
00:0-1:0-86,00-86696 --> 00:0-1:0-83,00-83727
and surrounded by a high tension electric fence.

22
00:0-1:0-83,00-83192 --> 00:0-1:0-81,00-81224
lnside there were extensive facilities,

23
00:0-1:0-80,00-80690 --> 00:0-1:0-78,00-78722
there was an animal farm,

24
00:0-1:0-78,00-78187 --> 00:0-1:0-76,00-76219
a crematorium,

25
00:0-1:0-75,00-75685 --> 00:0-1:0-73,00-73717
a pathology laboratory, a jail,

26
00:0-1:0-73,00-73182 --> 00:0-1:0-71,00-71214
an electricity generating plant,

27
00:0-1:0-71,00-71113 --> 00:0-1:0-69,00-69714
the commanders� quarters,

28
00:0-1:0-69,00-69178 --> 00:0-1:0-67,00-67210
& other sections for various experimental projects.

29
00:0-1:0-66,00-66676 --> 00:0-1:0-64,00-64708
By February 1945

30
00:0-1:0-64,00-64173 --> 00:0-1:0-62,00-62205
the Japanese forces were suffering losses on the battle front

31
00:0-1:0-61,00-61170 --> 00:00:0-59,00-59202
to win the war by biological warfare

32
00:00:0-58,00-58668 --> 00:00:0-55,00-55699
the Military Headquarters reinstated a Lt. General to be theSquadron commander.

33
00:00:0-54,00-54664 --> 00:00:0-52,00-52696
Yet this person had previously been relieved off this postbecause of corruption.

34
00:00:0-52,00-52161 --> 00:00:0-48,00-48703
This man, the inventor of the lshit Water Purifier

35
00:00:0-48,00-48157 --> 00:00:0-45,00-45689
a military medical doctor, Lt. lshii Shiro.

36
00:00:0-45,00-45154 --> 00:00:0-42,00-42686
A group of young soldiers were sent to Harbin toprovide new blood for this squadron.

37
00:00:0-42,00-42151 --> 00:00:0-39,00-39182
The banks of Song Hua River,

38
00:00:0-30,00-30640 --> 00:00:0-27,00-27671
When will they come to pick us up?

39
00:00:0-27,00-27136 --> 00:00:0-25,00-25669
Captain Takehara's gone to Bai Hua Liao

40
00:00:0-25,00-25468 --> 00:00:0-23,00-23671
to find our new sergeant.

41
00:00:0-23,00-23132 --> 00:00:0-21,00-21665
He's been gone for almost an hour.

42
00:00:0-21,00-21297 --> 00:00:0-19,00-19170
Why aren't we allowed to go to Bai Hua Liao?

43
00:00:0-18,00-18628 --> 00:00:0-16,00-16660
This place is freezing cold

44
00:00:0-16,00-16125 --> 00:00:0-14,00-14157
Yes, it's similar to Chiba Prefecture

45
00:00:0-13,00-13623 --> 00:00:0-11,00-11655
l think it's much colder here

46
00:00:0-11,00-11120 --> 00:00:0-9,00-9152
lshikawa, don't you think so?

47
00:00:0-8,00-8618 --> 00:00:0-6,00-6650
lt makes no difference,

48
00:00:0-6,00-6115 --> 00:00:0-4,00-4147
we aren't going home anyway.

49
00:00:0-3,00-3613 --> 00:00:0-2,00-2646
Look!

50
00:00:0-2,00-2111 --> 00:00:00,858
lshikawa already misses home after leavingMom for a few days.

51
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:03,360
He is just a Momma's boy,

52
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:06,363
he even broke down & cried when hismom saw him off.

53
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,366
But you cried too!

54
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,869
No. l didn't!

55
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:12,869
But my mom & sister did.

56
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,871
Yes my mom cried too.

57
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:16,873
l didn't cry.

58
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:17,908
but l felt really bad.

59
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:20,377
My father was killed fighting in China.

60
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:21,545
So was mine!

61
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,373
So were my father and my elder brother,

62
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,880
they died fighting in China.

63
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,948
This kind of food is even hard to get back homein our Japan.

64
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:33,950
Did you know that?

65
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,454
Drag him out!

66
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:43,450
Yeah! Stuff it in!

67
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,557
The original building housing

68
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,553
the Manchu 731 Squadron.

69
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,590
General,

70
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,592
Doctor lshii's arrived at the H.Q.,

71
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:56,589
would you...

72
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,592
Yeah, l'm coming.

73
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,606
lshikawa,

74
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,608
Catch the ball!

75
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,611
Dr. lshii!

76
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:20,606
General Kikuchi.

77
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,624
You still look like the same great lshii.

78
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,627
Squadron 731's lshii.

79
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:40,297
Welcome back, lshii!

80
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,645
Lt. General lshii's returned to the corps!

81
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,656
ldiots! Listen!

82
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,659
l'm the new Section Head, Captain Kawasaki.

83
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,162
From now on you are in the Kwangtung Army,

84
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:08,665
members of the 731 Squadron Youth Corps!

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,668
lf you get the chance to go to Harbin,

86
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,671
weather you leave or your day off,

87
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,669
you must change into civilian clothes before leaving,

88
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,669
& when you return,

89
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,672
put your uniforms back on at Bai Hua Liao.

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,677
lf you run into any other Japanese

91
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:26,679
or if you are stopped by a patrol,

92
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,679
you will not reveal your secondment to this squadron.

93
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,688
ls that clear?

94
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:33,690
Yes, Sir!

95
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:46,692
Crematorium

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,729
lt's almost three years since 1942

97
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,732
A toast to you and your brothers reunion.

98
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,736
Cheers!

99
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,740
Thank you, Sir.

100
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,746
Now, Gentleman,

101
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:33,743
l've not been here for the last couple of years

102
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,749
but l know all about what has been going on here.

103
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,756
l've looked into the research done by Mr. Kitano

104
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,259
and l think it has been handled wrongly.

105
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,761
What we need most now

106
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:48,754
is to increase the production & the numberof bacteria.

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,268
We must use bacterial weapons in the war

108
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,769
to speed our victory.

109
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,772
A toast to victory!

110
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:56,769
To the empire!

111
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:57,770
To victory

112
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,272
And to Mr. lshii for leading 731!

113
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,275
Cheers!, Cheers!

114
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:01,778
Sir!

115
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,281
Lt. General sir.

116
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,775
Lt. Onoe Shunji reporting for duty from theKwangtung Army Commanders� office.

117
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,288
Lt. General?

118
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:14,791
l should have been a full general!

119
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,293
l don't understand

120
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,797
Why those idiots at the Central Planning Office declinethat army doctors can go no higher than Lt. General.

121
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,299
lt's ridiculous!

122
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,794
Lt. Onoe!

123
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,799
l've just made a criticism against theCentral Planning Office

124
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,809
would you inform on me?

125
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:41,318
Stop!

126
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,487
Have you no respect for your seniors?

127
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,839
Forget it, let�s go back!

128
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:04,841
We'll be in trouble if we are discovered.

129
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,343
No!

130
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,845
My brother gave me that ball when l left Japan.

131
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,923
Get up! out of your beds!

132
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,096
Where's Hoshino and lshikawa?

133
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:34,264
l don't know.

134
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:35,432
l don't either.

135
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,934
Ono... where's he gone to?

136
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:40,934
l don't know!

137
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,967
Animal Breeding Unit

138
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,107
Hoshino!

139
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,110
Don't run!

140
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,119
Hoshino!

141
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,129
Stop running! Hoshino...

142
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,155
That was totally undisciplined

143
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,158
that must never be repeated.

144
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,160
The training of the Youth Corps is important.

145
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,663
lt's not only because we are short of staff

146
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,166
it's also because what we require here

147
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,669
are people of the highest integrity.

148
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,670
Headquarters only recognizes the importance

149
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,173
of bacterial weapons in this war.

150
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,176
The fail to realize that biological & chemical weapons

151
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:43,179
will greatly affect the future of Japan.

152
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:45,682
They will play a very important role.

153
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,184
So we must work doubly hard on these experiments.

154
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,181
Yes, sir!

155
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,181
That was really unexpected.

156
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,191
We have to step up security and discipline.

157
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:58,194
lt's late. l'd better leave you two to talk!

158
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,702
Brother, please sit down!

159
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,213
Shiro,

160
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:21,217
what's happening back in Chiba Prefecture?

161
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,723
There's shortage of everything

162
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,226
but people are managing

163
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,729
People have suffered a lot these past few years.

164
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,231
We can only do our best, brother

165
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,734
How are things here?

166
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,236
What about the men's morale?

167
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,231
Not too bad,

168
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,236
things are all right.

169
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,409
Also we confirmed that the incident

170
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,237
which got you relieved

171
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,242
was due to an informer.

172
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,582
lt was Lt. Colonel Nakatome who reported you

173
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,751
He even ridiculed the effectiveness of yourwater purifier.

174
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,255
Nakatome! Goddamn him!

175
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,273
Attention

176
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,268
Nakatome! Lt. Colonel Nakatomepresent!

177
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,308
Lt. General lshii wants you!

178
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,402
Kawasaki, any absentees?

179
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,406
Unfortunately

180
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:31,741
we had an accident just now.

181
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,416
l want you to treat those kids from Chiba gently.

182
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,578
They are important to us

183
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,422
Thank you!

184
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,430
Damn you!

185
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,433
Hashino brought about his own death

186
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,436
and you are acting like a bunch of school girls.

187
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,439
What kind of soldiers are you?

188
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,942
How can you gain honor for Chiba like this?

189
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,444
Soldiers shouldn't act like this!

190
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,946
Quick, close ranks!

191
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,452
Everybody down, prone position, crawl!

192
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,022
Assholes, quick!

193
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,537
Stand up!

194
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,540
Attention!

195
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,572
l heard that the fighting is very heavyon the southern front,

196
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:26,082
our whole army could possibly be wiped out!

197
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,587
lt sounds serious.

198
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,589
We have to push our people

199
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:35,584
to speed up the experiments on the marut

200
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,586
These biological weapons

201
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,588
are the only way to turn the war in our favor.

202
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,590
What did they say?

203
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,766
lt sounded like little Japan is finished!

204
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,601
Let�s go!

205
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:54,610
Wait!

206
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,615
Sir, please!

207
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,619
Give me back my baby!

208
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,630
My baby, my baby... please give her back to me!

209
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,661
Sir, didn't General lshii tell us that

210
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:48,164
we are supposed to conservatively use the "marut"?

211
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,666
This one can be stuffed and mounted, itwon't be wasted.

212
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:55,664
February 29, 1945

213
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,007
Victim: Zhao Qing, Han Chinese, 3 month old

214
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh water!

215
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,705
Water's coming out!

216
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:46,722
lt's really tough.

217
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:49,225
Thank god the money is All right.

218
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,226
also l can study.

219
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,729
do you send money home?

220
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:55,231
No.

221
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,733
Come on, you spend it all every month!

222
00:22:58,268 --> 00:23:00,236
No, mom said l must have it for the war efforts.

223
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,738
This is a nice place!

224
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,741
it's similar to Chiba Prefecture.

225
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:07,743
Chiba is not that cold

226
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,246
this is like a hospital.

227
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,748
l say it's not

228
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:15,251
We only have dead bodies here

229
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,753
hospitals should have patients

230
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:19,755
this is more like a medical school

231
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,258
Anyway this is fine by me

232
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,259
l eat well and l can make money

233
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,762
The only thing is this fat Captain

234
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:29,265
Look, isn't that Hoshino's ball?

235
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,768
Get it back!

236
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,272
Come on, let�s get it back!

237
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,776
Let's get it back!

238
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:00,789
Stop!

239
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,799
There's nowhere to run!

240
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,797
Give the ball back to us!

241
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,810
This is not Hoshino's ball!

242
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,814
Who are you? What are you doing here?

243
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:25,321
He is a mute!

244
00:25:12,402 --> 00:25:14,370
Hold on a minute!

245
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,875
What is wrong with him?

246
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,378
He's been here for over a month,

247
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,880
but he's still not adjusted to this place yet.

248
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,875
He vomits every time he goes to work.

249
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,875
When it happens

250
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:29,885
we have to let him take a break

251
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,547
it will take him a while to get used to it!

252
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,891
That's O.K., he'll soon get used to it!

253
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:37,893
His job is important!

254
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:40,896
we rely on the colors to determine the resultsof the experiments

255
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:43,232
we can't depend totally on black and white pictures.

256
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,901
Look after him, see that he works well!

257
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:47,903
Sir!

258
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,910
Lt. Col. Nakatome Jiro

259
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,906
l've been transferred to the southern front by orderof the Kwangtung Army Commander

260
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:00,241
l'd like to say goodbye sir.

261
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,918
Congratulations,

262
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,921
the situation in the south is serious,

263
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:09,091
a patriotic soldier like you

264
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,260
should be able to achieve a lot here

265
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,596
especially as you have a close relationship withthe planning office

266
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:14,930
you can do a lot for the war effort!

267
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:16,932
Yes, Sir!

268
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,943
This must be your arrangement.

269
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:37,953
This marut

270
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:39,955
has been injected with plague three times.

271
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:41,950
But no symptoms have appeared.

272
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,952
So now let�s conduct live dissection on him,& see what's so special about him.

273
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:44,952
Good!

274
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,963
The correct data,

275
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,959
relies on continuous tests on experimental subjects

276
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:52,961
so these maruts,

277
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,304
not only have to be alive,

278
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,973
but they also have to be fit and healthy.

279
00:26:58,341 --> 00:26:59,968
experiments on such live subjects

280
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:01,970
is a rare opportunity.

281
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:13,989
What is this?

282
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:15,984
lt's a man!

283
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:23,999
What is this?

284
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:25,501
He's a Chinese man.

285
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:37,680
What is this?

286
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,015
He is a bad Chinese man!

287
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,022
This is a marut.

288
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,358
lt is a log for the fire or making coffins,

289
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:51,694
it is material for experiment.

290
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,028
lt is called a "Marut"

291
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:55,023
What is this?

292
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,032
This is a marut.

293
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,034
What is this?

294
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,036
A Marut!

295
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,039
What is this?

296
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,041
A Marut!

297
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,047
What is this?

298
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:18,043
A Marut!

299
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:32,059
Beat him!

300
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:37,072
We must try to get evidence

301
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,575
& get it out of here

302
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,576
so the outside world knows what's going on in here.

303
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,703
lt's the only thing we can do!

304
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:02,097
Look, why go through all that trouble?

305
00:29:02,632 --> 00:29:04,099
say we have no chance of getting out here!

306
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:08,103
You chicken! You have no back-bone!

307
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,439
and you... learn to be a man. Don't copy him.

308
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,108
You don't act like a Chinese!

309
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,116
Beyond Practice Ground

310
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,126
Order arms!

311
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,635
At ease!

312
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,140
The lessons on experiments will start tomorrow,

313
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,643
so work hard men, & learn well,

314
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:49,144
is that clear?

315
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:50,141
Yes, sir!

316
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,158
Sir, please!

317
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:05,153
let her carry it away

318
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,162
it�s her baby!

319
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:17,169
Let's go!

320
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,177
Please, Sir!

321
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,186
Bacterial Extermination Room

322
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,702
Quickly change your clothes!

323
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:49,204
Hurry up!

324
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,716
Let's go!

325
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:10,225
March 9, 1945

326
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:13,221
Outdoor Frostbite Experimental Station

327
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:16,224
Victim: Zhao Hui Xiu, Han Chinese, 24 years old

328
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,368
Bacteria Breeding Room

329
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,371
Look, this is the "gene" production room.

330
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,378
This is the high temperature bacteriaexterminating room.

331
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,406
Look this way please,

332
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:14,409
this is the bacteria transplants,

333
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:16,912
you must study hard and learn all this assoon as possible.

334
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,247
Yes, Sir!

335
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,415
Frostbite Experimental Room

336
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,428
This is the cold treatment station

337
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,434
At -35�C for 10 hours Cold Treatment

338
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,937
Water temperature 15�C.

339
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,475
March 9, 1945

340
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:22,811
Victim: Jin Yuan Long, Manchurian, 31years old

341
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,489
What you are looking at now,

342
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:36,825
is a quick freezing station, it is -196�C.

343
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,519
Finish chewing your apple,

344
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:06,514
& spit it out like l do.

345
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,524
Don't swallow it.

346
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:11,860
This way you can

347
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:13,525
collect the germs from the mouth.

348
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:14,521
Yes, Sir!

349
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:23,537
Go back and tell your captain,

350
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,874
that you�ll be my guests this Sunday,

351
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:27,539
we'll have drinks together.

352
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:29,044
Yes Sir!

353
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,048
And you�ll come too, O.K.?

354
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,551
O.K.

355
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,555
Thank you!

356
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,567
This is a question of humanity.

357
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:53,902
No!

358
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,572
This concerns the rise or fall of theGreat Japanese Empire.

359
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,908
Listen lshikawa, they are human beings too,

360
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,244
they have parents just like you!

361
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,579
What are you talking about?

362
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:07,575
Give me better justification than that!

363
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,917
Today is Sunday

364
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,086
let�s not talk about business,

365
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,254
come on lets eat up.

366
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,589
This fruit is specially brought over from Japan.

367
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:15,924
Help yourselves.

368
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,593
Let me, you must look after your health.

369
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,601
Take Mrs. Takamura for example,

370
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:28,937
what's the difference between the children she bore

371
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,273
& the maruts?

372
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,608
What are you talking about?

373
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:35,944
That's not right!

374
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:38,280
You can not compare the maruts to the Japanese,

375
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,615
you & l speak a different language.

376
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,610
Please don't say anymore

377
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:45,620
l'm sorry, please excuse me.

378
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,629
lshikawa, wait!

379
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,720
lshikawa, lshikawa!

380
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,728
Kawasaki pushed him... from upstairs!

381
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:36,064
He's badly hurt,

382
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:38,400
let�s think of a way to teach Kawasaki a lesson.

383
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,735
l hope you'll work well together.

384
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,238
To be a member of the 731 Youth Corps

385
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,739
we should...

386
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:47,075
obey the regulations.

387
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,411
l think you'd better forget about it.

388
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:50,745
Don't pretend now,

389
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:52,740
you have no guts.

390
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:01,756
Coward. Stop pretending!

391
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:31,385
April 11, 1945

392
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,828
Those goddamned Japs...

393
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:16,164
What the hell are they up to?

394
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:17,499
Hey Specs!

395
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,834
What do you think the Japs will do to us?

396
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:37,852
What did they inject into us this morning?

397
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,188
l have no reaction at all!

398
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:42,857
l have no idea what it was.

399
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:47,862
Why didn't those people get it too?

400
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:11,886
Be careful of contamination!

401
00:42:12,254 --> 00:42:14,222
the last accident cost Sakagami & Ohtani their lives,

402
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:16,891
so be careful everyone.

403
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:37,912
Sir, according to the previous test results,

404
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,248
it would be a rather difficult job to produce aBlack Death Virus

405
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:41,913
that is 60times stronger.

406
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,924
Now this is the 7th experiment,

407
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,427
here is the record for the last few tests!

408
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,930
Sir, l've heard the Germans are using the Jewsto perform similar kinds of tests

409
00:42:56,298 --> 00:42:58,266
and they�ve achieved good results,

410
00:42:58,634 --> 00:43:00,602
so can't we...

411
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,940
Dr. lshii did 2years research on this in Europebefore the war.

412
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:09,277
According to him, the German researches into thatarea are fare behind ours.

413
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,614
Compared to this, their equipment & facilities arefare behind ours

414
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:18,942
What they achieved so far may not be ofany use for us.

415
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:21,956
Don't be discouraged, keep up the good work,

416
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:25,293
report to me at once when the experimentsare completed.

417
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:30,965
Yes sir, l heard that Lt. Colonel Nakatomedied in action on the southern front, is that right?

418
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,975
Dr. lshii may have been too...

419
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:47,982
We'd better keep out of that,

420
00:43:48,517 --> 00:43:50,485
You'd better concentrate on your own career.

421
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,988
The Empire Medical Department is waitingfor your return.

422
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:57,492
The medical future of Japan relies on you people.

423
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,002
Early summer 1945

424
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:11,005
Japanese were retreating from the Pacific Front

425
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:14,001
They also suffered many losses in China.

426
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:18,001
The moral of the Japanese troops was very bad.

427
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,009
All of Japan had been mobilized,

428
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:26,009
there were still great shortages of everything.

429
00:44:26,388 --> 00:44:29,016
A large deficit of manpower for the Japanese

430
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:32,026
military resulted in more adolescents joining

431
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:35,025
the forces. The cloud of defeat loomed larger

432
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:38,025
ln other words, the success or failure of 731

433
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,028
decides the survival of the Empire.

434
00:44:41,403 --> 00:44:43,371
So today...

435
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,038
we should have no more illusions about theKwangtung Army,

436
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:50,044
the Kwangtung Army relies on our bacterial war,

437
00:44:50,412 --> 00:44:53,040
there is no other way of winning it.

438
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:56,384
l've always thought that biological weaponsare more effective than bombers and guns

439
00:44:56,752 --> 00:44:59,050
Right now we must regroup our forces,

440
00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:02,049
& mobilize them.

441
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:05,052
l entreat you to work doubly hard

442
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:08,062
We must get ourselves well preparedfor the coming bacterial war.

443
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:12,066
Gentleman, do you have any questions?

444
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:19,063
Please, go ahead!

445
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:23,077
We have already successfully produced

446
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:25,413
a large quantity of virus which is 60times strongerthan the Black Death Virus.

447
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,082
The amount of culture we have,

448
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:31,085
according to our calculations,

449
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:34,081
has enough power to wipe out thewhole mankind.

450
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:37,091
At the same time

451
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:39,761
we have increased the number

452
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:42,096
of bacteria carrying rats to three million,

453
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:44,766
& jumping fleas to 300 kilos.

454
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:48,102
The number is estimated at 10 billion,

455
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:51,105
if this 10 billion bacteria carrying fleas

456
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:53,100
were all released, then it's not hard to imagine

457
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:57,111
the situation on the war front would changedrastically,

458
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,114
we would gain the final victory!

459
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,113
Because of the bacterial weapons

460
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:04,786
the fate of the Great Japanese Empire

461
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,121
lies in our hands.

462
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:09,116
Still after numerous experiments

463
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:11,459
the metal shell casings holding the bacteria

464
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,127
get very hot during firing.

465
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:14,462
And a majority of the infected fleas insideget killed

466
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:16,631
so these bacterial bombs have failed to producethe expected results.

467
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,132
Weapons Production Department...

468
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,136
Anything else?

469
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,140
Sir, there's been a strong reaction to the incident

470
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,476
when Kawasaki assaulted the Youth Corps member

471
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,145
and it's getting to be quite serious.

472
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:34,145
There's a lot of tension & unrest amongst the Corps.

473
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,151
Transfer Kawasaki from the Youth Corps.

474
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,146
Onoe you'll replace him.

475
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,155
Yes, Sir!

476
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,158
Sukizan Geisha House

477
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:49,163
Sorry to disturb you,

478
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:07,181
General, it seems your sword's not rusted yet!

479
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,188
Get out both of you!

480
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:17,191
Yes, Sir!

481
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:20,597
Whoever... was hit or touched by the chess pieces,raise your hands.

482
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,621
Gentlemen.

483
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,625
This is... my new invention.

484
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,628
This... is called Low Temperature Pottery...

485
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,623
Bacterial Bomb!

486
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,667
The Great Japan will not be defeated!

487
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,677
Careful! Don't break the pottery bomb!

488
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,710
May 22, 1945

489
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:05,712
An Da Rural Experimental Station

490
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,709
Victims: Names unknown, 29 males and females

491
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,722
Hurry up lshikawa!

Victim: Qu Hua, Han Chinese, 34 years old

495
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:42,869
not a female "maruta"

496
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,866
Kawasaki, l want you to bring me a healthyyoung man.

497
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,873
What's the use of a healthy young man?

498
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,872
lt's of no use for you,

499
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,874
but it's of great use for us.

500
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,049
Please help us get one!

501
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,550
Kawasaki,

502
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,886
if you can help us find a healthy young man,

503
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,222
then i'll buy you a drink.

504
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,886
Right, we'll all buy you a drink.

505
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:05,892
Kawasaki's good at that.

506
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,229
l'm sorry, l can't help you with that.

507
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,397
Kawasaki's only good at finding girls!

508
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:13,400
That's nonsense!

509
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,905
Come on Kawasaki!

510
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,241
Do something for us.

511
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,905
We'll reward you. Please!

512
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,912
O.K., l'll try.

513
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,915
June 12, 1945

514
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,251

Victim: Natashalvanova, White Russia, 35 years old

516
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,930
You can do what ever you want with me!

517
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,266
Let my daughter go, please!

518
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,935
Please, l beg you, let her go!

519
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:56,943
Please!

520
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,065
You've been here a while, are you used to it?

521
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,066
Yes, sir, l am!

522
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,072
Do you still see that Chinese mute?

523
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,408
Not very often, sir!

524
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,743
Do you think you can find him for me?

525
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,078
What for, sir?

526
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,108
Sir, l've brought you the mute.

527
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,111
Thank you, well done.

528
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,115
Don't be afraid!

529
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,132
Let him in.

530
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:12,128
Come here, come inside.

531
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,144
You wait here,

532
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,480
When the surgery is finished,

533
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,815
you can take him away.

534
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,151
Surgery? What surgery?

535
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,146
No questions!

536
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,322
Keep your nose out of these things.

537
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,181
Come here!

538
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,184
Go on!

539
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,200
Come here!

540
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,386
Where are you going?

541
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,384
Surgery is finished! Take him away! Quickly!

542
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,556
Yes sir!

543
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,396
Are you satisfied now?

544
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,392
Each of you got what you wanted... the heart...

545
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,396
the liver,

546
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,397
and the brain.

547
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,400
these organs from a living healthy young manin puberty,

548
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,403
are difficult to come by!

549
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,410
We should thank Kawasaki.

550
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,416
Don't mention it!

551
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,918
We'll invite you to dinner this evening.

552
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,920
Thank you! Thank you!

553
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,424
What's wrong with you? Quickly push the cart away!

554
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,423
Yes, sir!

555
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,929
July 2, 1945

556
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,432
Victim: A mute, name unknown, Han Chinese

557
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,436
Tunnel connecting Pathology Lab to Crematorium

558
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,509
Makimura, draw the curtains.

559
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,516
That fat ass is a barbarian.

560
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,519
Come here, that mute was not a marut

561
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,518
That animal has gone too far!

562
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,523
Yeah, l have always detested him.

563
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,696
Let's find a way to fix him!

564
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:45,031
What do you think?

565
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:51,527
l want to kill him. lf there's a problem, l takeresponsibility!

566
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,542
No, we are all in this together!

567
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,558
Hurry up!

568
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,563
Ready for disinfection?

569
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,088
What are you doing here? Get back!

570
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,746
A smart rat can beat a cat.

571
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,748
Fleas & germs can defeat bombers and guns too!

572
01:09:23,283 --> 01:09:25,751
This is... my theory behind 731 Squadron.

573
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:28,254
lt's also my philosophy.

574
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,757
For Victory,

575
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:33,259
we shall groom the strongest and nurture them,

576
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,261
the same applies for the Youth Corps.

577
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,263
Understand?

578
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,772
Stone, stone!

579
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,782
Stone, wait!

580
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,787
You must get out of here alive!

581
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:03,289
No matter what happens,

582
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,792
we must get the evidence out!

583
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:07,794
Stone, quick!

584
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:09,796
Release him!

585
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,797
Get in the hole you bastard!

586
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,134
Stone won't follow a coward like you...

587
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:15,801
Stone won't go into anything blindly with you

588
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,797
The door is open!

589
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,812
Stone!

590
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,820
Fire!

591
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:37,323
Charge, charge!

592
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,827
Stone, watch where you are going!

593
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:41,995
Fire!

594
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,823
Get down quick!

595
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:08,854
ldiots!

596
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:11,357
So many maruts are dead,

597
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,856
this is a serious matter.

598
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,858
Do you realize your job

599
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:18,031
is to keep them in good shape,

600
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,859
so they can live longer

601
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,861
But you neglected your duties,

602
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,863
with very serious consequences.

603
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,038
Your error is intolerable

604
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,866
& unforgivable!

605
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,869
Maruts are precious experimental material.

606
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:33,213
they mean more to us than ever...

607
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,878
You have no right to kill them.

608
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,887
The Russo-Japanese war is coming,

609
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,223
but many of our experiments

610
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,888
have not been completed yet.

611
01:11:46,426 --> 01:11:48,394
The 731 Squadron is our nation's hope,

612
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,898
we hold the power to turn the war in our favourand save Japan.

613
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:54,901
Get up now!

614
01:11:55,435 --> 01:11:57,403
l hope you won�t forget,

615
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,906
that l was the one who brought you here from Chiba.

616
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,912
Takamura at An Da Rural Station

617
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:08,914
is preparing for the final pottery shell tests.

618
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,919
Have the Maruts gone yet?

619
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,923
They left early this morning, sir!

620
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,946
Specs said,

621
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,448
that what you did was stupid.

622
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:45,952
We can't get out of here anyway.

623
01:12:46,486 --> 01:12:48,954
The more we resist, the faster we get killed.

624
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,959
He said the only thing we can do is to try &

625
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,295
get the evidence out.

626
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,960
So the world will know about this hell hole.

627
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,960
Dr. lshii, we're running out of time,

628
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,303
The situation at the front is very bad.

629
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:06,973
Looks like this is the final straw for us.

630
01:13:07,507 --> 01:13:08,474
The trip to Feng Tiang

631
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,977
is very important, don't worry about things here.

632
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,986
Thank you, l rely on you.

633
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:28,995
Report, sir!

634
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:31,497
lnform the air corps to take off now!

635
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,000
Preparations are complete at the shell test site.

636
01:13:34,534 --> 01:13:36,502
Come in... we haven't contacted them yet.

637
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,004
Right...

638
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:40,506
Let's go to the upper.

639
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:43,009
Fire the signal!

640
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:47,013
Let's move!

641
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,026
We need the Maruts urgently.

642
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:06,532
Are they on their way or not!

643
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,034
Reporting, Sir!

644
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:14,040
Excuse me sir, urgent telegram.

645
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,043
You may go.

646
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:31,057
August 9th, Nagasaki was bombed.

647
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,559
The Russians have officially declared war.

648
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,062
Manchuria 731 Sqdn. retreat if necessary.

649
01:14:36,596 --> 01:14:39,064
Go to Feng Tian and get the commander here!

650
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,068
Stop the delivery of Maruts.

651
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:50,065
Hello!

652
01:14:53,613 --> 01:14:56,081
Hello Airport!

653
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,089
Sir, the Maruts have escaped.

654
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:12,097
Go after them, don't let them run away!

655
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:14,600
Get in the car quick! After them!

656
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:37,111
Run, split out! Quick!

657
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:01,147
Hurry up! We must get the evidence out!

658
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:04,150
Run, quick!

659
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,242
Stone, go that way, quick!!

660
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,250
Quickly, run!

661
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:55,321
August 8, 1945

662
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,658
Proclaim Bacterial Bomb Experiment

663
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,336
Cover him!

664
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,367
Put him down here.

665
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,401
Sorry to disturb you!

666
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,407
Urgent telegram from Headquarters, sir!

667
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,415
Nagasaki was bombed.

668
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,413
The Russians have officially declared war.

669
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:34,587
The Kwangtung Army H.Q. ordered all troopsto retreat if necessary.

670
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,756
Are you coming back, sir?

671
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,430
All troops to retreat?

672
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,768
What do we do, sir?

673
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:15,461
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombedby the Americans.

674
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,797
The cities have been completely destroyed.

675
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:20,132
Now the Russians have declared war to us.

676
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,469
Our fate has been sealed.

677
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,465
We've received orders to retreat.

678
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,808
But l personally think,

679
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,473
that the work of the 731 Sqdn.

680
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,813
involves top security information.

681
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:37,483
So l'm now requesting the following:

682
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:41,487
1) Exterminate all remaining Maruts

683
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,483
& destroy this whole facility.

684
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,486
The engineers will be in charge of thatthe place must be flattened, l want no traces left.

685
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,829
2) Collect all data and documents

686
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,498
destroy them at once.

687
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,834
3) The Youth Corps is to retreat to Tung Hwa,

688
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:58,504
4) All units will commit suicide.

689
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:02,508
5) Their families and departments

690
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:06,512
will also commit suicide.

691
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:10,516
ln other words...

692
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:16,511
no evidence must be left behind!

693
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:20,526
Dr. lshii,

694
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,529
Our squadron has a lot of highly qualified people,

695
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,865
isn't it a waste do order them to die?

696
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:29,034
We shouldn't allow such meaningless sacrifices.

697
01:22:30,069 --> 01:22:31,536
l realize that too Gen. Kikuchi,

698
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,873
but we have to guard the secret of this place.

699
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:36,041
Dr. lshii, if...

700
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:40,535
you commit suicide, then l'll join you.

701
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:45,551
These soldiers & their families have followed you

702
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,547
from Japan to Manchuria.

703
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,890
You should at least,

704
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:53,559
get them back home.

705
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,562
lsn't that reasonable?

706
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,898
As the head of 731you're responsible for them.

707
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:01,567
You should be protecting them, not ordering them to die.

708
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,562
l hope you face up your responsibilities.

709
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,564
Gen. Kikuchi is right

710
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:08,574
We should return to our home land,

711
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,574
and we should take all data with us.

712
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:22,087
That might be possible,

713
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:26,592
but we must still prepare for the possibilityof being captured.

714
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,587
No matter what,

715
01:23:29,128 --> 01:23:30,595
we can't allow these secrets to be made known.

716
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,597
How about this?

717
01:23:33,132 --> 01:23:34,599
We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide,

718
01:23:35,134 --> 01:23:37,102
if anyone's captured, then they

719
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,605
commit suicide.

720
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:43,609
Well...

721
01:23:44,143 --> 01:23:45,610
that's what we'll do.

722
01:23:46,145 --> 01:23:48,113
l will personal be in charge of the retreat,

723
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,115
& arrange the transport.

724
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,618
l'm very happy you made this decision,

725
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:56,622
l'm sure everybody is grateful to you.

726
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,648
What are you doing?

727
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:26,652
These are our children's clothes!

728
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:28,653
The data is important!

729
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,666
Please take this with you, Madame!

730
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,668
You must take it if you are captured.

731
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:46,672
Mr. Takamura prepared them.

732
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:53,679
Where are you going at his time?

733
01:24:54,213 --> 01:24:56,181
l'm going to the office to get more data!

734
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,018
The war is over and we are going home!

735
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,687
Shut up! What do you know!

736
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:04,690
l don't care about anything else

737
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:08,694
all l know is that we are going home!

738
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,698
You are a woman, you know nothing!

739
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:14,700
Yes l may know nothing,

740
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,703
and l certainly don't know how to make poison!

741
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,706
How dare you to speak to me like that!

742
01:25:22,742 --> 01:25:24,710
Takamura! Takamura!

743
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,718
This is important data,

744
01:25:33,252 --> 01:25:35,755
We can not destroy it!

745
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,723
lf anyone dares to burn anymore...

746
01:25:38,257 --> 01:25:41,715
Takamura, l just want to go home!Nothing else is important!

747
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:47,733
That�s all l want, Takamura!

748
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:57,743
Burn it! Burn it all!

749
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:01,747
Takamura! This is an order, burn it all!

750
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:04,750
l don't want a single piece left.

751
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:09,755
You can't destroy the data!

752
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,091
This is the whole reason for our being here!

753
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,756
lt represents years of hard work!

754
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,099
& Japan will need it one day!

755
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,768
lf you want to destroy it kill me first!

756
01:26:56,836 --> 01:26:59,805
We're releasing the poison gas! Retreat! Hurry up!

757
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,847
Hasegawa, Miki, come quick!

758
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:44,850
Miki, go up!

759
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,888
lt's platinum, it's worth a lot of money.

760
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:58,924
This place is blowing up! Find shelter!

761
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,978
Quick, retreat!

762
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:55,980
Retreat!

763
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:18,003
Come on, let's go!

764
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:37,022
This place is blowing up. Find shelter!

765
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,049
August 15, 1945

766
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:46,091
Where are you going? Get back!

767
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,094
l'm sorry, quick!

768
01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:51,095
Don't run around!

769
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:26,240
Hold on, Madame, Hold on!

770
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:33,258
Sir, Mrs. Takamura is going into labor!

771
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:34,593
Can't she get in the car?

772
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:38,263
The car is full of Dr. lshii's personal data.

773
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:04,289
Sir, the train is leaving in 5 minutes.

774
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:08,293
Do you want a last look at the squadron?

775
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,302
All right!

776
01:36:00,379 --> 01:36:03,348
Gentlemen! This is just a change in strategy,

777
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:06,351
The Great Japanese Empire

778
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:10,355
has still not been defeated,

779
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,358
our base has been destroyed,

780
01:36:13,892 --> 01:36:15,860
but our careers will continue.

781
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:19,364
Now you�re all going back to Japan,

782
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:23,368
l trust you will safe guard the secrets of this base

783
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:26,371
and always remember this

784
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:30,375
no contact is allowed between squadron members

785
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:35,369
and under no circumstances will you reveal thenature of work here.

786
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:38,383
You are disbarred from taking up government posts.

787
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:44,378
Anyone who contravenes these conditions will beseverely punished.

788
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:10,475
Madame! Madame!

Wake up! Wake up!Sergeant, wake that man up.

00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:07,049
Constable, Liven that man upwith your truncheon.

3
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,256
Get his feet moving!

4
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,170
Remember you'reelectricity man to the whole nation.

5
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,688
Rubber? Rubber?

6
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,214
Eh?

7
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,413
Yes. Coming, coming, coming!

8
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,015
Good evening. I mean that most sincerely.

9
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,498
- I am the BBC, as you can see.- Oh!

10
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,376
And here was the last news.

11
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,649
Oh this, the third,or is it the fourth anniversary

12
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,967
of the nuclear misunderstanding

13
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:50,176
which led to the Third World War,here is then.

14
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,212
Oh, sod!

15
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:57,293

16
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,296
...of the Third World War,here is the last recorded statement

17
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,654
of the Prime Minister, as he then was,

18
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:09,049
who had justsucceeded his illustrious father info office.

19
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,058
"I feel I am not boastingwhen I remind you that this was,

20
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,893
"without a shadow of a doubt,the very shortest war in living memory.

21
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,813
"Two minutes, 28 seconds,up to and including the grave process

22
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,935
"of signing the peace treaty fully blotted.

23
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:26,292
"The great task of burying our 40 million dead

24
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,974
"was also carried outwith great expediency and good wi/.

25
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,730
"You know this greatcountry of ours

26
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,650
"often sticks in the mud of past,

27
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:38,129
"searches out and holds upto the light the mistakes of past times. "

28
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,570
That man! Damn him! Haig the Butcher.

29
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:44,494
I shall tell the world. Look at that!

30
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,771
Another chap butchered. Oh, the horror!

31
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,248
Oh, the horror! I can't look!

32
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:53,578
"We eat our hearts outwith the canker of racialism

33
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,092
"and death east of Suez.

34
00:04:55,807 --> 00:05:00,017
"But I am forced to ask,have we forgotten the bomb?"

35
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,536
The Prime Minister had, as you all know,

36
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:07,453
just returned from the 449thDisarmament Conference

37
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:12,091
and was greeted onthe steps of Number 10 by Mao Tse-tung.

38
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,454
The Chairman has invited me kindly in.

39
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,211
I can't say very much at the moment,

40
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,655
but there will be some pretty hardbargaining, you may be sure.

41
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,776
That's all.Thank you very much, gentlemen, thank you.

42
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,689
Ah, Lord Fortnum. BBC Television.

43
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,576
Off the cuff, while we'rewaiting for a statement,

44
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,411
I like your hat, I do.

45
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,091
Do you? Do you say that?

46
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,932
I tell you, it's the latest early warning hat.

47
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,089
It gives you that extra four minutes in bed.

48
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:41,057
I never were a hat in bed, I've beena Catholic person for a long time now,

49
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,607
and I wouldn't know where to begin.Is this your car, sir?

50
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,735
It is, I acquired it from Lord Snowdon.

51
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,094
- Not the Lord Snowdon?- No, a Lord Snowdon.

52
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,057
Ah, yes, the woods are full of them.Goodbye, sir.

53
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:55,972
Said that very well, didn't he?

54
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,015
The Prime Minister...

55
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:03,612
The Prime Minister is coming out.

56
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,248
- Prime Minister, can you say...- Yes, I can say.

57
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,295
I can say without any fear of contradiction,

58
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,610
after some pretty tough bargaining,I can say,

59
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:17,897
we have finally fixed the rent of Number 10at an undisclosed figure

60
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:22,171
of 100 yen pounds per week.

61
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:26,015
This lease means peace in our time.

62
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,613
That, I'm afraid, was the and of the news.

63
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:38,169
Our next scheduled programmewill be on August Bank Holiday,

64
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,456
when Charlton Heston willwrestle His Holiness the Pope

65
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,370
for the Sportsman of the Year title.

66
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:48,292
Until then, all walk backwardsinto long shot while good night is given.

67
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,535
# God save Mrs Ethel Shroake

68
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,577
# Long live Mrs Ethel Shroake

69
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,934
# God save Mrs Ethel Shroake

70
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,693
# Of 393A High Street, Leytonstone #

71
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:08,847
Good night.

72
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,976
Here! Here!

73
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:13,818
Come out of that television set.it's our tum for the telly news.

74
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:16,015
- Oh, is it?- Are you the District Visiting Announcer?

75
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,498
Yes, that's right. Have you any requests?

76
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,137
Can you do the fall of Singapore?

77
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,777
Oh, yes, certainly.

78
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:24,090
Tonight, Japanese invasion forcesreached Singapore.

79
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,328
Oh, dear!

80
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,409
- Ah!- I didn't quite catch the name.

81
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,613
Are you a doctor, Doctor?

82
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:31,338
- I advertise.- No boots. I don't wear them.

83
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,738
And I don't travel in them.

84
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:34,696
Don't be sharp with me, young man.

85
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:35,928
My card.

86
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,017
"Kennington and District Steam Laundry. "

87
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,373
Oh, I am pleased to meet you.

88
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,893
Oh, no, that's not me.I've let the space for advertising.

89
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,408
I am other side, Lord Fortnum of Alamein,

90
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,330
I acquired the title from a soldier person

91
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,932
who found himself OH hard times.

92
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:49,611
With psychiatry or army surplus?

93
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,098
I think he had to do with all of that.

94
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,295
And table lamps were negotiable.We all got one.

95
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,017
I don't require surgery.

96
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,454
I shall decide that, Lord Fortnum.

97
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,131
Now, do you wantit privately or on the National I-Health?

98
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:02,288
- Yes.- What?

99
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,574
Yes, I want it privately,on the National I-Hlealth.

100
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,255
Ah! You're home early tonight, Father.

101
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,293
- The last baron the Circle Line.- Oh!

102
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,971
I think I'll have a smoke.

103
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,811
One of these days, you'll not come back.

104
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,493
Be brought backby the health visitor, smoking.

105
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,333
You know, and yet you persist,

106
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:37,172
you know that I don't approveof you leaving the compartment.

107
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:39,773
She doesn't get enough exerciseon the whole.

108
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:42,737
After all, it's been... How long's it been?

109
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,337
It's been since... Dear?

110
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,490
That, since then. Since, well...

111
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:52,450
Still, we've managed very well.

112
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,416
I expect it's the choccy bars.

113
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,531
I like my women chubby built.

114
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,413
I think she smokesto try to keep her weight down.

115
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,614
Oh, I wish there was more peopleof her own age on the Circle Line

116
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,736
she could perhaps smoke with.

117
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,414
It'll be a damn fast habit, Mother.Oh, she's always at it.

118
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,778
Ah, well...

119
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,887
Now, look here,there's a limit to what I'll do, you know.

120
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,890
Is there?Well, let's go as far as that, then, shall we?

121
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,698
Yes. Huh! Well, it's not unpleasant

122
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,735
- when one gets used to it.- Yes.

123
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,011
Well, you know,

124
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,092
you've been a bit off colour.

125
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,096
Yes, I haveAnd what's more I'm not eating anything.

126
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,851
- Why is that?- Well, I can't get the stuff.

127
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,009
Ah, but look, I had this mounted,this very morning.

128
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,533
Eighteen carat Hovis.

129
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,377
Well, tell me about it, more.

130
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,256
Well, things were going swimminglyuntil that...

131
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:11,217
Well, until they dropped the,well now, you known.

132
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,574
- Oh, the Old...- That's the fellow.

133
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,978
Yes. Did the noise keep you awake?

134
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,574
Oh, ho, I slept through it all right.Yes. In fact, when I was in England, still abed,

135
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,769
albeit in a club chair,the Third World War took place.

136
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,970
I didn't get a chance to join the regiment.

137
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,970
Neither did I. I was standing by,

138
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,651
ready to face the enemy,whoever they might be.

139
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,775
- Mmm.- And I couldn't find them.

140
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,337
Tell me, do you know, who was the enemy?

141
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:34,456
I haven't the least Idea. I thought, Doctor,

142
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:39,010
I thought you might give me breakfastas a prescription against malnutrition.

143
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,771
Ah, yes. Well...

144
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:45,775
Take, um, 30 milligrams of egg on toast.

145
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,417
You can get it made up at any restaurant.

146
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:48,932
Oh, good! I'll have it made up in Boots.

147
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,213
It's more hygienic in bottles.

148
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,450
Yes, yes, yes, but will it cure me, huh?

149
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,814
My first impulse is to cut and run.

150
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,652
Thankful, happy in the thoughtit's no more than simple starvation,

151
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:02,448
but Doctor, I, I... I fool It is more.

152
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:06,007
Lord Fortnum,we must have a thorough look at you.

153
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,134
Uh, yes.

154
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,777
- Would you sit down again, please?- Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,770
Inside and out. Feet up, please.

156
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,974
Oh, your skin is very white.

157
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:16,253
My parents were white.

158
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:20,491
Doctor, look. Since this thing dropped,this, this rude thing, this, um...

159
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:26,570
That's the fellow.I've had terrible morbid fears.

160
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,414
I think I may tum into a bed sitting room.

161
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:37,730
Ah! Ah, that's probably atomic mutation.

162
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,536
- There's a lot of it about.- What can I take for it?

163
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,858
- Three guineas?- What?

164
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,577
Take three guineas, for your rent?

165
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:49,017
Rent! I don't want rent, I want to be cured,I demand a second opinion.

166
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,737
Yes, well, that is your privilege, of course.

167
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:54,857
But I can tell you thatthere's no evidence of dry rot or woodworm,

168
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,773
but keep well wrapped upand try and keep out of overdrafts.

169
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:08,769
She gets later and later every night,and sometimes morning.

170
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:10,656
Well, perhaps she's had more than one.

171
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:12,775
She's had time for half a dozen, if you ask me.

172
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,608
I'm going to get her.

173
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,735
Oh, Father, don"t leave me at night.

174
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,491
It is bleedin' night, isn't it?

175
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,892
God, what's this?

176
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:10,657
A likely story!

177
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Those are not my daughter's little hairs.

178
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,487
Out you come.

179
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,331
There's a simple explanation, sir.

180
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,694
Yes. And I'm going to give it to you.

181
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:36,936
Ah! What class of person are you?I am top drawer, to put it mildly.

182
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:41,968
You, I expect, are from the guttering.But I don't believe it, about my turning,

183
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,048
Ho.

184
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,737
Well, what can I say?

185
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,775
- Say?- Say sorry.

186
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,333
Sorry?

187
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,648
Sorry.

188
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,014
That's not nearly enough enough,under the circumstances.

189
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,009
Actually, sir, I'm a commuter chap.You know, backwards and forwards.

190
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,771
- That's nice.- Forwards and backwards.

191
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,372
How dare you!

192
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,417
- Does it get boring?- I-low really dare you say such things?

193
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,653
And do them!

194
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:24,133
Well, I'd be interested in joining your party,I'm sure you can use another pair of hands.

195
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,130
You keep your filthy commuter handsto yourself.

196
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,448
Down the seams of your trousers,where I can see them.

197
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,051
She'll need a nurse.

198
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,138
Mmm.

199
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,857
Right. You can get dressed.Uh, but what is it you want?

200
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,417
Want, want?

201
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,331
Do you mean to say you've been lookingat me without regard to my condition?

202
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,091
You're not well enoughto have a condition, dear.

203
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,214
Do you want a potty?

204
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:09,654
I want no such thing. I want an opinion.

205
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,815
Well, in my opinion...

206
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,658
In my opinion, you need re-pointing.

207
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,411
But that's only putting off the evil hour.

208
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:22,448
What you really need, you see,is a full-scale conversion to maisonette.

209
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,811
- it's true, then?- Oh, I expect it is.

210
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:28,016
Still, try not to worry, love. it's a simple op.

211
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,809
And the Councilwill give you a grant for your bathroom.

212
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:33,288
You don't realise, do you,I don't want a bathroom.

213
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,497
Now, if you want anything,here we are, just ring for nurse.

214
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,851
My God, I've dropped a brick!

215
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,057
Come along, Mother.

216
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,936
Must we go, Dad?

217
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,331
I felt safe in there.

218
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,254
Nothing to worry about

219
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:16,574
Where are we going?

220
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,888
I say that. I'm the leader of the new world.

221
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,696
Where we're going,up is where we're going, young man.

222
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,656
And don't you forgot it.

223
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:28,371
I say, sir, you can't do that.That's public property.

224
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,654
That's all right. I am a member of the public.

225
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,492
Public member.

226
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,610
At last! At last they've come to collect me.

227
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:46,495
- I-low long have you been...?- Three years.

228
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,807
Three years?

229
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:49,491
Collect me, collect me.

230
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,093
I've been here deadsince imminent warning red.

231
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,090
I'm afraid there's far too much to pay.

232
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,249
My friend will pay. if you can find him.

233
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,250
There are no friends left.

234
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,457
Roger, is this your trunk?

235
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,174
Me? My name's not Roger, it's Alan.

236
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,417
Roger's name is not on the lid.

237
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,137
It'll cost you 25 shillings.

238
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,011
Oh, I'm afraid I haven't any money, sir.

239
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:14,571
I shall lend you some.

240
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,808
Take something useful.

241
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,291
Help me on.

242
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,368
Oh! This is nice and warm.

243
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:37,887
Oh, dear me!

244
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,217
I'm afraid I'm three shillings short, sir,I shall have to owe it to you.

245
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,212
Come along.

246
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,177
What are you doing with that trunk?

247
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,375
What? We've got to have luggage, girl.

248
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,176
Can't be arrested as vagrants.

249
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:06,728
Go on.

250
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,889
You've got the tickets, dear.

251
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,698
I hear a rumour, sir,

252
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,213
the Pope's nowallowing contraceptives for all occasions.

253
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,090
Except during sexual intercourse.

254
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,373
You'd better get your hair cut.

255
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,138
That's enough of that talk. Keep talk out of it!

256
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,417
You all right?

257
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,454
Look here, look here.Can't you get more horsepower?

258
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,498
Keep moving. Keep moving, sir.You're safer on the move.

259
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:45,208
What?

260
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:49,688
I shan't, I shall notkeep asking you to keep moving, sir.

261
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,931
You will not? You'll do your duty, young man.I wish to speak to your superior,

262
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,817
I expect to tuminto a bed sitting room very shortly.

263
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,849
I think you'd better speak to me, sir.

264
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,658
In which particular,I shall be obliged to stop somewhere,

265
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,808
preferably a street.

266
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,968
You can't stop here, sir.

267
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,333
Oh, well, where can I stop?

268
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:08,489
You can't stop anywhere, sinas you very well know.

269
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,251
We don't want to stayin one place long enough

270
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,728
for the enemy to haveanother chance at us, do we, sir?

271
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,208
Not until our pre-emptive strike is launched,do we, sir?

272
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,694
Do we, sir?

273
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,737
Have we not struck back? Has England not?

274
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:23,848
We should have struck backthree years ago, if not before.

275
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,737
I expect we did, sir.But these things take time.

276
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:30,575
You're not looking very well, sir.Have you been to a good estate agent?

277
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,649
Oh, my God! Sorry, sir.

278
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:37,130
Oh, yes. Absolutely refused to handle me,until I'd turned into a bed sitting room.

279
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,368
And you are not that?

280
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,858
Not yet fully, damn you, man!

281
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,294
Do I, do I... Do I look like a bed sitting room?

282
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,972
It's not for me to say, sir.

283
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,776
But should you stop,you're liable to be knocked down

284
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:46,928
without the option.

285
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,657
Well, I...

286
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,207
I don't want to tum into a bed sitting room.

287
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:52,971
I don't.

288
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:55,732
You can't have a Lordturning into that sort of thing.

289
00:21:55,807 --> 00:22:00,017
I mean, Longleat, Woburn Abbey,a place where the takings are considerable,

290
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,896
but a bedsitter!

291
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,457
Three pounds ten a week. Never!

292
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,017
Carry on, Sergeant.

293
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,613
Excuse me.

294
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,617
Do you hear the frog?

295
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,493
Here's a turkey.

296
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,688
In every way,I'm getting better and better.

297
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,928
Every day, in every...

298
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,896
- Hello, hello?- Hello, hello. Have they dropped it yet?

299
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,412
No. I've still got it in me hand.

300
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:40,773
Hello, hello. Have they dropped it?

301
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,212
- Hello, up there.- it's coming from...

302
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:45,014
Hello, hello!

303
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,089
You stupid...

304
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,216
Hello. I can hear you down here.Can you hear me up there?

305
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,816
Every day, in every way,I'm getting better and better.

306
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,571
Every day and every...

307
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:08,498
She's got big busts, hasn't she?For a girl her age, hmm?

308
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,057
- What?Yeah, what?

309
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,448
That left bust, especially seems to,

310
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,177
the nipple seemsto stand out more on that one.

311
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:15,294
Yes.

312
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:18,098
Mmm. Father's very observant.He was in the Corps.

313
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,056
I wish he wouldn'ttalk about me in front of Alan.

314
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:22,209
Ho doesn't want to know about my busts.

315
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,413
No, I do, I do.

316
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,330
Shall we stop here for tea?

317
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,455
I hope all this family talkisn't boring you, Alan?

318
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:28,688
- No, not a bit of it.- Good.

319
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:32,294
Well, I expect you'd like a little dance now.To relax you, the both of you.

320
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,616
I'm glad it's all over. The, um...

321
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,815
Do you know, Mother, so am I.

322
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:56,017
Just like I was glad when I married you.

323
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,328
Got it all over.

324
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:02,332
If I'd known the end was such a relief.If only I...

325
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,853
I used to say,"For Christ's sake, drop it," didn't I?

326
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:06,975
Only when you were very tired.

327
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,496
He's not a bad lad.

328
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,057
Now, there you are, what did I say?

329
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:16,448
- Did you hear what I said, lad?- He said you were not a bad lad.

330
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:17,574
There!

331
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:18,728
Oh, thank you.

332
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,855
- One of the family now.- There.

333
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,498
I want you to treat mejust as if I was your father.

334
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,336
I hated my father!

335
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,614
No. Right. Ahhh!

336
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,494
Well, haven't you got a favourite uncleyou were fond of, young Alan?

337
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:34,933
Yes.

338
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,296
Well, treat me like him, then.

339
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:43,458
Uncle, can I havesixpence for sweeties, please?

340
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:46,493
Of course you may.

341
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,256
What a good, polite boy you are!

342
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,169
Radiation's rising.

343
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,576
Still, one mustn't grumble too much.

344
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,408
- Hello?Hello, have they dropped it yet?

345
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,171
- Hey?- Hello?

346
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:10,215
- What?- Have they dropped it yet, boy?

347
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:12,096
- Where are you?- In by here.

348
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,896
- Hmm?- In by here.

349
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:21,976
I'm a regional seat of government.Come in by here, quick.

350
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:24,049
I'll soon have you seated and governed.

351
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,775
Fancy seeing you down here.

352
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,576
- Who are you?- First of all,

353
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:31,613
have they dropped it yet, indeed?

354
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:32,734
Have they dropped what?

355
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:37,335
You know, thou. You're bound to know.You're up there, weren't you?

356
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:44,488
Still, towards the endit got all mixed up with the blackies and LBJ.

357
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:47,810
There's a fellow for you, LBJ.I was proud to regionally servo him.

358
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:51,096
Have they?No, don't tell me, let me guess.

359
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,971
Harrods laid all this on, you know. Harrods!

360
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:56,049
- They're very good at that.- Yes.

361
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:58,933
I expect I talk too much. Don't listen.I don't listen.

362
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,255
Thank God I've kept my head,when all about are...

363
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:03,613
Have they?

364
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,018
Some good people have gone, you know.

365
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:07,930
- Oh, yes.- I shot two myself.

366
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,773
I had to. They came at me. They tried to get inwith the man from Harrods.

367
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,656
In gas masks, they were, trying to get in.

368
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,537
Sol shot them. I said,"Take those gas masks off your face," I said.

369
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,053
I had to. They might have been someof my directors, you see.

370
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:20,253
Who? Who did you shoot?

371
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:22,056
My mother and my wife. Shot them dead.

372
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,970
- Oh.- Of course, I married again.

373
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:26,487
Don't mind me, I talk too much.

374
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:29,456
- Doris. Doris.- Hmm?

375
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm very much in love.Of course, it led to marriage.

376
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,016
She doesn't seem to mind.

377
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:35,888
Are you hungry?

378
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,696
- No.- That's a damn lie!

379
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,215
Don't you shout at mo,I'm a medical practitioner.

380
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:42,495
Hey!

381
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,015
I have the proof. The terrible proof.

382
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,293
There!

383
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,938
Fresh evidence hascome to life as to who is responsible.

384
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:50,972
Will you have a bite with us?

385
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:53,573
I will, I will, I will. In that order.

386
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,298
Mmm.

387
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,368
Where are we?

388
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:06,131
Are you all forgotten?

389
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,254
Paddington.

390
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,576
Don't you know your London?

391
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:14,134
Shall I carve?

392
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,452
it's family life that's important.

393
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,931
Do you have a family, young man?

394
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:38,613
No. My big brother did.

395
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,530
Didn't you have a Daddy and a Mummy, then?

396
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:41,938
No. My brother had them.

397
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,931
That's a bit unfair.You could've had one each.

398
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:55,458
I'm sorry to have to rest, Dad,but my legs feel like lumps of wood.

399
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:34,453
- Well, thank goodnessI caught you on your rounds, Doctor.

400
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:36,256
What are you going to do for mo? What?

401
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,093
Mmm.

402
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,688
Take, um,

403
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:50,171
six of these pills. One every half mile.

404
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,252
Oh, but I can't do that, I only live a mile away.

405
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:54,852
This is Hyde Park, isn't it?

406
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:57,055
Yes. Well, then you'llhave to move further out, I'm afraid.

407
00:28:57,127 --> 00:29:00,176
No. I'll tell you what,I'll take the long road home.

408
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:01,976
Thats the ticket. Splendid!

409
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:03,897
I don't know what to say to you, Doctor.

410
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,492
Say, Doctor, how much will that be?

411
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,092
Doctor, how much will that be?

412
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,373
That'll be 18 post-war guineas,

413
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,290
marked down to three and sixin the last bargain budget.

414
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,451
Oi, here!

415
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,177
Will you excuse me?

416
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:25,818
Are you Captain Bules Martin?

417
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:27,048
Yes.

418
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:30,298
Just sigh there, sir, OH that line. Here we are.

419
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:32,134
Thank you.

420
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:35,131
- Ah! Luncheon.- Ah, would you care to join mo?

421
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,732
Yes, certainly, certainly.

422
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:40,696
If this is Regent's Park, then...

423
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,531
Marble Arch must lie to the south.

424
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,097
Dad!

425
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,418
What I have here, sir,is your wife's death certificate.

426
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,569
- Oh, thank you.- Oh, dear!

427
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,608
There! Well, it was a lovely way to go.

428
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,208
But Mummy's alive!

429
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,937
I'm afraid not, dear.

430
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,769
It makes me feel all funny to read it.

431
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,054
No!

432
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,617
No! Tell them no, Alan.

433
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,018
- No!- Pull yourself together!

434
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,737
I am together. We are!

435
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,697
I want you to call me Arthurand come to me for every little plaster.

436
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,332
But Mum's alive!

437
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:25,377
Well, I thought I was, dear.By rights, I should be,

438
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:28,291
but how can you tell ifit's here in black and white?

439
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,857
Give it to me.

440
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:32,897
I shouldn't, should I, Dad?it'll only upset her to read it.

441
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:37,977
Give it to me, dear.I'll put it somewhere safe with all the others.

442
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,412
With the health cards.

443
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,289
Look, Mrs Frereton,there is nothing wrong with you.

444
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,608
Now then, you're a nice, kind boy.

445
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:48,497
It's your wife being alive that seems to beall the trouble, sir.

446
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,968
- I'm sorry.- Ah.

447
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,129
Oh, I'm sorry,we don't want to cause any trouble.

448
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:54,493
Oh, now listen, Mum...

449
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,648
Penny!

450
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:56,933
Don't argue with the nurse, dear.

451
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,692
She's bound to know best, what's best for us.

452
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,135
Do I lie down or anything?

453
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,409
The way, the wayI'd like you to look at it is this.

454
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:11,137
You may have lost a wife, sir,but you've gained a certificate.

455
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:14,495
I expect you've got the set now,if you haven't been careless with them.

456
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,008
I do hope we haven't been carelesswith our papers,

457
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:18,612
birth, marriage, death,

458
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:20,098
- And school.- Ah!

459
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:22,177
Mum got her school.

460
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:28,093
Father, can you let me see them allbefore you send them off?

461
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:32,813
I would just like to, to hold them all together,

462
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,457
look through them.

463
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:43,293
Not much, is it?

464
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,857
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

465
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:50,172
And we've all been so muchhappier since that...

466
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:58,129
Oh, well, at least I can still keep cheerful.

467
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,617
That's the style, Mum.

468
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,296
That's the hammer.

469
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,330
Forward.

470
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,933
- Hello!

471
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:18,736
My dear God, gas meters!

472
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:23,889
I can hear them shilling in the slot.Gas meters on a lord's legs.

473
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,653
Belgravia! I must find Belgravia before I turn.

474
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:32,568
For all I know,I may even now be in the provinces.

475
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:35,935
Will someone kindly set meon the right road to Belgravia?

476
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,328
A guide! A guide!

477
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,654
My freehold for a guide!

478
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:48,049
Ah, what a lovely evening.Splendid meal.

479
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,210
Yes,care for an after-dinner drink?

480
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:52,096
Well, thank you very much, yes.

481
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:04,891
No. Here, let me have a try.

482
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:15,808
Cheers!

483
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,572
What were you doing before this, then?

484
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,934
I was in the army, actually. I'm a Captain.

485
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,055
Oh, I say! What regiment?

486
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:27,368
Oh, we didn't know,due to the Official Secrets Act.

487
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:31,975
But from what I can make of my cap badge,it was the Household Cavalry.

488
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,378
Did you have to be a householder?

489
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:36,690
Oh, good lord, no, no!No. It did help for a commission.

490
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:37,848
No, the household that we're referring to

491
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:40,294
is the Buckingham Palace household.We did all the cavalry for them.

492
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:43,098
Did you? They're splendid!

493
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,137
All destroyed,of course, when they dropped the...

494
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,654
Oh!

495
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,411
# God save our gracious Queen

496
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,216
# Long live our noble Queen

497
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:52,812
# God save our Queen... #

498
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:55,777
No, no, no! We don't sing that any longer.

499
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,212
- You don't?- No, we sing now that

500
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,894
God should save Mrs Ethel Shroakeof 393A High Street, Leytonstone.

501
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,014
Oh.

502
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:04,738
Of the twenty peoplewho are known to be left alive in England,

503
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:06,457
she stands next in lineto the throne, you know.

504
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:09,297
- Mmm.- I say!

505
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:13,213
You're lucky to be still connected, huh?Bit of luck to have the phone.

506
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:17,337
I've only got the bells, boy.Drive me mad, they do, they drive me mad!

507
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:18,454
Ave

508
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:20,575
Hey, is that the authorities?

509
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,729
Hey! Hey! Keep moving!

510
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:25,378
No building whatever! Keep moving!

511
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:27,457
No building whatever!Keep moving! Keep moving!

512
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:29,416
I have the proof! I have the proof!

513
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:32,128
Look! The proof of germ warfare, boy.

514
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:36,412
They dip the weapons in germs, you see.They dip the weapons in the germs.

515
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:37,852
And then if they survive the, you know...

516
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:41,215
If you survive that, you see,you go down with the measles.

517
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:44,210
Uh, excuse me, madam.

518
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:46,767
Uh, which oneof you ordered a business telephone?

519

- Both of me.- Huh?

520
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,976
At last, at last, I shall convince the worldwith my documentary voice!

521
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,128
No, this is a...

522
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,494
- Hello, folks of world!- Hello, hello, folks of world!

523
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,615
This is a... it's only a demonstration model.

524
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:58,496
But this is the type you'll be getting, madam.

525
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,410
Just lot me have the borrowing of it,will you, please?

526
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:01,977
- The bells are driving me mad, you see.- Don't worry, sir.

527
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,811
Don't worry.As soon as the telephone's installed,

528
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,093
we rip the bells out.

529
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,657
Let me have it! Let me have it!

530
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:07,808
Madam!

531
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,377

00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,852
It's for you.

533
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,008
Oh.

534
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:17,213
- Hello?- Colour? I'll show you in bloody colour.

535
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,449
- What's he talking about, chum?- Colour!

536
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:22,610
The dirty... sod! That's naughty.

537
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,655
Bules Martin, Captain and Doctor.

538
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:27,577
Oh, just a moment!

539
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:34,768
Hello, darling.What are you doing this evening?

540
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,656
Oh, are you?

541
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,775
Well, lot me have a photograph of it,won't you?

542
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:43,931
Oh, give him my regards.

543
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,574
Yes. Bye-bye, Gregory.

544
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:50,096
Ah, Gregory, have you seen my Nigel?

545
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:58,857
Oh, it's getting late. Time for my humiliation.

546
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:01,089
Now, what have I donewith my defeat of England medal?

547
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:06,655
Your Majesty, I'm sorry that I failed you.

548
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:09,378
I tried to catch the thingbefore it hit the Palace,

549
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,131
but one of your corgis bit mo.

550
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:16,932
Come on, Sergeant, put your back into it.

551
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,213
I've got my back into it, sir.

552
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,931
Put your front into it, then!

553
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:21,213
Put your front into it, Constable.

554
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,574
Come on now, sin keep moving.

555
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,491
Hurry up! Don't stand there and watch us.

556
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:30,617
Well be moving, all right. Come on, lady.She who hesitates is lost.

557
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,295
My first wife died, you know.

558
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,335
I'm sorry to hear that.

559
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,216
I got my certificate the other day.

560
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,728
You don't want an old woman like me.

561
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,651
You remind me of my first wife.

562
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,128
That's funny. You see,I never met her, you see.

563
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:15,130
Will you do for me what my first wife did?

564
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,017
Doris tries, but she can't coordinate, you see.

565
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,578
Will you do it for me?

566
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:26,051
Well, so long as we get it over quickly,before Daddy misses me.

567
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:35,451
Now, no, no, no!

568
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:38,053
See reason, Mildred!Mildred, you're worse than your mother!

569
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:41,176
I didn't, Mildred, I haven't!She's a common or garden secretary!

570
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:43,215
Mildred, please! I love you!

571
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,335
She means nothing to me at all! Mildred!

572
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,808
I was kept late at the office.Mildred, I love you!

573
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:49,855
Mildred, please, no! The people next door!

574
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,975
Mildred, please! Mildred, no! Mildred!

575
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:53,890
Mildred! Mildred, Mildred!

576
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,168
Oh! Oh!

577
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:01,655
Get out, you slut! Get out and leave me alone!

578
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,454
That was my best dinner service.

579
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:15,333
Hello! Hello!

580
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,371
Doctor!

581
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:20,778
Hello!

582
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,578
Call the roll, Alan.

583
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,611
- Father figure!- Present.

584
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,167
- Penelope, the well-known fiancée!- Here.

585
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:46,857
Alan! Here!

586
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:48,452
Mother!

587
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,457
Mummy?

588
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,529
We're all here except one, Mother.

589
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,575
That's all we ever had, one Mother.

590
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:55,773
Mummy!

591
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,053
All right.

592
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,129
Now, when I say wave, I want you all to wave.

593
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:01,653
Wave!

594
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,411
- Hello.- Hello, young Alan.

595
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:06,330
- Hello, Penelope.- Hello.

596
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:09,248
Mummy!

597
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:11,136
All right. That's enough.

598
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,572
Mummy!

599
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:14,497
I demand an explanation.

600
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,858
Oh! Much worse than I thought.

601
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,096
Oh! Mother!

602
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,768
Don't worry, Mother, we'll look after you.

603
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:51,330
One more stop, madam,and I shall be forced to endorse your license.

604
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:55,017
You wouldn't want us touse our special powers, would you, madam?

605
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:58,894
I can't move. My legs are stiff.

606
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:29,297
- Hello?- It is I.

607
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,696

614
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,251

615
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:56,971
Oh! Oh, you black fiend!

616
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,977

Mummy!

618
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,452
Mummy!

619
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,337
Mummy!

620
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,536
Penny!

621
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:12,688
Penny!

622
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,217
I'm over here.

623
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:34,128
So you are.I'd recognise you anywhere, My Lord.

624
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:36,536
I must say it suits you.

625
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,695
- Please don't do that, I'm not well.

626
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:49,253
It's me. Captain Bules Martin.

627
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,096
And I'm your doctor.

628
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,768
Come in, Doctor.Did you bring some furniture?

629
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:01,972
I say!

630
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:05,813
Is this you?

631
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:08,618
Yes, tell me the worst. Where am I?

632
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:12,134
Yeah, you're number 29 Cul de Sac Place.

633
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:14,608
Yes, I know that, but what borough?

634
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,052
Ah, that's pretty bad news, I'm afraid.

635
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:17,731
- it's Paddington.- Quick, put a card.

636
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:18,854
Put a card in the window.

637
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:21,771
No coloureds, no childrenand definitely no coloured children.

638
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:22,934
Don't worry.

639
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,054
Doctor Bules Martin looks likehe's come to stay.

640
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,255
You're still under your doctor.

641
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,251
If everyone thought like you,this world would be a much happier place.

642
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:35,967
Breathe in.

643
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,288
In...

644
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:44,058
- Out.- Out!

645
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:46,178
Yes.

646
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:49,808
How's your water?

647
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:51,457
It hasn't run properly for years.

648
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,416
Oh well, we'll soon fix that.Have you got a washer somewhere?

649
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:58,737
One, two, three, 12...

650
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,614
Cough.

651
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,293
- You married?- You, not at the moment.

652
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:14,937
Well, I'd advise against it. Against it.

653
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:19,698
Listen.

654
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:21,932
Harken.

655
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:32,173
Survivors of the Third Gurkhas, quick march!

656
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,329
it's the Burma reunion.

657
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:43,131
And hot dinner.

658
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,969
The Cavalry cometh!

659
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,817
I must find the Albert Hall.

660
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,217
I shall be out till dawn.

661
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:57,088
No, don't wait up. And don't take any rent.

662
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,287
That's got rid of him.Come on, Abdul, let's get the furniture in.

663
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:21,132
Mummy!

664
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,137
Thank you, my dear.

665
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:33,496
As you chaps know,electricity is the life blood of civilization.

666
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:37,933
Without electricity,civilization as we know it could not survive.

667
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:43,010
Sol intend, with God's help,to go on pedalling this bicycle

668
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:46,057
until we've hit this desolation for six

669
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:49,927
and won God'sjust victory over the forces of evil.

670
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,412
Hmm? Hmm?

671
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:02,338
Mummy!

672
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:04,378
Mummy!

673
00:45:06,927 --> 00:45:08,088
Mummy!

674
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:10,537
I'll look up here.

675
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,617
No...

676
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,812
- Oi, you watching?

677
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,457
Oh, please come down!

678
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:35,733
Okay, coming.

679
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,013
- Oh!

680
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,049
I like it! I like it!

681
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,858
More! More! Oh!

682
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,891
What are you doing with that?it's not raining.

683
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,208
Come on.

684
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,288
Oh.

685
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:07,931
# Roll me over in the clover

686
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:11,417
# Do it again #

687
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:15,857
# Roll me oven. #

688
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:20,936
# On the road to Mandalay #

689
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,288
- Who's- Oh, for pity's sake!

690
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,096
- No coloureds, damn you!

691
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:36,216
Have youhot yet finished with my poor bruised body?

692
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,857
- Are youthat black man's woman?

693
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:40,055
That's hardly likely,in my condition.

694
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,492
- And what isyour condition?

695
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,696
I'm a cupboard.Will nobody close my doors?

696
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:48,688
I'm Lord Fortnum of Alamein. Who are you?

697
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:51,296
I'm Mrs Frereton.

698
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,128
Well, madam,in view of the ghastly circumstances

699
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,538
in which we both find ourselves,

700
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:59,089
I suggest we speakonly when spoken to and hold our tongues.

701
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,771
Very well, if you think so.

702
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,052
Mummy!

703
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:07,617
Mummy!

704
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,051
Mummy! Mummy!

705
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,371
Mummy!

706
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:28,012
Oh, let's sleep here for a bit.We can look again when it's light, love.

707
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:53,972
I wll say this for him,

708
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:56,891
I can't really say anything for him,

709
00:47:57,607 --> 00:48:00,213
except he is like a sheet of white paper.

710
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:03,138
I haven't seen a sheetof white paper for years

711
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,572
I could draw a face on.

712
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:08,491
His poor suit!

713
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,934
Crumple-fashion little stitches on the edges.

714
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,017
And I'll say this for him,

715
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,294
trendy boy.

716
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:17,937
You can say his lapels are crumpled

717
00:48:18,007 --> 00:48:20,533
and he has got a nosewhere noses used to be.

718
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,617
And I'll say this for him.

719
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:26,170
He's always here.

720
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,251
Wherever his feet are, he is.

721
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:32,856
Toes are bent upwards, but he's straight,

722
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:35,533
flat.

723
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,936
Stupid as the sun.

724
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:42,411
I will say this for him.

725
00:48:43,727 --> 00:48:45,456
And he has got twirly hair.

726
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,776
But you do get the whole of him,

727
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:53,578
now, to stroke.

728
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,137
There's nobody else.

729
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:15,374
# Roll me over in the clover

730
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:22,092
# Roll me over in the clover

731
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:26,729
# Roll me over,lay me down and do it again

732
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:29,938
# When she's... #

733
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:55,250
- All right, Sergeant, let's just check your ruler.- That's, uh...

734
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,977
- ... 22 inches, sir.- Carry on.

735
00:49:57,047 --> 00:49:58,287
Thank you.

736
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:01,612
Head, 22 inches.

737
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:03,416
Ah, taking my measurements!

738
00:50:05,687 --> 00:50:06,813
Chest, 22 inches.

739
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:10,130
That's right. That's the hammer.Get it all down, eh!

740
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,333
Inside leg,

741
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,576
-22 inches, sir.- You're right.

742
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:17,775
Right, sir. We'll lot you know.

743
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,656
Thank you very much, thank you.

744
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:21,567
Ah! There are my children!

745
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:23,094
Hello, Daddy!

746
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:27,134
You won't want their measurements,of course, they're a bit young.

747
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,938
My word! What a hairy trunk!

748
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:34,008
Keep moving.

749
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,137
You going to lot me know, then?

750
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,653
Uh, who are you?

751
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,328
They are.

752
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,569
I must say, they seemed rather impressedwith my inside leg.

753
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,896
Excuse me, sir, but it was a 22, wasn't it?

754
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:48,731
- Yes, I believe it was.- I say!

755
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:50,935
Not many of them left, you know.

756
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,418
Like to shake you by the hand.

757
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,967
Yeah, I would, but not until I've referred it

758
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:56,617
- to the Ministry of Health.- Quite, quite.

759
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,212
Can't be too careful.

760
00:50:58,287 --> 00:50:59,334
You in business, then?

761
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:00,772
- Hmm?- Looking for a partner?

762
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:01,973
No, I am a partner.

763
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:04,448
Of course. Who is your partner?

764
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,655
I don't need one,I'm just Partner and Company.

765
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:09,810
I say, uh, is that your daughter?

766
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:12,174
I say, it is. Chubby little thing.

767
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,257
- Well-built young girl.- Thank you.

768
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:17,896
Been going on for some time?

769
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:20,778
- Eighteen months.- Eight... Indeed, indeed!

770
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:23,495
Well,I'd like your permission to

771
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:25,577
call upon your daughter.

772
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:28,655
Often. Starting now.

773
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,288
No.

774
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:11,177
I'd like a bit more off here, for courting.

775
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:22,888
Ah! Ah, yes, that's much better.

776
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:26,813
I'm not one of your hippie types, you know.Such as that never won fair lady.

777
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:29,094
- Anything else, sir?- Mmm?

778
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:52,416
But Daddy, I love Alan.

779
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,692
Love?Love is a four-letter word.

780
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:57,178
Come to that, so is bull.

781
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,491
Cat is a three-letter word.

782
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,728
Right.

783
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:03,571
You're going to make a famous son-in-law.

784
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:05,418
Been my ambition for years.

785
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:07,893
Uh...

786
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:17,290
Now, look here, Mr Freretonl

787
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:19,847
You can't arrangethis thing over our heads, you know.

788
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:20,928
Can't I?

789
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:22,418
Captain Bules Martinis a man of subsidence

790
00:53:22,487 --> 00:53:23,613
and property, if not more.

791
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:25,213
Moreover, he's a partner.

792
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:28,658
A very fittingson-in-law for a future Prime Minister.

793
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:30,727
Who is?

794
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:31,933
I am.

795
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:35,216
You don't imagine they gathered mymeasurements for nothing, do you?

796
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:38,450
Show me a 22 inside legand I'll show you a future Prime Minister.

797
00:53:38,527 --> 00:53:40,211
It's a well-known fact.

798
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,494
I expect Mrs Ethel Shroake

799
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,216
to consider my credentials any day now.

800
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,691
That trunk of yours, get rid of it.

801
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:51,856
This is not my trunk.

802
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,098
He tied his thumbs up with string

803
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:55,612
and exposed himself for a limited period

804
00:53:55,687 --> 00:53:57,689
between Bagshot and Camberley.

805
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,257
Was that you, sir?

806
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:02,011
A post-war gesture, I suppose.

807
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:04,252
I hope you destroyed the string.

808
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:07,371
Get out of it! Shoo! Get out!

809
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:10,937
Clear out!

810
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:13,368
Naughty...!

811
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:41,371
I love St Paul's, you know.

812
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,254
Dearly love us to be married here.

813
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:46,612
Ah! Vicar!

814
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,374
May be requiring your services soon.

815
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:52,698
My fiancée and I.

816
00:55:54,127 --> 00:55:55,731
I'm not surprised.

817
00:55:56,247 --> 00:56:00,650
I wouldn't leave it too long, if I were you.Chubby little thing, isn't she?

818
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,529
My patient, you know.

819
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:08,853
Well, if you'll excuse me,

820
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:12,613
I'll just go in for a minuteand get spruced up a bit.

821
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:20,773
I can't go through with it.

822
00:56:21,407 --> 00:56:22,454
What?

823
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,053
Having this monster.

824
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:30,935
Well, no one else can have it, can they?

825
00:56:57,607 --> 00:56:59,416
- Then it must be?- it must be.

826
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:03,368
Well, I'll just slip into an old wedding dress.

827
00:57:03,447 --> 00:57:05,176
No, no, wait a minute, darling.

828
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:08,657
Go behind the screen.

829
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,209
Oh, really, darling,you've watched a lady undress

830
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:12,573
before today, haven't you?

831
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:14,297
Of course, darling.

832
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:16,808
I'll go behind the screen with you.

833
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:23,410
I wish Mother could have been alive to see it.

834
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:27,292
Uh, just a thought.

835
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:32,496
Have you considered the new economicalcombined marriage and divorce ceremony?

836
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:35,252
Three pounds one shilling. Catholics extra.

837
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:38,133
No, no, we couldn't affordthe divorce just now.

838
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:40,016
She'll have to be satisfied with the wedding.

839
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:42,772
Later on, of course, when I'm earning,then we can get the annulment.

840
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:45,009
Uh, this is the instant God kit, sir.

841
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:46,934
Good luck.

842
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:00,209
Alley-up there.

843
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,092
Would you join hands, please?

844
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,215
Good, good.

845
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:06,573
And now for a good book.

846
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:12,570
# Oh, and the naughty gamekeeper

847
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:14,729
# Took her into the potting shed

848
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,969
# And laid her upon the ground

849
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:18,811
# And with hands quivering, he ripped... #

850
00:58:18,887 --> 00:58:20,491
I say, look here, that's not the Bible.

851
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,012
I know, it's Lady Chatterley's Lover.

852
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:25,569
But if you prefer the old tvvit version,I think I can still recall it.

853
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:31,054
# Do you, Bules Martin,take this girl to be your lawful wedded wife?

854
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:32,731
# I was expecting you to ask me that question

855
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:34,377
# As it so happens, I do

856
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:38,927
# And do you, Penelope, take this lawfulwedded man to be your husband?

857
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:40,008
I do.

858
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:43,011
# And do you promise,Penelope Rose Frereton

859
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,693
# To cherish your husbandin sickness and in health

860
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:48,498
# In trial and in ordeal and in all that holy... #

861
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,728
I do!

862
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:51,297
I say, look here,there's still some decency left.

863
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:52,414
Come on, darling, let's get out of here.

864
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,488
Stop!

865
00:58:54,007 --> 00:58:55,691
Haven't finished, have we?

866
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,974
I now pronounce you man and wife.

867
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,654
On your mark, get set...

868
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:15,456
Get out of my bedroom, you Peeping Tom.

869
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:19,009
Ah! This ought to do the trick.

870
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:20,930
You've got two hours, mate.

871
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:22,771
- I won't need this, then, will I?- No!

872
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:27,013
My God! When was my last virility test?

873
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,207
Congratulations, Mrs Martin.

874
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,210
I thought you'd never get here.

875
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:41,490
- Excuse me, sir. BBC Television.- Yes?

876
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:45,929
When did you first decideto become a politician?

877
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:50,213
Did you get that?

878
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,289
I'm afraid I didn't, sir.Would you like to try again?

879
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,449
It began when I measuredmy inside leg one day,

880
00:59:54,527 --> 00:59:55,972
- as we all do.- Mmm.

881
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:58,254
And I found that I was very well-equipped.

882
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:17,216
Good heavens! Penelope?

883
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:19,933
Hello, Daddy.

884
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:22,135
But you're promisedto Captain Bules Martin, you slut.

885
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:23,732
Come down at once.

886
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:25,377
I married him this morning, Daddy.

887
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:26,812
So you did.

888
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:28,173
That's all right, then.

889
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:29,373
Carry on.

890
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:37,572
Wife sent you along, did she?

891
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,135
Well, it did occur to methat I might review the circumstances.

892
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:41,891
Huh. You'll love it.

893
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:44,573
Yeah, I can't keep away.

894
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:46,538
You'll learn to love your vlrlilty test.

895
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,412
I've always had a very good wind.

896
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:49,773
Mmm, oh dear.

897
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:53,094
- Who's wrong?- Well, my wife...

898
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:55,494
She... Well...

899
01:00:58,407 --> 01:00:59,454
Oh!

900
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:02,656
Best thing, uh, best thing to do istalk dirty among yourselves.

901
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:06,413
Well, if you can't come to that,flick through the dirty books.

902
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:22,614
Is it?

903
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:24,377
- Is it?- Due?

904
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,372
- Due?- I knew it.

905
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:28,495
- Ooh!- Should have kept my socks on.

906
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:32,817
Look, never mind, my love.

907
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,374
I'll nip downstairsand get some boiling water.

908
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:38,096
Come. Come on down.

909
01:01:39,247 --> 01:01:40,373
Come on, we'll just nip down.

910
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:45,897
- Oh.- Oh.

911
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:53,651
Pretty Poll. Pretty Poll!

912
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:11,617
Ah, did you pass your virility test, son?

913
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,849
I don't know. Hard to tell.

914
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,176
You see, lights fused at the critical moment.

915
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,968
Where's my bride? She should be able to tell.

916
01:02:19,047 --> 01:02:21,891
Sit down, son. Your bride is in labour.

917
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:24,097
Oh, God!

918
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:28,168
Daddy, I need a drink.

919
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:34,094
What'll you have, old boy?

920
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,932
I'll have a large, uh, water.

921
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,168
With water?

922
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:40,534
No, nothing with it.

923
01:02:40,607 --> 01:02:41,938
- Here you are.- Good. Thanks.

924
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,293
A pleasure.

925
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:47,497
Well, I think I'llwander along to the saloon car, bar.

926
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,808
Well, here we are again.

927
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:52,777
Another one for you? Pleasure, old friend.

928
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,576
Oh, I knew.

929
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:59,368
As soon as I grasped the test-tubefirmly in my right hand.

930
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,688
None of your cheek and impotence.

931
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:02,768
Cheek?

932
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,369
- You'll like it, I think.- Thank you.

933
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:09,937
Jolly good health.

934
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,613
Oh.

935
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:27,411
Evening.

936
01:03:28,407 --> 01:03:29,693
We're looking for a man.

937
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:31,496
Are you indeed, Inspector?

938
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:34,093
There aren't many of us left, you know.

939
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:38,896
We're also looking for a bed sitting room.

940
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:40,696
Aren't we all?

941
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:42,007
True. True.

942
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:46,210
We're on the trail of a foul and grisly murder.

943
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:49,370
I say, isn't that the first, uh, post-war murder?

944
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:51,336
Things are looking up for youin popular fiction.

945
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:53,409
Yes, we've had a pretty thin time of it recently.

946
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:54,488
Yes.

947
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,728
What with 40 million dead,

948
01:03:55,807 --> 01:03:57,218
we haven't beenable to see the wood for the trees.

949
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:59,130
Yes, quite.

950
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:01,858
But this is murder, not glory.

951
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:03,773
How do you do?

952
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:11,770
We are also looking for a trunk,if the Inspector doesn't mind me saying so.

953
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:16,171
And when we find it,we shall know why we're looking for it.

954
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:24,131
Penelope!

955
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,489
Penelope!

956
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:29,972
Penelope!

957
01:04:31,127 --> 01:04:32,572
Penelope!

958
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,698
Penelope!

959
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:37,132
Penelope...

960
01:04:37,847 --> 01:04:39,975
Relax, dearie. She's doing very well.

961
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,130
Would you like to see the birth?We've still got a few tickets left.

962
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:45,528
Let me go! She needs me!

963
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:46,654
No.

964
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:49,617
What she has need of is medical science.

965
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:58,372
Father?

966
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:04,733
Oh! Are you that blokewhat ordered the Van Gogh painting?

967
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:08,050
I am, I am. Hang it up there.

968
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:12,610
I think it might do better on the wall.

969
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:15,372
I wish you'd make your bleeding mind up.

970
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:20,176
Is your name Frereton?

971
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:22,170
No. it's not.

972
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:23,533
Never!

973
01:05:23,607 --> 01:05:25,655
- That is the man you want.- Never!

974
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:29,049
Only it's, uh, it's his turn to be Prime Minister.

975
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:32,535
I know. I know.

976
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:35,577
I always knewmy inside leg would lead to power.

977
01:05:35,647 --> 01:05:39,288
Dear Martin... Bules,give me a hand, will you?

978
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:43,133
And get rid of my old logs, which I shallnot need as Prime Minister.

979
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:56,409
Martin, what about down there, eh?

980
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:57,852
Huh?

981
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:07,854
Ah.

982
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:38,211
Oh, fire, fire!

983
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:39,808
Fire!

984
01:06:39,887 --> 01:06:42,652
- Did you say something?- What? Me? No.

985
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:43,853
Fire!

986
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:46,214
All right, Sergeant, nip down and seewhat that fire's about, would you?

987
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,016
I was just going to do so, actually, sir.

988
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,612
Can't have fires around this time of the year.

989
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:50,813
Very well put, sir.

990
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:51,968
Down you go, then, Sergeant.

991
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:53,731
Right. Could you lower the balloon a little, sir?

992
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:56,014
- Doing me best.- Thank you.

993
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:59,249
Oh, my bloody log!

994
01:06:59,327 --> 01:07:00,931
Never mind about your bloody leg!

995
01:07:01,007 --> 01:07:03,169
Look at me, I'm drifting! Grab hold of the rope!

996
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:05,773
Grab hold of the rope, Constable.Sir's drifting.

997
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:09,090
Sir's more than drifting! Sir's away!

998
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:10,817
- Grab the anchor!

999
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:14,778
I didn't join the force just to drift aimlesslyinto the void!

1000
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:17,293
Right, sir! Hold on, sir, we'll soonhave you out of trouble!

1001
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,653
Grab the anchor!

1002
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:20,616
I've got hold of it, sir.Everything's under control!

1003
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:24,055
Oh, my God! Pull me down, Sergeant!

1004
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,288
I will, sir!

1005
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:27,688
Use your weight and gravity.I'll come and help you!

1006
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:30,168
I haven't got much gravity left, sir!

1007
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:34,013
What a lovely dome that Is.Wren, isn't it?

1008
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:36,852
No, it's not rain, sir. It looks a bit cloudy,

1009
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,612
but I don't think we're in for any rain.Sorry, sir.

1010
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:41,928
Ever thought of dropping offthe balloon suddenly, Sergeant?

1011
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:44,168
We have this new system.

1012
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:47,137
Instead of moving the baby out,we move the furniture in.

1013
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:49,334
Excuse me.

1014
01:07:49,407 --> 01:07:51,296
What are you doing to my Penny?

1015
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,857
We should all ask ourselves,

1016
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,771
is it really necessaryfor people to leave the womb nowadays?

1017
01:07:55,847 --> 01:07:58,453
That's when most of the troubleseems to start in this wicked world.

1018
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:03,456
My God, it's monstrous!

1019
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:06,053
It may well be, but you must be preparedto love your monster.

1020
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,334
Oh, we have somemedicated wallpaper here.

1021
01:08:08,407 --> 01:08:11,217
Perhaps you'd liketo chose a pattern to suit your womb.

1022
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:18,058
Ah.

1023
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:28,015
Then, in come the three bears.And Daddy Bear said,

1024
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:30,249
“Who's been sleeping in my porridge?"

1025
01:08:30,327 --> 01:08:31,852
And the Mama Bear said,

1026
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:34,658
“That's no porridge. That was my wife. "

1027
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:38,698
Waste of time telling bleeding chinks...

1028
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:40,815
There were three pandas, see?

1029
01:08:40,887 --> 01:08:41,934
Ah!

1030
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:43,008
Sergeant!

1031
01:08:43,087 --> 01:08:44,248
Sir!

1032
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:46,455
Quick, man, they're coming over the wire.

1033
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:51,293
Where, sir? I can see no one whatever, sir.

1034
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:54,098
Put these glasses to your eyes, you idiot!

1035
01:08:57,687 --> 01:09:00,054
No, sir. Duff information, sir.

1036
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:02,937
I can see nothing whatever, sir.Nothing untoward to report, sir.

1037
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:04,532
- No sign of the enemy, sir.- Here.

1038
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,132
Are you the bloke, uh, officer,

1039
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:10,575
what was in charge of the nuclear detergentin the last atomic war?

1040
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,728
I am he.

1041
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,812
Bad news. It has been returned to sender.

1042
01:09:15,887 --> 01:09:18,367
And there's three and nine topay on it in Chinese dollars.

1043
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:20,734
- Good heavens! We got a reply.- I can't help that, mate.

1044
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:22,775
You didn't reckonwith the chinky-poo post office, did you?

1045
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:24,531
- Well, it's a bit late now.- Yes.

1046
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,248
Sixty-five million poundsit cost to develop that bomb.

1047
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:30,409
Pity about the three and nine.

1048
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:33,411
We could have won, you know.Damnable bad luck!

1049
01:09:57,728 --> 01:09:59,776
Dad will get a nice surprise.

1050
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:02,936
- Dad!Dad!

1051
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:06,650
- Daddy?Daddy?

1052
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:09,014
- Dad?Dad?

1053
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:17,372
Sorry we're late home, Dad.

1054
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:19,654
I had the baby.

1055
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:24,496
Don't you think he looks a bit like you, sir?

1056
01:10:45,648 --> 01:10:47,650
it's been along day.

1057
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:57,568
Oh.

1058
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:00,294
Oh.

1059
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:06,737
Good night.

1060
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:17,137
Rape!

1061
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:19,778
Damn it,I can hold my tongue no longer!

1062
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:21,656
- What?- I-low dare you, adulterer!

1063
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:23,890
How dare youtake advantage of our feathered friend!

1064
01:11:23,968 --> 01:11:25,732
- Mummy!- I'm so ashamed.

1065
01:11:25,808 --> 01:11:28,288
Compromised internallyin front of my own daughter.

1066
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,654
Close my doors at once.

1067
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:32,174
- Can't we go into this in the morning? I'm all...- Daddy, it's Mummy.

1068
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:35,808
Very well, Captain.But be gentle with me.

1069
01:11:35,888 --> 01:11:38,095
Nighty-night.

1070
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:41,487
Night-night, Mum.

1071
01:11:41,568 --> 01:11:43,491
Good night, dear.

1072
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:53,091
Uh, good night, Dad.

1073
01:12:04,608 --> 01:12:05,734
No.

1074
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:09,056
Nothing edible here.

1075
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:13,735
You know, ever since theydropped tho, uh, you know,

1076
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:16,129
woodworms have become quite extinct.

1077
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,176
Oh, really?

1078
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,658
Very strange.

1079
01:12:20,768 --> 01:12:23,135
Perhaps it wasn't the Russiansand Americans who dropped it, then.

1080
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:25,016
Perhaps it was Rentokil.

1081
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:30,690
Dinner is served, Daddy-0.

1082
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:34,854
Well...

1083
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:37,932
Well, I don't know who he is,but he's just in time.

1084
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:45,259
Well. Sit you down.

1085
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,852
What? What is it, darling? Chicken?

1086
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:57,292
No, it's Daddy.

1087
01:12:57,367 --> 01:13:01,452
Oh. Well, never mind. Don't take it too hard.

1088
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:05,088
We'll let his perch to another bird,if we can find one.

1089
01:13:05,168 --> 01:13:06,693
Be gentle, Bules.

1090
01:13:08,608 --> 01:13:12,055
How did this terrible thing happen?

1091
01:13:12,128 --> 01:13:13,653
After his career in politics,

1092
01:13:13,728 --> 01:13:16,652
he said he wanted his bodyto be left to science.

1093
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:18,855
Then he threw himself off his perch.

1094
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:30,414
Eh?

1095
01:13:35,008 --> 01:13:38,694
Here, whats that silly thing?

1096
01:13:38,768 --> 01:13:40,054
It's her father.

1097
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,859
Father, eh? Ooh! This'll mean a by-election.

1098
01:13:42,928 --> 01:13:44,692
Oh dear Lord!

1099
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:49,648
Cor, he tastes marvelous.We've never had so good.

1100
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,293
Oh.

1101
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:54,212
I am moving.

1102
01:15:11,648 --> 01:15:13,730
Gas masks on!

1103
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:17,493
Gas masks on! Hurry up.

1104
01:15:18,288 --> 01:15:22,338
Atomic bomb, radiation rising! Hurry up!

1105
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:25,809
Radiation rising. Masks on!

1106
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,219
All your masks on!

1107
01:15:28,368 --> 01:15:30,689
My word,it's a good job the Minister of Defense

1108
01:15:30,768 --> 01:15:33,851
had a sense of humourwhen he invented these masks.

1109
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:37,932
Mind you, I was thinking. I don't thinkthe human face fits the modern need.

1110
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:39,497
- You don't?- No.

1111
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:42,936
If I had my wayin the hurly-burly of post-atomic living,

1112
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:45,579
I'd have a bloke's mouth OH top of his HUT.

1113
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:47,412
You see, then when he's late for work

1114
01:15:47,488 --> 01:15:49,855
all he has to dois slide his breakfast under his hat

1115
01:15:49,927 --> 01:15:51,497
and eat if on the way to the office.

1116
01:15:51,568 --> 01:15:52,933
Huh?

1117
01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:57,047
Do you think we've come to the end of it all?

1118
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:00,498
Oh, dear.

1119
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:03,968
Nah.

1120
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:12,816
Get your masks on!Get your masks on!

1121
01:16:12,928 --> 01:16:15,852
Got your masks on! Atomic bomb!

1122
01:16:24,608 --> 01:16:27,009
Oh, please, God, not again.

1123
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:35,653
Bloody fog.

1124
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:38,208
What's to become of us now?

1125
01:16:38,288 --> 01:16:40,131
Well, we'll just have to keep going.

1126
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,698
What for?

1127
01:16:41,767 --> 01:16:43,531
Because we're British.

1128
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:44,972
British?

1129
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:49,814
Well, what a lot of use that is.We don't even know who's won the war.

1130
01:16:49,888 --> 01:16:54,450
We've run out of food. No medicine.We're eating our parents.

1131
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:55,893
British!

1132
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:03,174
And another thing. If I had my way,

1133
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:06,570
I'd have a bloke's genitalson the end of his finger.

1134
01:17:06,647 --> 01:17:07,648
He'd wear a glove, of course?

1135
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:11,016
Oh, yes!You don't want the frost to get at it, eh?

1136
01:17:11,088 --> 01:17:14,092
And you think howhandy it would be in them hon-corridor trains.

1137
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,692
He could waggle itout the window then, couldn't he?

1138
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:17,735
Where would you puta woman's equivalent?

1139
01:17:17,808 --> 01:17:21,494
Well, I'd...I'd have that up here OH her shoulder. See?

1140
01:17:21,568 --> 01:17:24,094
- Oh?- Then she couldn't get raped by, uh, midgets.

1141
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:25,692
Supposing they stoodon each other's shoulders?

1142
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:28,373
No! It'd be easier for her to kneel down.

1143
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:30,257
Oh ho, it wouldn't work. Out of the question!

1144
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:32,295
- I-low do you mean?- Picture to yourself.

1145
01:17:32,368 --> 01:17:38,569
Crowded train, a young mangets up to give his seat to a young, pretty girl.

1146
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:41,412
She doesn't notice at first, and then...

1147
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:44,059
"Excuse me, miss. " Ah?

1148
01:17:47,488 --> 01:17:48,933
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

1149
01:17:49,008 --> 01:17:50,533
Oh dear, indeed.

1150
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:53,088
That would put the price of ticketsup on the Tube, wouldn't it, eh?

1151
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:05,252
isn't it looking a bit off to you?

1152
01:18:05,328 --> 01:18:07,490
Well, take him inside, then.

1153
01:18:07,568 --> 01:18:09,411
No-poking compartment.

1154
01:18:11,527 --> 01:18:14,007
Ah, lot's got in now, dear. Blowing up foggy.

1155
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:16,775
Here, here, here. Come here.

1156
01:18:16,848 --> 01:18:18,532
Turn round, darling.

1157
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:19,939
What?

1158
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:21,930
Pardon... Pardon me, miss.

1159
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,131
Rubber?

1160
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:34,732
Please go away.

1161
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:39,649
It's rubber.

1162
01:18:39,808 --> 01:18:42,857
It's rubber! Rubber!

1163
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:44,848
Gas.

1164
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,374
This is a killer fog, all right.Just like the old days.

1165
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:48,812
Eh? isn't it, eh?

1166
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:51,811
Hey! You'll enjoy this.It was horrible how they were gassed.

1167
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:10,933
Oh!

1168
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:12,578
My baby!

1169
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:15,492
My poor baby!

1170
01:19:16,247 --> 01:19:17,487
It's dead!

1171
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:22,095
Now, look, darling,we all know that Rupert was thing.

1172
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:26,616
It was our thing. Ours!We made it, Alan and I.

1173
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:30,691
It was the only thingI ever cared for in the whole world.

1174
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:36,577
Well, never mind, darling,we might someday make another.

1175
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:39,856
What a shame. What a shame.

1176
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:45,856
Here. Here, darling, I'll drink that silly,silly bottle of milk up for you.

1177
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:47,816
That's right.

1178
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:50,812
Hey! Look! He's already got the hang of it.

1179
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:53,731
Look, darling,why don't we adopt this one? Mmm?

1180
01:19:54,688 --> 01:19:58,374
Here we are. There's his rattle.Diddles want his rattle, then?

1181
01:19:58,448 --> 01:20:00,610
Diddles want his rattle?

1182
01:20:00,688 --> 01:20:02,099
Piss off!

1183
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:05,330
Listen, darling, his first words. "Piss off!“

1184
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:06,694
Piss off.

1185
01:20:24,688 --> 01:20:27,134
Sergeant, I think we've foundwhat we've been looking for.

1186
01:20:27,207 --> 01:20:33,374
Proceed in orderly fashion towards target,map reference 79, D-3 and remove same.

1187
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:43,008
The rubber! The rubber!

1188
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,011
It is the end of us, my friends!

1189
01:20:46,768 --> 01:20:50,136
Oh, yes! The end, my friends, is in sight!

1190
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:55,491
I carried little Rupert inside me for 17 monthsrather than let him out into this wicked world.

1191
01:20:58,048 --> 01:21:01,734
Yes, my friend, rubber. It is the end of us!

1192
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:03,811
Stretch and repent!

1193
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:07,090
It's because of the rubber,stretching his way around the world.

1194
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,898
Run, brothers, run!

1195
01:21:08,967 --> 01:21:11,618
The rubber will get you wherever you hide!

1196
01:21:11,687 --> 01:21:13,576
The rubber is come.

1197
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:16,128
Stretch, brothers, and repent!

1198
01:21:17,488 --> 01:21:21,095
We've provoked the hand and the foot,

1199
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:24,934
and the elbow, and the knees,and the teeth of God!

1200
01:21:25,008 --> 01:21:26,817
- Right, Sergeant.- Stand by, men.

1201
01:21:28,007 --> 01:21:31,614
That's why he dropped the bomb.

1202
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,327
The bomb?

1203
01:21:33,408 --> 01:21:34,409
The bomb!

1204
01:21:34,487 --> 01:21:36,410
- The bomb.- The bomb?

1205
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:37,898
The bomb!

1206
01:21:44,647 --> 01:21:45,648
Stop!

1207
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,099
Dear God!

1208
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:49,938
That's the fellow!

1209
01:21:51,008 --> 01:21:53,739
Stretch and repent all your wicked ways!

1210
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:56,334
Follow me and yo shall be saved!

1211
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:59,734
Run, brothers, run!

1212
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:03,052
We can all stretch and repent!

1213
01:22:03,888 --> 01:22:07,893
Stop!Stop! Stop in the name of the Lord!

1214
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,251
Here, it's God! it's God.He's come back on us.

1215
01:22:13,648 --> 01:22:15,252
Good old God, mate.

1216
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:18,218
# For he's a jolly good follow#

1217
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:20,452
He's a Socialist, you know.

1218
01:22:20,528 --> 01:22:22,849
Quiet, Labour scum!

1219
01:22:23,008 --> 01:22:24,498
What?

1220
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:27,696
He's... He's a bleeding Conservative.

1221
01:22:27,767 --> 01:22:29,815
Here, hold hard a minute,you don't sound like God,

1222
01:22:29,888 --> 01:22:31,174
you sound like Lord Fortnum.

1223
01:22:31,248 --> 01:22:33,455
I also do impressions.

1224
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:37,418
Save us, Lord God,from the dreadful death by radiation.

1225
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:38,933
Save us, oh, God,

1226
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:42,256
from the temptationsand perversions of the rubber.

1227
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:45,615
Save me and I'll give upbeing an atheist, Goddy.

1228
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:47,894
God, give me back my baby.

1229
01:22:48,727 --> 01:22:51,378
Yes, well, uh, yes indeed!

1230
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:54,610
In the fullness of timewe'll see what we can do.

1231
01:22:55,047 --> 01:22:56,492
Good, now well, um...

1232
01:22:56,567 --> 01:23:00,174
That's not God, that's Lord Fortnum,the well-known bed sitting room.

1233
01:23:00,688 --> 01:23:02,213
What? What? Lies!

1234
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:03,938
Captain Bules Martin!

1235
01:23:04,327 --> 01:23:06,136
That's God, I recognise the voice.

1236
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:10,734
A large brown substancehas come to our attention.

1237
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:23,731
Bules, darling! Say something!

1238
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:27,137
My God, Nigel! And alive!

1239
01:23:27,687 --> 01:23:30,418
You left me on a left luggage rack.

1240
01:23:30,487 --> 01:23:33,093
There's seventeen poundsseven shillings to pay, Bules Martin.

1241
01:23:33,168 --> 01:23:35,694
But apart from that,there are no further charges against you.

1242
01:23:35,767 --> 01:23:39,408
Provided that you have the immediate fundsabout your person, that is.

1243
01:23:39,488 --> 01:23:40,649
It is.

1244
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:42,693
Is it?

1245
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,612
- Another.- Due?

1246
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:49,410
I knew there was something in there.I'm going to be another mummy.

1247
01:23:49,687 --> 01:23:53,453
I expect you may be wondering whyI've invited you all here this afternoon.

1248
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,651
I've just comefrom an audience with Her Majesty,

1249
01:23:55,728 --> 01:23:57,298
Mrs Ethel Shroake.

1250
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,378
And I'm empowered by her to tell youthat in the future,

1251
01:24:00,448 --> 01:24:04,658
clouds of poisonous nuclear fogwill no longer be necessary.

1252
01:24:05,008 --> 01:24:07,409
Mutations will cease sine die.

1253
01:24:07,488 --> 01:24:10,412
And furthermore,I'm the bringer of glad tidings.

1254
01:24:11,248 --> 01:24:13,455
A team of surgeonsat the Woolwich Hospital

1255
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:18,249
have just accomplished the world's firstsuccessful complete body transplant.

1256
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,493
The donor was the entirepopulation of South Wales

1257
01:24:21,568 --> 01:24:24,253
and the new body is functioning normally.

1258
01:24:24,608 --> 01:24:28,499
I myself saw it sit up in bed,wink and ask for a glass of been

1259
01:24:28,967 --> 01:24:33,928
All in all, I think we're in for a time of peace,prosperity and stability,

1260
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:39,093
when the earth will burgeon forth anew,the lion will lie down with the lamb,

1261
01:24:39,168 --> 01:24:41,933
and the goat give suck to the tiny bee.

1262
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,336
At times of great national emergency,

1263
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:47,570
you'll often find that a new leadertends to emerge.

1264
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:50,733
Here I am. So watch it.

1265
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:54,258
Keep moving, everybody. That's the spirit.

1266
01:24:54,327 --> 01:24:56,011
Keep moving!

1267
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,657
Come on, Sergeant.

1268
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:21,128
Come on. Come on, Sarge. Come on, then.

1269
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:23,778
Come on. You can comewith us then, Sergeant.

1270
01:25:23,847 --> 01:25:27,613
This is BBC Television.I have great news for the country.

1271
01:25:27,687 --> 01:25:30,293
Great Britain is a first-classnuclear power again.

1272
01:25:53,968 --> 01:25:57,450
# God save Mrs Ethel Shroake

1273
01:25:57,527 --> 01:26:01,418
# Long live Mrs Ethel Shroake

1274
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:05,174
# God save Mrs Ethel Shroake

1275
01:26:05,248 --> 01:26:09,298
# Of 393A High Street, Leytonstone #

1276
01:26:10,727 --> 01:26:12,058
Good night.

1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,610
I got your permit right here.

2
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,160
Catchy tune.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,160
Fuck this game.

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,040
FUCK YOU!

5
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,380
We need backup,we need Kung Fury!

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,260
Yeah, that's my bicep.

7
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,900
One second babe.

8
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,860
Hello?

9
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,940
We got an arcade machinedown here going crazy,

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,140
it is killing everybody,it's destruction, chaos, terror-

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
What are you gonna do?

12
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,240
My job.

13
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Game over.

14
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm a cop anddamn good at my job.

15
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
It all began years ago.

16
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,590
In the line of duty,

17
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,160
me and my partner werechasing down

18
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,160
a mysterious Kung Fu-master.

19
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,000
You're under arrest, punk.

20
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,160
Show us your hands.

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,580
Good work, Dragon.

22
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
You could've killed both of uswith that crazy stunt

23
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,680
but goddammit, you're thebest partner I've ever had.

24
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,960
Thanks,I learned from the best.

25
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,660
You're like a father to me.

26
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,910
With one fatal blow,he hit my partner.

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,120
I could tellhe was dead straight off.

28
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,140
Before I could pull the trigger...

29
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,420
I was hit by lightningand bitten by a cobra.

30
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,080
I blacked out.

31
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,870
And saw images of ancientShaolin temples and monks,

32
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,840
mastering the art of Kung Fu.

33
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,710
There was an ancient prophecy,

34
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,210
about a new formof Kung Fu so powerful,

35
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,120
only one man could master it.

36
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
The chosen one.

37
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,500
When I woke up,

38
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,260
I saw the Kung Fu masterrunning towards me.

39
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,820
I could feel my body mutate

40
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,760
into some sort ofKung Fu freak of nature.

41
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,740
You!

42
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,710
You are the chosen one!

43
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,780
- Knock, knock.- Who's there?

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Knuckles.

45
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,180
As a memento,

46
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,500
I put on a strip of clothfrom the dead Kung Fu master.

47
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,480
I decided I would usemy new super Kung Fu powers

48
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,580
to fight crime.

49
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,740
So, I becamethe best cop in the world.

50
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,040
I became, Kung Fury.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,840
I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.

52
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,540
I just got back from city hall,$50 million worth of damages,

53
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,940
and I got the mayor upmy ass like a fag on Viagra.

54
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,840
How am I going to explainthis to the press, hmm?

55
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,240
You just destroyed an entirecity block for Christ's sake.

56
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,160
Didn't you tell meto block it out?

57
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,090
I told you do it by the book.

58
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,260
Cut the bullshit.

59
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,890
Nobody else could have stopped

60
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,960
that arcade machineand you know it.

61
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,060
Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,670
You need to start followingthe rules like the rest of us,

63
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,770
so I'm assigning youa new partner.

64
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,800
What?Hell no, I work alone.

65
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,470
Not anymore you don't.

66
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,020
Say hi to your new partner,Triceracop.

67
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,250
Very nice meeting you Kung Fury,

68
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,480
looking forward toworking with you.

69
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
You're like a father to me.

70
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
I work alone.

71
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,420
Either you team upwith Triceracop,

72
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
or you're off the case.

73
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,540
I'm not off the case,

74
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
I quit.

75
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah Yeah, I did the blood test.

76
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,140
It was positive, yeah?

77
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,250
What the hellare you talking about?

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah no problem.

79
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,280
Give me the phone.

80
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
What the hell is this?

81
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,060
- Chief McNickles speaking.- Is this the police?

82
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,060
- Yeah, this is the police.- Fuck you!

83
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,680
MALFUNCTIONING?

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,700
I need someoneto trace that call!

85
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,640
But that's impossible!

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,540
Not for me it isn't.

87
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,070
Hackerman, he's the mostpowerful hacker of all time.

88
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,440
Follow me.

89
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,260
I was able to triangulatethe cell phone signal

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,420
and trace the caller.

91
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,520
His name is Adolf Hitler.

92
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,520
Hitler, he's the worstcriminal of all time.

93
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,720
Do you know him, sir?

94
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
I guess you could say that.

95
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,440
In the 1940's,Hitler was a Kung Fu champion.

96
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,260
He was so good at Kung Fu,

97
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,920
that he decided to changehis name to Kung Fuhrer.

98
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,360
But he didn't stop there.

99
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,640
He knew ofthe Kung Fury prophecy,

100
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,440
and wanted to claim the throne.

101
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,740
So he and his posse ofNazi soldiers

102
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,740
conducted experimentsfor years.

103
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,600
But they weren't ableto figure out

104
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,160
how to master the artof Kung Fury.

105
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,900
And one day,

106
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,000
he disappearedfrom the face of the earth.

107
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,740
And no-one has seen himever since.

108
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,300
Until now.

109
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
I guess he figured if he couldfind the chosen one and kill him,

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,140
he would becomeKung Fury himself.

111
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,320
He must have traveled in timein order to get here,

112
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,960
that's probably why hedisappeared in the first place.

113
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,820
So, what're you gonna do?

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,120
My job.

115
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm gonna go back in timeto Nazi Germany,

116
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
and kill Hitler,once and for all.

117
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,000
So, how are you gonna do that?

118
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm not sure.

119
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,060
I need some sort oftime machine.

120
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,880
Wait a minute,

121
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,740
using an RX modulator,I might be able to conduct

122
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,630
a mainframe cell direct andhack the uplink to the download.

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,560
What does that mean?

124
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,270
It means that with the right computeralgorithms, I can hack you back in time.

125
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
Just like a time machine.

126
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,540
Well then, it's hacking time.

127
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,860
Oh, no!

128
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,960
Fuck!

129
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,340
That's a Laser-Raptor.

130
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,720
I thought they went extinctthousands of years ago.

131
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,480
Who are you?

132
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
My name,

133
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
is Barbarianna.

134
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
What year is this?

135
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
It's the Viking age.

136
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,860
That explains the Laser-Raptor.Fuck!

137
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,700
I went too far back in time.

138
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,920
You need to get outof this valley.

139
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,640
This place is swarmingwith Laser-Raptors.

140
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,760
I'll meet you at the God's drop.Katana can help you get there.

141
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,100
Who's Katana?

142
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm Katana.

143
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,420
I can give you a ride to Asgard.

144
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,080
A ride on what?

145
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,460
So, who are you?

146
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm a cop from the future.

147
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,340
I was sent back in timeto kill Hitler,

148
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,000
but I accidentally wenttoo far back in time

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
and ended up in this place.

150
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,720
I know someonewho might be able to help you.

151
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,960
Thor!

152
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,380
Behold! It is me, Thor!

153
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,520
Son of Odinand protector of mankind.

154
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,420
Check out my pecs.

155
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,860
Your pecs are epic.

156
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,160
Thanks bro!

157
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,200
So, anyway.

158
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,060
Thor, this is Kung Fury,he's a cop from the future.

159
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah, I need to get toNazi Germany and kill Hitler...

160
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,040
- so if you could help me with--- Stop!

161
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,240
Hammer time.

162
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,820
Walk through this portal andyou shall end up in Nazi Germany.

163
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
Good luck to you, Kung Fury!

164
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,800
Thanks Thor!

165
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,860
Well,looks like this is my ride.

166
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,080
Hey, future cop,where are you going?

167
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
You know what.Here, take my number.

168
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,120
And use this phone to call me.

169
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
It's a personal, transportable,cellular telephone.

170
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,980
It features 645 channelcapacity,

171
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,460
10 number speed dial,and an electronic security lock.

172
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,000
This revolution in communicationcould make it possible

173
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,960
for more and more peopleto have a phone in their car!

174
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,940
Tank you.

175
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,040
I am the greatest Kung Fu masterof all time,

176
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,460
right guys?

177
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,380
Thank you!

178
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm disarming you.

179
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,660
My arm! My arm!

180
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,680
Kill him!

181
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,120
You don't need that spine,

182
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
it's holding your back!

183
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,700
A-ha!

184
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,340

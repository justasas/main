1
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:44,919
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

2
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:56,116
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!Nuclear com-force to main engine room!

3
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:05,996
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

4
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,623
What is it like,the planet we're approaching?

5
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:48,666
Nothing but ice and snow.A barren desert of whiteness.

6
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,774
Scan it with our computer waves.

7
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,737
The enemy's weapons may behidden beneath its surface.

8
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:42,940
Aha!Looks like the cops.

9
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,715
As Thor, chief of the imperial police,

10
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,203
I order you to surrender at once

11
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,148
Stella, you cheap smuggler

12
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,991
I am police robot M.

13
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,003
You have the right to remain silent.

14
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,877
Go for hyper space.

15
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,536
Let's hope this star-buggy stays together.

16
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,073
What's our chances?40% total disintegration..

17
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,164
30% molecular ignition..

18
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,264
..20% gamma contamination.

19
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,319
You are very reassuringI assume that means -

20
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,504
we have a 10% chanceof making it.

21
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:36,078
Not really!3% structural collapse

22
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:38,160
3%...Alright Alright!

23
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,004
Just keep on courseand get ready

24
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:42,004
to reenter normal space.

25
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,023
Ready when you are.

26
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,276
We've done it!We've done it!

27
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,376
Not quite. Look!The Nutrant star!

28
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:01,966
If it gets a hold on us,it'll crush us.

29
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,302
Prepare to releaseAth-Power stage.

30
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:15,823
Eject!Eject!

31
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,927
Ha Ha!We made it.

32
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,515
Plot us a new course,so that cop cant find us.

33
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,026
Even as you speak.It's been taken care of.

34
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,355
There's the borderof the haunted stars.

35
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,439
If we'd traveledone second further,

36
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,777
we would have wound upright beside them.

37
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:46,635
What in the universe is that?

38
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,878
It's a spaceship.

39
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,067
No, its a launch.

40
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,693
Their power is totally down.

41
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,999
Maybe they're wounded,

42
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,099
to weak to send a signal.

43
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,299
I'm gonna have a look.

44
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,541
What's the radiation level?

45
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,002
Normal.The hull isn't damaged.

46
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,907
I'm going inside.

47
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,735
Is everything alright?

48
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,403
Yes!

49
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,103
Wait a minute..There's someone here.

50
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,003
He looks like he's hurt pretty bad,

51
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,433
but he's alive

52
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,275
I'll try to get him back to the ship.

53
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,375
I'll help you bring him aboard.

54
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:25,127
He's dehydrated.

55
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,753
Suffering from exhaustion.

56
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,833
But the launch was full of supplies.Everything he could have needed.

57
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,193
He's also in chock.

58
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,775
He keeps talking about monsters....Red monsters

59
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,990
He wants us to alert someone..Urgently.

60
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:43,098
Who?

61
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,078
The Emperorof the first circle of the universe.

62
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,081
It's the emblem of the chiefofficers of the imperial navy.

63
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,778
I'd say red hot potatoes forsmall time smugglers on the run like us.

64
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:03,752
We'll, what do we do?

65
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,626
You go to prison, Stella star.

66
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,500
Your leap throughhyperspace didn’t fool us.

67
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:11,219
Your friction trail was easy to follow.

68
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,016
Hehehe..

69
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,237
You are completelysurrounded by fighter ships.

70
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,213
This time you've won.

71
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,279
We surrender.

72
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,620
There won't be a next time, Stella Star!

73
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:31,153
Don't worry.We'll get out of this.

74
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,613
My Lord!

75
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:20,269
Yes. What is it Ellrik?

76
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,797
They found one damned survivor.

77
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,810
Right now, the imperial shuttle shiphas taken him to their medical centre.

78
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,042
But his brain seems tobe thoroughly damaged

79
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,425
He will be of no help to them,to find the ship.

80
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,823
Mhmm..

81
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:50,598
Come to me, Golem!

82
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,124
I have a simple task for you.

83
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:16,999
You must not fail me.

84
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:32,240
Therefore, the great machinesof the central operating system..

85
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,410
..of imperial justice hereby sentence you,

86
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,380
Akton, of ninth Vega..

87
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,002
..to 220 years hard labor

88
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:48,070
in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd.

89
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,763
As for you, Stella Star,

90
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,938
having considered all the arguments..

91
00:13:57,038 --> 00:14:00,338
Studied all the Video-tapes,the accusations..

92
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:05,063
..we condemn you to forced labor for life..

93
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:08,960
..in the penal colony..

94
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,510
..of Nocturne the 2nd

95
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,599
This session is hereby adjourned.

96
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:20,445
Throw the radium into the furnace.

97
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:21,874
Careful now.

98
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,164
I said let's go, move!

99
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,308
Faster!

100
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,158
Move, Let's go!

101
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,932
Will you step it up!

102
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,520
Here! You can move faster than that!

103
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,046
Careful with that Radium.

104
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:39,412
Will you move!Move down those stairs!

105
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,924
Throw it the furnace!

106
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,024
Do what I tell you!

107
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:46,824
Where do you think you are.We haven't got all day!

108
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,999
Alright, 5 minutes of rest

109
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,727
Move quickly now!

110
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,627
Prisoners get back to their posts!Let's go!

111
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,927
Come on quickly now!

112
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,501
Let's go!

113
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,977
I've been at this for 12 straight hours..

114
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,202
..the radiation will burn my skin off.

115
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,097
Were not slaves.

116
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:13,203
You'd better work.

117
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:16,024
If you don’t want the taste of the burningof their energy whips too.

118
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,634
But there must be a way to escape.

119
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,227
There will be a way, you know.

120
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,294
Blow ups happen.

121
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,967
If I could only succeedin overfeeding the furnace.

122
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,279
But overfeed it with what?

123
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:30,884
Energy!

124
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,061
Then a gun ray could be enough.

125
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,465
Planing an escape!

126
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,089
This is what you're gonna get, lady!

127
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,313
You can drop the riffle-ray.

128
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:06,470
Now turn around.

129
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:10,685
You!

130
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,849
I bet you never expected to see me here.

131
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,586
And you too.

132
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,990
Poor Stella.Your escape efforts have been wasted.

133
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,449
OK.

134
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:23,691
I've lost again.

135
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:26,444
We were sent to free you,your sentence has been cancelled.

136
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,531
Have you both gone mad?

137
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:31,547
I only have logic animotion circuits.No room for craziness.

138
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:34,243
Well, I've been assignedto a top secret imperial mission,

139
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,452
we must now leave and set Akton free.

140
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,034
There, he's yours

141
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:48,841
My gift to you.

142
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,068
Would I lie to you?

143
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,012
Look, it is the imperial flagship.

144
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,665
Akton, you are gonna meetsome real royalty.

145
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:30,527
He's here!There is his holographic image.

146
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:46,672
His Highness; The emperorof the first circle of the universe.

147
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:52,354
I come to you because my faithful robot,Elle, has told me..

148
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:56,163
..that you are the only onewho could save us.

149
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,860
You know, you mustbe the best pilot in the whole galaxy..

150
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,738
..and you Akton, the best navigator.

151
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:09,101
Stella, our galaxy is split..

152
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,554
..into 2 waring factions.

153
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:17,105
Our own andthe one ruled by the evil count..

154
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:21,287
..Zarth Arn!From the league of the dark worlds.

155
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:26,880
Recently we've begun to receive troublesomereports from our spies among the league.

156
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:31,776
They have informed usthat the count has created a weapon..

157
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,706
..a new, limitless weapon.

158
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,626
A Weapon so vast, so huge..

159
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:43,246
..that it would takea whole planet to conceal it.

160
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:47,408
That is why we sent the mission ship.

161
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,685
Did they find the planet?

162
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:52,519
The ship came so close..

163
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,629
..so close..

164
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,172
..to discovering the counts secret..

165
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:03,764
.. when it was suddenly attackedby a horde of unknown monsters.

166
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:07,229
We had assumed it was destroyed,

167
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:09,240
we lost all hope.

168
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:15,136
Until you found the launch from that ship.

169
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:18,046
And now, with the utmost secrecy..

170
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:23,954
..you must sail to the haunted stars.

171
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,841
You must find that ship.

172
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:30,827
Find the counts secret

173
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,191
planet and destroy it.

174
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,330
There's something else.

175
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,079
When you complete the mission..

176
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,370
.. search for the commander..

177
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:50,224
..of that missing ship.

178
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:57,364
He was my only son.

179
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,385
The first possibility is the Origa system.

180
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,533
Also know as the worlds asleep.

181
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,102
But this system is still within our galaxy

182
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,642
and we should've found it by now.

183
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,376
The same also appliesto the white sun of Ohzon

184
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,082
so only the third possibility remains:

185
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,909
The heart of the haunted stars.

186
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:48,357
An unknown planet named..

187
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:50,141
Euraphas!

188
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,121
Well, shall we begin our search?

189
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,723
Lets go!

190
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,885
The distance we must travel is enormous.

191
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:01,149
By using hyperspace,what would normally take 2 months to reach

192
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:03,262
We should do in 2 hours.

193
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,474
Everything ready?Ready! Right!

194
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:12,083
Every time I go into hyperspaceI get nervous.

195
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,783
Prepare for re-entry to normal space.

196
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:35,481
We've arrived!

197
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:53,263
Its not very far from here.You can reach by using the space shuttle.

198
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,278
Thor and I will wait for you there.Hidden in that canyon.

199
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:02,219
So that were ready in case of anothersurprise attack of the count.

200
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,285
That sounds fine with me.

201
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:06,963
Is there air out there?

202
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,768
Yeah. Yeah you can breathe.

203
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:11,981
Alright. lets go!Follow me!

204
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:20,457
I'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship.The controls are easy!

205
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:22,638
Now watch your step right here.

206
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,732
Take care.

207
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,536
You alright?You bet. Lets go.

208
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:57,333
Don't you think were a little low?I haven't been programmed to walk on water.

209
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,182
Ohh me. water makes me so nervous

210
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,344
Everything makes you nervous.

211
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:07,197
It's the launch.Lets land.

212
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,006
OK! Take it in easy.

213
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,835
Shuttle to star-ship!We are landing now.

214
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,411
Roger. Out.

215
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,430
My seat-belt’s stuck.

216
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:25,631
Oh Elle, come on!

217
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,732
Take it easy, I'm coming.

218
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:33,706
Look at that!

219
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:35,030
Amazing!

220
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,662
It's almost buried.

221
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,829
The impact was tremendous.

222
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,222
I doubt if anyone could have survived.

223
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:49,572
The nuclear exhaust portshave been gutted by fire.

224
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:54,841
We'd better look around.

225
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:56,746
What's that?

226
00:26:57,976 --> 00:26:59,424
I don't know.

227
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:14,446
Seems to be a planetary artifact.

228
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,779
Well, it certainly is an antique.

229
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:18,892
Looks like some sort of Laser spear.

230
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,808
This planet is inhabited.

231
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:23,773
We must be very careful.

232
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,995
We are in the evil counts domain.

233
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,908
These stars are extremely farand remote, even for him.

234
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,117
Probably they've set upa fully independent kind of civilization.

235
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:41,419
We're wasting time. We'd betterstart looking for the missing crew.

236
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,697
Come on. Lets go this way.

237
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:48,190
Look!Amazons on horseback.

238
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:50,241
I hope they are friendly.

239
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,487
We'll soon find out.

240
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:08,983
Take my revenge.

241
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:13,188
Kill 'em.

242
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,590
Die robot.

243
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:33,134
You'll pay for this -All of you!

244
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,121
Don't make us kill you.

245
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,454
Come on!

246
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,181
Stop!There is no escape.

247
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,770
Take your hands off of me.

248
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,119
Let me go.

249
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:03,881
Get your hands off of me.Let me go.

250
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,310
Queen Querrelia. Thisis the spy we captured.

251
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,136
She came through the forbidden sea.

252
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,576
You're a spy.

253
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,799
As the men from the launch were too.

254
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:22,362
But nothingis going to stop the count anymore.

255
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:26,492
Even if you had passed by this world..

256
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,858
..you'd neverbe able to discover the counts planet.

257
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:36,988
Two packs of murdering guardians are thereto watch and protect it from intruders.

258
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,711
..and now:Put her into the mind probe.

259
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,305
No! No!

260
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:44,992
Hold it right there!

261
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,242
Elle!

262
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:49,912
Release her or I'll blast your queen.

263
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:51,063
I mean it.

264
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,992
Come on now.

265
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,015
Don’t you people move or you are dead.

266
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:01,410
Give me the trouble and I'mgonna clean out your sinuses real good lady

267
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,078
Now you stand there.

268
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:04,903
Ok, Close the door.

269
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,868
Don’t you follow us now.

270
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,031
Stop them!Stop them!

271
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:15,936
Behind you!

272
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,407
Come on, lets go!

273
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:21,947
Elle you're terrific.I didn't know you had it in you.

274
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,737
Where's the release mechanism?

275
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,149
It's jammed!

276
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:33,296
Take cover!

277
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,046
Here goes the last shot.

278
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:39,882
Full power!

279
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:43,963
Come on, lets go!

280
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:45,728
Hurry! Hurry!!

281
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,118
Guardian..

282
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,656
..take my revenge.

283
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,534
Kill them.

284
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:08,628
Look!

285
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,562
Whoa!Run for your life!

286
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:15,564
There! That narrowpassage in the rocks.

287
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,362
Come on Stella, run!

288
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,159
Hurry!

289
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:05,176
Oh! Elle!

290
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,053
We better move!

291
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,256
The amazon air-fighters will be here soon.

292
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:33,914
Quick, to the ship!

293
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:51,879
They're attacking.I'll man the laser-canon.

294
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,046
Specter 7..Fire!

295
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,866
Ok, get ready.Here they come.

296
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,972
Power is up to full battle speed.

297
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,257
You!

298
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:24,255
Why don't you come back now?

299
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:27,363
Here they come. Specter 3.

300
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,445
Alright.We've got them!

301
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:41,734
Fire! Fire!

302
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:43,695
Yeah!

303
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,853
One more.There's one more!

304
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,569
We've got 'em.

305
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,706
Watch out on the right.

306
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:58,364
We're down from 6 to 5.

307
00:33:58,713 --> 00:33:59,713
Get ready.

308
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,003
More to the left.

309
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:12,803
Steady.

310
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:14,497
Then fire 5.

311
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,114
Then 6.

312
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,678
Fire the laser-canon, robot.Fire!

313
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,598
Yeah! Hahaa!

314
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:23,175
We got it!

315
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:28,431
We're holding.

316
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:32,651
Now!

317
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,940
8 ships approaching from the right. Fire!

318
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:41,767
Alright, we've won.We did it.

319
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,907
I found the positionsto both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship.

320
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,818
The mother-ship is closestso we'll check it out first.

321
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:03,515
It's here.

322
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,864
On the 3rd planetof the next solar system.

323
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,889
I've never been there.

324
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:10,956
What's it like?

325
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:14,092
Red fogs, high winds, low gravity.

326
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,660
The air is breathable.

327
00:35:16,842 --> 00:35:18,707
And the atmospheric conditions are stable.

328
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,310
However..

329
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:24,076
The entire planetis covered with ice and snow.

330
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:27,923
And you mustbe extremely careful when the sun sets.

331
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:30,289
The temperature dropsthousands of degrees.

332
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:32,729
And in an instant, everything freezes over.

333
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:10,457
What a terrible crash.

334
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:12,910
No-one could have survived.

335
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:19,354
Do you see any signs of the emperors son?

336
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,698
If he's in the middle of all this

337
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:25,032
I don't even knowif his own mother would recognize him.

338
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,846
Then it's all over.

339
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,449
There's no hope of everfinding the counts secret fortress.

340
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,944
There's still the third launch.

341
00:36:37,383 --> 00:36:39,898
It's probablylost out in the stars, who knows?

342
00:36:40,758 --> 00:36:43,750
Anyway, it's uselessto raise false hopes.

343
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:45,905
It's been too long.

344
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,349
And this galaxy is wild and hostile.

345
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:51,166
Come on Elle, lets go back to the ship.

346
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,664
We'd better hurry.

347
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:57,315
We're running out of timeand our power-packs are nearly finished.

348
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:58,831
Let's get rid of them.

349
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,363
It's gonna be a long walk back.

350
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,754
My feet are already cold.

351
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,920
It's times like thesei'm glad to be a robot.

352
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,323
What's the matter with you, Akton?

353
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,480
Well, I'm just refining my powers.

354
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,623
And what's your problem,ships-computer, huh!

355
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:52,261
Is everything alright with Stella and Elle?

356
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,452
I'm not worried about them.

357
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:56,654
I'm just waiting.

358
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,712
Your waiting is over.

359
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:14,094
At last Thor.You have some good news for me?

360
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:17,301
Yes Excellency.I have killed the alien pathfinder..

361
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,029
..and taken over this ship.

362
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:21,592
What of Stella Star?

363
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:24,758
And that tin policeman.

364
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,798
This planetwill take care of them, Excellency.

365
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:29,430
Good!

366
00:38:29,992 --> 00:38:33,072
And I await your immediate arrival.

367
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,688
Elle, how much further?

368
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,910
We should be close.Just a few more radiants.

369
00:38:57,175 --> 00:39:00,509
Ships-computer!Why aren't the main engines firing?

370
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,851
There is a malfunction.

371
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,310
A malfunction?

372
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:09,150
Where?

373
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,576
I am not programmed for this malfunction.

374
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:47,338
Akton!We're here!

375
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,521
Akton! Thor!Let us in. The sun is setting.

376
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:03,704
That's exactly why I'm not letting you in.

377
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:07,039
Soon you'll be dead andI'll be gone from this planet.

378
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,439
Have you gone crazy? Open this hatch!

379
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:11,614
No!

380
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,169
Where's Akton?

381
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,135
Akton is dead.

382
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:17,547
And I'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn..

383
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:19,628
..as the prince of the League of Darkness.

384
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,926
Thor, a traitor?I cannot believe it.

385
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,846
I cannot trustmy own logic circuits anymore.

386
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,391
He fooled me too.

387
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:35,010
It's no use. We're gonna freeze.

388
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:37,603
Maybe not.Maybe I can save you.

389
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,666
Let's stop here.

390
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:41,143
Now you lie down in the snow, face up.

391
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:42,735
Okay.

392
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:52,016
Now give me your handso I can monitor your temperature.

393
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,088
I can use my energyto keep your heart working.

394
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:00,421
You'll be in a stateof suspended animation.

395
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:02,116
Elle!

396
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,878
As an opponent, I always knewyou were programmed to never give up.

397
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,006
Which was infuriating.

398
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:14,246
But now that quality..

399
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,386
..must be..

400
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:18,441
..best.

401
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:21,429
You are the most faithful companiona woman ever had.

402
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:23,810
And I too, respect you, Stella.

403
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,104
You are the nicest human being I've known.

404
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:30,255
Now, maybe, is a good timeto use your ancient system of prayer.

405
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:32,532
And hope it works for robots, as well.

406
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,487
Goodbye my friend.

407
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,709
Goodbye for now, Stella.

408
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,007
You were expected here hours ago!

409
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:06,452
I've been delayed by a malfunction.

410
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,793
I don't tolerate malfunctions..

411
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,127
..or inefficiency here in my realm

412
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:17,268
How long will the delay be?

413
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:19,974
I think a very long time.

414
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:22,728
You shouldn't try taking offwithout asking me first.

415
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:25,609
This time I'll make sure you are dead.

416
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,502
I'll fix you.

417
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:18,553
Alright Akton.This is it.

418
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,617
Say goodbye.

419
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:22,029
What?

420
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:24,785
Stop!

421
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:26,754
Put down the gun.

422
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:27,800
Stop!

423
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:30,397
No-one can survive these deadly rays.

424
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:35,305
Those deadly rays will be your death.

425
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:49,643
Elle?

426
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,199
Elle, do you read me?

427
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,651
This is Akton.I've taken over the ship.

428
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,548
Do you read me?

429
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,223
Her pulse rate is 16.

430
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:16,675
She may survive if you can use your powersand bring her back slowly.

431
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:18,722
Careful now.

432
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,620
Close the hatch.

433
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:18,770
Look! It's working!

434
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:20,652
She's going to make it.

435
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:44,904
Come on Stella!

436
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,175
Whats wrong?

437
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,548
The main engines will not fire.

438
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:15,484
Thor must have tried everything.

439
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,231
What are we gonna do now?

440
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:20,579
So..We get out of one mess..

441
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:22,443
..just to find ourselves in another.

442
00:46:22,468 --> 00:46:23,499
Not necessarily.

443
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,928
What do you mean?We are stuck!

444
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:28,328
Even the transmitter is out of order.

445
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:30,987
We can take off immediately.

446
00:46:31,503 --> 00:46:32,709
Take off?How?

447
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:37,443
The ship is not operating,simply because I borrowed this reactor.

448
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:48,233
Then you knew about Thor.

449
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:49,855
Yes I did.

450
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,474
So you see into the future.

451
00:46:54,554 --> 00:46:56,601
All these years you never told me.

452
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,696
Think of all the troubleI might have avoided

453
00:46:59,721 --> 00:47:01,562
You have tried to change the future.

454
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,745
Which is against the law.

455
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:05,737
So therefore, I can tell you nothing.

456
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,484
Let's find the 3rd launch.

457
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:10,016
Akton, you are something else!

458
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:12,341
Yes.Time is running out.

459
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,831
Lets go!

460
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:47,878
We're arriving.

461
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:50,725
That's the planet Demundia.

462
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:53,855
There in barren landand wast emptiness

463
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,655
we'll find the 3rd launch.

464
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,504
Somethings wrong.

465
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,901
Everything has stopped.

466
00:48:01,926 --> 00:48:02,941
What's happening?

467
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:04,124
Power failure!

468
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:15,044
My circuits!My circuits are failing.

469
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:18,129
We've been hit.By an energy beam.

470
00:48:23,828 --> 00:48:25,899
I am out of control.

471
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:27,741
Look!

472
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,401
What is it?

473
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,290
It must be the Counts weapon!

474
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:37,623
Oh my head, oh!

475
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:55,804
Fire, you stupid robot!Fire!

476
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:06,292
What's happening?

477
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:26,269
Here, let me help you.

478
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,899
The attack is over.You'll be alright.

479
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,912
I thought I was gonna go insane.

480
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:33,651
We've just survived an attack

481
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:36,238
of the most powerful weaponin the entire galaxy.

482
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:00,701
If Akton's calculationsare correct

483
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:02,799
we should find the launch this way.

484
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:06,637
In a crater just over..

485
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:08,105
There!

486
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,138
Oh me!

487
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:42,400
Don't say it. Don't sayI know..

488
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:44,400
Steam makes you nervous.

489
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:46,834
No, no! Not really.

490
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:49,324
Why should I be nervous?

491
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:52,366
There is nothingto be afraid of round here.

492
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:08,673
Looks totally wreckedbut it's definitely the third launch.

493
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:09,951
I'd better go down.

494
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:13,774
No, I insist.Time for a little robot-chauvinism.

495
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,243
You stay here.

496
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:17,351
Be careful Elle.

497
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:20,041
You do not have to worry about me!

498
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:06,068
Release her!

499
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:10,967
Let me down!

500
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,443
Help!

501
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:16,078
Help!

502
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:49,286
Help!

503
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,350
Don't.. Don't..

504
00:54:10,816 --> 00:54:11,840
Relax.

505
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:13,467
Take it easy.I'll cut you down.

506
00:54:18,473 --> 00:54:19,275
There.

507
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:20,790
You're free.

508
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:31,743
That was a little too close for comfort.

509
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:32,641
Come on.

510
00:54:33,164 --> 00:54:33,958
Come on!

511
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:57,527
We rest here.

512
00:54:57,947 --> 00:54:59,241
This is safe.

513
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:09,897
Who are you?

514
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,579
This is an energy-shield mask.

515
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,099
And the amount of energy is limited.

516
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,138
My name is Simon.

517
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,844
I'm the only survivorfrom the wreck of an imperial mission.

518
00:55:33,216 --> 00:55:34,264
Are you really?

519
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,075
We've been searching for youall through these damned haunted stars.

520
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:39,792
Why?

521
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,869
The emperor's orderswere to find the Count's phantom planet

522
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,324
and to destroy it.

523
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,022
So you know about the monsters?

524
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,340
Yes I do.

525
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:50,994
But it's useless.

526
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:54,589
We did not succeedin find the planet either.

527
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:57,854
And now there's no time left.

528
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,831
The cavemen will waiting for us.

529
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,818
Alright, stay very close and very quiet.

530
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:23,702
Oh, this way looks safe.

531
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:31,943
This way.

532
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:58,485
Simon!

533
00:57:20,776 --> 00:57:21,554
No!

534
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:32,809
Akton!

535
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:01,587
You alright?

536
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,496
Akton, thank god you got here in time.

537
00:58:05,473 --> 00:58:06,877
You must've known all along.

538
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,586
By the way, this is Simon.

539
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:12,824
The only survivorfrom the imperial mission.

540
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,383
We owe you our lives.

541
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:16,113
Now maybe..

542
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:18,850
..with your help, we can stillfind the Count's phantom planet

543
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,754
Lets go aboard your shipand continue on at once.

544
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,596
There's no need to continue.

545
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,093
Have you gone crazy?

546
00:58:25,775 --> 00:58:28,902
That's our primary mission: Tofind the planet and destroy it.

547
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:31,077
I know,but we've already found it.

548
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:32,719
Think about it.

549
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,608
Then you'll understand thatthis is the Count's planet.

550
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,043
Remember what the Amazon queen said:

551
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:42,575
A planet occupiedby two packs of evil defenders.

552
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:45,212
The first we met while in space.

553
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:46,339
The red monsters.

554
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:48,284
And the second..

555
00:58:48,419 --> 00:58:49,641
Right here. The Troglodytes.

556
00:58:50,387 --> 00:58:53,355
And there’s no question about it.This is the planet!

557
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:54,942
This?

558
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:56,990
That's incredible.

559
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,132
I was here and I didn't even realise it.

560
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:01,081
There's no way you could have.

561
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:04,212
Anyway, we proceed at onceand destroy all that machinery.

562
00:59:04,237 --> 00:59:05,181
Right?

563
00:59:05,633 --> 00:59:06,435
Right.

564
00:59:52,262 --> 00:59:54,313
There is the doorthat'll take us to the machinery.

565
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:02,227
This is the Counts secret domain.

566
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:05,283
The very heart of the phantom planer.

567
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,382
From here he plan to controlthe entire universe.

568
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:11,980
This is incredible.

569
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,466
Where is everybody?

570
01:00:13,855 --> 01:00:15,569
Everything is set in our destiny.

571
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,811
Soon you'll know all the answers.

572
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,039
This will takeus to operation headquarters.

573
01:00:46,253 --> 01:00:47,412
After you, my dear.

574
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,695
Here's the nerve centerof the entire operation.

575
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,727
This is unbelievable.

576
01:00:58,938 --> 01:01:00,025
Fantastic.

577
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:04,287
Pre-programmed computers.They could run forever.

578
01:01:04,955 --> 01:01:07,094
All these power modules,what are they for?

579
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:10,942
This is the forcethat projected the red monsters into space.

580
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,477
Then this is the waythey produced real monsters?

581
01:01:15,418 --> 01:01:17,045
No. Not real.

582
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,910
The monsters never existed.

583
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:22,816
These machines discharged mentalprojections of monsters in our brains

584
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,794
There's the control-panel.

585
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,012
Well, destiny must take it's course.

586
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:48,845
No, we can't allow this to happen.

587
01:01:49,283 --> 01:01:51,553
We must destroy it, at once.

588
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:17,838
You've been very lucky.

589
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,520
And clever.

590
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:23,320
You survived every trapthat I'd lay for you.

591
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:27,864
Then I realized that your successwould become my triumph.

592
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:30,759
How much time is left, Captain?

593
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,514
Half a quadrant to go, My-lord.

594
01:02:35,724 --> 01:02:37,336
You hear?

595
01:02:37,665 --> 01:02:39,824
In less than an hours time

596
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:42,435
All that'll be left of this planet

597
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,784
Will be ashes and cosmic dust.

598
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:46,839
Forever.

599
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:52,303
Then you will be among the dead.

600
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,012
The emperor will make you pay for this.

601
01:02:56,037 --> 01:02:58,104
The Emperor?

602
01:02:58,668 --> 01:03:00,374
I forgot to inform you..

603
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:05,911
..that the Emperor will beblown to pieces along with the rest of you.

604
01:03:07,173 --> 01:03:07,983
Yes!

605
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,808
I told the emperorthat we had found you on this planet.

606
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:16,221
He's on his way here now, at top speed.

607
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,371
He'll get here just in time..

608
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,830
..to join the fireworks.

609
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:26,814
I'm sorry, your highness.

610
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,489
You've lost.

611
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:29,799
Highness?

612
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:31,535
Forgive me Stella.

613
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:35,043
But in the beginningI didn't know whose side you were on.

614
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:39,262
And after-wardsI didn't know how to tell you

615
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:42,884
Yes, he is Simon, son of the Emperorand heir to the throne.

616
01:03:52,851 --> 01:03:57,938
You two are to prevent themfrom leaving this room at all cost.

617
01:03:58,749 --> 01:04:01,638
You will stay with them until the end.

618
01:04:03,192 --> 01:04:04,446
Kill them..

619
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:06,350
..if you have to.

620
01:04:23,938 --> 01:04:26,580
Now it will be just a matter of waiting.

621
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,516
An hour goes by quickly.

622
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:50,055
We've got to get past those golems.

623
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:51,697
Yes, but how?

624
01:04:58,011 --> 01:04:59,106
Have faith.

625
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,583
And never give up hope.

626
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:51,420
Look out!

627
01:07:10,525 --> 01:07:12,652
We are now approaching Demundia.

628
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,765
All crewmen to landing stations.

629
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,162
All crewmen to landing stations.

630
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:40,160
Don't worry.Don't worry.

631
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:42,637
You and the prince will live.

632
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:45,988
Akton, you've got to get up.

633
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:47,726
We must get away from here.

634
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:51,690
I shall remain here.

635
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:53,929
Please get up, please.

636
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:58,074
I'm no longer useful at this time.

637
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,628
You're talking nonsense.You can heal yourself in no time at all.

638
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:04,326
No.

639
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:07,297
I must obey destiny.

640
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:09,000
Akton!

641
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,027
We'll carry you.

642
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,615
Go.

643
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:14,338
It's your duty.

644
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,861
You must live.

645
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:21,696
I can't.

646
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:22,942
I can't leave you.

647
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,068
You're the only human-likefriend I ever had.

648
01:08:26,504 --> 01:08:28,964
I don't understand. You never die.

649
01:08:29,099 --> 01:08:30,797
Stella, Stella.

650
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:32,685
I've accomplished the mission.

651
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:33,806
Yes, but I..

652
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:37,626
Others are coming.Even as I speak they'll rescue you.

653
01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:40,634
Don't worry.

654
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,872
I'll live forever.

655
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:47,996
Now go.

656
01:08:48,774 --> 01:08:49,711
Go.

657
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:45,597
Father!

658
01:09:57,036 --> 01:09:58,521
We must leave at once.

659
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:01,076
48 seconds left to the explosion.

660
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:02,584
We've got to get out of here.

661
01:10:02,609 --> 01:10:03,663
It's true father.

662
01:10:03,688 --> 01:10:06,143
The Count has mined the planetwith nuclear charges.

663
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,730
We're all about to die.

664
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,160
You know something, my boy?

665
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:14,025
I wouldn't be emperorif I didn't have some powers at my command.

666
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:21,672
Imperial battle-ship!

667
01:10:23,575 --> 01:10:24,488
Holt..

668
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,971
..the flow of time.

669
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:38,251
In the space of 3 minutes

670
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,833
Every molecule on this planetwill be immobilized.

671
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:43,525
But after the third minute

672
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,157
The green ray loses it's power.

673
01:10:45,692 --> 01:10:47,255
Time will flow once again.

674
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,819
And everything will explode.

675
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:52,189
Three minutes are enough, father.

676
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,868
Now, the Count believe that we are dead.

677
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:02,239
That our armies have dispersed.

678
01:12:02,264 --> 01:12:03,612
And that we have no leader.

679
01:12:05,047 --> 01:12:09,238
He is supremely confident that he canovercome us with the greatest of ease.

680
01:12:11,185 --> 01:12:12,415
Well then.

681
01:12:12,876 --> 01:12:14,749
Now is the time to surprise him.

682
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:20,017
We will attack his headquarters

683
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:23,319
before his fleets can join him.

684
01:12:24,446 --> 01:12:26,732
If we succeed in this

685
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:28,867
we could save billions of lives.

686
01:12:32,298 --> 01:12:33,972
Gather together all our legions.Sir!

687
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,094
And order the attack.

688
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:27,414
By sunset,I'll be the new Emperor.

689
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:32,822
And I will be the masterof the whole universe.

690
01:15:30,037 --> 01:15:31,489
Kill them!

691
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:31,921
Enemy arriving with torpedoes.

692
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:33,429
Prepare for attack.

693
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,293
Kill! Kill!

694
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:20,611
Over there.

695
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,387
We've got them, father.It's working

696
01:17:44,983 --> 01:17:45,991
Kill!

697
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:47,030
Kill!

698
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:21,739
Kill them!

699
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,652
Let's squad. Come on

700
01:19:55,156 --> 01:19:56,481
Over there, quickly.

701
01:20:37,394 --> 01:20:40,108
Now let's give the Emperor

702
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:41,957
a great reception.

703
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,727
Put in use the mightiest weapon.

704
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,691
The doom-machine.

705
01:20:47,738 --> 01:20:51,730
Send it off to towardsthe Emperor's capital world

706
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:55,516
and destroy the emperor's imperial planet.

707
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:59,085
Zarth-Arn!!Yeah!

708
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,490
It's over.

709
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:04,759
We're finished.

710
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:08,783
We've lost.

711
01:21:12,093 --> 01:21:12,998
No.

712
01:21:15,441 --> 01:21:17,457
No, there's still a way.

713
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:19,957
There's one solution left.

714
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:23,508
I'm afraid we're forced to use it.

715
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:24,556
What?

716
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,765
Starcrash!

717
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,892
Four dimensional attack.

718
01:21:31,551 --> 01:21:32,360
Yes!

719
01:21:32,785 --> 01:21:34,976
If we can re-enter space

720
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:38,140
at the precise moment

721
01:21:38,165 --> 01:21:42,535
the impact of surprise upon the Countwill be so overwhelming

722
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,618
that he cannot halt us.

723
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:46,976
But father,there is not a weapon powerful enough.

724
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,540
Oh yes, there is.

725
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,651
The floating city.

726
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,965
The floating city.

727
01:21:53,173 --> 01:21:54,372
Yes, yes I know.

728
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:58,879
Although we destroy it'shope, it's future..

729
01:21:59,812 --> 01:22:01,637
..I'm afraid we must sacrifice it.

730
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:05,287
By setting it towards the Count's fortress.

731
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,913
It's our only way.

732
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:15,250
Now you must help me.

733
01:22:19,353 --> 01:22:20,773
Both of you.

734
01:22:22,602 --> 01:22:23,285
Go!

735
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:24,986
And direct it's course.

736
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:44,407
Zoltan!

737
01:22:44,915 --> 01:22:45,804
Yes, my-lord.

738
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:50,600
Now set the doom-machineagainst the imperial space station itself.

739
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,450
How long will it take?

740
01:22:52,475 --> 01:22:53,213
15 minutes.

741
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:54,721
The set it in motion.

742
01:22:54,912 --> 01:22:58,118
I want to wipe out the Emperorfrom the whole of the universe.

743
01:22:58,777 --> 01:22:59,785
Yes, my-lord.

744
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:05,477
When do we reach the floating city?

745
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:06,819
In less than 2 minutes.

746
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:09,065
Right. I'll check the docking facility.

747
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:10,708
Right!

748
01:23:22,775 --> 01:23:24,680
Everything checks out OK.

749
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:26,831
Look!

750
01:23:26,856 --> 01:23:28,013
The floating city.

751
01:23:28,038 --> 01:23:29,307
Already evacuated.

752
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:32,775
The technicians have already set thecharges and freed the atomic engines.

753
01:23:33,283 --> 01:23:34,687
If everything goes smoothly

754
01:23:34,712 --> 01:23:38,006
I'll try to eject myselfas soon as I re-enter space.

755
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:39,792
But surely I'll come with you!

756
01:23:39,817 --> 01:23:40,864
No, no, no!

757
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,983
It's more important that you stay hereto rescue me once this is all over.

758
01:23:46,419 --> 01:23:47,324
Alright.

759
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:48,999
I'll stay.

760
01:23:49,515 --> 01:23:51,110
But I cannot let you go alone.

761
01:23:52,086 --> 01:23:54,185
In fact our best scientistshave spent the last

762
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,308
few hours reconstructingan old friend of yours.

763
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:01,446
Elle!

764
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:05,692
You can't keep a good robot down.

765
01:24:08,312 --> 01:24:10,637
This is incredible, they rebuild you.

766
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:12,494
But how?You look marvelous.

767
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:14,145
Very carefully.

768
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,153
And they used the latest components.

769
01:24:16,178 --> 01:24:18,422
I feel like a new machine.

770
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:19,709
Go now. Quickly!

771
01:24:19,734 --> 01:24:21,702
The survival of our galaxyis in your hands.

772
01:24:58,424 --> 01:25:01,426
This will take us directlyto the control-room.

773
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:04,521
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

774
01:25:11,197 --> 01:25:13,237
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

775
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,928
This doesn't make you nervous, does it?

776
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:21,960
I've never flown a city before.

777
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:24,047
Well, leave it to me.

778
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,440
Build up maximum energy.

779
01:26:03,465 --> 01:26:05,924
We must leapthrough the very heart of the stars.

780
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,137
Prepare to transit. 8 degrees.

781
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,683
Ok. I'm ready.

782
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,092
My-lord!

783
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:40,382
Yes Ellrik?

784
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,986
A floating ship is about to crash into us.

785
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:43,732
What?

786
01:26:44,542 --> 01:26:45,550
Zoltan!

787
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:46,883
Yes my-lord.

788
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:49,799
Destroy the floating ship approaching us.

789
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:55,945
It can't be done.

790
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,016
It's too close.

791
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:59,639
There it is. Dead-ahead.Alright!

792
01:27:00,571 --> 01:27:03,309
The Count's fighters.We've got to evade them.

793
01:27:06,426 --> 01:27:09,022
All systems prepare for full power.

794
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:38,905
Let's lock in these controls.

795
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:40,606
Move it out. Quick.

796
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:41,495
Right!

797
01:27:42,067 --> 01:27:42,805
Let's go!

798
01:28:01,437 --> 01:28:03,643
Come back, you fools.You cowards.

799
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:04,897
Come back and fight.

800
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:05,818
My-lord?Yes!

801
01:28:05,843 --> 01:28:07,247
Come, or you'll be destroyed.

802
01:28:07,272 --> 01:28:08,694
You stay here.Go!

803
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:17,035
Let's get out of here or there won't beenough left of me to put back together.

804
01:28:17,413 --> 01:28:18,484
You can bet on that!

805
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:23,182
Circuits, don't fail me now.

806
01:28:39,362 --> 01:28:42,462
Zarth-Arn!! Zarth-Arn!!

807
01:29:58,544 --> 01:30:01,329
It's Simon. Simon!

808
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:03,127
We're over here.

809
01:30:08,085 --> 01:30:09,767
Stella. Stella!

810
01:30:12,652 --> 01:30:14,113
And welcome home.

811
01:30:30,747 --> 01:30:31,628
Stella!

812
01:30:31,653 --> 01:30:32,462
Simon!

813
01:30:33,216 --> 01:30:33,961
Ah Stella.

814
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,614
Simon.

815
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:40,002
Is that so.

816
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:42,003
Well..It's done

817
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:43,836
It's happened.

818
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,675
The stars are clear.

819
01:30:49,379 --> 01:30:51,213
The planets shine.

820
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:55,229
We've won.

821
01:30:57,624 --> 01:31:01,536
Oh, some dark force no doubt

822
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:03,298
Will show it's face once more.

823
01:31:05,139 --> 01:31:08,289
The wheel will always turn.

824
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:12,964
But for now it's calm.

825
01:31:16,276 --> 01:31:17,514
And for a little time..

826
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:19,554
..at least..

827
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:24,161
..we can rest.

1
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:49,134
There was once in venicea moor othello who for

2
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:53,241
his merits in the affairs of warwas held in great esteem.

3
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,640
It happened that he fell in lovewith a young and noble lady

4
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,108
called desdemona,

5
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:02,709
who drawn by his virtue,became equally enamoured of him.

6
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:06,323
So it was that since her fatherwas much opposed to the union

7
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:10,555
of desdemona with a moor,she fled her house at night.

8
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,621
In secret hastethey were married.

9
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:19,063
Now there was in othello'scompany, an ensign named lago,

10
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,827
a very amiable outward appearance

11
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,504
but his character wasextremely treacherous.

12
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:31,245
I have told often andi retell it again and again.

13
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:34,415
I hate the moore.

14
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,211
I'll poison his delight.

15
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,149
How? How, lago?

16
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,659
Proclaim him in the streets,incense her kinsmen,

17
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:50,061
and though he in fertile climatedwell, plague him with flies.

18
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,994
No, they come.

19
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,735
What will i do?

20
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:57,804
Why, go to bed and sleep.

21
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,009
- I'll incontinently drown myself.Oh, bitterness.

22
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,606
What should i do?

23
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:03,974
Put money in thy purse.

24
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,083
Ere i would say i would drownmyself for love of a guinea

25
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,608
hen, i would change myhumanity with a baboon!

26
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,883
Come, be a man.

27
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,724
Drown thyself?

28
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:23,128
Drown cats and blind puppies.

29
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:28,232
It cannot be that desdemonashould long continue her love

30
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,396
to the moor or he his to her.

31
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,742
It was a violent commencement.

32
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,608
And thou shalt see an answerablesequestration,

33
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,813
put buy money in thy purse.

34
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,118
When she is sated with his body

35
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,246
she'll fine the errorof her choice.

36
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:51,154
She must change, she must,for youth.

37
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,555
Your daughter!

38
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,362
- Look, your house!- Your house!

39
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,232
- Your daughter!- Your daughter!

40
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,396
Senior, is all your familywithin?

41
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,574
Why, wherefore ask you this?

42
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,140
Lf't be your pleasure for yourdull watch o' th' night,

43
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:10,144
transported, with no worse norbetter guard but with a knave

44
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,376
of common hire, a gondolier,to the gross clasps of a

45
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,779
lascivious moor.

46
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,647
This thou shalt answer!

47
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:21,686
Straight satisfy yourself, if shebe in your chamber or your house,

48
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,790
lago, can i depend on the issue?

49
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,053
Thou are sure of me.Go, make money.

50
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,921
It is too true an evil.Gone she is.

51
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,862
Is there not charms by whichthe property of youth

52
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,800
and maidhood may be abused?

53
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,267
Call up all my people!

54
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,907
Raise my kindred!

55
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,644
Where is the moor?

56
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,149
Keep up your bright swordsfor the dew'll rust them.

57
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,116
Oh, thou foul thief!

58
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,755
Where hast thou stowedmy daughter?

59
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:54,824
Hold your hands! Good signor,

60
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,392
where will you that i go toanswer this your charge?

61
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,425
To prison till fit time of law

62
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:02,020
and course of direct sessioncall thee to answer.

63
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,801
Now at the same hour, therecame messengers in haste

64
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,637
to the senate for there wasnews that the turkish armies

65
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,935
were moving against thevenetian garrison in cyprus.

66
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,673
The senators, already raised

67
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,112
the net, elected the moor to thecommander of their troops.

68
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,979
And officers were searching

69
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,814
the town to apprise othelloof this honor

70
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:27,184
when lo, desdemona's oldfather himself brings the moor

71
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,485
at sword's point to the councilchamber upon a charge of

72
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:33,289
working from desdemona withunlawful enchant.

73
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:34,428
She was abused,

74
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,533
stolen from me and, ay,corrupted by magic spells.

75
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,861
I'm very sorry for't.

76
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:43,495
If she in chains of magic were notbound, whether a maid so tender,

77
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,343
fair and happy would ever haveto incur her general mock,

78
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,810
run from her father

79
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,375
to the sooty bosom of such afierce bat!

80
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,487
Damned as thou art,thou hast enchanted her!

81
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,055
Othello, what in your own partcan you say to this?

82
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,454
Nothing but this is so!

83
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:08,622
Did you by indirect and forced

84
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,756
courses subdue and poisonthis young maid of affection?

85
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,835
Most potent grave andreverend signors,

86
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:22,003
my very noble and approvedgood masters,

87
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,171
that i've taken away this oldman's daughter it's most true.

88
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,413
True i have married her.

89
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:35,620
The very head and front of myoffending has this extent,

90
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,520
no more.

91
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,260
Rude in my speech,

92
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,257
and little blessed with the softphrase of peace,

93
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,262
since these arms of mine hadseven years' pith till now some

94
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,566
nine moon wasted theyhave used their dearest action

95
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:53,042
in the tented field and littlelittle of this great world can i

96
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,374
speak more than pertainsto feats of broil and battle.

97
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,509
And therefore little shall i gracemy cause in speaking of myself.

98
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:02,745
Yet by your gracious patience

99
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:07,289
i will round unvarnished taledeliver of my whole course of love,

100
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,414
what drugs, what charms,

101
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,794
what conjuration and what

102
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,728
mighty magic, for suchproceedings am i charged withal

103
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,655
that i won his daughter.

104
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,163
Her father loved me, oft

105
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,233
invited me, still questioned methe story of my life.

106
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,495
I ran it through even from my

107
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:24,597
boyish days wherein i speak ofthe most disastrous chances

108
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,742
of moving accidents by floodand fields of hair-breadth

109
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,074
scapes for the imminentdeadly breach.

110
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:35,073
Of being taken by insolent foe,and sold to slavery,

111
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,115
of my redemption thence andpotency my travels history

112
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:44,554
wherein a venturous vast anddesert idle, rough quarries,

113
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:49,124
rocks and tills whose headstouch heaven.

114
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,291
It was my head to speak.

115
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,261
Rest to hear, but desdemonaseriously inclined.

116
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,575
But still the house affairs woulddraw her thence, which ever as

117
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,940
she could with haste dispatch,

118
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,775
come again and with a greedyear devour up my discourse.

119
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,609
I found good means to draw

120
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,382
from her a prayer of earnestheart that i would all my

121
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,957
pilgrimage dilate, and oftendid beguile her of her tears

122
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,086
when i did speak of somedistressed stroke of my use of it.

123
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:27,768
She gave me for my pains,a world of sighs.

124
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:32,270
She swore, in faith: 'twasstrange, 'twas passing strange.

125
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,743
Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrouspitiful.

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,045
She wished she had not heard

127
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:43,016
it, yet she wished thatheaven made her such a man.

128
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:49,054
She thanked me, and bade meif i had a friend that loved her

129
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,321
i should but teach him how totell my story

130
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,593
and that would woo her.

131
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,595
Upon this hint i spake,

132
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,259
she loved my for the dangersi had passed,

133
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,201
and i loved her that shedid pity them.

134
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:06,699
This only is the witchcrafti have used.

135
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,773
I think this tale would winmy daughter, too.

136
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,275
Come hither, desdemona.

137
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,822
Do you perceive in all thisnoble company

138
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:25,655
where most owe you obedience?

139
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,463
My noble father, i do perceivehere a divided duty.

140
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,392
To you i am bound for lifeand education.

141
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:38,370
My life and education both dolearn me how to respect you.

142
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,407
You are the lord of duty.

143
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:48,013
I am hitherto your daughter.But here's my husband.

144
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,578
And so much duty as mymother showed to you

145
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,483
preferring you before her father

146
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,024
so much i challenge that imay profess,

147
00:12:55,024 --> 00:13:03,454
due to the moor, my lord.God be with you. I have done.

148
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,534
When remedies are pastthe griefs are ended.

149
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:09,468
Please it your grace on tothe state affairs.

150
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,867
The turk with a most mightypreparation makes for cyprus.

151
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:15,339
Othello, the fortitude of theplace is vast known to you.

152
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,072
You must away this morning.

153
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:18,642
With all my heart.

154
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,976
When we consider the importanceof cyprus to the turk, we must

155
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:23,779
not think the turk is sounskillful to leave that latest

156
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,285
which concerns them first,

157
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,084
neglecting an attempt of ease andgain to wake and wage a danger.

158
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,799
Look to her, moorif thou hast eyes to see.

159
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,758
She has deceived her fatherand may thee.

160
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,037
My life upon her faith!

161
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,954
Mark me with what violenceshe first loved the moor

162
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,549
but for bragging and dealinga fantastical lie.

163
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,489
Will she love him still for prating?

164
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,460
Ah, let not thy discreet heartthink it.

165
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,666
- Lieutenant cassio.- Largo

166
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:18,973
what a cannon.

167
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,005
I know my price.

168
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:20,665
I'm worth no worse a place.

169
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,209
But he, sir, had the election.

170
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,212
And what's he? This michaelcassio, this florentine,

171
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,681
that never set a squadron in thefield nor the division of a battle

172
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:32,754
knows more than a spinster.Yet cassio must his lieutenant

173
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,120
be, by god bless the mark ofthe fellow's ancient!

174
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,723
Well, i would not follow him that.

175
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:39,917
Oh, sir, content you.

176
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,721
I follow him to serve my turnupon him.

177
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:43,526
Lago? Lago!

178
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,598
Honest lago!

179
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,399
I wake up on your lordship.

180
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,662
My desdemona must i leavewith thee.

181
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,500
I pray bring her after good timeto cyprus.

182
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,869
Well, me good lord, i'll do it.

183
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,409
The moor's of a free andopen nature, that thinks men

184
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:01,744
honest that seem to be so,and will as tenderly be led by

185
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,408
th' nose as asses are.

186
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,923
We cannot all be masters.

187
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,190
Nor all masters cannot bytruly followed.

188
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,698
You shall mark many a duteousand knee-crooking knave who

189
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,735
doting on his own obsequiousbondage wears out his time,

190
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,499
much like his master's ass, fornaught but provender; and when,

191
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,972
he's old, cashiered.

192
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,533
Whip me such honest knaves!

193
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:29,943
Others there are who, trimmed

194
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,113
in forms and visages of duty,keep yet their hearts attending

195
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,180
on themselves,and throwing but shows of

196
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,239
services on their lords,do well thrive by them, and when

197
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,577
they have lined their coatsdo themselves homage.

198
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,753
These fellows have some soul,

199
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,988
and such a one do i professmyself for, sir, it is as sure

200
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:48,994
as you're roderigo, werei the moor, i would not be lago.

201
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,991
In following him i followbut myself.

202
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,362
When my outward action dothdemonstrate the native act and

203
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,441
figure of my heart in compliment

204
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,241
extern, 'tis not long after buti will wear my heart upon my

205
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:11,150
sleeve, for daws to peck at.I am not what i am.

206
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,533
I have but an hour of loveto spend with thee.

207
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,934
We must obey the time.

208
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:24,251
Oh, lago, what tidings canyou tell of my lord?

209
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:25,486
He's not yet arrived, but the

210
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,060
turkish fleets be not enshelterdthey are drowned.

211
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,436
It is there! I knowothello's trumpet!

212
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:47,448
News, lads! News! The desperatetempest hath so banged the turks

213
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,909
that their designment halts.

214
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,618
Our wars are done!

215
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:06,994
He takes her by the palm.Well said. An excellent courtship.

216
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:16,735
With as little a web as this will iensnare as great a fly as cassio.

217
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:48,474
It gives me wonder great as mycontent to see you here before me.

218
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,508
Oh, my soul's joy!

219
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,039
If after every tempest come such

220
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,845
calms, may the winds blowtill they have wakened death.

221
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:00,555
- My dear othello!- Oh, my fair warrior!

222
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,757
I prattle out of fashion, andi dote in my own comforts.

223
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,152
- Worthy montano, your pardon- sir

224
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,331
good michael, look youto the guard tonight.

225
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,657
Come, my dear love.

226
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:19,038
Once more well met at cyprus.

227
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,360
It is othello's pleasure thatupon certain tidings now arrived

228
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,426
importing the destruction ofthe turkish fleet, every man

229
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,294
put himself into triumph.

230
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:50,495
Each man what sport and revelshis addiction lead him.

231
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,904
For, besides these beneficial news,

232
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:56,637
it is the celebration ofour general's nuptial.

233
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:03,344
Heaven bless the isle of cyprusand our noble general othello!

234
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,857
First, i must tell thee this.

235
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,960
Desdemona is directlyin love with him.

236
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:18,193
With cassio?Why, 'tis not possible.

237
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,393
Her eyes must be fed.

238
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,463
And what delight shall shehave to look on the devil?

239
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,038
Very nature will compel herto the second choice.

240
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:29,134
Now sir, this granted,

241
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:34,481
who stands so eminent in the degreeof this fortune as cassio does?

242
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,575
Why, none! Why, none!

243
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:41,451
A slipper and subtle knave,a devilish knave!

244
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,588
- He is handsome.- Cassio?

245
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,257
He has all the requisites in him

246
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:51,093
that folly and green mindslook after.

247
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:56,635
Oh, a pestilent complete knave

248
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,605
and the woman hath foundhim already.

249
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,405
I cannot believe that indesdemona.

250
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,456
Did you not see her paddlewith the palm of his hand?

251
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,115
Did not mark that?

252
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,693
Yes, that i did, but that wasbut a courtesy.

253
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,693
Courtesy? Lechery. An index

254
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:26,726
and obscure prologue to thehistory of lust and foul thoughts.

255
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:31,569
They met so near with their lipsthat their breaths embraced together.

256
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,238
Villainous thoughts, roderigo.

257
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,973
But, sir, be you ruled by me.

258
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:40,940
Listen, listen to cassio tonight.Watch him on the court of god.

259
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,917
Cassio knows you not.I'll not be far from you.

260
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,918
Do you find some occasionto anger him from what

261
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,119
other course you please.

262
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,113
Well

263
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,884
sir, he's rash and very sudden

264
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,890
in choler, and haply maystrike at you.

265
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,016
Provoke him that he may,

266
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:57,198
for even out of that will icause these of cyprus to mutiny

267
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,994
and the displanting of cassio.Lieutenant cassio!

268
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:05,634
Lago, i'll say, you like mewell, lago?

269
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,435
In the sincerity oflove and friendship.

270
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,802
Come, lieutenant, a stoup ofwine!

271
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,340
Here a brace of gallants that

272
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:15,549
fain have a measure to thehealth of black othello.

273
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:16,982
Not tonight, good lago.

274
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,577
I have very poor and unhappybrains for drinking.

275
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,085
Oh, just one cup.

276
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,094
I must to the watch.

277
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,531
Not this hour, lieutenant,'tis not yet ten o' th' clock.

278
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,162
Our general cast us thus earlyfor the love of his desdemona.

279
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,972
He hath not yet made wantonthe night with her

280
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:40,803
and she is sport for jove.

281
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,734
She's a most exquisite lady.

282
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,042
And full of game, i'll warrant.

283
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,477
What an eye she hasto provocation.

284
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,551
I object, i think right modest.

285
00:22:51,120 --> 00:23:00,324
Well, happiness to their sheets.Another cup, i'll drink for you.

286
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,624
I have drunk two cups andi don't dare not to task

287
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:04,062
my weakness with any more.

288
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,790
My man, 'tis a night of revels.

289
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,264
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.

290
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:27,522
If it were now to die, 'twerenow to be most happy,

291
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,884
for i fear my soul hath her content

292
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:34,058
so absolute that not anothercomfort like to this

293
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:56,347
succeeds in unknown fate.Ah, brothers on call tonight!

294
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,178
God, an excellent song!

295
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,981
I learned it in england, where

296
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,590
indeed they are most potentin potting.

297
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,285
Your dane, your german,

298
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:09,022
and your swag-bellied hollander- drink, ho! -

299
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,426
are nothing to your english.

300
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,660
Is your englishman so exquisitein his drinking?

301
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,828
He drinks you with facilityyou dane dead drunk,

302
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:19,100
he sweats not to overthrowyour almain,

303
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:22,471
he gives your hollander a vomitere the next pottle can be filled.

304
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:24,102
To the health of our general!

305
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,611
I am for it, lieutenant, andi'll do you justice.

306
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,262
Good faith, a little one,not past a pint, as i'm a soldier.

307
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,565
Well, god above alland there be souls must be saved,

308
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:59,672
and there be souls must notbe saved.

309
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,072
It's true, good lieutenant.

310
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:05,408
For mine own part, no offense

311
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:11,413
to the general, nor any manof quality, i hope to be saved.

312
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:17,856
Ay, but, by your leave,not before me.

313
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,163
Do not think, gentlemen,i am drunk.

314
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:29,631
This is my ancient, my righthand, this is my left.

315
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,797
I am not drunk now. I canstand well enough, and

316
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,440
i speak well enough.

317
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:37,341
Excellent well!

318
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:41,075
Very well. You must not thinkthen that i am drunk.

319
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,618
Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!

320
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:57,326
What noise is this?

321
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,127
A knave teach me my duty?

322
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:03,869
What's the matter, lieutenant?

323
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:06,338
I'll beat the knave intoa twiggen bottle.

324
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,288
Away, i say.

325
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,255
Go out and cry a mutiny!

326
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:34,796
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!

327
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:46,679
Stop, lieutenant!

328
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,747
Hold this shame forever!

329
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,943
Have you forgot all place ofsense and duty?

330
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,144
Hold the rage!

331
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:20,474
Hold, gentlemen!

332
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,685
You're ordered above.Yeah, move, come on!

333
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,891
Why, sir, the generals!

334
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,511
Silence that dreadful bell!

335
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,892
Who began this? Lago.

336
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:07,789
I do not know.

337
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,659
Friends all, but now, even now,in quarter and terms like

338
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,704
bride and groom devestingthem for bed,

339
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:20,864
but now swords out and tiltingone at other's breasts.

340
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,834
Worthy montano, what's the matter

341
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:26,648
that you unlace yourreputation thus and spend your

342
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:29,208
rich opinion for the nameof a night-brawler?

343
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:34,285
Your officer, lago, caninform you.

344
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:35,816
Fortunate. Town of war to manageprivate and domestic quarrel?

345
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:38,124
In night, and on the courtand guard of safety?

346
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,159
Lago, who began't?

347
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,865
Thou dost deliver more or lessthan truth, thou art no soldier.

348
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,935
I had rather have this tonguecut from my mouth than it should

349
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,402
do offense to michael cassio.

350
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,199
Sir, men in rage strike thosethat wish them best,

351
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,176
yet surely cassio i believereceived from him that fled

352
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:00,608
some strange dignity, whichpatience could not pass.

353
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,613
I know, lago, the honestyand love doth mince this matter,

354
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:06,984
making it light to cassio.

355
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:15,553
Cassio, i love thee,but never more be officer of mine.

356
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,158
Look if my gentle love be notraised up.

357
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,365
I'll make thee an example.

358
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:07,779
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?Ay, past all surgery.

359
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:09,908
Marry, heaven forbid!

360
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,383
Reputation, reputation,reputation!

361
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:15,986
O, i have lost my reputation!

362
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,619
I have lost the immortal partof myself,

363
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,818
and what remains is bestial.

364
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,192
My reputation, lago,my reputation.

365
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,027
Reputation oft got withoutmerit and lost without deserving.

366
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,769
I tell you what you shall do.

367
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,236
Our general's wife isnow the general.

368
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:32,806
Confess yourself freely to her.

369
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:37,272
Desdemona is of so free, sokind, so blessed a disposition

370
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:40,142
she holds it a vice in hergoodness not to do more than

371
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:41,237
she is requested.

372
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,082
Farewell, lieutenant.

373
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:55,720
Roderigo.

374
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,657
My money is almost spent,

375
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,793
i have been tonight exceedinglywell cudgeled.

376
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:04,694
And i think the issue will be,

377
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,109
i shall have so much experiencefor my pains, and so, with

378
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:12,873
no money at all, and a littlemore wit, return again to venice.

379
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:16,050
How poor are they thathave not patience!

380
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,777
Does not go well?

381
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,515
Cassio has beaten thee, andthou by that small hurt hath

382
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,352
cashiered cassio.

383
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,789
Content thyself awhile.

384
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:28,387
For whiles this honest foolplies desdemona to repair

385
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:31,124
his fortune, and she for himpleads strongly to the moor.

386
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,464
Io, by how much she strives

387
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,433
to do him good, she shallundo her credit with the moor.

388
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,598
So will i turn her virtue into pitch,and out of her own

389
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,109
goodness make the netthat shall enmesh them all.

390
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:27,845
Do not doubt, cassio.

391
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,581
I'll have my lord and you againas friendly as you were.

392
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:33,956
Madam, whatever shall becomeof michael cassio, he's never

393
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,427
anything but your true servant.

394
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,865
Ha! I like not that.

395
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,728
What dost thou say?

396
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,664
Nothing, my lord, or if,i know not what.

397
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,496
How now, my lord?

398
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,835
I have been talking witha suitor here.

399
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,873
A man that languishes inyour displeasure.

400
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,772
Who is't you mean?

401
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:50,936
Why, your lieutenant cassio.

402
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:52,180
Went he hence now?

403
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,115
I' sooth so humbled that he hathleft part of his grief with me

404
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,146
to suffer with him.

405
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:57,476
Good love, call him back.

406
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:58,483
Some other time.

407
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,779
- Shall't be shortly?- The sooner, sweet, for you.

408
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:03,413
- Shall't be tonight at supper?- No, not tonight.

409
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:03,991
Tomorrow dinner then?

410
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,393
I shall not dine at home.

411
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,951
I meet the captainsat the citadel.

412
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:09,426
Why then, tomorrow night.I prithee name the time.

413
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:11,327
No more. Let him comewhen he will.

414
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,495
I will deny thee nothing.

415
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,871
Whereon i do beseech thee

416
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:22,434
grant me this to leave mebut a little to myself.

417
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:27,980
Shall i deny you? No.Farewell, my lord.

418
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:36,084
- My noble lord.- What dost thou say, lago?

419
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,426
Did michael cassio, when youwooed my lady,

420
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:41,552
know of your love?

421
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:45,695
He did, from first to last.Why dost thou ask?

422
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:49,136
But for a satisfaction of mythought, no further harm.

423
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,138
Why of thy thought, lago?

424
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,201
I did not think he had beenacquainted with her.

425
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,034
O, yes, and went between usvery oft.

426
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,770
- Indeed?- Indeed? Ay, indeed.

427
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,941
Discern'st thou aught in that?Is he not honest?

428
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,281
- Honest, my lord?- Honest? Ay, honest!

429
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:11,414
My lord, for aught i know.

430
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,184
What dost thou think?

431
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,226
Think, my lord?

432
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,822
Think. Thou dost mean something.

433
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,461
I heard thee say even now,thou lik'st not that,

434
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,036
when cassio left my wife.

435
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:29,466
If thou dost love meshow me thou thought.

436
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:30,839
My lord, you know i love you.

437
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,506
I think thou dost.

438
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,517
For michael cassio, i dare

439
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:44,214
be sworn, i think he is honest.I think so, too.

440
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,096
Men should be what they seem.

441
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,324
Certain, men should bewhat they seem.

442
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:56,459
Why then, i think cassio'san honest man.

443
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,830
Nay, yet there's more in this?

444
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:06,507
I prithee speak to me asto thy thinkings.

445
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,249
Good name in man and woman,

446
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:14,719
dear my lord, is the immediatejewel of their souls.

447
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:17,921
Who steals my purse stealstrash; 'this something, nothing.

448
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:21,291
Twas mine, 'tis his, and hasbeen slave to thousands.

449
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,257
But he that flinches from memy good name robs me of

450
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:31,000
that which not enriches himand makes me poor indeed.

451
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:32,437
By heaven, i'll knowthy thoughts.

452
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,203
Beware, my lord, of jealousy!It is the green-eyed monster,

453
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,108
which doth mock the meatit feeds on.

454
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,408
That cuckold lives in blisswho, certain of his fate,

455
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,445
loves not his wronger.

456
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:45,517
But o, what damned minutestells he over who dotes,

457
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:50,153
yet doubts, suspects,yet fondly loves!

458
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,923
Why? Why is this?

459
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:57,562
Think'st thou i'd make a life of

460
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,534
jealousy to follow still thechanges of the moon with

461
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:06,696
fresh suspicions?No, lago, i'll see before i doubt.

462
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:10,173
When i doubt, prove.I speak not yet of proof.

463
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:15,613
Look to your wife.Observe her well with cassio.

464
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,888
I know our country dispositionwell.

465
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,760
In venice they do let heaven

466
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,700
see the pranks they dare notshow their husbands.

467
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,433
Their best conscience is not toleave't undone but kept unknown.

468
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:41,700
Dost thou say so?

469
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,070
She did deceive her father,marrying you.

470
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,543
And when she seemed to shakeand fear your looks,

471
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,612
she loved them most.

472
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:48,414
And so she did.

473
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:53,179
Why, go to then! She that soyoung could give out such a

474
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,517
seeming to seel her father'seyes up close as oak.

475
00:37:56,758 --> 00:38:00,387
He thought 'twas witchcraft.But i am much to blame.

476
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,361
I humbly do beseech you of mypardon for too much loving you.

477
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,261
I'm bound to thee forever.

478
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,907
I see this hath a littledashed your spirit.

479
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,144
Not a jot, not a jot.

480
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:26,379
Trust me, i fear it has.

481
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,323
I hope you will consider whatis spoke comes from my love.

482
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,887
Cassio's my worthy friend.

483
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,221
My lord, i see you're moved!

484
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,790
No, not much moved.

485
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:45,830
I do not think butdesdemona's honest.

486
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:49,871
Long live she so.And long live you to think so.

487
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,879
And yet, how nature erringfrom itself

488
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,110
ay, there's the point, as to

489
00:38:57,218 --> 00:39:01,314
be bold with you, not toaffect many proposed matches

490
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,715
of her own clime, complexion,and degree.

491
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:11,092
One may smell in such a willmost rank, foul disproportions,

492
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,926
thought unnatural.

493
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,737
My lord, i would i might entreatyour honor to scan this thing

494
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:24,276
no further. Leave it to time.

495
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:25,736
Farewell.

496
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,139
Leave me, lago.

497
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:36,152
How now, my dear othello?

498
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:39,154
My lord, i take my leave.

499
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,991
Are you not well?

500
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:47,492
I have a pain upon myforehead here.

501
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,795
Why, that's with watching.

502
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:49,903
It will away again.

503
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,266
Let me but bind it hard, withinhours it will be well.

504
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,672
Your napkin is too little.Let it alone!

505
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:00,070
I have a thing for you.

506
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:00,833
You have a thing for me?

507
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,535
It is a common thing tohave a foolish wife.

508
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:04,406
O, is that all? What will you

509
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,843
give me now for thatsame handkerchief?

510
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:07,673
What handkerchief?

511
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,977
That which so often youdid bid me to steal.

512
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:10,845
Give it me.

513
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,350
If it be not for some purposeof import, give't me again.

514
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,847
Poor lady, she'll run mad.

515
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,823
I have use for it. Leave me.

516
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,384
How now, general?

517
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:50,048
I swear 'tis better to be much

518
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:51,091
abused than but toknow't a little.

519
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,919
- My lord!- Is my lord angry?

520
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:56,153
He went hence but now, andcertainly in strange unquietness.

521
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:58,491
- I will go seek him.- I prithee do so.

522
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,067
There's matter in't indeedif he be angry.

523
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:13,438
Villain, be sure thou provemy love a whore, be sure of it!

524
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,816
Give me the ocular proof,

525
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,719
or, by the worth of mine eternalsoul, thou hadst been better

526
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,345
have been born a dog thananswer my waked wrath!

527
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:21,978
Is't come to this?

528
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,318
Make me to see't, or at theleast so prove it that

529
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:27,020
the probation bear no hingenor loop to hang a doubt on

530
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:28,760
or woe upon thy life!

531
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:31,957
Never pray more,abandon all remorse.

532
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,964
For nothing canst thou todamnation add greater than that.

533
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:36,003
O monstrous world!

534
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,628
Take note, take note, o world!

535
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:39,396
To be direct and honestis not safe.

536
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:47,004
By the world i think my wifebe honest, and think she is not.

537
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,584
I think that thou art just, andthink thou art not.

538
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,244
I'll have some proof. Her name,

539
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:59,220
that was as fresh as dian'svisage, is now begrimed and

540
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:03,329
black as mine own face.

541
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:05,455
Would i were satisfied!

542
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,099
How satisfied, my lord?

543
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:11,035
Would you, the supervisor,grossly gape on?

544
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,233
Behold her topped?

545
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,805
It is impossible you shouldsee this.

546
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:22,143
Were they as prime as goats,as hot as monkey?

547
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,843
Give me a living reasonshe's disloyal!

548
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:29,522
I lay with cassio lately, andbeing trouble with a raging

549
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,552
tooth, i could not sleep.

550
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,650
There are a kind of men so looseor should that in their sleeps

551
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:35,194
will mutter their affairs.

552
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,355
One of this kind is cassio.

553
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,795
In sleep i heard him say,

554
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:46,433
sweet desdemona, let usbe wary, let us hid our loves.

555
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,241
And then, sir, would he gripeand wring my hand, cry

556
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,369
o sweet creature! Then kiss

557
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,107
me hard as if he plucked upkisses by the roots that grew

558
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:58,277
upon my lips, laid his leg o'ermy thigh, and sigh, and kiss

559
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:00,918
and then cry, cursed fatethat gave thee to the moor!

560
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:03,388
I'll tear her all to pieces!

561
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:06,585
Tell me but this. Have you notsometimes seen a handkerchief

562
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,786
spotted with strawberries inyour wife's hand?

563
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:10,020
I gave her such a one.

564
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,157
Such a handkerchief, i'm sureit was your wife's, did i today

565
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:15,098
see cassio wipe his face.

566
00:44:17,672 --> 00:44:18,604
If it be that

567
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:20,800
if it be that, or any that was

568
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:23,940
hers, it speaks against herwith the other proofs.

569
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:29,180
Now do i see 'tis true.

570
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:35,917
O, that the slave hadforty thousand lives!

571
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:36,546
One is too poor, too weekfor my revenge!

572
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:41,993
- Yet be content!- Blood, blood, blood!

573
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:46,130
Patience, i say.Your mind may change.

574
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,669
Never, lago. Like to the pontiac

575
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:51,502
sea, whose icy current andcompulsive course nev'r keeps

576
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,969
retiring ebb, but keeps due onto the propontic and the

577
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:55,599
hellespont.

578
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:57,470
Even so my bloody thoughts,

579
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,047
with violent pace, shall nev'rlook back, nev'r ebb to humble

580
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:04,674
love, till that a capable andwide revenge swallow them up.

581
00:45:04,752 --> 00:45:07,915
Witness that here lago dothgive up the execution of

582
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:10,520
his wit, hands, heart towronged othello's service.

583
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:11,750
Within these three days let me

584
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:14,294
here thee say thatcassio's not alive.

585
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:17,522
My friend is dead. 'tis doneat your request.

586
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,959
But let her live.

587
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:21,466
Damn her, lewd minx!

588
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:24,060
O, damn her!

589
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:33,137
Now art thou my lieutenant.

590
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:36,114
I am your own forever.

591
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,569
Cassio! Cassio!

592
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:39,772
Give me your hand.

593
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,081
This hand is moist, my lady.

594
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,344
It hath felt no age norknown no sorrow.

595
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:53,587
This argues fruitfulness andliberal heart. Hot, hot and most.

596
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,961
'Tis a good hand, a frank one.

597
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,089
You may, indeed, say sofor 'twas that hand that

598
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,258
gave away my heart.

599
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,629
A liberal hand.

600
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:03,303
Come now, your promise.

601
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,202
- What promise, chuck?- Let cassio be received again.

602
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,076
Lend me thy handkerchief.

603
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,640
I have it not about me.

604
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,676
- Not?- No, indeed, my lord.

605
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:17,875
That's a fault. That handkerchief

606
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:20,043
did an egyptian to my mothergive.

607
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,111
The worms were hallowed thatdid breed the silk.

608
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:23,790
Then would to god thati had never seen't.

609
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:27,286
Is't lost? Is't gone?Speak, is it out of the way?

610
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,390
It is not lost.But what an if it were?

611
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:30,393
How?

612
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:32,856
I say it is not lost.

613
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:34,724
Fetch't, let me see it!

614
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,961
Why, so i can, but i willnot now.

615
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:39,297
This is a trick to put mefrom my suit.

616
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:41,234
Pray you let cassiobe received again.

617
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:43,808
- The handkerchief!- I pray talking of cassio

618
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:44,567
the handkerchief!

619
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:47,542
A man that all his time hath foundedhis good fortunes on your love,

620
00:47:47,815 --> 00:47:49,680
- shares dangers with you- the handkerchief!

621
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:52,181
Come, come, you'll nevermeet a more sufficient man.

622
00:47:52,419 --> 00:48:00,326
Away. Away!Away!

623
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,256
Cassio, this handkerchief.Whose is it?

624
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:06,829
I found it here.I like the work well.

625
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,296
'Tis very good!Shall i see you soon at night?

626
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:11,305
I will see you soon, bianca.

627
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,933
- Come, lieutenant.- Cassio, handkerchief.

628
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:16,800
Take it. Have it copiedthee made for it.

629
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,081
Tell you yet once more,

630
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,979
importune desdemona toput you in your place again.

631
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,954
Sure there's some wonderin this handkerchief.

632
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,958
'Tis a year or two showsus a man.

633
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,290
They're all but stomachs,and we all but food. Cassio!

634
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:45,328
They eat us hungerly, andwhen they're full, they belch us.

635
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,942
How now, good cassio?What's the news with you?

636
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:04,413
What trumpet is that same?Something from venice.

637
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:24,970
My noble lord, whilest youwere here, overwhelmed with

638
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:28,146
your grief, cassio came hither.I shifted him aways, bade him

639
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,112
anon return, andhere speak with me.

640
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:33,279
Mark the fleers, the gibes,

641
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:36,354
and notable scorns that dwellin every region of his face.

642
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,293
For i will make him tellthe tale anew,

643
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:43,396
where, how, how oft, howlong ago, and when he hath

644
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,794
and is again to cope your wife.

645
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:53,139
I say, but mark his gesture.

646
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,204
Marry patience, or i shall sayyou're all in all in spleen,

647
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,605
and nothing of a man.Dost thou hear, lago?

648
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,675
I will be found most cunningin my patience.

649
00:50:03,017 --> 00:50:06,783
But - dost thou hear? -most bloody.

650
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,649
- How do you know, lieutenant?- Lago.

651
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:14,058
Now, if this suit lay in bianca'spower,

652
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,092
how quickly should you speed!

653
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:17,853
Alas, poor caitiff!

654
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,333
I never knew woman loveman so.

655
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:26,130
She gives it out thatyou shall marry her.

656
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,900
Ay!

657
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:38,977
I was talking on the sea bank,and the bauble falls me thus

658
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:41,086
about my neck

659
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:44,282
so hangs, and lolls, andweeps upon me,

660
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:46,388
so shakes and pulls me!

661
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:49,360
- Cassio!- I must leave her company.

662
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,427
What did you mean by that samehandkerchief you gave me even now?

663
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:56,561
A likely piece of work thatyou should find it in your

664
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:57,862
chamber and know not wholeft i t there!

665
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,239
This is some minx's token.

666
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,030
I'll take out no work on't.

667
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,036
Now now, my sweet bianca?How now?

668
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,541
After her! After her!

669
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,978
Did you see how he laughedat his vice?

670
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:14,721
O lago.

671
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:16,384
Did you see the handkerchief?

672
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:18,816
Was that mine?

673
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:23,153
Desdemona gave it him, andhe hath giv'n it his whore.

674
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,909
I had been happy if the generalcamp, pioners and all, had

675
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,078
tasted her sweet body.

676
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,540
So i had nothing known.

677
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:48,145
What sense had i of herstolen hours of lust?

678
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:51,920
I saw it not, it harmed me not.

679
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:55,826
I slept the next night well,was free and merry!

680
00:51:57,131 --> 00:52:01,295
I found not cassio's kisseson her lips.

681
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:12,109
A fine woman, a fair woman,a sweet woman.

682
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:20,414
Nay, you must forget that.

683
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,954
Ay, let her rot and perish,and be damned.

684
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:30,728
No, my heart is turned to stone.I strike it and it hurts my hand.

685
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:35,159
O, the world hath not asweeter creature!

686
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:41,970
She might lie by an emperor'sside and command him tasks.

687
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:44,209
Nay, that's not your way.

688
00:52:45,479 --> 00:52:49,575
Hang her! I do but saywhat she is.

689
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:54,013
So delicate with her needle.

690
00:52:54,855 --> 00:52:56,880
An admirable musician.

691
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,153
O, she will sing the savagenessout of a bear.

692
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,922
Of so high and plenteouswit and invention

693
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,065
she's the worse for all this.

694
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,632
O, a thousand, a thousandtimes.

695
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:13,906
Of so gentle a condition?

696
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,267
Ay, too gentle.

697
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:20,512
Nay, that's certain.Yet the pity of it, lago.

698
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:26,485
O lago, the pity of it, lago.

699
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,583
I will chop her into messes!

700
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,786
Cuckold me!

701
00:53:45,906 --> 00:53:47,237
- Will you think so?- Think so, lago?

702
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:49,399
- What, to kiss in private?- An unauthorized kiss?

703
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:52,167
Or to be naked with herfriend in bed an hour or more

704
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:53,936
not meaning any harm.

705
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,641
Naked in bed?

706
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:56,678
But if i give my wifea handkerchief

707
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:57,611
what then?

708
00:53:57,784 --> 00:54:00,048
Why, then 'tis hers, my lord,and being hers shy may,

709
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,152
i think, bestow't on any man.

710
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,017
By heaven, i would mostgladly have forgot it!

711
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:04,849
He had my handkerchief!

712
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:06,491
- Ay, what of that?- That's not so good now.

713
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:08,888
What if i had said i had seenhim do you wrong?

714
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,857
- Or heard him say- hath he said anything?

715
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:12,858
He hath, my lord, butno more than

716
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,532
what hath he said?

717
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:17,431
That he did i know not what he didwhat? What?

718
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:20,066
Lie.

719
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:24,808
Lie with her?

720
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:29,673
With her, on her, what you will.

721
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,293
Damnation!

722
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:18,390
My lord, i say, othello!

723
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:33,706
Dost thou mock me?

724
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:37,874
I mock you not, by heaven.

725
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:23,027
O now for ever farewellthe tranquil mind.

726
00:56:25,399 --> 00:56:27,390
Farewell content.

727
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:33,095
Farewell the plumed troops,and the big wars that make

728
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,876
ambition virtue. O farewell!

729
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:41,839
Farewell the neighing steed andthe shrill trump,

730
00:56:42,716 --> 00:56:47,551
the spirit-stirring drum,th'ear-piercing fife, the royal

731
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:54,024
banner, and all quality,pride, pomp, and circumstance,

732
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:56,729
of glorious war.

733
00:56:58,365 --> 00:57:02,802
And o you mortal engineswhose rude throats the immortal

734
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:06,132
jove's dread clamorscounterfeit.

735
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:12,500
Farewell! Othello's occupation'sgone!

736
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:55,649
- God save you, worthy general.- Pray you.

737
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:04,621
The duke and the senatorsof venice greet you.

738
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:08,433
I kiss the instrument oftheir pleasures.

739
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:25,110
Is there division 'twixt my lordand cassio?

740
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:28,413
A most unhappy one, i woulddo much t' atome them,

741
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,488
for the love i bear to cassio.

742
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:32,252
My lord?

743
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:34,687
May be th' letter moved him,for, i think, they do command

744
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:36,556
him home, deputing cassioin his government.

745
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:39,230
- Trust me, i am glad on it.- Indeed?

746
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:47,998
- Why, sweet othello- devil! Out of my way!

747
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,632
I will not stay to offend you.

748
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:51,367
Truly an obedient lady.

749
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:53,912
I do beseech your lordshipcall her back.

750
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,342
- Mistress!- My lord!

751
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:56,516
What would you do with her, sir?

752
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:57,850
Who? I, my lord?

753
00:58:58,351 --> 00:58:59,318
You did wish that i would makeher turn.

754
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:04,253
Sir, she can turn, and turn,and yet go on and turn again,

755
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:05,751
and she can weep, sir, weep.

756
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,651
And she's obedient, as you say,obedient. Very obedient.

757
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:11,022
Proceed you in your tears.

758
00:59:11,998 --> 00:59:13,226
Concerning this, sir

759
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:18,836
o well-painted passion!I am commanded home.

760
00:59:19,606 --> 00:59:24,407
Get you away, i'll sendfor you anon.

761
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:33,385
Sir, i obey the mandate andwill return to venice.

762
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,154
Cassio shall have my place.

763
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:45,395
You are welcome, sir,to cyprus.

764
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,340
Goats and monkeys!

765
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:04,309
Is he not light of brain?

766
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,151
He's that he is.

767
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:41,643
Let me see your eyes.

768
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:45,651
Look in my face.

769
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:56,164
Why, what art thou?

770
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,137
Your wife, my lord.Your true and loyal wife.

771
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:03,734
Had it pleased heaven to try mewith affliction, had they rained

772
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:08,209
all kinds of sores and shameson my bare head, steeped me

773
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,112
in poverty to the very lips,given to captivity me and

774
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:14,512
my utmost hopes.

775
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:20,722
I should have found in someplace of my soul a drop of patinece

776
01:01:21,795 --> 01:01:26,858
but, alas, to make me the fixedfigure for the time of scorn

777
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,731
to point his slow and movingfinger at.

778
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:34,101
Yet could i bear that too, well,very well.

779
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:41,603
But there where i have garneredup my heart, where either

780
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:47,219
i must live or bear no life,the fountain from the which my

781
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:57,352
current runs or else dries up,to be discarded thence, or

782
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,367
keep it as a cistern for foultoads to knot and gender in.

783
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:04,867
I hope my noble lordesteems me honest.

784
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:09,402
O, ay, as summer flies arein the shambles, that quicken

785
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:11,206
even with blowing.

786
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:20,385
O, thou weed, who art solovely fair, and smell'st so

787
01:02:20,754 --> 01:02:25,521
sweet, that the sense achesat thee, would thou hadst

788
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,763
never been born!

789
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:34,760
Alas, what ignorant sinhave i committed?

790
01:02:37,804 --> 01:02:41,501
Committed? A thou publiccommoner, i should make very

791
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,643
forges of my cheeks that wouldto cinders burn up modestly.

792
01:02:44,811 --> 01:02:47,575
Did i but speak thy deeds.What committed?

793
01:02:47,814 --> 01:02:50,442
Heaven stops the nose at it,and the moon winks,

794
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,676
the bawdy wind that kisses allit meets is hushed within the

795
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:58,187
hollow mine of earth andwill not hear't. What committed?

796
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:06,599
- Are not you a strumpet?- By heaven you do me wrong!

797
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:10,430
- Are not you a strumpet?- No, as i am a christian!

798
01:03:10,637 --> 01:03:11,763
- Is't possible?- O heaven forgive us!

799
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:13,768
I cry you mercy then.

800
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,602
I took you for that cunningwhore of venice that married with othello

801
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:52,275
how do you, madam?

802
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,845
How do you, my good lady?

803
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,551
Faith, half asleep.

804
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,152
Good madam, what's thematter with my lord?

805
01:04:01,354 --> 01:04:02,343
With who?

806
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:04,785
Why, with my lord, madam.

807
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:08,954
Who is thy lord?

808
01:04:09,128 --> 01:04:10,925
He that is yours, sweet lady.

809
01:04:11,898 --> 01:04:16,665
I have none. Do not talkto me, emilia.

810
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,532
I cannot weep, nor answers havei none, but what should go by water

811
01:04:22,508 --> 01:04:33,112
prithee tonight lay on mywedding sheets, remember.

812
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:24,196
Get me some poison, lago,this night.

813
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,331
I'll not expostulate with her,lest her body and beauty

814
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,837
unprovide my mind again.

815
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:33,806
Do it not with poison.

816
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:39,779
Strangle her in her bed, eventhe bed she hath contaminated.

817
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:43,080
Good, good! The justice ofit pleases.

818
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:47,826
And for cassio, let me behis undertaker.

819
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,924
Excellent good!

820
01:05:52,265 --> 01:05:54,062
You shall hear more by midnight.

821
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:15,586
A halter pardon him!

822
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:17,887
And hell gnaw his ones!

823
01:06:18,524 --> 01:06:20,116
Who should he call her whore?

824
01:06:21,027 --> 01:06:22,358
Who keeps her company?

825
01:06:23,363 --> 01:06:24,955
What time? What place?

826
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:28,960
What form? What likelihood?

827
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,799
The moor's abused by somemost villainous knave,

828
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,202
some base notorious knave,some scurvy fellow!

829
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:35,807
Speak within doors.

830
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:38,937
Some such squire he wasthat turned your wit the steamy

831
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,343
side without and made you tosuspect me with the moor.

832
01:06:42,482 --> 01:06:43,949
Desdemona.

833
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:54,083
Get you to bed.

834
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:56,428
Dismiss your attendant there.

835
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,260
Look't be done.

836
01:08:02,795 --> 01:08:05,263
I do not find that thou deal'stjustly with me.

837
01:08:05,398 --> 01:08:06,626
What in the contrary?

838
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:09,997
Every day thou daff'st mewith some device, lago.

839
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:12,500
I have wasted myself out ofmy means.

840
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:15,635
The jewels you have had fromme to deliver desdemona would

841
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,572
half have corrupted a votarist.

842
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,075
You have tole me she hathreceived them, and returned

843
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,215
me expectations and comfortsof sudden respect and

844
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,375
acquaintance, but i find none.

845
01:08:26,552 --> 01:08:29,020
Very well. Go to.

846
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,622
I cannot go to, man,nor 'tis not very well.

847
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:34,291
I will make myself knownto desdemona.

848
01:08:34,827 --> 01:08:36,761
She will return me my jewels.

849
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:42,197
If not, i will seek satisfactionof you.

850
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,428
Now i see there's a mettlein thee, and even from this

851
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:48,540
instant do build on thee abetter opinion than ever before.

852
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,843
Give me thy hand, roderigo.

853
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:58,615
I protest i have dealtmostly directly in thy affair.

854
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,986
It hath not appeared.

855
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:05,017
I grant thee it hath not appeared,and your suspicion is not

856
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:08,160
without wit and judgment.

857
01:09:09,095 --> 01:09:12,326
If thou hast that in thee indeedwhich i have greater reason

858
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:14,194
to believe now than ever,

859
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,334
i mean purpose, courage, andvalor, this night prove it.

860
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:27,311
If thou the next night followingenjoy not desdemona,

861
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:31,510
take me from this worldwith treachery.

862
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,756
There is especial commissioncome from venice to depute

863
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,232
cassio in othello's place.

864
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,801
Why, then othello and desdemonareturn again to venice.

865
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:58,503
Unless his abode be lingeredhere by some accident, wherein

866
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:04,408
none can be so determinateas the removing of cassio.

867
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:07,615
How do you mean, removing him?

868
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,580
Why, by making him uncapableof othello's place.

869
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,616
Knocking him out his brains.

870
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:19,325
And that you would haveme to do?

871
01:10:31,677 --> 01:10:35,443
I will be near to second your attempt,and he shall fall between us.

872
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:43,253
I have no great devotionto the deed.

873
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:44,514
It makes us, or it mars us.

874
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,018
Think on that.

875
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:06,138
Lago.

876
01:12:20,152 --> 01:12:21,119
Lago.

877
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:55,545
Hark! Who is it that knocks?

878
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:57,681
It is the wind.

879
01:13:05,765 --> 01:13:07,699
I called my love false love.

880
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:11,694
But what said he then?

881
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,477
O, these men, these men

882
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:27,743
dost thou in conscience think,tell me emilia, that there be

883
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:31,690
women do abuse their husbandsin such gross kind?

884
01:13:32,224 --> 01:13:33,987
There be some such,no question.

885
01:13:34,226 --> 01:13:36,126
Wouldst thou do such a deedfor all the world?

886
01:13:36,429 --> 01:13:37,623
Why, would not you?

887
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:38,886
No, by this heavenly light!

888
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,989
Nor i neither by thisheavenly light.

889
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,997
I might do it as well asin the dark.

890
01:13:43,803 --> 01:13:45,930
Wouldst thou do such a deedfor all the world?

891
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,275
The world's a huge place.

892
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:51,743
It is a great price for a small vice.

893
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:53,705
In troth, i think thouwouldst not.

894
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:55,770
In troth, i think i should.

895
01:13:56,248 --> 01:13:58,842
Marry, i would not do such athing for a joint-ring, nor for

896
01:13:58,984 --> 01:14:01,748
measures of lawn, nor forgowns, petticoats, nor caps,

897
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:05,323
nor any petty exhibition, butfor all the whole world?

898
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:07,449
I do not think there isany such woman.

899
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:12,561
Yes, a dozen, but i do thinkit is their husbands' faults

900
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,858
if wives do fall.

901
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,862
Say that they slack their dutiesand pour our treasures into

902
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,732
foreign laps, or else break outin peevish jealousies, throwing

903
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:23,864
restraint upon us,or say they strike us.

904
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:28,473
We have galls, and thoughwe have some grace.

905
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:30,138
Yet have we some revenge.

906
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:33,608
Let husbands know their wiveshave sense like them.

907
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,708
They see, and smell.

908
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,353
And have their palates both forsweet and sour, as husbands have.

909
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:41,251
What is it that they do whenthey change us for others?

910
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:43,051
Is it sport? I think it is.

911
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:45,393
And doth affection breed it?I think it doth.

912
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:48,496
Is't frailty that thus errs?It is so too.

913
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:52,927
And have we not affections?Desires for sport? And frailty?

914
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:54,800
As men have?

915
01:14:55,374 --> 01:14:58,434
Then let them use us well,else let them know, the ills

916
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,738
we do, their ills instructs us so.

917
01:15:01,013 --> 01:15:03,914
Good night. Good night.

918
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:02,672
It is the cause, it is the cause,my soul.

919
01:16:03,342 --> 01:16:07,108
Let me not name it for you,you chaste stars.

920
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:14,316
It is the cause. Yet i'll notshed her blood.

921
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:20,155
Nor scar that whiter skin ofhers than snow, and smooth

922
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:22,726
as monumental alabaster.

923
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:29,490
Yet she must die, else she'llbetray more men.

924
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:34,461
Put out the light, and thenput out the light.

925
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,366
If i quench thee, thou flamingminister, i can again they

926
01:17:39,638 --> 01:17:42,766
former light restore, shouldi repent me.

927
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:48,573
But once put out thy light,those cunning'st pattern of

928
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:53,844
excelling nature, i know notwhere is that promethean heat

929
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:57,784
than can thy light relume.

930
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,217
- Othello.- Ay, desdemona.

931
01:18:02,494 --> 01:18:04,189
Will you come to bed, my lord?

932
01:18:12,738 --> 01:18:14,069
Have you prayed tonight,desdemona?

933
01:18:14,173 --> 01:18:14,639
Ay, my lord.

934
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,206
If you bethink yourself of anycrime unreconciled as yet to

935
01:18:17,409 --> 01:18:20,970
heaven and grace,solicit for it straight.

936
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:23,712
Alas, my lord, what may youmean by that?

937
01:18:24,316 --> 01:18:25,613
Well, do it, and be brief.

938
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:30,219
I would not kill thyunprepared spirit.

939
01:18:31,356 --> 01:18:33,221
No, heaven forfend!

940
01:18:35,327 --> 01:18:37,056
I would not kill thy soul.

941
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:38,826
Talk you of killing?

942
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:41,758
Ay, i do.

943
01:18:42,835 --> 01:18:43,961
Then heaven have mercy on me.

944
01:18:44,203 --> 01:18:46,671
Amen, with all my heart.

945
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:51,968
If you say so, i hopeyou will not kill me.

946
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:57,745
Peace! And be still.

947
01:18:59,918 --> 01:19:03,046
I will so, and yet i fear you.

948
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:06,750
Why i should fear i know not,since guiltiness i know not.

949
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:09,050
But yet i feel i fear.

950
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,930
That handkerchief!

951
01:19:13,632 --> 01:19:16,658
That handkerchief which i soloved and gave thee,

952
01:19:17,136 --> 01:19:18,569
thou gave it to cassio.

953
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:20,529
No, by my life and soul!

954
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:22,365
Send for the man and ask him.

955
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:23,472
Sweet soul, take heed.

956
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:26,301
Take heed of perjury,thou art on thy deathbed.

957
01:19:27,546 --> 01:19:29,241
- Lord have mercy on me.- I say amen.

958
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:32,511
And have your mercy too.I never loved cassion in my life.

959
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,208
I saw the handkerchief.He found it then,

960
01:19:34,453 --> 01:19:35,215
i never gave it to him.

961
01:19:35,387 --> 01:19:37,582
Send for him, let himconfess the truth.

962
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,757
He hath confessed.

963
01:19:38,824 --> 01:19:39,449
What, my lord?

964
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:40,991
That he hath used thee.

965
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:46,521
How? Unlawfully?

966
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:49,332
Ay.

967
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:51,200
He will not say so.

968
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:53,495
No, his mouth is stopped.

969
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:57,033
Honest lago hath takenorder for it.

970
01:19:57,976 --> 01:19:58,965
What, is he dead?

971
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:02,347
Had all his hairs been lives,my great revenge had

972
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:03,812
stomach for them all.

973
01:20:04,283 --> 01:20:07,047
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thoufor him to my face?

974
01:20:07,252 --> 01:20:09,277
O, banish me, my lord,but kill me not!

975
01:20:09,521 --> 01:20:10,749
Down, strumpet!

976
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:13,015
Kill me tomorrow, let melive tonight!

977
01:20:18,864 --> 01:20:20,388
It is too late.

978
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,517
Now how dost thou look now?

979
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:53,787
Cold, cold, my girl,even like thy chastity!

980
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:57,124
O cursed, cursed slave!

981
01:20:57,336 --> 01:20:59,827
Whip me, ye devils, from thepossession of this heavenly sight!

982
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,504
Blow me about in winds!

983
01:21:01,807 --> 01:21:03,502
Roast me in sulphur!

984
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:08,135
Wash me in steep-down gulfsof liquid fire!

985
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:16,979
O desdemon! Dead desdemon!Dead, o! O!

986
01:21:17,422 --> 01:21:19,117
My lord! My lord!

987
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:22,385
What, ho, my lord! My lord!

988
01:21:22,661 --> 01:21:24,925
I do beseech you thati may speak with you, my lord.

989
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:29,265
What, ho, my lord!

990
01:21:30,269 --> 01:21:30,894
I had forgot thee.

991
01:21:31,103 --> 01:21:33,697
O my good lord, yonder...,alas, what cry is that?

992
01:21:34,006 --> 01:21:35,064
Yonder's murders done.

993
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:39,207
It is the very error of the moon.

994
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,312
She comes more nearer earththan she was wont

995
01:21:44,549 --> 01:21:46,278
and that makes men mad.

996
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,115
Alas! That was my lady's voice.

997
01:21:51,523 --> 01:21:55,960
O! Sweet desdemona!Who hath done this deed?

998
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:58,862
Nobody, i myself.

999
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,932
Commend me to my kind lord.

1000
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:32,019
You heard her say herself.

1001
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:33,423
It was not i.

1002
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,830
She said so. I must needsreport the truth.

1003
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:38,300
She's like a liar goneto burning hell!

1004
01:22:39,071 --> 01:22:40,299
It was i that killed her.

1005
01:22:40,772 --> 01:22:43,741
She turned to folly, andshe was a whore!

1006
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:44,601
Liar!

1007
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:46,040
Cassio did top her.

1008
01:22:46,244 --> 01:22:47,438
Ask thy husband else!

1009
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,843
That she was false to wedlock?

1010
01:22:49,014 --> 01:22:50,038
Ay, with cassio.

1011
01:22:50,248 --> 01:22:54,651
Had she been true, if heavenwould make me such another

1012
01:22:54,786 --> 01:22:59,450
world of one entire and perfectchrysolite,

1013
01:23:01,293 --> 01:23:02,726
i'd not have sold her for it.

1014
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,987
My husband say she was false?

1015
01:23:05,163 --> 01:23:06,755
Ay, it was he that told meon her first.

1016
01:23:06,999 --> 01:23:10,025
An honest man he is, and hatesthe slime that sticks

1017
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:11,462
on filthy deeds.

1018
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,232
She was too fond of hermost filthy bargain.

1019
01:23:14,373 --> 01:23:14,930
Peace.

1020
01:23:15,107 --> 01:23:16,904
- Do thy worst.- Peace.

1021
01:23:17,342 --> 01:23:18,969
This deed of thine is no moreworthy heaven than

1022
01:23:19,177 --> 01:23:20,201
thou wast worthy her.

1023
01:23:20,379 --> 01:23:21,539
Peace, you were best.

1024
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:26,174
O gull! O dolt! As ignorantas dirt!

1025
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:28,809
I'll make thee known thoughi lost twenty lives.

1026
01:23:29,154 --> 01:23:31,748
Help! Help, ho, help!

1027
01:23:32,024 --> 01:23:33,992
Murder! Help, ho!

1028
01:23:34,726 --> 01:23:36,523
Disprove this villain, if thoube'st a man.

1029
01:23:36,628 --> 01:23:38,152
He says thou told'st him thathis wife was false.

1030
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,557
I know thou didst not.

1031
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:41,763
Speak, for my heart is full.

1032
01:23:41,967 --> 01:23:43,992
I told him what i thought, andtold no more than what he

1033
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:45,567
found himself was apt and true.

1034
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,102
But did you ever tell himshe was false?

1035
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:48,664
I did.

1036
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:54,968
You told a lie, upon mysoul, a lie! A wicked lie!

1037
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,910
Did you say with cassio?

1038
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:58,639
With cassio, mistress.

1039
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,774
Go to, charm your tongue.

1040
01:23:59,885 --> 01:24:01,079
I will not charm my tongue.

1041
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:02,811
I am bound to speak.

1042
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:05,983
My mistress here liesmurdered in her bed.

1043
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:07,384
Heaven forfend!

1044
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:12,328
Nay, stare not, masters.

1045
01:24:12,998 --> 01:24:15,330
It is true indeed.

1046
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,536
Villainy, villainy, villainy!

1047
01:24:20,839 --> 01:24:23,137
I think upon it, i think i smell it.

1048
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:26,276
O villainy! I thought so then.

1049
01:24:28,413 --> 01:24:31,075
I'll kill myself for grief.

1050
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:32,439
What, are you mad?

1051
01:24:32,617 --> 01:24:33,641

Nay, lay thee down and roar,for thou hast killed the sweetest

1057
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,470

O, she was foul!

1059
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:59,470
Lago knows that she withcassio hath the act of shame

01:24:59,778 --> 01:25:01,211
a thousand times committed.

1061
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:01,710
O heaven!

1062
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,839
Cassio confessed it, and shedid gratify his amorous works

1063
01:25:05,117 --> 01:25:06,550
with that handkerchief!

1064
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:07,577

1068
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:20,096
Heaven! A man, devil didthem all, all, all!

1069
01:25:20,298 --> 01:25:23,358
I shame against me,yet i'll speak.

1070
01:25:23,735 --> 01:25:26,829
Oh, thou dull moor, thathandkerchief thou speaks of

1071
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:30,270
i found by fortune, and didgive my husband

1072
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:52,955

1073
01:25:58,436 --> 01:26:00,461
She loved thee.

1074
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:18,718
Othello, did you and heconsent in cassio's death?

1075
01:26:18,823 --> 01:26:19,812
Ay.

1076
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,223
Dear general, i never gaveyou cause.

1077
01:26:22,527 --> 01:26:25,553
Othello, your power andyour command is taken off,

1078
01:26:26,064 --> 01:26:28,032
and cassio rules in cyprus.

1079
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:35,706
Be not afraid though you dosee me weaponed.

1080
01:26:40,245 --> 01:26:43,112
Here is my journey's end.

1081
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:48,210
Here is my butt, the veryseamark of my utmost sail.

1082
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:58,918
Will you, i pray, demand thatdemi-devil why he hath thus

1083
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:00,793
ensnared my soul and body?

1084
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,799
Demand me nothing.

1085
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,773
What you know, you know.

1086
01:27:11,743 --> 01:27:15,736
Are there no stones in heavenbut what serves for the thunder?

1087
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:53,441
I pray you, when you shallthese unlucky deeds relate,

1088
01:27:56,554 --> 01:27:58,044
speak of me as i am.

1089
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,927
Nothing extenuate, nor setdown aught in malice.

1090
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:15,900
Then must you speak of one thatloved not wisely, but too well.

1091
01:28:18,343 --> 01:28:21,779
Of one not easily jealous,but being wrought,

1092
01:28:24,316 --> 01:28:32,815
perplexed in the extreme,of one whose hand like the

1093
01:28:33,124 --> 01:28:41,293
base indian, threw a pearlaway richer than all his tribe.

1094
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:47,496
Set you down this.

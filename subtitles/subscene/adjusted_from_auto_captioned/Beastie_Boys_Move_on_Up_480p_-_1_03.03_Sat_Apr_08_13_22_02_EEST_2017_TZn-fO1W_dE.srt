Boys Before Flowers began to gain popularity.

20
00:0-6:0-360,00-360450 --> 00:0-5:0-358,00-358140
A parody even started.

21
00:0-5:0-356,00-356300 --> 00:0-5:0-353,00-353550
People constantly greet each other on the set.

00:0-5:0-347,00-347250 --> 00:0-5:0-343,00-343680
During the shootings, it became dangerous sometimes.

Following accidents on set, main characters got into car accidents.

25
00:0-5:0-336,00-336300 --> 00:0-5:0-330,00-330810
The actress playing Geum JanDi, Goo HaeSun, got into a car accident.

26
00:0-5:0-323,00-323000 --> 00:0-5:0-321,00-321970
Inside this hospital is Goo HaeSun.

27
00:0-5:0-314,00-314520 --> 00:0-5:0-311,00-311300
I just finished shooting an episode with her, before the accident.

28
00:0-5:0-311,00-311300 --> 00:0-5:0-307,00-307350
I found out from my manager.

29
00:0-5:0-307,00-307350 --> 00:0-5:0-305,00-305120
Which brings me here.

30
00:0-5:0-303,00-303470 --> 00:0-4:0-299,00-299370
With worry, the F4 members entered the hospital.

31
00:0-4:0-291,00-291670 --> 00:0-4:0-288,00-288320
Because of the shock of her accident, Goo HaeSun needed peace.

32
00:0-4:0-283,00-283990 --> 00:0-4:0-279,00-279830
It's like as soon as I got over my car accident, she got into one.

33
00:0-4:0-279,00-279830 --> 00:0-4:0-270,00-270010
I got pretty upset when I heard the news.

34
00:0-4:0-270,00-270010 --> 00:0-4:0-266,00-266330
Her leg and her face were hurt in the accident.

35
00:0-4:0-266,00-266330 --> 00:0-4:0-260,00-260970
I wish HaeSun will think of her health and rest.

36
00:0-4:0-260,00-260970 --> 00:0-4:0-257,00-257110
I hope she only thinks about her health.

37
00:0-4:0-257,00-257110 --> 00:0-4:0-249,00-249430
She should feel better and then start shooting episodes again.

38
00:0-4:0-249,00-249430 --> 00:0-4:0-243,00-243600
I hope all the viewers understand that.

39
00:0-4:0-243,00-243600 --> 00:0-4:0-240,00-240070
Please be patient until she recovers. Thank you for your consideration.

40
00:0-3:0-238,00-238350 --> 00:0-3:0-235,00-235190
The popular drama Boys Before Flowers.

41
00:0-3:0-235,00-235190 --> 00:0-3:0-231,00-231690
We will anticipate good news.

42
00:0-3:0-229,00-229440 --> 00:0-3:0-225,00-225650
I know you have been anticipating new episodes.

43
00:0-3:0-225,00-225650 --> 00:0-3:0-221,00-221970
I'm sorry, but there has, as you have just seen, been bad news.

00:0-3:0-221,00-221970 --> 00:0-3:0-216,00-216900

45
00:0-3:0-214,00-214580 --> 00:0-3:0-208,00-208180
Instead, we have made a new special for this drama.

49
00:0-3:0-190,00-190230 --> 00:0-3:0-185,00-185830
Give a round of applause for the F4 members!

50
00:0-2:0-172,00-172700 --> 00:0-2:0-169,00-169880
The schedule is pretty tight now, isn't it?

51
00:0-2:0-169,00-169880 --> 00:0-2:0-167,00-167120
Yes, when I'm not busy, the most I can sleep is about 2 or 3 hours.

52
00:0-2:0-162,00-162650 --> 00:0-2:0-159,00-159670
When you sleep a lot, it's only 2-3 hours?!

53
00:0-2:0-159,00-159670 --> 00:0-2:0-151,00-151570
What happens when you can't sleep?urm, well, I'll shoot all night, and get maybe 1-2 hours.

54
00:0-2:0-151,00-151470 --> 00:0-2:0-146,00-146090
You must've been very tired. How about you Kim Bum?

55
00:0-2:0-146,00-146090 --> 00:0-2:0-141,00-141000
No, I'm fine.

56
00:0-2:0-141,00-141000 --> 00:0-2:0-135,00-135950
How about you, HyunJoong? Your face has become very slender.

57
00:0-2:0-135,00-135950 --> 00:0-2:0-132,00-132680
Yes, as I shoot more episodes, somehow I lost more body weight.

58
00:0-2:0-132,00-132680 --> 00:0-2:0-130,00-130020
It becomes a diet, so I guess there are some good points!

59
00:0-2:0-130,00-130020 --> 00:0-2:0-126,00-126140
Yes, it's pretty okay overall.

60
00:0-2:0-126,00-126140 --> 00:0-2:0-120,00-120030
All staff members have been losing about 5-6kg while shooting.

61
00:0-2:0-120,00-120030 --> 00:0-1:0-113,00-113170
Jun nee, you're okay too, right?

62
00:0-1:0-113,00-113170 --> 00:0-1:0-105,00-105420
He's so good looking, I can't talk to him right!

63
00:0-1:0-105,00-105420 --> 00:0-1:0-98,00-98900
It's not easy to talk to them when they're right in front of me!

64
00:0-1:0-98,00-98899 --> 00:0-1:0-96,00-96900
I thought, "well, they can't be that good looking", but when I actually met them

65
00:0-1:0-96,00-96900 --> 00:0-1:0-88,00-88170
How could they bring all the pretty boys together?yes, so you can call me man4Ah4, ah4!

66
00:0-1:0-88,00-88170 --> 00:0-1:0-81,00-81480
There has been a lot of popularity for Boys Before Flowers. Do you notice?

67
00:0-1:0-81,00-81480 --> 00:0-1:0-78,00-78100
JoonPyo, how do you take this in?

68
00:0-1:0-78,00-78100 --> 00:0-1:0-70,00-70360
Well, I didn't really realize the popularity for the first or second episodes. It wasn't until the third and fourth episode I started to see.

69
00:0-1:0-70,00-70360 --> 00:0-1:0-64,00-64140
It was then when I saw how popular it really is.

70
00:0-1:0-64,00-64140 --> 00:00:0-58,00-58910
So I think I really understood it then.

71
00:00:0-58,00-58910 --> 00:00:0-53,00-53930
A little while ago, we went down to film (on location). Around 2-3 thousand fans had gathered at the set during the shooting.

72
00:00:0-53,00-53930 --> 00:00:0-46,00-46990
SInce it wasn't the last scene, I had to shoot another one that was supposed to finish at 11 pm.

73
00:00:0-46,00-46990 --> 00:00:0-41,00-41700
We had to wait until about five a.m. .

74
00:00:0-41,00-41700 --> 00:00:0-38,00-38320
So you had to wait until it got quiet, oohh.Yeah, that's right.

75
00:00:0-38,00-38320 --> 00:00:0-33,00-33480
Even fans get tired at around 5!

76
00:00:0-33,00-33480 --> 00:00:0-28,00-28810
So the entire staff pretended to leave,

77
00:00:0-28,00-28810 --> 00:00:0-21,00-21700
and they returned.Wow!But things like that might be the reason for later filming.

78
00:00:0-21,00-21700 --> 00:00:0-17,00-17000
Now that I think of it, all of you have actually been in an accident, right?

79
00:00:0-17,00-17000 --> 00:00:0-11,00-11230
Yes, my toes were hurt so I had surgery but now they're okay.

80
00:00:0-11,00-11230 --> 00:00:0-7,00-7320
You visited GooHyeSeun too, how was she?

81
00:00:0-7,00-7320 --> 00:00:00,00-580
Well, when I saw her, her face had relaxed a lot. Still, there

82
00:00:00,00-580 --> 00:00:02,370
And she had surgery on her face, so the strings were

83
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,360
on the side of her lips?Yes.

84
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,060
So until that gets better, she should probably rest.

85
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,940
There MAY be some people that do not know of the BBF story.

86
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,840
because due to its popularity rising, people may have just started watching.

87
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,380
For those viewers, I have prepared a summary of episodes 1-16 so far.

88
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:34,790
Let's watch!

89
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,890
The new transfer student to the luxury high school, ShinHwa, Geum JanDi.

90
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,600
Geum JanDi, fighting!

91
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,650
School life wasn't exactly comfortable for her.

92
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,590
Lick it.

93
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,460
Can't you stop?

94
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,370
Who is she?

95
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,540
What?Then you lick it instead of her.

96
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,900
If you lick it, I'll let it go.

97
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,710
What's wrong with you?!

98
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:40,400
It's up, it's up! The sophomore in class B, Geum JanDi, got the red card!

99
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,990
Hey, you keep chuckling to yourself, what's wrong with you?

100
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,160
Around this time, her lids probably popped.

101
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,180
Goo JoonPyo gradually began to fall for Geum JanDi.

102
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,620
What?

103
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,560
Stop . . . stop now . . . help me.

104
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:39,410
You still don't believe me.

105
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,170
I believe..i believe in you.

106
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,820
In the name of ShinHwa F4, I have an announcement to make.

107
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:11,150
From this day forward, second year Geum JanDi will officially be the girlfriend of F4's Goo JoonPyo.

108
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,330
Where are we going?

109
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,500
I have something to show you..

110
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,080
Alright, look outside.

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,090
Wow, it's a heart! It's really in the shape of a heart!

112
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,600
If I found a girl I liked, I promised myself that I would bring her here.

113
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,030
Do you see it? My heart.

114
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,990
It's wrong, right? It's all wrong, isn't it?

115
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,720
I guess that you know her better than me.

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Sunbae.

117
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,610
Please, be happy.

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,020
Tell me you will be.

119
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,660
If sunbae's sad, I'm sad too.

120
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,490
They felt each other's pain in love.

121
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,300
So, it was like this?

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,360
Goo JoonPyo! Stop, don't do this, this is . . .This is what? Is this something you don't know about either?

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:49,030
I'm sorry.Geum JanDi, don't ever act like you know me from now on.

124
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,150
Due to JiHoo, JanDi and JoonPyo's love was over.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,450
Yoon JiHoo is no longer a member of F4.

126
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,170
What?JunPyo . . .

127
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:19,440
Also, in a week from now, Yoon JiHoo and Geum JanDi will be expelled from this school.

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,480
But, then his heart couldn't easily forget Geum JanDi.

129
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,030
Why did it have to be JiHoo out of all people.If only it wasn't JiHoo . . .

130
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,430
Goo JoonPyo . . .

131
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,440
Say that you like me once.

132
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:52,400
However, their thoughts were messed up about each other.

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,910
Yes? What did you say?

134
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,400
JoonPyo. Goo JoonPyo . . .

135
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,370
Get up! Geum JanDi's here!

136
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,610
Get up man!

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Goo JoonPyo.Please wake up. Why are you doing this?

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
The words you wanted me to say, I think I can say them now.But if you're like this, what am I supposed to do?

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,880
Wake up!

140
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,130
Are you telling the truth?

141
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,770
With F4's help, they confirmed the love between Geum JanDi and Goo JoonPyo.

142
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,140
Ya, Geum JanDi must have been really shocked. Look at her shoes, shoes!

143
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,350
JoonPyo, lucky you!

144
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:21,140
If it were me, I could die happy right now!Sunbae!Sorry.We had to do something about it because both of you are so stubborn.

145
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,360
Meanwhile, Kang Hye Jang (JoonPyo's mom) finds out that they're dating.

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,610
Her dad's a dry cleaner, her mom works at a bath house.

147
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,480
Yes, that's right.

148
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,190
Stop the car.We don't need to stop the car.Don't you hear me?! STOP THE CAR!

149
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:51,200
Goo JunPyo./br Geum JanDi. Stand still,

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,670
please stand still.

151
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,840
But Goo JoonPyo shows his love in front of Kang Hye Jang.

152
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,100
Find JoonPyo right now. He needs to go somewhere with me.

153
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Okay.

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,370
I didn't get to thank him.

155
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,810
I couldn't even tell him I like him.

156
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,980
And thus a long time of separation comes between the two.

157
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,190
I'll be back soon. Don't go anywhere, just wait . . .

158
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,960
I love you, Geum JanDi.

159
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,100
In this section, or entirely?

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,320
Uhm, entirely I'd have to say the first kiss with JanDi was most tender . . .

161
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,740
on the swings in the playground.

162
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,190
I'm good looking, I'm tall, I have a lot of money.

163
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:04,130
NG.. (laugh).

164
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,770
Again!

165
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,990
I'm good looking.I'm smart, I'm rich. How could you hate me?

166
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,980
Wow! It's really good! How could you hate him?

167
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,790
Please say that to . . .

168
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,390
Which one?"Geum JanDi, 2year (of high school) Class B, is my girlfriend."?

169
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:38,740
No, not that.Ahh, "kkuhjuh" (meaning go away).

170
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,610
Oh, I don't think I can do it.Then please look at me and do it.

171
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,310
If I look at him, I can't do it even more!Then please look at the middle and do it.

172
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:58,150
Kkuhjuh.That "kkuhjuh" is cool.

173
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:06,060
I didn't need that many lines.

174
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,630
It was mostly, "Yo! What's up?".

175
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,770
Then please show us the real way to say it.

176
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,640
It's not very friendly.

177
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,500
When I met my friends, I would say, "Yo! What's up?"

178
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,700
It's awkward, right?

179
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,620
Get lost!

180
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,860
What about "kkujuh"?

181
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,530
"Hurry up and get lost", sorry.

182
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,370
The conversation between Goo JoonPyo and his older sister,

183
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,740
You remember, right?You, know, "What kind of guys I hate the most?".Here's his sister.

184
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,480
What kind of guys do I hate the most?

185
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
The guy who is lying.

186
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,410
the guy which i don't like most?

187
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,460
Wait, no, I'm sorry, I didn't catch the feeling in time.

188
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,780
Sorry, please thing that your sister got really sick

189
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,510
So now her nose is stuffy and her voice sounds different

190
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,300
A.. a unfair man.

191
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,430
A person who keeps a grudge?

192
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,540
Oh, what kind of man was that again?

193
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,600
And Goo JunPyo is what kind of man? Your older sister's favorite man!

194
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,400
The second section of the summary, let's watch together!

195
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,920
Yoon JiHoo had JanDi's back during hard times.

196
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,070
You're gonna catch a cold.

197
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm okay though.

198
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,180
Thank you.

199
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,640
It's really warm!

200
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,790
I hoped you wouldn't need it, but oh, well.

201
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,020
See?Sunbae.

202
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,910
Whenever my heart rings the emergency bell, you appear.

203
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,800
Fine, command me.

204
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,050
What?

205
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,440
To be Geum JanDi's emergency car.

206
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Hmm, it's my first time riding one of these.

207
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,840
In the end, JanDi goes to find JoonPyo in Macau.

208
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,950
H-hi. I came.

209
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,340
Yeah, so what brings you here?

210
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,530
Just so you know, I'm doing fine. And as you can see, I'm busy.

211
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:59,940
You can go now. You don't need to worry about me.

212
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,340
So to you, I'm like . . .A stain I would like to erase./br

213
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,000
This is so cruel, Goo JoonPyo.

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,400
I was always like this.

215
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,860
Once again, JiHoo helps JanDi's broken heart.

216
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,880
It's the first time in my life, earning money with my own hands.

217
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,120
When I'm with you, there's a lot of new things I do.

218
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,620
So because of that, thanks.

219
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,790
Young master, should we go now?

220
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,830
Wait just a little bit.

221
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,850
Why did you come?

222
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,310
I don't have anything to say to you.

223
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,620
Speaking of which, what are you doing ?

224
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,490
You think you have the right to ask that kind of question?

225
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,920
Yoon JiHoo!

226
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,590
I forgave you because you were my friend, and I tried to stay away from her because she was my friend's girl.

227
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:30,720
I held myself, and gave you a chance for you to be with her.

228
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,630
I'm not holding back any more.

229
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,600
Enough!

230
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,670
Why did you come?

231
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,380
Do you have something to say?

232
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,690
Fine. I get it.

233
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,120
I'm leaving.

234
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,460
A new girl appears in JunPyo's life.

235
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,590
Oh, I found him!

236
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,810
What do you mean, "What?"? You're engaged to me!

237
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,940
Hey, ugh. Aren't you gonna let GO of me?

238
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:54,700
Listen carefully, I'm only saying this once. My name's Ha JaeKyung. Starting today, I'm engaged to you.

239
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,790
You got it ?

240
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:03,890
From now on, I'm gonna tame you.

241
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,800
How is this love mess going to untangle itself?

242
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,150
Oh that's right! Lee Minho was chosen out of 200 people for his hairstyle?

243
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:35,670
When I went to the second tryouts, I went with my hair curled.

244
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,700
It's like the hair in comic books.

245
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes, I made it similar to that and went.

246
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:51,840
The staff members said it suited me.

247
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,910
They said that, and I think they liked it.

248
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,600
That hairstyle is the same hairstyle for Goo JoonPyo right?

249
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,710
No, it wasn't.

250
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,750
That was the second time I curled it,

251
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,890
And the sixth time was when my hair turned perfectly into JoonPyo's hair.

252
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:15,030
Wow, you must've put a lot of effort into that! But now it's a trend.

253
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:23,300
That's right, every guy has the same hairstyle either as Goo JoonPyo or HyunJoong.

254
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,170
Yeah. Everywhere you walk, everyone has Goo Joonpyo's or Hyunjoong's hair style

255
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:35,000
Even this announcer next to me tried to copy HyunJoong's hairstyle!

256
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,050
Yeah, I was going to do your hair style, but I undid it.How did everyone else get their role?

257
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm still preparing concert in JP...

258
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,750
You asked them what you would be doing and how did they reply?

259
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,480
For now, just do what you're doing.

260
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,860
And I asked them what they were doing without me knowing.

261
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,640
At that time, BBF was a hit in Japan.

262
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
So at first, I thought they were kidding.

263
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,870
So they told me we'd talk back in Korea, so after the concert,

264
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,870
when I got there, they wanted to have a meeting.

265
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:46,100
So at the meeting, they told me there was a drama casting, and they asked me what I thought of it.

266
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,890
But I told them I had to quickly release an album in Japan! But my manager said

267
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,360
to do it because it was a good opportunity, so I did.

268
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,430
So there was a story behind this!And apparently your manager is very scary!

269
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:07,600
My manager is a very nice person.

270
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,340
In my position, my character was cast very late.

271
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:20,000
But I think that there was no way around it, 'cause they were casting East of Eden at that time.

272
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,110
I think because I met the right opportunities, I'm living happily and having fun.

273
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,080
Kim Jun, how was your casting as WooBin?

274
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,180
It's my first time in a drama, so I watched the auditions.

275
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,400
Yes, yes. Auditions aren't something that you look at and memorize,

276
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,790
it's something you continuously have to look over.

277
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:17,900
Before that, we had no idea who was cast,

278
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:24,950
Lee MinHo and I met at auditions, but I didn't know his role or anything.

279
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,090
So I wondered, why is his hair so curled?

280
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,800
I saw him during the audition, so . . .

281
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,510
He's tall. On top of that, he was walking around with glaring eyes.

282
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:51,050
He looked cool, and I later found out that we were cast together.

283
00:23:51,050 --> 00:24:01,340
I had recently seen the movie "Public Enemy Returns."

284
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:08,580
So when I saw him, I thought, "Oh, the guy who got stabbed with a knife!"

285
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:16,470
I kept remembering that part in the movie!

286
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,190
The dead guy shouldn't be here.

287
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,500
So I felt a little weird when I first saw him.

288
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,600
I remember Kim Bum in a drama, where he was really good at crying scenes.

289
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,600
So for those reasons, I found it really interesting.

290
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,910
So the person who dies, the person who cries, Kim Joon...

291
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,410
Wasn't that a first impression?

292
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:57,350
At first, I saw GaEul in a movie

293
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,160
"The Show Must Go on." She came out as a bad girl.

294
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,330
She was in that movie?Yes, as the bad daughter.

295
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,200
My wife is in that too.Right. That's right.

296
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,770
Oh yes, my wife appears in that same movie in the middle somewhere.

297
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,180
Why did I mention this?

298
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,610
So Kim Joon, aren't you the oldest in this group? How is it after being friendly with the other three of the F4?

299
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:35,800
There are some similar parts and different parts. Like MinHo, he looks very tall and sophisticated.

300
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:45,180
But when you get familiar with him, he has this cute behavior.

301
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,160
He's really kind and sweet unlike the character he plays.

302
00:25:51,160 --> 00:26:03,450
WIth HyunJoong, it's pretty much the same. He's funny.

303
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:09,630
HyunJoong is basically your atmosphere maker.

304
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,100
Yes, that seems right.

305
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,430
He has this unexpected personality to him.

306
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:26,340
When I first saw KimBum, he looked young.

307
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,420
But actually, he's very experienced and I ask for help from him sometimes.

308
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,790
What is Kim Joon like?He's the problem solver of the group.

309
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:45,130
When we're hanging out, he handles situations like this...

310
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,800
He takes control of situations. He says he's not good at something and shows slight potential for scamming.

311
00:26:50,800 --> 00:27:00,740
He's almost like a con artist.He says he can't do something, but he really can, and wins.

312
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,610
He must be really competitive.He must have really held that against me. He mentioned it before, too.

313
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,820
But, he really has a good heart. Really.

314
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,590
But, he's really modest to the extreme.

315
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,960
He can do everything.He says he can't, but there is nothing he can't do.

316
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,460
Everyone must have lost a bet to him once.

317
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,810
It's not as popular as the national drama "Boys over Flowers," but you must know the national pop song right?

318
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,720
I guess you don't know "Noona's Dream."[Hyung Young's Song "Noona's Dream"]

319
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,740
It's really not the national pop song, is it?

320
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,190
Noona's fantasies. I asked the ladies around me who are 30 and over this question.

321
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,640
"What present do you wish to receive from F4?"

322
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,950
Let's see what girls want as a present from the F4!

323
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,000
The first present they want to receive is . . .

324
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,670
To have a scarf tied by So YiJung.

325
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,940
That scene outside the club . . .

326
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,490
Although it was just an act, it was the first scene where feelings are shown for GaEul.

327
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,900
Well, we must see this since there are possibly some people who don't know what we're talking about.

328
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,190
Must be nice....and here, let me pull out your hair

329
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:54,390
Oh, and this side, too.So that was the first one.

330
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,800
And so what was the second one?

331
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,310
Here's the second one.

332
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,500
And the second one is...

333
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,570
To have shoes put on by Yoon JiHoo.

334
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,510
You did wash your feet this morning, right?Oh, of course...I went to the bathhouse.

335
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:23,070
Oh, these are those expensive shoes in Macau

336
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,600
Is this the right size for you?You must be lucky!

337
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:42,010
Oh my, what to do?

338
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,850
I wanted to buy you something with the first money I ever earned.

339
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:51,990
Thank you, JiHoo. I'll wear it well.

340
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:05,410
Oh, this is so awesome.

341
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,300
It's alright, right, Jihoo?Yes, I think it's fine.

342
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,550
We have one more left, to receive a back hug from Goo JoonPyo.

343
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:25,630
Everyone, please don't hate Hyun-young.

344
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,590
I happen to be the only woman here, so . . .

345
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,840
We got it all ready.Oh, shall we do the necklace? You pick one out of the two.

346
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,470
Actually, when the necklace is given, it's given in the state of the back hug.

347
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,020
So you must do both.Ladies, use your imagination and put your face in this picture right now.

348
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,610
I'm substituting for everyone.

349
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,440
I won't be placing the necklace around your neck.

350
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,400
What should I do?Stay still![I am so happy!]

351
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:18,010
Please give a round of applause.are you trembling from him just touching you?

352
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,720
Oh, I can have it?

353
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes, please have it.Oh thank you

354
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,830
Isn't there only one of this kind in the world?No, there's a lot.

355
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,320
But the only two people who received this necklace from the F4 ar Geum JanDi and me.

356
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:48,860
If I could come back in another life, I would want to be in F4.Since all I've done is receive, I prepared something for you, too.

357
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Do-shi-rak (lunch box).

358
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:08,370
The eye is like a monster.I actually like eyes are closer together.

359
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:14,330
The nose is in the middle of the face

360
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,580
I think it got carsick - Im sorry

361
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:28,000
Please take the lunch box

362
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,140
The carsick lunch box.

363
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,410
Because of this, girls were going crazy trying to bake cookies

364
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:44,450
I've made them too, Goo JoonPyo cookies!

365
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:54,000
Yoon JiHoo eats one, too.

366
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,650
Charismatic JoonPyo, smooth JiHoo,

367
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:24,020
Casanova YiJung, and tough WooBin

368
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,730
It is hard, so we have something prepared for you all: King before Flowers.

369
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,500
Out of these four gentlemen, who is the king?

370
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,470
You have a rose in your hand right?

371
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:45,480
We will see at the end who has the most flowers

372
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,680
Let's see who gets the most roses.

373
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Let's start asking the questions now.

374
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,620
First question. Of the members, who is the best looking?

375
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,320
Please start thinking now

376
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:12,100
This is hard right? When i look at it its a hard decision too.Hmmm, maybe each thinks he is the best-looking...

377
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,720
In that case, you can keep the flower yourself.Oh yeah?

378
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,380
If you think it's yourself, you don't need to give it to anyone.Oh, it looks like Kim Bum has something planned...

379
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:27,440
1, 2, 3 . . .Oh, this is weird. Thank you.

380
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:39,350
Of the members, who has the most individual roles?

381
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,400
Kim Joon has 2Be sure to accept the flower that's coming to you...

382
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,820
You can't leave that out

383
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:11,450
In the drama it's very embarrassing to dance though

384
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:31,440
1, 2, dan dan [dance steps], 1 , 2 dan dan.Go backwards then forwards.

385
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:41,520
Yes, these are the dance steps. Ready, start.Just do that and that's the dance, right?Let's match it to the music.

386
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,140
Oh wait, this isn't quite right.

387
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,700
I heard that you're really good at guitar as well

388
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:21,500
I think in episode 17 or 18, I play the guitar for JanDi.

389
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Which is why we've prepared a guitar for you!

390
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,020
Oh this is a bit...What about that piece you played...

391
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,890
Remember when you took the apple away?Was there guitar playing in the apple scene?Oh, what was that?

392
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,090
it's because my fingers are cold.

393
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:28,020
I can't play the guitar.I don't really have any musical talent.

394
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:33,350
Oh, it's totally fine.I can play the piano.

395
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,140
Oh, piano?This house doesn't seem to have a piano.Oh, then later, in the other room, we can use the piano.

396
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,470
We'll play it in the next room.Do you, by chance, know how to play the guitar as well?

397
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:50,070
I also play piano...Oh so you all play piano. We'll hear your piano playing in the next room, then.

398
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:56,990
Better than the drama, the NG's!

399
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,680
NG before flowers!

400
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:10,420
How should I do so?Sunbae, snap out if it, please!And if I can't... oops! sorry

401
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:20,530
Sunbae, snap out of it, please!the one who isn't snapping out of is... Aiyah! I'm going crazy. Sorry

402
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,470
It's a good morning.

403
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,600
In the name of F4, I have an announcement to make..Laughing...What's wrong with you?I'm sorry.

404
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,570
Go now.

405
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,800
I'm sorryWhere's the headrest?

406
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,760
Do you want to die?

407
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:41,640
Before it cools, you have to eat it when it's still warm.

408
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,690
Oh this is so well-cooked...Honey, what about the braised fish?

409
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:51,360
CAPTION: Do I really have to eat this?This has been cooking since the crack of dawn...

410
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,390
Noona!

411
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,810
Is this funny?

412
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,770
Butler Lee, ttak ok ok gah.... (Trying to say ttak kuh, meaning clean it up.)

413
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:33,360
Ah, the night air feels nice. Hey, do you remember?

414
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,100
The thing we did when we were young

415
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:15,630
Move; let me do it.

416
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:22,610
Call JoonPyo. JanDi's in danger.

417
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,660
Sorry, man, I'm really sorry.

418
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,020
Glad to meet you (She's Chinese)- Oh, Glad to meet you. You can speak korean!

419
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,600
I love you.I love you? By whom were you taught?

420
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:39,810
[They're still acting](She's speaking in Chinese)

421
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,870
What did you just say?

422
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:52,980
Huh?I have nothing to talk about, anymore.

423
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,860
I really have nothing more to say.

424
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,540
Mini series "Boys over Flowers..."

425
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,650
Flower boys' NG will be continued till the end of the drama, with you viewers.

426
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,840
After watched it, you guys said no, but in my opinion,

427
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,900
The NG King is already picked.

428
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,820
The NG(mistakes during shooting) King - Lee MinHo.

429
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:34,000
You admit your mistakes quickly, though, don't you?Yes, I should admit them quickly.

430
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,570
You have reactions each, after you make NG, don't you?

431
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:45,530
I think MinHo says he's sorry asap, if he makes one.Right, I admit my mistakes early.

432
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,800
Since we are visiting the house, shall we begin our tour now?Yes, we should take a look around.

433
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,910
Many women must be waiting for this moment.

434
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,620
We're now moving.

435
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:03,430
Can you lead us?- Where would you like to go first?Let's go to your room

436
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,690
We're here in JunPyo's room.- Right, I'm in JUNPYO's room.

437
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,770
Everyone has much anticipated this... Junpyo would you tell us more about the room?

438
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:28,850
Everything has been prepared in advance.The closet is actually elsewhere, but you can see the clothes that are used during filming.

439
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:37,100
This fur is Goo Joonpyo's trademark

440
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:47,840
Did you see "Gag Concert (a Korean show)" when they wore this?

441
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,470
Yes, I saw it.- About hat Goo JunPyo, how did you feel?

442
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,730
His fur didn't look that expensive.

443
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,660
His furs were just hairs.

444
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,450
So this is the bed, eh?

445
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,990
This bed is where JanDi laid, when she got hurt, isn't it?

446
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:14,590
No it's not.- Huh?This house has many beds.That's in a different room.

447
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,660
So this is just Goo Joonpyo's room

448
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,700
Oh, the guest room?Uh... not the guest ro-- Er, yeah. The guest room..Correct.

449
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:31,430
Then, shall we go to that room?This window, this is the window that you sneaked out of to save Jandi?

450
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,900
Oh, but you can't open it.- Oh, I can't open it.

451
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,370
Outside is just a set.

452
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:45,960
ohhh, it does open.

453
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,630
Why don't you try going outside?

454
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:58,370
Let's go with F4 and HyunYoung.

455
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:05,710
ohh this is yoon ji hoo's housee. -yeahh this is yoon ji hoo's/ my house.

456
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:14,380
Goo Joonpyo's house is kind of luxurious and has an antique feel to it, but Yoon Jihoo's house seems more modern.

457
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:21,690
Because it's the house of the former president's grandson, it has a more "Hano" feel to it.

458
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,690
The design is very modern

459
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,740
Just a short while ago, we find out about your grandfather, right?

460
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,030
Isn't it a bit too big for you to live in by yourself? Why don't you live together?

461
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:40,690
My grandfather hasn't been back in 15 years. BR Ah, it's been 15 years since he left this house...

462
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,410
Soon, depending on what the screenwriter decides...

463
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:52,180
We'll find out whether he will come back, or if he will forever stay away.

464
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,940
So it depends on the writer...Also, my house...

465
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,320
has a very special "tahb" (tower) in the back.

466
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:07,410
You can't see it from here, but...

467
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,820
Oh, there really is a tower back here. What is the name of the tower?

468
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:17,200
It's called "Dabo Tahb"Ah... "Dabo Tahb"?

469
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,900
Didn't this belong in Kyongju? You brought it over here?Yes, because I'm the former president's grandson, everything is permissable

470
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,180
Is "Dabo Tahb" the only tower name that you know, HyunJoon?

471
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,320
No, no..Then what other tower's do you know of?Well there's the "Big Bang Tahb..."

472
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:45,020
Joon and Bum, what do you find the most appealing about this house?

473
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,180
Something that you feel is really your style?I like the "hano" feel of the ceilings.

474
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:56,830
But, Joon and Bum, have you even had the chance to come to this set?

475
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:03,890
Bum: I've been here before but, Joon hasn't.Joon: Yeah, this is my first time looking around.

476
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,390
Take a look around. Is there anything that you like?

477
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,570
The interior is really nice, but what really caught my attention from when we first came in is this elephant.

478
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:17,760
Oh the elephant?Yes, is this something that i can ride?If you don't ride it properly, it could break.

479
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,950
In Joonpyo's room there was a horse, and here, there's an elephant. When they were young...

480
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,320
they got to ride these.Lucky little kids.

481
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,960
Shall we go over this way now?

482
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,120
Back over here is a piano. Just a while ago, we talked about playing.

483
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,700
All of you play piano well, right?We need to hear you.

484
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,160
Not "play well," just "play"

485
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,910
First, let's start with Kim Bum

486
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,460
Wow... then Joon...

487
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,770
the instruments... oh, let me move over to that side. No no, stay there.

488
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:08,540
What piece will you play for us?

489
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:13,900
I'll play something that you've probably heard, it's called "Romance"

490
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,750
We know the lyrics to that...BR Kim Joon appears to be an extremely well-versed pianist.

491
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:25,310
Then, since Kim Joon and I are singers, we'll hum.

492
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,560
Okay, but your voice is too high.

493
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,200
Wow, but apart from this do you know anything more modern?

494
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:12,540
Uh...Do you know ??? (some Korean pop song)by any chance?

495
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:18,890
I don't have any experience playing those kind of songs.Oh, I can't play very well.

496
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,840
The thing with these guys is they all say that can't play well but then...No, I really can't play well.

497
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,930
I'll play Moon River.

498
00:52:30,930 --> 00:53:13,330
Come on, Joon, sing.Wait, that isn't right.No, it sounds right.

499
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:20,140
I'll stop here...it's been so long since I've played.Wow, all of your are so talented with instruments.

500
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:25,660
HyunJoon, you can play too, right?Well, I can play the pop tune, "Want to see you..."

501
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:33,070
"Want to see you?" Oh! In that case, since it's about time to sign off anyway,

502
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,890
We'll go ahead and say our farewells, then as a finale, HyunJoon can play "Want to see you" since we all want to see "Boys Over Flowers"

503
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:42,560
Thanks to your love and support, we've come to this point--Episode 16...

504
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:50,070
to 17 and 18, and about 8 more epidodes to go.

505
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,340
We will do our best so that we can end well.And we ask for you full support until the end. Thank you.

506
00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:00,910
Because of some accidents, these car accidents...

507
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:07,630
regretful though it may seem,we really need to consider the actors' and actresses' heath first.

508
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,500
If you'll be patient just a bit more, then we'll present a great, upgraded...

509
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:18,900
final few epidsodes. And keep Koo Hyesun in your thoughts...and please continue to love "Boys over Flowers"

510
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,540
Tomorrow evening, episode 17 will air. Please keep loving "Boys over Flowers."

511
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:29,640
I'm also eagerly looking forward to watching,but I'll be patient until tomorrow. Everyone, watch with us tomorrow night.

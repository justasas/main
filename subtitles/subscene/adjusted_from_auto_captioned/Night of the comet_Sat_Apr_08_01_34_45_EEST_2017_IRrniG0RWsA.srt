1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,230
Since before recorded time...

2
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:47,797
it had swung through the universein an elliptical orbit so large ...

3
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,505
that its very existenceremained a secret of time and space.

4
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:57,374
But now, in the last few yearsof the 20th century,

5
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,851
the visitor was returning.

6
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:13,200
The citizens of Earth would get an extraChristmas present this year,...

7
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,172
as their planet orbitedthrough the tail of the comet.

8
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,643
Scientists predicted a light showof stellar proportions,

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,012
something notseen on Earth for 65 million years.

10
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,085
Indeed, not since the time...

11
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:30,020
that the dinosaursdisappeared, virtually overnight.

12
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:38,463
There were a few who saw this as morethan just a coincidence,

13
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:42,471
but most didn't..

14
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,279
I'm showing you the top of the line here.This is the best we have.

15
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:22,646
- This is $9.50. Now this...- $9.50?

16
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:26,518
But wait, this is $8. Okay?This is $7.50.

17
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:27,919
This lady over here,she's wearing the $7.50.

18
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,458
Yeah, right.- Let me tell you about this.

19
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:57,279
Blow on it. See? See how nice that is?Isn't it great?

20
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,692
Now, I know you got $9.50.

21
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,644
And this spring, look at it.Isn't that nice?

22
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:21,047
And the other side. Look at it.Isn't that great? It's $9.50.

23
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,280
Enjoy the movie.

24
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,451
Excuse me. Where's the men's room?

25
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,024
- In a minute.- Hey, you work here or not?

26
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,187
Hey, Regina.Regina, give that thing a rest, will you?

27
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,285
In a minute, Mel.

28
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:35,594
Look, I don't pay youto do that kind of stuff around here.

29
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:38,794
Regina, I want you to clean everything up,so we can get out of here

30
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:42,239
in time to watch the comet.- Everything's cleaned up.

31
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:43,601
Damn!

32
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,270
I want you to take this flashlightand walk the house.

33
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,350
Mel, they throw things at me.

34
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,683
Who cares? Walk the house.

35
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:55,688
Have you ever been hit with Dots, Mel?Milk Duds?

36
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,783
Those things hurt.- I don't...

37
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:02,526
Oh, how are you, sir?The refreshments are right over there.

38
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,930
Thank you.

39
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,730
I don't want those weirdoes cutting upthe seats, you understand?

40
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,806
Okay. Okay, okay.

41
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:15,980
Replacing Reg in third place is Reg.

42
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,310
Third place.

43
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:23,178
Wait a minute.

44
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:27,054
Somebody named DMK in sixth place.When did this happen?

45
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:31,460
Look, don't be an overachiever. You'll fit inbetter with your age group, okay?

46
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,567
- This is really annoying.- Regina. Regina, look over here.

47
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:37,432
Regina, look at me!

48
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,273
Read my lips.

49
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:44,872
Flashlight. Walk house. Now.

50
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:46,943
Okay, Mel.

51
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,646
- Let me take this for you.- That's great... There go the profits.

52
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,748
And listen, stay outof the projection booth.

53
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,451
And stay away from Dupree.

54
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,052
I'm gonna fire that guy someday.

55
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,131
He's been doing to mewhat he's been doing to her in the booth.

56
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,359
He's been doing to mewhat he's been doing to her in the booth.

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,933
- "David, that was a scream.�- "You're right.�

58
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,171
I 'il go see. You stay here.

59
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm talking about a mint-conditionprint of �It Came from Outer Space�.

60
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,540
In 3D, man. Yeah, right.

61
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:20,045
Look, you know as well as I doyou got film freaks that'd go down on you

62
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,248
for a bootleg print of that.

63
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,285
100 bucks? 100 bucks? Right.

64
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:29,660
Something wrong with the phone here?Did I hear you say $100?

65
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,360
Look, $100 isn't gonna get it this time.

66
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,493
Because I'm gonna have tospend the night in here

67
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,402
waiting for you to bring the print back.

68
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:38,839
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thingfor a lousy $100?

69
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:41,504
"Help me!�

70
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,979
Okay 110's a little better, yeah.

71
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:47,645
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.You leave, I let you in the backdoor.

72
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,188
Okay? I leave, you let me back in.Mel thinks everybody's gone.

73
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,521
- Larry, do you know anybody named DMK?- No.

74
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,094
No, you got to have the print backby 6:00 in the morning.

75
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:59,132
You know, if we spend the night in here,we're gonna miss the comet.

76
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,066
It's not like you can't see iton television, you know.

77
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,899
all right, hey.Get your guy here in an hour.

78
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,872
Yeah, well, maybe I want tosee it for real, okay?

79
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,945
Hey, television's real.Television's very real.

80
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,212
So, what do you say? I'll give you $15.

81
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:15,676
Are you kidding?

82
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,617
We spend the night in here,we end up making it,

83
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:18,780
and you give me 15 bucks?

84
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,187
Do you knowwhat that makes me look like?

85
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,454
Reggie, I'm not giving you $15for making it with me.

86
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,025
Okay, well, just sowe have that straight, okay?

87
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:28,724
Yeah, for sure.

88
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:32,827
I mean, you'd be worth a lot morethan $15. Everybody knows that.

89
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:39,007
The first earthlings to see theeffects will be in Newfundland.

90
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,007
Or, Newfoundland.

91
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,317
This is expected to begin at 2.04.That's Pacific Standard Time.

92
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,081
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

93
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:52,017
...Interesting sidebar to this storyis the fact that all telecommunications

94
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,359
seem to be out in that partof the world.

95
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,467
This could have...

96
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,336
Hello?

97
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,539
Samantha, you sound pissed.

98
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:13,242
I just had it out with Dorisonce and for all, again.

99
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:18,746
She wants me to, like, haul chips and dipsaround for her little comet party.

100
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:22,293
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris...Look, I need your help.

101
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,956
Tell her that you know all about thisfield trip that I'm gonna take, okay,

102
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:29,628
with my science class. We're gonna goto the observatory to watch the comet.

103
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:33,195
- She won't go for it.- She'll go for it. Just tell her, okay?

104
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,535
Okay.

105
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,252
Doris? Reggie's on the phone.

106
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,688
She's not having car trouble?

107
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:50,624
She's gonna be out all nightwith her science class at the observatory.

108
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,063
I know everything.

109
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:59,434
Yeah, hi, Doris.- What's this about a science class, Regina?

110
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:02,404
Well, you want me to do betterin science, don't you?

111
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,168
I want you home in five minutesafter you finish work.

112
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,678
If you wanna watch the comet,you can do it here.

113
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,511
Look, Doris. I have 18 years ...

114
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,950
Look, Doris. Like, I'm 18, okay,and I can watch the comet whereverI want to watch the comet.

115
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,890
Here, Samantha, you and your sistershare a lot of secrets.

116
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,756
I want you to share this one with her.

117
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:23,389
If it were up to me,I couldn't care less what she did.

118
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:27,626
But if your father makes it back homewithout some Sandinista

119
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:28,931
blowing his brains out,

120
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,338
he's gonna hold me responsiblefor any kind of trouble

121
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:33,170
you two girls get into.

122
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,373
What we have here is a chain of command.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,108
The Major jumps on me, I jump on you.

124
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:42,881
Did you get that? Okay.

125
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:48,784
- Now, are you going to join the party?- Join the party for what Doris?

126
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,760
So I can watch Chuck from across the street

127
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,128
stick his hands down your pants?

128
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,835
I think that's somethingDaddy should know.

129
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:59,267
Chuck's a nice guy.He's certainly nice to be with

130
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,205
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

131
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,971
You were born with an asshole, Doris.You don't need Chuck.

132
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:17,220
Looks like a real nice crowdwe have out here tonight.

133
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,033
Sarah, Chucky.

134
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,668
Hey, where have you been? You're gonnamiss everything. It's going to start.

135
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,872
Oh, kids.I'll never marry another man with kids.

136
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,678
In 1910, Halley's comet returned.

137
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:41,682
Everybody thoughtthey were going to die then.

138
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,226
- What was that?- Look!

139
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,303
You wanna know what bugs me about all this?

140
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:01,469
What?

141
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:06,211
Well, I'm always afraidsomeone's gonna see us, you know?

142
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:10,617
See us how? There's no windows.They can't see through walls.

143
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,948
Well, Superman can see through walls.

144
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:18,153
Not these walls. They're made out of steel.Used to be a fire law.

145
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,863
Superman can see through steel.

146
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,737
No, it's the one thing he cannot see through.

147
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,134
That's lead, you nerd.- Lead?

148
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,976
Yeah. I mean, Superman can see throughsteel like it wasn't there, even.

149
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:36,506
Larry!

150
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:39,553
Well, I guess I'm the only one who's notoutside watching the meteor shower.

151
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,691
Perhaps put the radio on autopilotand leave me.

152
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:43,420
I just might put the radio stationon autopilot and sneak out myself.

153
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:22,005
This is the Big Kof Los Angeles. A great-looking morning

154
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:26,136
in southern California. 50,000 wattsof oil, steel, and passion FM in the a.m..

155
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:29,774
It's wake-up time in the City of Angels.And I'm Steve LaBeau.

156
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,886
- God damn it!- What?

157
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,180
What?

158
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,388
I've been waiting by that doorfor the last 30 minutes,

159
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,825
and that pinhead hasn't broughtthe film back yet.

160
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:43,056
Give the guy a break.I mean, people are late sometimes.

161
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:47,803
No, something's wrong.If he screwed that film up,

162
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:50,305
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

163
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,175
I'm gonna go over there on the bike.

164
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,270
Oh, jeez!Don't I get an Egg McMuffin or anything?

165
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:59,951
- You could do me a favor.- I did you a favor last night.

166
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,486
If that guy calls,

167
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:06,790
you tell him I'm on my way over,and I'm very, very, very, very pissed.

168
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:10,226
- Hey, what about my 15 bucks?- Tell him you're pissed, too.

169
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,712
DMK.

170
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:40,392
You trust people, you getscrewed over every goddamn time.

171
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,237
Is that you?Yeah, it's about frigging time.

172
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:30,045
That's the end of you, DMK.You're history.

173
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,152
God, bad smog.

174
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:37,189
Shit!

175
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,026
Shit!

176
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,471
Oh, damn it!

177
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,073
Just great!

178
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,713
I don't believe this,there's clothes everywhere!

179
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:58,287
I hate days that start like this.

180
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:11,663
Oh, damn it, damn it!

181
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:26,678
Eww. Gross.

182
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:34,724
Larry?

183
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,681
What is this? Trick or treat?

184
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,084
- Come here.- What?

185
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:28,554
- Come here!- Come here, your ass.

186
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:37,803
Alright look, I don't know what your sceneis, but don't do anything stupid, okay?

187
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:45,169
No, you don't seem to understand.I've been trained to take care of myself.

188
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,043
You know what I'm saying?I don't want to hurt you.

189
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:52,980
Oh, shit!

190
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,119
No!

191
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,660
Let go of me!

192
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,339
No!

193
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,080
Come on, come on, come on!

194
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:13,076
Samantha?

195
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:16,814
Doris?

196
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,701
- Samantha?- What?

197
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,235
God. What are you trying to do?Give me a heart attack?

198
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:07,108
- I thought you were Doris.- You know, she decked me last night.

199
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:08,647
Knocked one of my teeth loose, even.

200
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,717
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

201
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:13,082
You know how he's always telling meto be careful with my mouth

202
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:16,452
on account of the dental plandoesn't cover anything cosmetic.

203
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:21,153
Anyway, get this. I think Chuck and Dorisspent the night together last night.

204
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:23,197
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

205
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,235
I mean, even if he isn't pissed offabout my mouth, which I can't imagine.

206
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,802
What's happening?

207
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:32,432
Oh, yeah, I guess you are a little confused.

208
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,412
God, you look terrible.

209
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:39,142
I ran away last night after she slugged me.Left a note and everything.

210
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,446
But I didn't have any place to go,so I spent the night

211
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,215
in a lawn storage shed.

212
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,581
It was pretty gross with the Syneroland everything.

213
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,023
God, look at this kitchen.

214
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm not cleaning this up.

215
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,865
So anyway, since I was still herethis morning,

216
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:59,302
I thought, hey, I'll goto pep squad practice and split after.

217
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,098
Except for I don't knowif pep squad practice is on or not.

218
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,576
I can't get anybody on the phone.

219
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,309
Sammy, you can't get anybodyon the phone because everybody is gone.

220
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:11,018
What? could you grab the milk, please?

221
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:14,289
- I swear to God!- You made me swallow my gum.

222
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,859
There's nobody.I mean, there's no body!

223
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,962
Oh, right. Nobody. I'm sure.

224
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,866
- Come here.- Hey!

225
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:25,403
Back off!

226
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,663
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

227
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:32,903
Muffy?

228
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:37,780
Stupid dog.

229
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,980
Look! Look at this!

230
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:46,792
- At what?- Doris isn't at Chuck's. I'll show you Doris.

231
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,890
Here's Doris.

232
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,991
This is all that's left of her,this and dust.

233
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:57,831
Look, here's Chuck.

234
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:06,978
Where are the kids?

235
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:13,215
It's Saturday morning.Where are the goddamn kids?

236
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,783
They're around.

237
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,420
They're not around.

238
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:46,859
Look, if you're trying to scare me,you're doing it, okay?

239
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:50,357
- I'm not trying to scare you.- Then stop it.

240
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:51,933
I'm not doing it.

241
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,031
You try calling someone.Not just your pep squad. Anyone.

242
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,732
Nobody's home!

243
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,211
Unbelievable, that's song number 16on the survey this week.

244
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:04,283
Don't forget, we preview the top 20every Friday night.

245
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,978
A great way to start a super weekendhere in the southland.

246
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:08,112
Get down!

247
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:36,444
- Are you sure this is the radio station?- Yeah. Just go on in.

248
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,886
Well, don't push.

249
00:26:50,437 --> 00:26:52,530
Do you think whatever happened,happened everywhere?

250
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,800
Like in Burbank or places like that?

251
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,972
We'll ask the DJ.He does the news, doesn't he?

252
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:03,448
Search me. I always change the channelwhen the news comes on.

253
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:09,489
Here's something in here.

254
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,258
So, where is he?

255
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,068
I mean, somebody has to run this stuff,don't they?

256
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,041
We've got trouble. Not us.That's the name of the song.

257
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,511
And I'm Steve LaBeautrapped inside your radio.

258
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,481
The guy who really cares about you.

259
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:33,575
I mean, who else would sitin this little box every day

260
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,745
just to play music for you?

261
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,450
Well, it's time to reach intothe old mailbag here. Got a letter from...

262
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,652
Beam me up, Scotty.

263
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:43,356
Okay, girls. Hold it right there.

264
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:46,866
- You, the blonde, get into the light.- Wait.

265
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,037
Why don't you just let my sister go.

266
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:51,765
And maybe you and Ican work something out.

267
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:53,136
- I'm not going anywhere!- Shut up!

268
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:55,210
You got the wrong idea.You, into the light.

269
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:59,577
I'll give you to five. One, two... No?

270
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:04,811
All right. Let's try it this way.Five, four, three...

271
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:06,287
Okay, okay.

272
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:09,386
Do you get a lot of dates this way?

273
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:12,921
Open your eyes.

274
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,464
Okay.

275
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,245
Hey, I know what you're thinking, but...- That you're a cretin?

276
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:31,507
Sweetheart, you haven't seen thosefreaked-out zombies running around here?

277
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,088
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

278
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:35,850
Well, you got off lucky.

279
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,855
Me and this girl pulled into townthis morning.

280
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,690
You don't work here?

281
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,194
No. I drive a truck.

282
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,467
I was heading to San Diegowith this girl I picked up.

283
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:50,064
We were looking for a gas station.

284
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:53,868
That's when we spotted one of those...

285
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,673
Whatever they are.

286
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,109
Looked like it was eating...

287
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,111
Looked like it was eating a cat.

288
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:03,917
A dead cat?

289
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,952
Semi-dead.

290
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,553
Who'd want to eat a live cat?

291
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,022
Beats the shit out of me.

292
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,758
This girl freaked out.

293
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,428
Took off running.

294
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:22,906
I spotted her about 20 minutes later.

295
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:27,311
- Looked like one of those things had...- What?

296
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:33,819
Torn her apart.

297
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,624
Oh, God.

298
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:43,261
- Larry.- Oh, shit.

299
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,231
What's with her?

300
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:50,407
I think she's going to besick or something.

301
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,068
A guy she knew...

302
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:54,738
Same thing might have happened.

303
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,817
- Is it safe around here, do you think?- Yeah.

304
00:30:02,992 --> 00:30:04,823
I checked it out.

305
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,589
Swell.

306
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:19,207
Are you all right?

307
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:25,013
My name's Hector.

308
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:29,611
- What's yours?- Just leave me alone, okay?

309
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:35,890
Look, I... I know we got offon the wrong foot,

310
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:41,467
but considering what the alternative is,I think we should try to get along.

311
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,128
What do you say?

312
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,534
Listen, this is no timefor an attitude problem.

313
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:52,337
Your little sister seems to be taking thisa lot better than you.

314
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,817
That's 'cause she doesn't knowwhat's going on.

315
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:55,941
And you do, I suppose.

316
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:59,044
Whatever is going on isn't just here.It's everywhere.

317
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,254
She thinks we're gonna be rescued,that our dad's gonna come back

318
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,224
from Honduraswith the goddamn Green Berets.

319
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,763
She could be right.

320
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,925
Give us a break, Hector.

321
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:17,438
Where did you spend the night last night?

322
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:26,145
I spent the night in the back of my truckwith the girl I picked up.

323
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,555
- What else do you want to know?- Skip it.

324
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:33,959
Steel's gotta be the answer.

325
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:36,860
If Sam spent the nightin the Lawn storage shed...

326
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:39,902
What?

327
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:42,796
...again, I'm an employee. I can't.

328
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:46,172
Just our way of sayingMerry Christmas to you from all of...

329
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:06,462
Testing, one, two, three, four.

330
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,705
This is Samantha Belmont,

331
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,042
one-third owner ofthe Greater Los Angeles Basin, speaking.

332
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,140
You guys?

333
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:25,013
Hey, is anybody there?

334
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:30,955
Where did you get this,a Dime Store?

335
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,724
Beats me. It was given to me.

336
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:36,793
Yeah, well, it might be all rightfor date night in the barrio,

337
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:39,063
but if we run into any moreof those guys outside,

338
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:41,765
we're gonna needa little more stopping power.

339
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,807
Date night in the barrio?

340
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,150
Here are other changes.

341
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,923
And here's some other changes.Most of you guys had finals this week?

342
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:03,651
Huh, Later.

343
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:06,126
They are history. Canceled.

344
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:10,501
They're history. They're cancelled.The legal drinking age is now 10.But, you will need ID. Let's be real.

345
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:15,267
I'll be taking take requests from all youteenage comet zombies on the...Hit line!

346
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:20,511
That's 555-4487.

347
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,448
Get it? 555-HITS!

348
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:36,163
Do you know where the armed forcesreserve centre is at Los Alamitos?

349
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,328
Yeah.

350
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,803
My dad used to take us therefor target practice.

351
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,746
They store automatic weapons there.- You know how to use them?

352
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:48,407
Come on, Hector.

353
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:52,448
The MAC-10 submachine gunwas practically designed for housewives.

354
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:56,591
I got a call!

355
00:33:56,959 --> 00:34:00,053
It came in on the hit line.- Hello?

356
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:02,691
Hello?

357
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,995
It went dead.- Did they say they were okay?

358
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:07,264
I don't know.They said they were in the desert.

359
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,704
- The desert? What desert was it?- I don't know.

360
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:10,935
Shit! Think!

361
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,568
Why don't you just pull your gunon her? Maybe you can scare it out of her!

362
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:18,083
They said they were, like, part ofa think tank or research group or something.

363
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,982
Where? Was it in this state?

364
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,987
- I forget.- Okay. Let's take it real slow.

365
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:26,860
Did they mention a town?

366
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:30,224
Some place they were near,like maybe Blythe, Bishop?

367
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:33,624
- What about Edwards Air Force Base?- If I knew, I'd tell you.

368
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:36,796
I didn't expect the call, you know.I didn't take notes or something.

369
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,100
Just try and remember.

370
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,608
If you think I'm not telling yousomething on purpose...

371
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,302
Well, if they'll stay put,we can get them.

372
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,380
...leave anything out?

373
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,949
From a psychological standpoint,the radio station represents

374
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,039
a link to normalcy.

375
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,847
I don't think they'll wander faras long as it's operating.

376
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:54,090
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say upfront.I'm opposed to this.

377
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,219
There is no reason for us to bringthose people,

378
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,792
or any other survivors back here.

379
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,560
What about the disintegration factor?You just want to let that happen?

380
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:07,734
We don't know thatthe condition is progressive.

381
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:09,832
I think we've established that, Audrey.

382
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:13,004
Partial protection seems to resultin a slowing of the overall effect,

383
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:15,082
but progression is steady in any case.

384
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:18,517
Drying of the body fluids...Get to the point, Oscar.

385
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:21,349
We've heard this a thousand times.

386
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,427
Ultimately, there is nothing leftbut calcium dust.

387
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:29,294
Right. So there isn't even enough hopeto warrant bringing anybody back here.

388
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,669
So, what you're saying is,we shouldn't even try.

389
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:35,839
Right.

390
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,369
We don't want to be caught in the cityafter dark. we'll leave tomorrow.

391
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,944
And we've had an indicationof some survivors...

392
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,542
in San Bernardino as well.

393
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:48,522
Four, maybe five.

394
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:51,022
Wait a minute.Wait, girls, just shut up.

395
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:56,122
Samantha! Did they sayanything else? Anything?

396
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,395
Yeah. They saidbe careful on the street.

397
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:07,339
Because some people were exposedto the comet a little bit.

398
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,344
What happened to Dorisis happening to them, only slower.

399
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:17,743
And, like, they're dangerous.

400
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,855
Like what happened to Larry.

401
00:36:57,034 --> 00:37:00,002
You're not going to blame mebecause the phone went dead.

402
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:04,370
I'm not the phone company.Nobody is the phone company anymore.

403
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:20,152
What?

404
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:22,955
Cops?

405
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:26,790
Where were you guys earlier?

406
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:38,139
Oh, shit, my license.

407
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:40,677
Oh, shit!

408
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,618
I know you guys are probably goingto give me a ticket or something,

409
00:37:51,997 --> 00:37:53,692
but I'm really glad to see...

410
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,914
...the weekend comet sale.Everything must go.

411
00:38:14,022 --> 00:38:16,115
Big savings on tuners, turntables,car stereos,

412
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:18,250
also demos of great damaged items.

413
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,091
This weekend only, Henry'sStereo Warehouse. Fourth and Alameda.

414
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,395
Free coffee for the adults.Free balloons for the kids.

415
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:51,323
This is for your step mom,you little punk.

416
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:56,528
- Ahh! They're here! They're here!- Where?

417
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,040
- What's wrong?- It's okay. I've got her.

418
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,134
- You've got her?- Yeah, I got her.

419
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:11,121
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

420
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,258
I know.

421
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,627
I know.

422
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,426
...expand your careerhorizons. For a clearer view of...

423
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:22,593
Is there anything I can do?

424
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:24,964
I'm fine.

425
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,508
Interstate Technologiesis an equal-opportunity employer.

426
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,807
Looks like the weather is shaping upfor a great weekend.

427
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,404
You know, it's hard to believe that there'sonly 11 more shopping days till Christmas.

428
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:37,816
Good luck finding a parking space withinhitchhiking distance of the malls, too.

429
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,115
You know how jammed it can get.

430
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:53,126
- Is she okay?- Yeah, I guess so.

431
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:57,837
Come on in. Have a seat.

432
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:07,408
Listen, I have to goto San Diego tomorrow.

433
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:09,816
Why?

434
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,256
My mom.

435
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,357
- Some friends. My sister.- But you know they're gone.

436
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:22,228
I know, but I still have to find out.

437
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:25,103
I mean, you guys know for sure,but I don't know.

438
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:29,543
Did you have, like, a close family?

439
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,484
Yeah, pretty close.

440
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:40,825
- And you?- Not anymore.

441
00:41:42,061 --> 00:41:46,122
My real mom hung around until my dadcame back from Vietnam, then she split.

442
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:49,598
So it's been mostly me and Sam and Dad

443
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:52,163
and the 3rd special forces.

444
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:56,737
Smoke Bomb Hill. Fort Bragg.

445
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:05,719
But then around aboutsixth or seventh grade,

446
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,982
it became real obviousthat we weren't boys,

447
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,924
that we were never going to goto ranger school.

448
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:15,793
So I guess Dad figured there wasnothing more to offer us.

449
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,470
So he found us a new momand went off looking for a war.

450
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:27,804
What about the em...

451
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,345
The guy. Larry?

452
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,479
Oh, he and I weren't going steadyor anything like that.

453
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:57,542
- Look, don't go to San Diego, okay?- I have to.

454
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:00,575
But I'll be back.

455
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:05,648
Please, okay?

456
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:14,260
What will you give me if I come back?

457
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:22,599
Texas.

458
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:29,750
Could give you Florida. Florida and Texas.Florida, Texas and Hawaii.

459
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:36,553
- Hawaii? I wanted Hawaii.- When I come back,

460
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,255
I'll take you to dinner.

461
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,363
Your choice.

462
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,177
Here.

463
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:17,838
Great!

464
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,647
See? This is the problemwith these things.

465
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,744
Daddy would have gotten us Uzis.

466
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:35,291
The car didn't know the difference.

467
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:46,735
So, did you make it with him last night?

468
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:49,874
- Who?- The Good Humor Man. Who do you think?

469
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:54,846
- Jeez. Is that what's bugging you?- That's no answer, man.

470
00:44:55,918 --> 00:44:58,580
No, I didn't make it with him last night.

471
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:00,348
Why are you so weirded out?

472
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:02,287
Oh, right, Reg.Why should I be weirded out?

473
00:45:02,392 --> 00:45:04,859
My sister, who swiped every guyI ever had my eye on

474
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,225
has now swiped the last guyin the whole freaked-out world.

475
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,145
Mom?

476
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:58,812
Mother?

477
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,257
Mom.

478
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,692
I don't know who you are out there,but I have a gun.

479
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:34,791
So if I were you,I'd split while I had a chance.

480
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:37,426
Okay?

481
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,584
Look, kid, just stay away.We don't want any.

482
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,147
Shit!

483
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,860
Get out of here, you little freak.

484
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:11,705
Lucky for you I like kids.

485
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:21,884
Jeez! There goes the neighborhood.

486
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,030
Shit.

487
00:48:46,148 --> 00:48:48,082
Audrey, what's the code?

488
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,304
We found survivors.

489
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:14,511
How long will the blood test take?

490
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:18,910
Not long.

491
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,284
I've talked with some of the others,and we've decided

492
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:26,792
that it would be more beneficialto conduct the blood tests in the field.

493
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:30,363
So I want you to go to LAwith the rest of the group.

494
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:32,491
Whatever the majority wants.

495
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,167
You don't seem to holdmajority rule in very high regard.

496
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,645
If something's wrong, it's wrong.

497
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,545
Majority rule doesn't have anythingto do with it.

498
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:49,149
But it goes straightto the core purpose of our group,

499
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,687
which is to survive.

500
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,852
You'll grant me that?

501
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:57,154
The core purpose never includedbringing outsiders to the facility.

502
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:04,228
That's about the twelfth canyou've downed this morning.

503
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,399
Thirsty.

504
00:51:05,508 --> 00:51:08,272
Yeah, well, what're you gonna dowhen your complexion freaks out?

505
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,504
Dermatologist is dead, you know.

506
00:51:10,647 --> 00:51:13,548
I know and I'm getting a rashor something, too.

507
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,208
Oh, God. You and your rashes.

508
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:18,516
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the worldmakes me a little nervous.

509
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:27,327
So, do you like him?

510
00:51:29,335 --> 00:51:32,202
- Come on, Sam.- I'm just interested.

511
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:38,940
Yeah, well, I guess so.I mean, he's nice.

512
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:44,979
There was this new guy at school.Paul Morgan.

513
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:47,778
He transferred from Taft. Junior.

514
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:50,885
Oh, I don't hang aroundwith juniors much.

515
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,062
I liked him.

516
00:51:56,566 --> 00:52:00,024
I mean, he was from Taft,

517
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:04,373
but, he was nice.

518
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:13,317
Kathy said he was probablygonna ask me out.

519
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:16,881
Huh, Kathy.

520
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,920
She was flunking algebraand she was trying to figure out some way

521
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:23,588
to keep her parents from finding out.

522
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:29,026
This is really a lucky break for her.

523
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:38,976
No wonder I'm breaking out.Think we could go home and change?

524
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:43,712
- Why don't we get a little creative?- What?

525
00:52:44,922 --> 00:52:48,551
- Do you have your a,do you have your MasterCard on you?- No.

526
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,425
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

527
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:53,827
The stores are open!

528
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:08,214
Hey, Reg, which do you like better?This?

529
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:12,312
Second one. Yeah. Definitely.

530
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:15,789
- How come?- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

531
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:19,026
- Come on.- I guess you're right, actually.

532
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,224
Yeah, we got to thinkof these things, you know?

533
00:54:41,022 --> 00:54:44,218
Well, let's do it.

534
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:54,134
- You know, I've been thinking.- Don't set any dangerous precedents.

535
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,569
What if Hector's gotthe same problem we have?

536
00:54:56,673 --> 00:55:00,575
- Such as?- Such as, no guys.

537
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:03,273
- What?- Really.

538
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:07,244
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

539
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:12,186
- I'm sure.- Think it over.

540
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,521
You said he didn'tcome on to you last night.

541
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:15,594
So?

542
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:19,597
So that means that the last guy on earthis either a gentleman or a fag.

543
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:22,595
I mean, what are the odds? In LA?

544
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:27,071
Things could be very interestingaround here, Regina.

545
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:43,055
Attention, shoppers.

546
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:47,055
I trust you've got credit cardsto pay for all that stuff.

547
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:17,964
What's the matter?Lost something?

548
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,628
Check with lost and foundon the second floor.

549
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,166
Didn't find this one.

550
00:56:33,418 --> 00:56:35,909
You dirty rat.

551
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:39,758
Get her, boys!

552
00:57:41,863 --> 00:57:43,057
Woa!

553
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,353
Bummer!

554
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:15,194
Well, I think it's timeto take the high ground.

555
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:26,172
Listen, you guys, we're expectingsome friends here any minute.

556
00:58:26,414 --> 00:58:30,077
Look, you just split now, okay,and we'll Tell them not to hurt you.

557
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,451
No imagination.

558
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:00,945
Look, over there.

559
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:10,755
Hey!

560
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:15,496
- Hey!- Eat glass, creeps!

561
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,605
How did you like that?

562
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,949
You guys are a bunch of wimps!You can't hit anything.

563
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,146
Hi.

564
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:41,560
Get her.

565
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,319
Knock that shit off!

566
01:00:07,831 --> 01:00:10,595
Hello out there in Television Land.

567
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,302
All right. Here's the deal.

568
01:00:14,939 --> 01:00:18,772
If bachelorette number oneisn't out here in half a tick,

569
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:23,507
I'm going to ice bachelorette number two.Got it?

570
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:40,862
Come on.

571
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,039
Let her go.

572
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:51,936
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have youholding one of my people hostage.

573
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,915
Even if you pull the trigger,I can still take him out. And you.

574
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,747
Come on, Willy, she means it.

575
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:00,255
Miss, you're not getting the point.

576
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:03,520
I can't have you holdingone of my people hostage.

577
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:10,668
You're crazy!

578
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,534
I'm not crazy.I just don't give a fuck.

579
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:17,339
- What do you think, 20, 30 minutes?- No more.

580
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:20,571
They could be anywhere by now.Let's go back.

581
01:01:20,714 --> 01:01:24,343
- Let's apply a little deductive reasoning.- Deductive reasoning?

582
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:29,056
Where would adolescentswith nothing to do go?

583
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,467
See, we worked really hard toget ahead in this business, girls.

584
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,095
And we don't get shit for it!

585
01:01:43,174 --> 01:01:44,505
But we do it...

586
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:47,505
because we know we can workour way up through the system.

587
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:48,773
And the system works

588
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,282
Why, just a few days ago,we were only stock boys.

589
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,983
Now we own the store.The American way.

590
01:01:58,391 --> 01:02:00,222
And then this happens.

591
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:04,155
What are you talking about?

592
01:02:04,531 --> 01:02:08,865
I'm talking about youcoming in here and ripping us off.

593
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,167
What do you want?You want us to pay for it? What?

594
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:18,443
You wouldn't believewhat we want from you.

595
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:23,683
In your worst nightmare,you wouldn't believe.

596
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:31,121
Let's play a game.It's called �Scary Noises�.

597
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:35,522
This is the closest shopping arcade,but the whole area

598
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:38,228
is an absolute monumentto consumerism.

599
01:02:38,437 --> 01:02:40,268
All we can do is hope.

600
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:43,374
Check all the fiords,including the basement.

601
01:02:50,651 --> 01:02:54,143
Isn't that a scary noise?Wanna hear it again?

602
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,084
Gosh! The suspense is killing me.

603
01:03:00,228 --> 01:03:01,855
Let's do it again.

604
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:07,591
An E-ticket attraction.Let's do it again.

605
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:13,136
Now wait a minute.

606
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:16,304
I don't thinkthere's really a bullet in here.

607
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:20,776
No. Now, see there, it's loaded.

608
01:03:20,985 --> 01:03:23,783
I just neededto be a little more patient.

609
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,316
I think this is it, girls.I really do.

610
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:55,118
We're not with these guys.

611
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:57,693
Really, like, we just met theman hour ago.

612
01:03:59,997 --> 01:04:02,932
I mean, look at this stuff.Look at this skirt.

613
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:07,768
It's ironic. Of all the great mindsof the world, all the great intellects,

614
01:04:07,874 --> 01:04:11,139
- Who should survive? Or almost survive?- I�m so thirsty

615
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:15,671
I don't have to see the resultof the blood test.

616
01:04:15,783 --> 01:04:18,547
I can guesswhat they say about that one.

617
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:23,356
You're right.

618
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:28,127
It would be senseless to take her back.Look, I'll stay and take care of it.

619
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:32,188
Then if this Hector person shows up,I can run tests on him, too.

620
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:36,971
Of course, it would be out of the questionto let you remain by yourself.

621
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,976
I'll stay here with you.

622
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:03,399
Listen, thanks for suggestingthat I wait for Hector.

623
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:07,668
I mean, I know Reggie'll probably get him,but I'd like to have a shot at it.

624
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:10,142
Samantha, I need you to lie down.

625
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,840
Hector's not exactly a fox,

626
01:05:13,783 --> 01:05:16,547
but considering what's left,he's not bad.

627
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:21,083
- He sounds cute. Is he coming back?- Yeah.

628
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:24,884
But we should wait for himat the radio station.

629
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:27,959
That's where he'll go.What's that?

630
01:05:30,168 --> 01:05:32,659
- I'm going to give you something.- For what?

631
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:37,338
Well, your skin'sbeen a little irritated.

632
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,276
Yeah, a rash.

633
01:05:39,378 --> 01:05:43,178
It could be a rash,but it could also be something else.

634
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:46,010
- That's one of the main symptoms of...- The comet? No.

635
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,819
See, I always get rashes,like, when I have a fight with Doris,

636
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:53,485
or I break up with a boyfriend.It's nerves.

637
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:56,620
And you know, the way things havebeen going around here lately,

638
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:59,826
I'm surprised I don'tlook like strawberry Jell-O.

639
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:05,400
But if I do have that stuff,this will get rid of it, right?

640
01:06:07,544 --> 01:06:10,035
- Yeah.- God, you had me worried.

641
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:14,874
Don't worry. Just a pinch now.

642
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,321
Ow!So, you guys are, like, geniuses, right?

643
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,133
Yeah, I thought so.

644
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:39,278
We have a couple ofgeniuses at my school.

645
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:42,206
- Yeah?- Yeah.

646
01:07:01,706 --> 01:07:02,968
Is...

647
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,375
Is that it?

648
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:10,880
What did you want me to do, Oscar,

649
01:07:10,984 --> 01:07:13,851
take her out backand shoot her in the head?

650
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:18,717
I simply meantI was glad it was painless.

651
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:23,155
I don't think we have to stay around.

652
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:26,595
She didn't think that he was coming back.

653
01:07:26,901 --> 01:07:28,630
I feel we can wait.

654
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:31,065
But...

655
01:07:32,241 --> 01:07:36,371
I feel the radio stationis the more logical place.

656
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:44,353
Listen, Oscar, you were rightabout the condition being progressive.

657
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:48,548
But it is also accelerating,apparently.

658
01:07:49,628 --> 01:07:51,357
We don't have weeks.

659
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:53,992
We have maybe hours.I don't know.

660
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:57,395
- We have a commitment.- But I do know I don't have enough

661
01:07:57,504 --> 01:08:02,441
to debate the issue. I am not going to bea party to taking anybody else back.

662
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:04,942
You have to live up to it.

663
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,080
What do you expect me to do, Oscar,go for my gun?

664
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:13,043
Of course not.

665
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:55,603
It's 450 FM in the p.m.I'm Steve LaBeau,

666
01:08:55,704 --> 01:08:59,104
and you're listening to 50,000 wattsof rock 'n'roll at the tower of power

667
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:01,176
over the City of Angels.

668
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:24,196
Reggie! Merry Christmas.

669
01:09:28,908 --> 01:09:30,102
Reggie?

670
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:38,317
Samantha?

671
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:44,826
Hi.

672
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,028
Hi.

673
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:55,262
Did you happen to see two girlsrunning around here?One is a cheerleader.

674
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,369
I'm not thinking straight.

675
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:03,837
I wrote everything down,but I think I misspelled it.

676
01:10:04,249 --> 01:10:06,183
That pad on the table.

677
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:12,089
- You need this?- No, thanks. I have one.

678
01:10:14,028 --> 01:10:17,293
It seems to bethe perfect Christmas gift this year.

679
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:22,759
I'm going to miss Christmas,permanently.

680
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:30,077
I want you to know thatI thought they were talking hypothetically,

681
01:10:30,378 --> 01:10:32,608
until they found the first survivors.

682
01:10:32,715 --> 01:10:34,649
Then they really did it.

683
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:39,055
Some of those survivors were just kids.

684
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,920
Hey, wait a minute.What's all this about blood?

685
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:47,696
They think they can generate a serum.

686
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:53,437
- A serum?- We were exposed. Not a lot. Just enough.

687
01:10:54,908 --> 01:10:59,003
They left the ventilating ducts wide open.The fans going.

688
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:01,339
Very scientific.

689
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:02,978
Very stupid.

690
01:11:05,686 --> 01:11:10,623
In 36 hours,you will be able to vacuum up

691
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:12,623
the last of them from the carpet.

692
01:11:15,498 --> 01:11:18,899
Hey, you know what?

693
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:24,070
She was right. You are cute.

694
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,310
Santa Claus.

695
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:41,854
Hey.

696
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,744
Have you ever had hepatitis?

697
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,249
Darned tags.

698
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,187
You have a pair of scissors?

699
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:08,917
No. Have you ever had hepatitis?

700
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:13,360
Cute kids.

701
01:12:14,265 --> 01:12:16,062
They part of you guys?

702
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:20,468
No. They're survivors just like you are.

703
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:23,368
- Neat girl, huh?- If you like the type.

704
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:26,142
Come on, kids. Come with me.

705
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,573
Have you ever had hepatitis?

706
01:12:33,821 --> 01:12:38,588
No. I had mono once, though.Caught it from this guy named Randy Sharp.

707
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:42,021
- Anemia?- No.

708
01:12:42,698 --> 01:12:45,963
- Are you pregnant?- No. Thought I was once, though.

709
01:12:47,804 --> 01:12:51,240
- That's not important.- That's what you think.

710
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:54,208
It was the longest three weeksof my life.

711
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,781
You know, I can't remember.

712
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:04,013
How much blood were we expectedto get from these people?

713
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:07,681
Oh, 300 ccs. Yes, that's it.

714
01:13:07,793 --> 01:13:11,991
That can't be right. If we draw 300 ccsa day, they'll expire altogether.

715
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:13,257
No, I don't think so,

716
01:13:13,366 --> 01:13:15,891
now that we'veterminated brain functions.

717
01:13:16,003 --> 01:13:17,630
I mean, they're brain-dead.

718
01:13:17,738 --> 01:13:20,935
All they can do nowis manufacture blood.

719
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,105
Well, maybe.

720
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:28,540
We aren't gonna get anything like 300 ccsout of those children.

721
01:13:28,851 --> 01:13:30,613
No. But, we will out of that teenager.

722
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,119
I hope she's just as healthy as she looks.

723
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:37,318
Boy, did you see her hair?What I'd give to have hair like that.

724
01:13:39,396 --> 01:13:40,863
What is this place?

725
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:44,125
Do you have diabetes?

726
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:48,604
I mean, is this some sort of,I don't know, underground hospitalor what?

727
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,972
You're a very strong-willed young lady.

728
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,881
- Cancer.- You have cancer?

729
01:13:58,151 --> 01:14:00,176
No, I am a Cancer.

730
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,956
I just want to know where I amand what I'm doing here.

731
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,871
Oops. Oh, gosh.Could you hand me that arterial...

732
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:22,138
Got it.

733
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:32,555
Well, it's up to the respirators now.

734
01:14:33,058 --> 01:14:34,525
Why don't we prep the children?

735
01:14:34,626 --> 01:14:37,754
When we're finished with them,we can start on that girl.

736
01:14:37,997 --> 01:14:40,966
They're so cute.I love working with kids.

737
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:44,063
Yeah. Don't forget the lights.

738
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,440
Are you taking any medication?

739
01:14:57,052 --> 01:15:00,988
Have you had any medicationwithin the last 24 hours?

740
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,059
Where's my sister?

741
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:10,992
Dr. Carter, may I see you a moment?

742
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,267
All right.

743
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:16,465
I mean, she should be here by now,shouldn't she,

744
01:15:16,575 --> 01:15:18,099
even if Hector didn't show up?

745
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:21,145
Your sister�s dead.

746
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:27,350
- What?- I realize this comes as a shock,

747
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:31,918
but she had been exposed, and in 48 hoursshe would have died anyway.

748
01:15:32,993 --> 01:15:35,461
It was quite painless,I can assure you.

749
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,671
You both have nice, strong hearts.

750
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:48,505
- Are we going to get shots?- No.

751
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:51,370
No shots. I promise.

752
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:53,576
- Audrey?- They're not back yet.

753
01:15:53,684 --> 01:15:56,209
Listen, we may have a situationon our hands here.

754
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:59,222
I can't locate Rogersanyplace in the compound.

755
01:16:00,993 --> 01:16:05,292
I can't rule out the possibility thathe may already have gone into transition.

756
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,863
We can't wait for Audrey.

757
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:13,033
You're gonna have to startwith the children and that one in there.

758
01:16:13,139 --> 01:16:15,539
We need blood to develop the serum.

759
01:16:15,642 --> 01:16:18,110
We don't have enough for everyone.

760
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,980
We're not robots, Doctor. We're notall going to fall over at one time.

761
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:25,986
Some of us will last a little longer.

762
01:16:26,088 --> 01:16:29,148
While others of ushave more immediate needs.

763
01:16:29,425 --> 01:16:31,985
You're smart.You can figure that out.

764
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:34,119
Psychology is not an exact science,

765
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:37,666
but, my God, man,anybody can add two and two.

766
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,936
I'm very sorry about your sister.It's a tragedy.

767
01:16:47,612 --> 01:16:49,239
It truly is.

768
01:16:56,089 --> 01:16:58,489
And I can understand your hostility.

769
01:16:58,592 --> 01:17:00,219
But no matter how upset you are,

770
01:17:00,328 --> 01:17:04,127
breaking an expensive pieceof equipment won't solve anything.

771
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:08,328
I mean, striking out at inanimate objectsis really quite childish.

772
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:11,336
Even you should be able to realize that.

773
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:15,410
Jerk.

774
01:17:44,278 --> 01:17:46,542
Howdy, partner. How you doing?

775
01:17:47,715 --> 01:17:52,379
- Who are you?- The name is Hec. Hec Gomez.

776
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:58,857
Hey, them's real fine duds you got there.You a Maytag repairman?

777
01:17:59,896 --> 01:18:02,330
How did you find this place?

778
01:18:02,566 --> 01:18:05,796
Well ah, this lady back in LA sent me.

779
01:18:06,236 --> 01:18:10,104
Hey, you been to LA lately?It's cleaned out, man, I'm telling you.

780
01:18:11,142 --> 01:18:13,906
Hey, come here.I want to show you something. Come on.

781
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:19,283
Hey, you know how the harbor freewayis always bumper to bumper?

782
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:22,182
Well, you can go 150 miles an hourif you want to.

783
01:18:22,822 --> 01:18:24,551
Me and this baby,

784
01:18:24,657 --> 01:18:28,184
we go through them freewayslike turkey crap through a tin horn.

785
01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:34,625
Hey...

786
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,662
You like girls?

787
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:44,645
Look in here.

788
01:18:48,017 --> 01:18:50,281
- She's dead.- She ain't dead.

789
01:18:50,554 --> 01:18:52,681
See, this lady shot her upwith sodium pentothal

790
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,281
to make this fellow thinkshe was dead,

791
01:18:59,464 --> 01:19:02,160
So you wouldn't suck her blood out,you asshole.

792
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:07,938
Son of a bitch!

793
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:11,076
Shit!

794
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,084
Excuse me, everyone.

795
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,087
I'm afraid our adolescent guesthas escaped.

796
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,123
She's quite hostile.

797
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,696
She may have already gone topside,

798
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:32,563
so please take a momentand look around you.

799
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:59,257
Check those rooms,and I'll check this one.

800
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:58,096
Let's go.

801
01:22:05,678 --> 01:22:08,510
- Everything is under control.- Good.

802
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:40,008
You said no shots.

803
01:22:40,117 --> 01:22:42,449
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.It'll just...

804
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:45,319
You'll just giggle

805
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:47,255
and then you'll feel a little sleepy.

806
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:48,917
That's right.

807
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:51,325
And when you wake up,do you know where you'll be?

808
01:22:51,431 --> 01:22:54,594
- Where?- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

809
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,636
In fact, you'll live with Santa Clausfor the rest of your life.

810
01:22:58,872 --> 01:23:01,432
Hey, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

811
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,843
What? You don't believe in Santa?

812
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:26,626
Life support systems.

813
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:31,970
- Wilson, come with me.- Keep an eye on her.

814
01:23:32,077 --> 01:23:34,068
Yes.Now, Wilson!

815
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:37,276
Forget the door. Turn off the alarm.

816
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:54,529
I don't know.

817
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:58,037
My parents told menever to breathe anything from strangers.

818
01:23:58,307 --> 01:23:59,274
Hey!

819
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:03,375
Get your hands up.

820
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:10,479
What are you guys doing?

821
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:15,422
They said if we breathe this, we could goto the North Pole and see Santa Claus.

822
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:18,356
- That's so sick.- Hey!

823
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:20,864
- Holy shit!- Whoa.

824
01:24:20,966 --> 01:24:23,059
- Sam?- I give! I give!

825
01:24:23,603 --> 01:24:27,767
- They said you were dead.- They were exaggerating totally.

826
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:32,473
- Hey, that's a great outfit.- Thanks. Is that guy in the hallway dead?

827
01:24:33,514 --> 01:24:34,845
Don't.

828
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:47,527
Well?

829
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:54,331
You can give up if you want to, Wilson.

830
01:24:57,742 --> 01:25:00,870
But we still have the two childrenand that girl.

831
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,645
I forgot my football.

832
01:25:03,749 --> 01:25:07,048
- We'll get you another football.- We'll get you a stadium.

833
01:25:09,089 --> 01:25:10,056
Now!

834
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,504
Get everybody topside, now!

835
01:25:24,607 --> 01:25:27,770
- What about them?- Screw them.

836
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:36,442
Okay, kids. Going up.

837
01:25:37,622 --> 01:25:39,817
Put your hands down, kids.

838
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:41,787
God, don't be so stupid.

839
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,337
- Come on, kids.- Who are the kids?

840
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:57,966
- I'm Brian.- I'm Sarah.

841
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,342
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Regand that's Aunt Sam

842
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,641
and that's Uncle Hector.

843
01:26:01,749 --> 01:26:03,876
- Can I have my bunny?- In a minute.

844
01:26:03,985 --> 01:26:06,613
- Beat feet, Uncle Hector.- Uncle Hector?

845
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:09,313
Hey, it's my bunny, you know.

846
01:26:17,133 --> 01:26:19,226
- Where have you been?- Can we change this?

847
01:26:19,336 --> 01:26:22,828
- Arranging a hotfoot for your friends.- I really hate this music.

848
01:26:22,939 --> 01:26:24,338
Give me a break!

849
01:26:27,045 --> 01:26:29,138
- What are you doing?- I'm not kidding.

850
01:26:29,247 --> 01:26:31,579
I get carsick without my bunny.

851
01:26:31,717 --> 01:26:35,949
- Come on, Reg. Give the kid the bunny.- We've stopped. Why have we stopped?

852
01:26:36,056 --> 01:26:37,114
Son of a...

853
01:26:37,223 --> 01:26:38,918
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

854
01:26:39,025 --> 01:26:42,619
Okay, kids.Cover your eyes for Uncle Hector.

855
01:26:44,998 --> 01:26:47,660
Hey! Think tank, huh?

856
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:50,629
Look, couldn't we just, like, leave?

857
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,433
Think over this.

858
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,577
- We can get them. We have to get them.- Hey, we'll be taking off now.

859
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,547
Look us up at Chasen's.We'll party down, huh?

860
01:27:01,184 --> 01:27:03,675

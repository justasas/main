1
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,608
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

2
00:01:58,473 --> 00:01:59,792
Willy?

3
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,553
It's all right.
I came back.

4
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:05,512
Why, what happened?
Did something happen, Willy?

5
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,952
- Nothing happened.
- You didn't smash the car?

6
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,472
I said nothing happened!

7
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,952
- Didn't you hear me?
- Don't you feel well?

8
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,792
I'm tired to the death.

9
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,231
I, uh, I couldn't make it.

10
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:20,952
I just couldn't make it, Linda.

11
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,272
Where were you all day?
You look terrible.

12
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:26,072
Oh, I got as far
as a little above Yonkers.

13
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,352
I stopped for a cup of coffee.

14
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,792
- Maybe it was the coffee.
- What?

15
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,912
I suddenly couldn't drive anymore.

16
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,072
The car kept going off
onto the shoulder.

17
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,432
Maybe it's the steering.

18
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,711
I don't think
Angelo knows the Studebaker.

19
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:41,833
No, it's me. Suddenly I realise
I'm going 60 miles an hour

20
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,432
and I don't remember
the last five minutes.

21
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,791
I can't seem to keep my mind to it.

22
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,753
Maybe it's your glasses.
You never went for new glasses.

23
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,431
I see everything.
I came back ten miles an hour.

24
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,832
It took me nearly four hours
from Yonkers.

25
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,513
You just gotta take a rest.
You can't continue like this.

26
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,911
Aw, I just got back from Florida.

27
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,831
But you didn't rest your mind.

28
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,992
Your mind is overactive
and the mind is what counts, dear.

29
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:09,672
I'll start out in the morning.
Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.

30
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,431
Oh, these... these arch supports
are killing me.

31
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:13,992
Take an aspirin.

32
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,431
Should I get you an aspirin?
Lt'll soothe you.

33
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,568
I was driving along, understand?
I was fine.

34
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,431
I was even observing the scenery.

35
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:26,113
You can imagine me looking at scenery
on the road every week of my life.

36
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,312
But it's so beautiful up there, Linda.

37
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,391
The trees are thick and the sun is warm.

38
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:33,552
I just open the windshield
and let the warm air bathe over me.

39
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,048
And then all of a sudden I'm...

40
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,231
...l'm going off the road.

41
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:40,952
I'm telling you,
I absolutely forgot I was driving.

42
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:44,313
If I'd have gone the other way
over the white line

43
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,808
I might have killed somebody.

44
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:51,912
So, I went on again and five minutes
later I'm dreaming again and I nearly...

45
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:57,552
I have such thoughts.
I have such strange thoughts.

46
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,831
Talk to them again, Willy.

47
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,752
There's no reason
why you can't work in New York.

48
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,592
I'm the New England man.
I'm vital in New England.

49
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:10,312
You're 60 years old. They can't expect
you to keep driving every week.

50
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:13,312
I'll have to send a wire to Portland.

51
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:17,393
I'm supposed to see Brown and Morrison
tomorrow morning to show the line.

52
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:19,511
- Oh, I could sell them.
- Now, Willy.

53
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:21,872
Go down to that place again.
Talk to Howard.

54
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:25,112
Tell him you gotta work in New York.
You're too accommodating.

55
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,672
If old man Wagner was alive,
I'd have been in charge of New York now.

56
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,192
That man was a prince.
He was a masterful man.

57
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,672
That boy of his, Howard,
he don't appreciate.

58
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,352
When I went north the first time,

59
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,072
the Wagner Company didn't know
where New England was.

60
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,272
Why don't you
tell these things to Howard?

61
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,888
Oh, I will. I definitely will.

62
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:48,032
- Oh, is there any cheese?
- I'll make you a sandwich.

63
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,272
Go to sleep. I'll take some milk.

64
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,168
Geez.

65
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,408
Maybe he smashed up the car again.

66
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:59,873
He's gonna get his licence taken away
if he keeps that up.

67
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:02,311
I'm getting nervous about him, you know.

68
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,791
- His eyes are gone.
- No, I've driven with him.

69
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,632
He sees all right.
Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.

70
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:09,831
I drove into the city
with him last week.

71
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,431
He stops at a green light.
It turns red and he goes.

72
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,191
- Maybe he's colour blind.
- Pop?

73
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,752
He's got the finest eye for colour
in the business.

74
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,031
- The boys in?
- They're sleeping.

75
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,672
- Happy took Biff on a date tonight.
- Is that so?

76
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:24,392
It was so thrilling,
seeing them shaving together,

77
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,632
one behind the other in the bathroom
and going out together.

78
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:29,551
- Did you notice?
- Hm?

79
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:32,472
The whole house smells
of shaving lotion.

80
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:34,271
Figure it out.

81
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:37,313
Work a lifetime to pay off a house.
You finally own it.

82
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,311
There's nobody to live in it.

83
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,712
Life's a casting off.
It's always that way.

84
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:44,271
No, no, some people
accomplish something.

85
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,871
Did Biff say anything
after I went this morning?

86
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,312
You shouldn't have criticised him,
after he just got off the train.

87
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,752
- You must not lose your temper at him.
- When did I lose my temper?

88
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:56,191
I simply asked him
if he was making any money.

89
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:59,433
- Is that criticism?
- Willy, how could he make any money?

90
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,791
There's such an undercurrent in him.

91
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:05,152
He became a moody man. Did he apologise
when I left this morning?

92
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,832
He was crestfallen, Willy.
Now, you know how he admires you.

93
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:12,792
I think when he finds himself you'll
both be happier and you won't fight.

94
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,391
How can he find himself on a farm?
Is that a life?

95
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,431
A farmhand in the beginning
when he was young,

96
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,233
I thought, a young man, it's good
for him to travel, take differentjobs.

97
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,472
It's more than ten years and
he has yet to make 35 dollars a week.

98
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,511
He is finding himself, Willy.

99
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,191
Not finding yourself at the age of 34
is a disgrace.

100
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,591
- Shh!
- The trouble is, he's lazy!

101
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,912
- Willy, please, they are sleeping.
- Biff is a lazy...

102
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,791
...bum!
- Go down!

103
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,391
Get yourself something to eat
and be quiet.

104
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,151
Why did he come home?

105
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,391
I would like to know
what brought him home.

106
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,432
Well, I don't know.
I think he's still lost, Willy.

107
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:48,271
I think he's very lost.

108
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:51,192
Biff Loman is lost
in the greatest country in the world.

109
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,312
A young man with such
personal attractiveness gets lost?

110
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,472
And such a hard worker.

111
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,991
There's one thing about Biff.
He's not lazy.

112
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,208
Never.

113
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:06,473
I'll see him in the morning, have
a talk with him, get him a job selling.

114
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,191
He'd be big in no time.

115
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:11,512
Remember the way they used to
follow him around in high school?

116
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:15,632
Oh, when he just smiled at them
their faces lit up.

117
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:19,952
When he walked down the
street with a crowd of kids behind him.

118
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:22,191
Will you ever forget that?

119
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,471
- You smoking?
- You want one?

120
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:27,208
I can never sleep when I smell it.

121
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:31,592
It's funny, Biff, you know... us.

122
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:35,152
Sleeping in here again, huh?
The old beds.

123
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:37,991
All the talk that went across
those two beds, huh?

124
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,127
- Our whole lives.
- Yeah.

125
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,111
A lotta dreams and plans.

126
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,433
About 500 women would like to know
what was said in this room.

127
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,392
- Remember that big Betsy something?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,272
What the hell was her name?
Over on Bushwick Avenue.

129
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:55,111
- With the collie dog.
- Yeah, that's the one.

130
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,992
- I got you in there, man.
- That was my first time, I think.

131
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:01,872
Boy, there was a pig.

132
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:05,313
You taught me everything I know
about women. Don't forget that.

133
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:08,872
I bet you forgot how bashful
you used to be, especially with girls.

134
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:11,872
Oh, I still am, Biff.
I just control it, that's all.

135
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,871
I think I got less bashful.

136
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,832
You got more so.

137
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,312
What happened, Biff?
Where's your old humour?

138
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,992
The old confidence?
What's the matter?

139
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:28,592
- Why does Dad mock me all the time?
- He's not mocking you, Biff.

140
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:32,152
Everything I say there's mockery
on his face. I can't get near him.

141
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:34,551
I think the fact
that you're not settled,

142
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,311
that you're still up in the air.

143
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:38,751
I think there's other things
depressing him.

144
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,431
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Don't lay it all to me.

145
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,671
But I think if you just got started...

146
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:46,512
I mean, is there any future
for you out there?

147
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,392
I don't know what the future is.
I don't know what I'm supposed to want.

148
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,911
What do you mean?

149
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:56,752
I spent six or seven years after
high school trying to work myself up.

150
00:08:56,872 --> 00:09:00,032
Shipping clerk, salesman,
business of one kind or another.

151
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:02,231
It's a measly manner of existence.

152
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,592
To get on that subway
in the hot mornings in the summer,

153
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:09,752
to devote your whole life
to keeping stock or making phone calls.

154
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,071
And the selling, the buying.

155
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:16,272
To suffer 50 weeks of the year
for the sake of a two week vacation,

156
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:21,272
when all you really desire
is to be outdoors with your shirt off.

157
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,512
And always to have to get ahead
of the next fellow.

158
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,631
Still, that's how you build a future.

159
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,432
I bought a new kind
of American type cheese. It's whipped.

160
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:32,351
Why do you get American?
I like Swiss.

161
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,312
- I thought you'd like a change.
- I don't want a change.

162
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:38,832
- Why am I always being contradicted?
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

163
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:42,312
- Why don't you open a window in here?
- They're all open.

164
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:45,752
They boxed us in here.
Bricks and windows, windows and bricks.

165
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:48,151
We should have bought
the land next door.

166
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:51,072
There's not a breath of fresh air
in the neighbourhood.

167
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,871
The grass don't grow anymore.
You can't raise a carrot.

168
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,671
They should have had a law
against apartment houses.

169
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,631
Remember those two beautiful elm trees?

170
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:05,591
When I and Biff
hung the swing between them, huh?

171
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,910
Like being a million miles
from the city.

172
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:11,232
They should have arrested the builder
for cutting those down.

173
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,887
They massacred the neighbourhood.

174
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:20,632
More and more I think of those days,
Linda, this time of year.

175
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:23,311
It was lilacs and wisteria

176
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:26,352
and then the peonies
would come out... daffodils.

177
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,071
What fragrance in this room.

178
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:32,112
- People had to move somewhere.
- There's more people now.

179
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,671
- I don't think...
- There's more people!

180
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:38,672
That's what's ruining this country!
Population is getting out of control!

181
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,391
The competition is maddening!

182
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,832
Smell the stink from that apartment
house and another on the other side!

183
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,527
How can they whip cheese?

184
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,631
Go down, try it and be quiet.

185
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:03,832
You're not worried about me,
are you, sweetheart, huh?

186
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:08,872
No, you've got too much on the ball
to be worried about, my darling.

187
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:13,552
You're my foundation
and my support, Linda.

188
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:17,472
Oh, just try to relax.
You make mountains out of molehills.

189
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,271
I won't fight with him anymore.

190
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,270
If he wants to go to Texas, let him go.

191
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,831
- He'll find his way.
- Sure.

192
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,671
Certain men just don't get started
till later in life.

193
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,672
Like Thomas Edison, I think,

194
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:31,327
or B.F. Goodrich.

195
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,927
One of them was deaf.

196
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,511
I'll put my money on Biff.

197
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:41,232
And Willy, if it's warm Sunday
we'll drive in the country.

198
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,790
We'll open the windshield,
we'll take lunch.

199
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,351
The windshields don't open
on the new cars.

200
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,551
- But you opened it today.
- Me?

201
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,287
I didn't.

202
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:57,047
Now, isn't that peculiar?

203
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:02,752
- Isn't that remarkable?
- What, dear?

204
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:07,192
That is the most remarkable thing.

205
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:10,287
What, darling?

206
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:13,287
I was thinking of the Chevy.

207
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:19,472
1928, when I had that red Chevy.

208
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,927
Isn't that funny?

209
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:28,231
I could have sworn
I was back in that Chevy today.

210
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:32,751
That's nothing.
Something must have reminded you.

211
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,847
Remarkable.

212
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,967
Remember those days, huh?

213
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,952
The way Biff used to simonise that car?

214
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,392
Dealer refused to believe
there was 80,000 miles on it.

215
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:51,072
Close your eyes.
I'll be right up.

216
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,951
Now, you be careful on the stairs.

217
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:57,072
- The cheese is on the middle shelf.
- Eighty thousand mi...

218
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,887
Eighty-two thousand.

219
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:08,032
No, I've always made a point
of not wasting my life.

220
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:11,752
Whenever I come back here I know that
all I've done is to waste my life.

221
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:14,471
You're a poet, Biff.
You know that?

222
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:19,032
- You're an idealist.
- No, I'm mixed up very bad.

223
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,912
Maybe I ought to get married, right?

224
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,990
Maybe I ought
to get stuck into something.

225
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,470
Maybe that's my trouble.

226
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:30,071
I'm like a boy.
I'm not married, I'm not in business.

227
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,767
I'm just like a boy.

228
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:36,110
Are you content, Hap?

229
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,671
You're a success, aren't you?
Are you content?

230
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,430
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You're making money.

231
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:44,871
All I can do now is wait for
the merchandise manager to die.

232
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:53,231
Listen, kid, why don't you
come out West with me?

233
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,990
And you and I?

234
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:58,831
Maybe we can buy a ranch,
raise cattle, use some muscles.

235
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,710
Men built like we are
should be working in the open.

236
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,190
- The Loman brothers?
- We'd be known all over.

237
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,751
Biff, Biff, that's
what I dream of sometimes.

238
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:10,752
Sometimes I want to rip my clothes off
and outbox the merchandise manager.

239
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,150
I can outbox, out lift,
outrun anybody in the store

240
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,590
and I have to take orders
from those sons of bitches.

241
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:17,350
If you were with me I'd be happier.

242
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,872
Everybody around me is so false
that I am constantly lowering my ideals.

243
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:24,432
Together we'd stand up for one another.

244
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,391
We werert brought up to grub for money.
I don't know how.

245
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:29,710
- Neither can I.
- Let's go.

246
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,271
The only thing is,
what can you make out there?

247
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,231
Hap!

248
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:36,672
I got to show some
of those pompous executives there

249
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,487
that Hap Loman can make the grade, huh?

250
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,247
Then I'll go with you, Biff.

251
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:44,670
We'll be together yet.

252
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:47,447
I swear, huh?

253
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:51,424
But take those two we had tonight.
Werert they gorgeous creatures?

254
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:53,863
Yeah, most gorgeous I've had in years.

255
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:56,983
I get that any time I want, Biff.
Whenever I feel disgusted.

256
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:00,064
The only trouble is,
it gets like bowling or something.

257
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:03,224
I just keep knocking them over.
It doesn't mean anything.

258
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,303
- You still run around a lot?
- Nah.

259
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,303
I'd like to find a girl steady,
somebody with substance.

260
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:12,143
- Mm-hmm. That's what I long for.
- Go on.

261
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,343
- You'd never come home.
- I would.

262
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,263
Somebody with character, like Mom.

263
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,023
You're gonna call me a bastard
when I tell you this.

264
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,744
That girl Charlotte I was with,
engaged to be married.

265
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,582
- No kidding.
- Sure.

266
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,062
Guy's in line
for the vice-presidency of the store.

267
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,503
I don't know what gets into me.

268
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:30,344
Maybe I have an overdeveloped
sense of competition.

269
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:33,303
I went and ruined her.
Furthermore, I can't get rid of her.

270
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:35,463
He's the third executive
I've done that to.

271
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,503
Isn't that a crummy characteristic?

272
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,519
And to top it all,
I go to their weddings.

273
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:44,143
Don't get your sweater dirty!
Biff!

274
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,102
Doesrt he know Mom can hear that?

275
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:49,544
Oh, what a simonising job. Huh?

276
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,424
Look, Biff, don't leave again, will you?

277
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,702
You'll find a job here, Biff.

278
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,662
- You gotta stay.
- Hey, Biff-o!

279
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,423
I don't know what to do.
It's getting embarrassing.

280
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,143
Oh, boy, what a simonising job.

281
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,264
Look, you go to sleep now but
talk to him in the morning, will ya?

282
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,544
- With her in the house?
- We should have a good talk with him.

283
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:13,503
- That selfish, stupid...
- Shh. Sleep, Biff.

284
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,919
No kidding, Biff.
You got a date?

285
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:29,863
Listen, um, you just want
to be careful with those...

286
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:31,983
...those girls, Biff.
That's all.

287
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,543
Don't make any promises,
no promises, Biff.

288
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,982
No promises of any kind.

289
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:40,624
'Cause the girls, you know,
they always believe what you tell them.

290
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,943
You're very young, Biff.

291
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:47,744
You're too young
to be talking seriously to girls.

292
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:51,144
You want to watch your schooling first.

293
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:52,783
Stand where you were.

294
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:55,462
When you're all set, though,

295
00:16:55,463 --> 00:17:00,184
there will be plenty of girls

296
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,639
for a boy like you.

297
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,438
That so?

298
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,999
The girls pay for you?

299
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,919
Boy, you must really be making a hit.

300
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:16,743
I've been wondering why
you polished the car so careful there.

301
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,814
Uh...

302
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:26,215
Don't leave the hubcaps.
Get the chamois to the hubcaps.

303
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:30,670
Happy, use newspaper on the windows.
It's easy.

304
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,294
Use it like a pad.

305
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:36,390
That's it, good work.
You're going all right.

306
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:39,895
Biff, um...

307
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,374
First thing we gotta do
when we get time,

308
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,774
we gotta clip that big branch
over the house.

309
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,511
I'm afraid it's gonna fall on the roof.

310
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:52,791
Tell you what, we get a, uh...

311
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,734
We get a rope and sling her around,

312
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:58,334
we climb up there with saws
and take her down.

313
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:00,934
Soon as you finish the car, boys,
I want to see you.

314
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,494
I got a surprise for you, boys.

315
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:06,455
- What do you got, Dad?
- No, no, you finish first.

316
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:10,415
Never leave a job till you finish.
You remember that.

317
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,071
Biff?

318
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:18,375
Up in Albany I saw a beautiful hammock.
I think I'll buy it next trip

319
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:21,790
and we'll hang it
between those two elms there, huh?

320
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,430
Wouldrt that be...
Huh?

321
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,374
Wouldrt that be something?

322
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,895
Just hanging... Just swinging there
under those branches?

323
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,894
Oh, boy, that would be something.

324
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,574
How's that, Pop? Professional?

325
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,615
Terrific. That's a terrific job, boys.

326
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:42,879
- Good work, Biff. - Where's the
surprise? - In the back seat of the car.

327
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,415
What is it? Tell me. What did you buy?
-Never mind, something I want you to have.

328
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:49,694
- What is it, Happy?
- It's a punching bag.

329
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,775
- It's got Gene Tunney's signature.
- How'd you know?

330
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,574
- The finest thing for the timing.
- I'm losing weight.

331
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,134
- Jumping rope is good, too.
- See the football I got?

332
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,935
- Where'd you get a new ball?
- Coach told me to practice passing.

333
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,815
- He gave you the ball?
- I borrowed it from the locker room.

334
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,214
- I want you to return that.
- I told you.

335
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:09,023
- I'm bringing it back.
- He's gotta practice with a ball.

336
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,542
Coach will congratulate you
on your initiative.

337
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:14,503
- He keeps congratulating my initiative.
- He likes you.

338
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,303
Somebody else took that ball,
there'd be an uproar.

339
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:20,062
What's the report, boys?
What's the report?

340
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:23,183
Where'd you go this time, Pop?
We were lonesome for you.

341
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,103
I'll tell you a secret, boys.
Don't breathe it to a soul.

342
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:29,703
Someday I'll have my own business
and I'll never have to leave home.

343
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,582
- Like Uncle Charley?
- Bigger than Uncle Charley.

344
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,671
Charley is not liked.
He's liked but he's not well liked.

345
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,343
- Where'd you go this time?
- I went to Providence. Met the mayor.

346
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,982
- The mayor of Providence?
- He was in the hotel lobby.

347
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,502
- What did he say?
- He said, "Good morning".

348
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,582
I said, "You got a fine state here".

349
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,783
He had coffee with me,
then I went to Waterbury.

350
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:54,567
Waterbury is a fine city, a big clock
city. The famous Waterbury clock.

351
00:19:54,743 --> 00:20:00,303
Sold a nice bill there. And then Boston.
Boston was the cradle of the Revolution.

352
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,582
A fine city.
A couple other towns in Mass,

353
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,822
on to Portland, Bangor
and straight home.

354
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,942
- Love to go with you.
- As soon as summer comes.

355
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:10,103
- Promise?
- You, Hap and I, I'll show you.

356
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:11,902
One thing, boys, I have friends.

357
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,543
I can park my car on any street
and the cops protect it like their own.

358
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,383
This summer we'll take
our bathing suits...

359
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,502
- We'll carry your bags.
- That'd be something,

360
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:23,623
coming to the Boston stores
with you boys carrying my bags!

361
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,342
A sensation.

362
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:28,223
- You nervous about the game?
- Not if you're gonna be there.

363
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,462
What do they say
now that you're captain?

364
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,102
There's a crowd of girls around him
when classes change.

365
00:20:33,103 --> 00:20:36,423
This Saturday, just for you,
I'm gonna break through for a touchdown.

366
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:39,182
- You are supposed to pass...
- I'm doing one play for Pop.

367
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:42,023
When I take off my helmet
that means I'm breaking out.

368
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,143
- Watch me cross that line.
- Wait till I tell this in Boston.

369
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,822
- Biff, where are you?
- Hey, look at Bernard!

370
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:49,662
What are you looking so anaemic about?

371
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:52,463
Gotta study, Uncle Willy.
He's got Regents next week.

372
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,782
Come on, let's box.

373
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,462
I heard Mr. Birnbaum say
if you don't start studying math

374
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,342
he's gonna flunk you and you won't
graduate. -You better study with him.

375
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:03,583
- Pop, you didn't see my sneakers.
- A beautiful job of printing.

376
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:07,943
Just because he prints University of
Virginia doesn't mean they gotta graduate him.

377
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:11,423
With scholarships to three universities
they're gonna flunk him?

378
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,142
- I heard Mr. Birnbaum say...
- Don't be a pest.

379
00:21:14,143 --> 00:21:16,598
What an anaemic.

380
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,991
I'm waiting for you in my house, Biff.

381
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,950
Bernard is not well-liked, is he?

382
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,670
He's liked but he's not well-liked.

383
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:27,910
Bernard can get
the best marks in school,

384
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,591
but when he gets out to the business
world you'll be ahead of him.

385
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,070
That's why I thank Almighty God
you're both built like Adonises.

386
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,829
The man who makes an appearance
in the business world,

387
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,230
the man who creates personal interest,
is the man who gets ahead.

388
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:44,286
Be liked and you will never want, hm?

389
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:48,071
Take me, for instance. I never
have to wait in line to see a buyer.

390
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:50,709
Willy Loman is here,
that's all they have to know.

391
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,950
- I go straight through.
- Did you knock 'em dead?

392
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:55,751
Knocked them cold in Providence,
slaughtered in Boston.

393
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:59,151
- I'm losing weight, Pop.
- Hello, dear. - Sweetheart.

394
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:02,390
- How'd the Chevy run?
- Chevrolet's the greatest car ever.

395
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:04,910
Since when do you
let your mother carry wash?

396
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,663
Where to, Ma? -Just hang it on the
line. Biff, you gotta go to your friends.

397
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:12,303
- The cellar is filled with boys.
- When Pop comes home they can wait.

398
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:15,983
- Better go tell them what to do, Biff.
- Sweep out the furnace room.

399
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:19,783
- Good work, Biff. - The way they
obey him. - That's the training.

400
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,621
I was selling thousands,
but I had to come home.

401
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:25,182
The block will be at that game.
You sell anything?

402
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:27,943
I did 500 gross in Providence,
700 gross in Boston.

403
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,734
Wait, wait, I got a pencil.

404
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:35,174
That makes your commission 200...

405
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:37,014
My God!

406
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:40,495
- Two hundred and twelve dollars!
- I didn't figure it yet.

407
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:43,895
- How much did you do?
- A hundred eighty gross in Providence.

408
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:46,573
It comes to roughly 200 gross
on the whole trip.

409
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,414
See, three of the stores
were half closed for inventory.

410
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,294
I would have broke records.

411
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:54,014
It makes 70 dollars and some pennies.
Very good.

412
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,814
- What do we owe?
- Well...

413
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:58,373
- Sixteen dollars on the refrigerator.
- Why 16?

414
00:22:58,374 --> 00:23:01,094
- The fan belt broke. It was $1.80.
- It's brand new.

415
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:04,055
Well, it's like the man says.
It's got to work itself in.

416
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,333
I hope we didn't get stuck
on that machine.

417
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,613
It's got the biggest ads of any of them!

418
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,374
It's a fine machine.
What else?

419
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:14,134
Well, there's $9.60
for the washing machine,

420
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:18,134
for the vacuum cleaner there's three and
a half due on the 15th, then the roof.

421
00:23:18,254 --> 00:23:21,974
- You've got 21 dollars. - It don't
leak? - They did a wonderful job.

422
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,374
- You owe five for the carburettor.
- I'm not gonna pay that man.

423
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:29,614
That lousy, rotten Chevrolet, they ought
to prohibit the manufacture of that car.

424
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,774
Well, you owe him three and a half.

425
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:35,335
And odds and ends comes to
around 120 dollars by the 15th.

426
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,814
A hundred and twenty dollars?
If business don't pick up I don't know.

427
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:41,814
- Next week you'll do better.
- I'll knock them dead.

428
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:44,654
I'll go to Hartford.
I'm well-liked in Hartford.

429
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:48,134
You know what the trouble is, Linda?
People don't seem to take to me.

430
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,694
- Don't be so foolish.
- I know it when I walk in.

431
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,333
- They seem to laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

432
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:57,174
- Don't talk like that.
- They just pass me by.

433
00:23:57,294 --> 00:24:01,423
- You're making 70 to 100 dollars a week.
- I gotta be at in 10, 12 hours a day.

434
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:04,254
Other men, I don't know why,
they do it easier.

435
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,893
I don't know why I can't stop myself.
I talk too much.

436
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:10,079
- Oh! - A man ought to come
in with a few words.

437
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:13,015
Charley, he's a man of few words
and they respect him.

438
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:15,733
You don't talk too much.
You're just lively.

439
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,574
Well, I figure, what the hell.
Life is short.

440
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:22,110
A couple of jokes...

441
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:26,174
- I joke too much.
- Why, you're...

442
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,790
I'm short.

443
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,013
I'm very foolish to look at, Linda.

444
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:36,278
I didn't tell you, but at Christmastime
I happened to be calling on F.H. Stewarts,

445
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:40,414
another salesman I know
as I was going to see the buyer.

446
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:44,534
I heard him say something
about "the shrimp".

447
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:49,694
And I cracked him...
I cracked him right across the face.

448
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,454
I won't take that.

449
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:54,214
I simply will not take that.

450
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,573
But they do laugh at me.
Oh, I know that.

451
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:01,773
- Darling?
- No, I gotta overcome it.

452
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:03,933
- I know I gotta overcome it.
- Darling?

453
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,974
I'm not dressing to advantage, maybe.

454
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:11,735
Willy, darling, you're
the handsomest man in the world.

455
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:17,814
You're the best. You're a pal.

456
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:22,975
On the road I want to grab you sometimes
and just kiss the life out of you.

457
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:27,854
I get so lonely,
especially when business is bad,

458
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,774
I get the feeling
I'll never sell anything.

459
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:33,469
I want to make a living for you.

460
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:38,102
Or business. Business for the boys.
There's so much I want to make for them.

461
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:41,013
Me? You didn't make me, Willy.
I picked you.

462
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:43,053
- You picked me, huh?
- I did.

463
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:47,054
I'm sitting at that desk, watching all
the salesmen go by, day in and day out.

464
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:50,494
You got such a sense of humour.
And we do have a good time together.

465
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:53,373
- Sure, sure. Why do you have to go?
- It's 2:00.

466
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:56,175
- Come on.
- My sisters will be scandalised.

467
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,973
- When will you be back?
- Two weeks. Will you come up?

468
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,854
Sure thing. You do make me laugh.
That's good for me.

469
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:05,533
And I think you're a wonderful man.

470
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:10,039
- You picked me, huh? - I did, 'cause
you're so sweet and such a kidder.

471
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:12,214
I'll see you next time I'm in Boston.

472
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:14,893
- I'll put you through to the buyers.
- Right. Well.

473
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,453
Well, bottoms up.

474
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:20,295
Willy! You just kill me, Willy!

475
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:22,910
You just kill me!

476
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,694
And thanks for the stockings.
I love a lot of stockings.

477
00:26:26,814 --> 00:26:30,014
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

478
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,893
Oh, and keep your pores open.

479
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:35,029
Willy!

480
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:40,814
You are, Willy, the handsomest.

481
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:48,733
I'll make it all up to you, Linda.

482
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,294
There's nothing to make up.
You're doing fine.

483
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:53,533
- What's that?
- I'm mending my stockings.

484
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:56,614
- They're so expensive.
- I won't have you mending stockings!

485
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:58,694
- Willy...
- Where is he? If he doesn't...

486
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:01,293
- Give him the answers.
- I do, but I can't on a Regents.

487
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:04,254
- It's a state exam.
- Biff! Where is he?

488
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,453
You better give back that football.

489
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:09,694
- Biff, where is he?
- He's too rough with the girls.

490
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:12,734
- He's driving without a licence.
- Shut up.

491
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:13,933
Willy.

492
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,894
- Get out of here.
- If he doesn't buckle down he'll flunk.

493
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:21,454
- You gotta do something about that boy.
- There's nothing the matter with him.

494
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:26,054
You want him to be a worm like Bernard?

495
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:30,534
Aw, he's got spirit, personality.

496
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:33,934
He's loaded with it, loaded.
What is he stealing?

497
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:37,110
He's giving it back, isn't he?

498
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:41,190
Why is he stealing?

499
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,934
What did I tell him?
I never in my life told him anything...

500
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,413
Come on up, Pop.
Let's go up.

501
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:50,150
Huh?

502
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:53,773
Why did she have
to wax the floors herself?

503
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,694
Every time she waxes the floors
she keels over.

504
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:58,893
- She knows that.
- Take it easy, Pop.

505
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:02,174
- Hey, what brought you back tonight?
- I got an awful scare.

506
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,349
I nearly hit a kid in Yonkers.

507
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:08,014
Why didn't I go to Alaska
with my brother Ben that time?

508
00:28:08,094 --> 00:28:11,134
Ben, that man was a genius.
That man was success incarnate.

509
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:13,893
What a mistake.
He begged me to go.

510
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:17,854
The man started with the clothes on his
back and ended up with diamond mines.

511
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,973
I'd like to know how he did it.

512
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,973
The man knew what he wanted, got it.

513
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:25,334
Walks into a jungle, comes out
the age of 21 and he's rich.

514
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:29,814
The world is an oyster, but
you don't crack it open on a mattress.

515
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:32,493
Pop, I told you,
I'm gonna retire you for life.

516
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:35,414
You're gonna retire me for life
on 70 dollars a week

517
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:38,574
and your women and your car
and your apartment. You retire me?

518
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:42,094
I couldn't get past Yonkers today.
Where are you guys? Where are you?

519
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:46,838
The woods are burning. I can't
drive a car. - Everything all right?

520
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,533
- What's the matter?
- Everything's fine.

521
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:55,053
- I thought something happened.
- No. - Can't we do something about the walls?

522
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:58,933
You sneeze in here, in my house hats
blow off. - Come on, let's go up, huh?

523
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:02,214
- You go ahead. I'm not tired.
- All right. Take it easy.

524
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,334
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had a heartburn.

525
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,933
- You don't know how to eat.
- I eat with my mouth.

526
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:13,653
You gotta know about vitamins
and things like that.

527
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:16,814
- Come on, let's shoot. Tire you out.
- All right.

528
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:19,654
- You got cards?
- I got them someplace.

529
00:29:21,974 --> 00:29:24,493
What is it with those vitamins?

530
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:26,893
They build up your bones. Chemistry.

531
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,934
- There's no bones in a heartburn.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:32,453
- You don't know about it.
- I'll get insulted.

533
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:35,494
Don't talk about something
you don't know anything about.

534
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:45,269
- What are you doing home?
- A little trouble with the car.

535
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,629
Oh.

536
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,574
- I'd like to take a trip to California.
- Don't say.

537
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:57,974
You want a job? - I got a job, I told you
that. What are you offering me a job for?

538
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,653
- Don't get insulted.
- Don't insult me.

539
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,333
- You don't have to go on this way.
- I got a good job.

540
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,173
- What do you keep coming in here for?
- You want me to go?

541
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:09,214
I can't understand it.
He's going back to Texas again.

542
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:10,972
- What is that?
- Let him go.

543
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:13,373
I've got nothing to give him.
I'm clean.

544
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:17,334
- I'm clean.
- He won't starve. None of them starve.

545
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:20,573
- Forget about it.
- Then what have I got to remember?

546
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:25,758
You take it too hard. When a deposit bottle
is broken you don't get your nickel back.

547
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:28,854
- That's easy for you to say.
- That ain't easy for me to say.

548
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:34,293
You see the ceiling
I put up in here, hmm?

549
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,229
Yeah, that's a piece of work.

550
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,812
Putting up a ceiling is a mystery to me.

551
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:44,710
How do you do it?
What's the difference?

552
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:47,732
- Huh?
- Well, talk about it.

553
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,853
- You gonna put up a ceiling?
- How can I?

554
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:52,532
- What are you bothering me for?
- You're insulted.

555
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,173
A man who can't handle tools
is not a man.

556
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:58,973
- You're disgusting.
- Don't call me disgusting, Willy.

557
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:02,054
Oh, I'm getting...

558
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:07,654
- I'm getting awfully tired, Ben.
- Keep playing. You'll sleep better.

559
00:31:07,773 --> 00:31:10,349
Did you call me Ben?

560
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:15,814
That's funny. For a second
you reminded me of my brother, Ben.

561
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:19,253
- I only have a few minutes.
- You never heard from him again?

562
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:23,678
Didn't Linda tell you? A couple weeks ago
we got a letter from his wife in Africa.

563
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:27,092
- He died. - Is that so?
- This is Brooklyn, huh?

564
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,133
- Maybe you're in for some of his money.
- He had seven sons.

565
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:32,452
There was one opportunity
I had with that man.

566
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,933
There are several properties
I'm looking at.

567
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:38,654
If I'd have gone with him to Alaska
everything would have been different.

568
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,974
- You'd have froze to death.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:46,614
Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska.
I'm surprised you're not up there.

570
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:49,452
There's the only man I ever met
who knew the answers.

571
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:50,972
- How are you all?
- Fine.

572
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:53,692
- Fine.
- Pretty sharp tonight.

573
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,933
- Is Mother living with you?
- She died long ago.

574
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:58,293
- Who?
- Fine specimen of a lady, Mother.

575
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:00,373
- I'd hoped to see the old girl.
- Who died?

576
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,772
- You heard from Father?
- What do you mean, who died?

577
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:04,932
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about!

578
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,732
- It's half past eight.
- That's my bill.

579
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:09,253
- I put the ace.
- If you don't know how to play...

580
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:12,053
- It's my ace, for God's sake.
- I'm through!

581
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:13,893
- When did Mother die?
- Long ago.

582
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:16,413
- You never knew how to play cards.
- All right.

583
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,492
Next time I'll bring a deck
with five aces.

584
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:21,574
- I don't play that kind of game.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

585
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,213
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

586
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:26,414
- Ignoramus.
- So, you're William?

587
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:28,388
Oh, Ben.

588
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:31,333
I've been waiting for you so long.

589
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,813
What's the answer?
How did you do it?

590
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:35,853
There's a story in that.

591
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,612
- Is this Ben?
- How do you do?

592
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:40,212
Where have you been?
Willy's been wondering...

593
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:42,212
Where is Dad?
How did you get started?

594
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:46,373
- I don't know how much you remember.
- I was just a baby, 3 or 4 years old.

595
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:48,852
- Three years, eleven months.
- What a memory.

596
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:51,292
I have many enterprises
and I've never kept books.

597
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,813
I was sitting under the wagon.
What was it, Nebraska?

598
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,893
South Dakota and I gave you wildflowers.

599
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:59,413
- I remember you walking down some road.
- I was going to find Father in Alaska.

600
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:02,252
In those days
I had a very faulty view of geography.

601
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:04,732
I discovered after a few days
I was heading south.

602
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,972
Instead of Alaska I ended up in
Africa. - Africa? - The Gold Coast!

603
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:11,653
- Principally, diamond mines.
- Diamond mines!

604
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:14,172
Yes, but I'm afraid
I only have a few minutes.

605
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:17,134
Boys, boys, listen to this!

606
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:18,933
This is your Uncle Ben!

607
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,253
A great man!
Ben, tell my boys.

608
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,573
Why, boys, when I was 17
I walked into the jungle.

609
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:28,052
When I was 21, I walked out.

610
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:31,733
- And by God, I was rich!
- See what I've been talking about?

611
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:35,333
- The greatest things can happen.
- I have an appointment in Ketchikan.

612
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:37,492
Tell about Dad.
I want my boys to hear.

613
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:40,012
I want them to know
the stock they spring from.

614
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:44,413
All I remember is a man with a big beard.
I was sitting on Mama's lap around the fire.

615
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:48,253
- There was some kind of high
music. - He played the flute.

616
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:52,853
- The flute, that's right. - Father was
a very great, very wild-hearted man.

617
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:56,013
He'd start in Boston
and toss the whole family in the wagon,

618
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,652
and he'd drive the team
right across the country.

619
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:02,293
Through lowa, Michigan, Illinois
and all the western states.

620
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,773
We'd stop in the towns and
he'd sell the flutes he made on the way.

621
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:07,412
A great inventor, Father.

622
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:11,573
With one gadget he made more in one week
than a man like you makes in a lifetime.

623
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:15,533
That's the way I'm bringing them up,
rugged, well-liked, all around.

624
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,852
- Yeah? Hit me, boy, hard as you can.
- No.

625
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:19,533
Oh, come on, get to me.

626
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:21,292
Go ahead, show him.

627
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,094
Like I taught you.
Give him the old shoulderjab.

628
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:29,134
Hey!

629
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:37,732
- How's that?
- Very good, Willy, very good.

630
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:41,413
- Shake hands, boys. Attaway.
- Look out, Biff.

631
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:43,813
Never fight fair with a stranger, boy.

632
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,574
You'll never get
out of the jungle that way.

633
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:49,773
It was an honour and a pleasure
to meet you, Linda.

634
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,293
Have a nice trip.

635
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:56,454
Oh, and good luck with your, uh...
What do you do?

636
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:59,132
- Oh, uh, selling.
- Oh, yes, really?

637
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,133
I don't want you to think...
It's Brooklyn, but we hunt too.

638
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:04,492
- Really, now?
- There's snakes and rabbits

639
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,573
That's why I moved out.
Biff can fell any one of these trees.

640
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:10,830
Go over to where they're building
the apartment and get some sand.

641
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,484
We're gonna rebuild the front stoop.
Watch us.

642
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:16,205
I lost weight, Pop, you notice?

643
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,684
They steal more
they'll put the cops on them.

644
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,845
- Don't let Biff take any more.
- The load they brought last week,

645
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:24,845
at least a dozen six by tens,
won'th all kinds of money.

646
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:27,806
If that watchman sees them...

647
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,765
I got a couple of fearless characters.

648
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:33,565
Willy, the gaols are full
of fearless characters.

649
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,606
- And the Stock Exchange.
- Uncle Willy!

650
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:39,325
Uncle Willy,
the watchmars chasing Biff!

651
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:41,805
Shut up.
He's not stealing anything.

652
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,605
Where is he?

653
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:46,446
Oh, there's nothing wrong.
What is the matter with you?

654
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,668
Nervy boy, good.

655
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:51,268
Nerves of iron, that Biff.

656
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:52,548
I don't know what it is.

657
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:55,188
My New England man comes back
and he's bleeding.

658
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:58,629
- Couldrt sell a nickel for five cents.
- It's contacts, Charley.

659
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:01,429
- I got important contacts.
- Glad to hear it, Willy.

660
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,148
Come in later,
we'll shoot a little casino.

661
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,885
I'll take some of your Portland money.

662
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:16,229
All business is bad, it's murderous.

663
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:19,708
But not for me, of course.

664
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:23,964
- I'll stop by on my way
back to Africa. - Ben, wait.

665
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:27,845
Can't you stay a few days, huh?

666
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,348
You're just what I need, Ben.

667
00:36:30,348 --> 00:36:32,868
You know, I have a fine position here,

668
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,469
but Dad left when I was such a baby,
I never had a chance to talk to him.

669
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:39,308
I still feel
kind of temporary about myself.

670
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:43,669
- I'll be late for my train.
- Ben, my boys. Can't we talk?

671
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:47,109
See, they'd go
into the jaws of hell for me, but I...

672
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:51,429
You're being first-rate with your boys.
Outstanding, manly chaps.

673
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,309
Ben, that's good to hear
because sometimes I'm afraid

674
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:56,708
I'm not teaching them
the right kind of...

675
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,068
How should I teach them?

676
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:01,869
William, when I walked
into the jungle, I was 17.

677
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,908
When I walked out I was 21.

678
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,869
And by God, I was rich!

679
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:11,444
Was rich!

680
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:19,469
That's just the spirit
I want to imbue them with,

681
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:22,108
to walk into a jungle...
Oh, boy.

682
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:26,028
I was right. I was right. I was right!

683
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:29,244
- I was right!
- Willy?

684
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:33,516
Willy, dear, did you get some cheese?

685
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,084
It's awful late, darling.
Come to bed.

686
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:44,029
You gotta break your neck
to see a star in this yard.

687
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:47,084
Are you coming up, Willy?

688
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:50,149
Whatever happened
to that diamond watch fob?

689
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,468
When Ben came from Africa that time,

690
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:54,988
didn't he give me a watch fob
with a diamond in it?

691
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:59,628
You pawned it, dear, 12, 13 years ago
for Biff's radio correspondence course.

692
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,348
That was a beautiful thing.
I'll take a walk.

693
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:04,548
But in your slippers, Willy?

694
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:09,189
What a man, huh?
Now, there was a man won'th talking to.

695
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:12,068
- But in your slippers!
- I was right.

696
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,188
I was, I was right!

697
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,069
- I was right.
- What is he doing out here?

698
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:19,227
- Shh!
- God Almighty, Mom.

699
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:22,149
- How long's he been doing this?
- Don't. He'll hear you.

700
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,788
What the hell is the matter with him?

701
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,596
- It'll pass by morning.
- Shouldn't we do anything?

702
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,868
Oh, my dear,
you should do a lot of things.

703
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,467
There's nothing to do.
Go to bed.

704
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,589
- I never heard him so loud, Mom.
- You'll hear him.

705
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:40,388
- Why didn't you write me about this?
- How would I?

706
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:42,748
For over three months
you've had no address.

707
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:45,804
I was on the move.
I thought of you all the time.

708
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,707
But he likes to have a letter

709
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,949
just to know there's still
the possibility of better things.

710
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:55,269
- He's not like this all the time.
- When you come home he's the worst.

711
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,028
When you write you're coming,

712
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,189
he's all smiles, he talks about
the future, he's wonderful.

713
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:03,869
The closer you come the more shaky
he gets and by the time you get here,

714
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:06,028
he's arguing,
he seems to be angry at you.

715
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:09,708
I think it's just because he can't
bring himself to open up to you.

716
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:12,748
- Why are you so hateful to each other?
- I'm not hateful.

717
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:16,109
Oh! You no sooner walk through
that door than you're fighting.

718
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,949
I don't know why.
I mean to change, Mom. I'm trying.

719
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:21,507
- Are you home to stay now?
- I don't know.

720
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:24,668
- I'll look around.
- You can't look around all your life.

721
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,909
I just can't take hold.
I can't take hold to some kind of life.

722
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:31,749
Biff, a man is not a bird
to come and go with the springtime.

723
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,084
Your hair.

724
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:37,707
Your hair's getting so gray.

725
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,068
It's been gray
since you were in high school.

726
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:43,468
- I just stopped dying it.
- Well, dye it again, Mom.

727
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,987
I don't want my pal looking old.

728
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:49,588
You are such a boy!

729
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:53,669
You think you can go away for a year?
You've got to get it into your head now.

730
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:57,389
One day you'll knock on this door,
there will be strange people here.

731
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,188
What are you talking about?
You're not even 60 yet.

732
00:40:00,308 --> 00:40:01,827
What about your father?

733
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:04,427
- Well, I meant him, too.
- He admires Pop.

734
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,708
If you don't have feeling for him,
you can't have feelings for me.

735
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,428
- Sure, I can.
- No, Biff.

736
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:12,188
You can'tjust come to see me!

737
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:14,987
Because I love him.

738
00:40:14,988 --> 00:40:17,228
He's the dearest man in the world to me

739
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:21,988
and I won't have anyone making him feel
unwanted and low and blue.

740
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:25,708
You have got to make up your mind now.
There's no leeway anymore.

741
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,307
Either he's your father,

742
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,588
and you pay him that respect,

743
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:32,348
or else you're not to come here.

744
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,349
- Hey, Biffo!
- What the hell is the matter with him?

745
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:38,027
- Don't go near him.
- Stop making excuses for him.

746
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:41,509
He always wiped the floor with you.
He never had an ounce of respect.

747
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:44,388
- He always had respect for her.
- What do you know?

748
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,787
- Don't call him crazy.
- He's got no character.

749
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:48,948
Charley wouldn't do this,
not in his house.

750
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,748
- Peeling that vomit from his mind.
- Charley never had what he's got.

751
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,669
People are worse off than Willy Loman,
I've seen them.

752
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,908
Then make Charley your father.
You can't do that, can you?

753
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:00,588
I am not saying he's a great man.

754
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:03,988
Willy Loman never earned a lot of money.
His name was never in the paper.

755
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:05,828
He's not the finest character.

756
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:07,988
But he's a human being.

757
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:12,156
And a terrible thing is happening
to him. So attention must be paid.

758
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:16,868
He must not be allowed
to fall into his grave like an old dog.

759
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:21,348
Attention! Attention must
finally be paid to such a person.

760
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:24,107
- You called him crazy?
- Mom, I didn't...

761
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,148
Wait a minute. A lot of people think
he's lost his balance,

762
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,349
but you don't have to be very smart
to know what his trouble is.

763
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:32,347
- The man is exhausted.
- Sure.

764
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,907
A small man can be
just as exhausted as a great man.

765
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:39,468
He works for a company
36 years this March,

766
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:42,748
he opens up uneard of territories
to their trademark,

767
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:45,107
and now, in his old age,

768
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:47,348
they take his salary away!

769
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:50,468
- I didn't know that, Mom.
- You never asked, my dear!

770
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:52,988
Now you get your spending money
somewhere else

771
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:55,828
- you don't trouble your mind with him.
- I gave you money.

772
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:57,987
Christmastime, 50 dollars.

773
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:01,148
To fix the hot water it cost $97.50!

774
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:04,229
For five weeks
he's been on straight commission,

775
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:06,387
like a beginner, an unknown.

776
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:08,348
Those ungrateful bastards!

777
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:10,548
Are they any worse than his sons?

778
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:14,148
He drives 700 miles,

779
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:18,028
and when he gets there no one
knows him anymore, no one welcomes him.

780
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:21,588
And what goes through a mars mind

781
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:24,468
driving 700 miles home

782
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:27,988
without having earned a cent?
Why shouldn't he talk to himself?

783
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:32,028
Why not, when
he has to go to Charley every week

784
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:35,588
and borrow 50 dollars from him,
and pretend to me it's his pay.

785
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:38,747
How long can that go on?
How long?

786
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:42,909
And you tell me he has no character?

787
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:46,988
The man who never worked a day
in his life but for your benefit!

788
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:49,427
And when does he get the medal for that?

789
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:52,428
Is this his reward?

790
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:56,749
To turn around at the age of 63
and find his sons,

791
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:59,708
who he loved better than his life,

792
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,708
- one a philandering bum...
- Mom!

793
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,268
That is all you are, my baby.

794
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:08,708
And you! What happened
to the love you had for him?

795
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:10,307
You were such pals.

796
00:43:10,308 --> 00:43:12,907
How you used to talk every night
on the phone,

797
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:15,669
how lonely he was
till he could come home to you.

798
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:17,547
All right, Mom.

799
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:20,868
I'll live in my room, I'll get a job,
I'll just keep away from him.

800
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:24,428
No, Biff, you can't stay here
and fight all the time.

801
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:26,427
He threw me out of this house.

802
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:28,028
Why did he do that?

803
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:30,909
- Because I know he's a fake.
- A fake!

804
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:34,268
- In what way? What do you mean?
- Just don't lay it all at my feet.

805
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:36,788
It's between me and him.
That's all I have to say.

806
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:40,108
I'll chip in from now on.
He'll settle for half my paycheque.

807
00:43:40,229 --> 00:43:42,747
- He'll be all right.
- He won't be all right!

808
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,643
I hate this city and I'll stay here.

809
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:47,436
Now, what do you want?

810
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,741
- He's dying, Biff.
- Why is he dying?

811
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:53,276
He's been trying to kill himself.

812
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,836
How?

813
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,301
Do you remember I wrote you that
he smashed the car again in February?

814
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,539
Well?

815
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:07,803
The insurance inspector came.

816
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:11,644
There's evidence that all the accidents
in the last year werert accidents.

817
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:13,523
How can they tell?
That's a lie.

818
00:44:13,524 --> 00:44:16,244
- It seems there's a woman...
- What woman?

819
00:44:16,324 --> 00:44:18,139
What?

820
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:19,964
- Nothing.
- What did you say?

821
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:22,700
- I said, "What woman?"
- What about her?

822
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:29,092
She was walking down the road.

823
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:31,932
She saw his car.
She said he wasrt driving fast at all.

824
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:33,651
He didn't skid, she said.

825
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:37,453
He came to that little bridge and
deliberately smashed into the railing.

826
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:40,171
It was the shallowness of the water
that saved him.

827
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:43,108
Mom, he probably just fell asleep again.

828
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:48,132
- No. I don't think he fell asleep.
- Why not?

829
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:52,587
Last month...

830
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:57,028
Oh, boys, it's so hard
to say a thing like this.

831
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,532
I was looking for a fuse, the lights
blew out, I went down in the cellar.

832
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:05,251
Behind the fuse box,
it happened to fall out,

833
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:09,012
was this length of rubber pipe,
just short.

834
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:10,571
No kidding.

835
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:12,811
There was an attachment
on the end of it.

836
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:16,067
I knew right away, and sure enough.

837
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:19,972
On the bottom of the hot water heater
there's a new nipple on the gas pipe.

838
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:23,307
- Thatjerk.
- Did you have it taken off?

839
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,627
I'm ashamed to.

840
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:29,588
How can I mention it to him?

841
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:32,451
Every day I go down

842
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:35,572
and I take away
that little rubber pipe.

843
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:39,252
But when he comes home
I put it back where it was.

844
00:45:41,412 --> 00:45:43,587
How can I insult him that way?

845
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:48,132
It sounds so silly and old-fashioned,
but I tell you,

846
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,988
he's put his whole life into you.

847
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:54,347
And you've turned your backs on him.

848
00:45:55,972 --> 00:45:59,252
Biff, his life is in your hands.

849
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:03,548
I feel like a damn fool.

850
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:05,931
All right.

851
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:08,467
All right.

852
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:13,892
It's settled now.
I've been remiss, I know that.

853
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:18,012
But now I'll stay and I swear to you,
Mama, I'll apply myself.

854
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:21,372
It's just that, see,
I don't fit in business.

855
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:24,252
Not that I won't try.
I'll try and I'll make good.

856
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:27,172
The trouble was,
you never tried to please people.

857
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,611
It's like when you worked
for Bob Harrison.

858
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:31,251
He said you were tops.

859
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:35,252
Then you go and do some damn fool thing
like whistling songs in the elevator.

860
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,051
So what? I like to whistle.

861
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:39,852
You don't raise a guy
to a responsible job who whistles.

862
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,411
Don't argue about it.

863
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,611
You'd go for a swim
in the middle of the day.

864
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:46,492
You don't take off?
You run off sometimes, on a nice day.

865
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:48,811
- Sure, but I cover myself.
- Oh, boys.

866
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:50,171
I'll tell you something.

867
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:52,932
In the business world
some of them think you're crazy.

868
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:56,932
- Screw the business world.
- Right. Great. But cover yourself.

869
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:59,531
I don't care!
They've laughed at Dad for years.

870
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:02,772
You know why? Because we don't belong
in this nuthouse of a city.

871
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:06,772
We should be mixing cement somewhere
on some open plain, or carpenters.

872
00:47:06,852 --> 00:47:08,811
A carpenter's allowed to whistle.

873
00:47:08,812 --> 00:47:11,812
Even your grandfather was better
than a carpenter.

874
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:14,468
You never grew up.

875
00:47:15,052 --> 00:47:18,132
Bernard does not whistle
in the elevator, I assure you.

876
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,652
- I bet you do.
- I never whistled in an elevator.

877
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:28,331
And who in the business world
thinks I'm crazy, hmm?

878
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:31,332
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't make a thing out of it.

879
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:34,652
Go back to the West.
Be a carpenter or a cowboy.

880
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:37,251
- Enjoy yourself.
- He was just saying things.

881
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:38,971
- I heard what he said.
- Come on.

882
00:47:38,972 --> 00:47:40,530
They laugh at me, huh?

883
00:47:40,531 --> 00:47:42,531
Go to Filene's, go to the Hub,

884
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:45,532
go to Slattery's, Boston
and call out the name Willy Loman.

885
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,452
- See what happens. Big shot. Big.
- All right, Pop.

886
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,627
All right.

887
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,450
Why do you always insult me?

888
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:01,331
Dad, I didn't say a word.

889
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:04,172
- Did I say a word?
- He didn't say anything, Willy.

890
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:05,770
No.

891
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:08,492
- All right, good night.
- Willy! He's decided...

892
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:12,292
If you get tired hanging around
tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up.

893
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,051
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

894
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:16,691
He's gonna see Bill Oliver, Pop.

895
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:18,867
Oliver?

896
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:21,971
For what?

897
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:25,572
Well, he always said he'd stake me
and I'd like to go into business,

898
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:27,411
so maybe I'll take him up on it.

899
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:30,212
- Isn't that wonderful?
- What's wonderful about it?

900
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,572
There's 50 men in the city of New York
that would stake him.

901
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:36,692
- Sporting goods?
- I guess so.

902
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:39,852
- I know something about it.
- He knows something about it!

903
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:44,332
You know sporting goods
better than Spalding, for God's sake.

904
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:47,731
- How much is he giving you?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.

905
00:48:47,812 --> 00:48:51,932
- Then what are you talking about?
- All I said was I was gonna go see him.

906
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,611
- You're counting your chickens again.
- Jesus.

907
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:57,652
- Don't curse in this house.
- Since when did you get so clean?

908
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:00,972
Don't use that language to me.
I won't have it!

909
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:05,563
I got an idea, a feasible idea. Let's
talk this over. Let's talk sense.

910
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:10,259
When I was in Florida last time I thought
of a great idea to sell sporting goods.

911
00:49:10,452 --> 00:49:13,739
It just came back to me.
We have a line, the Loman line.

912
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,531
- We put on a couple of exhibitions.
- That's an idea. - Wait!

913
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:20,291
We form two basketball teams,
two water polo teams.

914
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:23,131
We play each other.
It's a million dollars of publicity.

915
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,730
Two brothers, see?
The Loman brothers.

916
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:29,451
- We could sell sporting goods.
- That is a one million dollar idea.

917
00:49:29,612 --> 00:49:31,210
Marvellous.

918
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,571
I'm in great shape
as far as that's concerned.

919
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:37,012
It wouldn't be like a business at all.
We'd be out playing ball again.

920
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:40,531
- That's what I was talking about.
- You won't get fed up. It'd be family.

921
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:44,892
Lick the world. You guys together could
absolutely lick the civilised world.

922
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:47,491
I'll see Oliver.
If we could work that out...

923
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:50,652
- I think everything is...
- Stop interrupting!

924
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,971
Don't wear a sports jacket and slacks.

925
00:49:52,972 --> 00:49:55,932
A business suit
and talk as little as possible.

926
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:58,650
- And don't crack any jokes.
- Hey, he did like me.

927
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,891
- He always liked me.
- Oh, he loved you.

928
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:02,770
Will you stop!

929
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:05,732
Walk in very serious.
You're not applying for a boy's job.

930
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,732
Money is to pass.
Be quiet, fine and serious.

931
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:11,571
Everybody likes a kidder
but nobody lends them money.

932
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:14,492
- I'll try to get some myself.
- I see great things for you.

933
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:18,052
I think your troubles are over.
Start big, you'll end big. Ask for 15.

934
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,770
How much you gonna ask for?

935
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:22,530
- Gee, I don't...
- Don't say gee. Gee is a boy's word.

936
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:25,371
A man walking in for $15,000
does not say "gee".

937
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:27,491
- Ten would be top.
- Don't be so modest.

938
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,252
You always start it too low.
Walk in with a big laugh.

939
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,572
Start off with a couple of your
good stories to lighten things up.

940
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:36,291
It's not what you say
but how you say it,

941
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:38,731
because personality always wins the day.

942
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:41,571
- Oliver always thought...
- Will you let me talk!

943
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:43,451
Dad, stop yelling at her.

944
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,810
I was talking, wasrt I?

945
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:48,331
I just don't like you
yelling at her all the time.

946
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:50,811
- I'm telling you.
- You taking over this house?

947
00:50:50,812 --> 00:50:53,972
- Willy, he didn't mean...
- Don't take his side all the time!

948
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,707
Stop yelling at her.

949
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:23,091
Give my best to Bill Oliver.

950
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:31,698
- He may remember me.
- Why did you have to start that?

951
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:35,532
Did you see how sweet he was
as soon as you talked hopefully?

952
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:40,299
Go up.
Say good night to him.

953
00:51:40,492 --> 00:51:43,699
- Don't let him go to bed that way.
- Biff, let's buck him up.

954
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:48,346
Please, dear.
It takes so little to make him happy.

955
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:51,602
Come.

956
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:56,171
Your pyjamas are hanging
in the bathroom, Willy.

957
00:51:56,252 --> 00:51:57,611
What a woman.

958
00:51:57,612 --> 00:52:00,931
They broke the mould when they made her.
You know that, Biff?

959
00:52:01,107 --> 00:52:03,666
He's off salary.

960
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,866
My god, working on commission.

961
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:08,306
Let's face it.
He's no hotshot selling man.

962
00:52:08,307 --> 00:52:11,066
Sometimes you gotta admit
he's a sweet personality.

963
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:13,706
Lend me ten bucks.
I'm gonna buy some new ties.

964
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:16,947
I'll take you to a place I know.
Wear one of my striped shirts.

965
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:20,068
Mom got so gray.
She got awful old.

966
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:25,187
I'm gonna go in and see Oliver tomorrow
and I'm gonna knock him...

967
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,826
Come on up and tell Dad.
Let's give him a whirl.

968
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:30,426
With ten thousand bucks... boy.

969
00:52:30,427 --> 00:52:33,107
That's the first time
I've heard the old confidence.

970
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:37,187
You're gonna live with me, kid,
and I'm telling you, any babe you want.

971
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,306
You say the word.

972
00:52:39,307 --> 00:52:42,027
Can you do something about the shower?
It drips.

973
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:46,147
Oh, all of a sudden
everything falls to pieces.

974
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:49,507
That damn plumbing.
They ought to be sued, those people.

975
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:53,227
- Hardly finished putting it in...
- I'm wondering if Oliver will remember.

976
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:57,555
- You think he might? -Remember him?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

977
00:52:57,747 --> 00:53:00,466
If he'd have stayed with Oliver,
he'd be on top now.

978
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:05,715
Wait till Oliver gets a look at him. You
don't know the average calibre anymore.

979
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:09,627
The average young man today
has got a calibre of zero.

980
00:53:09,707 --> 00:53:11,946
The greatest thing for him
was to bum up...

981
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:13,882
Willy.

982
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:23,747
- Glad to hear it, boy.
- He wanted to say good night to you.

983
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:26,802
Oh, yeah, you knock them dead, boy.

984
00:53:28,587 --> 00:53:31,403
What do you want to tell me?

985
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,266
Take it easy, Pop, good night.

986
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:42,347
If anything falls off the desk
while you're talking to him,

987
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,146
like a package or something,
don't you pick it up.

988
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:48,427
- They have office boys.
- I'll make a big breakfast.

989
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:53,827
Will you let me finish, hmm?

990
00:53:54,787 --> 00:53:57,627
Tell him you were in business
in the West, not farm work.

991
00:53:57,707 --> 00:54:00,747
- All right, Dad. I will.
- I think everything's gonna be...

992
00:54:03,267 --> 00:54:07,227
And don't undersell yourself.
No less than $15,000.

993
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:10,627
- OK. Good night, Mom.
- Because you got a greatness in you.

994
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:12,762
Biff!

995
00:54:15,787 --> 00:54:18,322
Remember that.

996
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:22,234
- You got all kinds of greatness.
- Sleep well, darling.

997
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:26,346
- I'm gonna get married, Mom. I wanted
to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear.

998
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:29,107
I just wanted to tell you.

999
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,722
Keep up the good work.

1000
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:51,107
Do you remember that Ebbets Field
game, the championship of the city?

1001
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:52,666
Hmm?

1002
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,122
Just rest, dear.

1003
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:58,346
- Should I sing to you?
- Yeah, you sing to me.

1004
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:02,627
You know, when that team came out,
he was the tallest.

1005
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:04,266
You remember?

1006
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:07,707
- All in gold.
- Oh, like a young god.

1007
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:14,475
Hercules, something like that. And
the sun, the sun all around him.

1008
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:18,442
Remember how he waved to me?

1009
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:23,811
Right from the field, with the representatives
from three colleges standing by,

1010
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:27,266
and the buyers I brought.

1011
00:55:27,347 --> 00:55:29,786
Oh, the cheers when he came out.

1012
00:55:29,787 --> 00:55:32,842
Loman! Loman!

1013
00:55:33,827 --> 00:55:36,787
Loman!

1014
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:45,722
God Almighty, he'll be great yet.

1015
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:52,187
A star like that, magnificent,

1016
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:55,243
can never really fade away.

1017
00:56:00,547 --> 00:56:03,122
- Oh, boy.
- Willy?

1018
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,922
Dear?

1019
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:10,402
What has he got against you?

1020
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:15,963
I'm so tired. Don't talk anymore.

1021
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:20,746
Will you ask Howard
if he'll let you work in New York?

1022
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:23,987
First thing in the morning.
Everything will be all right.

1023
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:28,802
Gee.

1024
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:32,746
Look at the moon
moving between the buildings.

1025
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:42,066
Oh, oh, wonderful coffee!

1026
00:57:42,147 --> 00:57:44,506
- A meal in itself.
- Can I make you some eggs?

1027
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:48,265
- Take a breath.
- You look so rested, dear.

1028
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:50,915
I slept like a dead one.
First time in months.

1029
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:53,706
Imagine sleeping till 10
on a Tuesday morning.

1030
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:57,874
- Boys left nice and early? - They
were out of here by 8:00. - Good work.

1031
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:00,386
It was thrilling, them leaving together.

1032
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:03,539
I cannot get over the smell
of shaving lotion in this house.

1033
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:07,328
Biff was very changed this morning.
His attitude seemed to be hopeful.

1034
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:10,929
- He couldn't wait to see Oliver.
- He's heading for a change.

1035
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:14,186
- Certain men take longer to get...
- Solidified.

1036
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:16,762
- How did he dress?
- His blue suit.

1037
00:58:17,475 --> 00:58:20,435
He looked so handsome.
He could be anything in that suit.

1038
00:58:20,515 --> 00:58:23,074
Boy, there's no question.
No question at all.

1039
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,874
Gee, on the way home tonight
I'd like to buy some seeds.

1040
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:30,434
Wonderful, but not enough sun
gets back there. Nothing will grow.

1041
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:33,234
Before it's over
we'll get a place in the country,

1042
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,994
- I'll raise vegetables, chickens.
- You'll do it.

1043
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:38,914
They'll get married and visit.
I'll build a guest house.

1044
00:58:38,995 --> 00:58:42,715
I've got so many tools. All I'd need
would be lumber and peace of mind.

1045
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:45,274
- I sewed the liner.
- I could build two houses

1046
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,274
- so they'd both come.
- Yes.

1047
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:51,115
- He decide how much he's gonna ask for?
- He didn't, but I imagine ten.

1048
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:55,155
Fifteen thousand.
You're gonna talk to Howard today?

1049
00:58:55,234 --> 00:58:59,354
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll put it to him straight and simple.

1050
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,195
- He'll have to take me off the road.
- Ask for a little advance.

1051
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:05,274
We've got the insurance premium.
It's the grace period.

1052
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:08,595
It's $108.68 because
we're a little short this month.

1053
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:11,313
- Why are we short?
- You had the job done on the car.

1054
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,154
- That damn Studebaker.
- One more payment on the refrigerator.

1055
00:59:14,235 --> 00:59:16,554
- Itjust broke again.
- It's old, dear.

1056
00:59:16,555 --> 00:59:19,154
We should have bought
a well advertised machine.

1057
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,394
Charley bought a General Electric.
It's 20 years old and it's good.

1058
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:26,594
- Willy, please! - Whoever heard
of a Hastings refrigerator?

1059
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:30,715
Once in my life I'd like to buy
something outright before it's broken.

1060
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:34,474
I am always in a race with the junkyard.
I just finished paying for the car.

1061
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:37,395
It's on its last legs.
The refrigerator consumes belts.

1062
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,273
- Willy.
- They time those things!

1063
00:59:39,274 --> 00:59:42,834
They time them so when you finally
pay for them they're used up.

1064
00:59:42,915 --> 00:59:45,714
All told, about 200 dollars
would carry us dear,

1065
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:49,635
but that includes the last payment
on the mortgage.

1066
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:53,595
When we've made that payment, Willy,
the house belongs to us.

1067
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,194
- That's 25 years.
- Biff was nine when we bought it.

1068
00:59:57,195 --> 01:00:02,075
Well, that's a great thing,
to weather a 25 year mortgage.

1069
01:00:02,154 --> 01:00:04,898
It's an accomplishment.

1070
01:00:05,714 --> 01:00:10,098
All the cement, the lumber. The
reconstruction I put in this house.

1071
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:13,434
There ain't a crack
to be found in it anymore.

1072
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:16,074
- Well, it served its purpose.
- What purpose?

1073
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:19,074
Some stranger will come along,
move in, and that's that.

1074
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:23,515
If only Biff would take this house
and raise a family.

1075
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:29,394
- Good-bye. I'm late.
- I forgot to tell you.

1076
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:33,554
You're supposed to meet them for dinner.
Frank's Chop House, near Sixth Avenue.

1077
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,513
Is that so? How about you?

1078
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:38,435
Just the three of you.
They are gonna blow you to a big meal.

1079
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:41,194
- Who thought of that?
- Biff came to me this morning.

1080
01:00:41,195 --> 01:00:45,266
He said, "Tell Dad we're gonna blow
him to a big meal. Be there 6:00".

1081
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,706
You and your two boys
are gonna have dinner.

1082
01:00:47,707 --> 01:00:50,425
- Gee whiz, that's really something.
- Yeah.

1083
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:52,826
I'm gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid.

1084
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:56,227
I'll get an advance
and I'll come home with a New York job!

1085
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:59,026
- I'm gonna do it!
- That's the spirit, Willy!

1086
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:01,786
I will never get behind the wheel
the rest of my life!

1087
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,466
It's changing, Willy.
I can feel it changing.

1088
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:06,883
- Beyond a question.
- Oh!

1089
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:09,146
- You got your glasses?
- Yeah.

1090
01:01:09,147 --> 01:01:12,147
And your handkerchief?
And your saccharine?

1091
01:01:12,267 --> 01:01:15,106
- And my saccharine.
- Be careful on the subway stairs.

1092
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:19,427
Will you stop mending stockings?
It gets me nervous. I can't tell you.

1093
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:21,866
And don't forget,
Frank's Chop House.

1094
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:26,418
- Maybe beets would grow out there.
- Oh, Willy, you tried so many times.

1095
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:29,578
- Yeah, well, don't work hard.
- Now, you be careful.

1096
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:32,194
Come on, give me a little something.

1097
01:01:34,218 --> 01:01:37,394
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1098
01:01:50,394 --> 01:01:53,210
- Psst.
- Hello, Willy.

1099
01:01:53,403 --> 01:01:57,202
- I'd like to talk to you, Howard.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

1100
01:01:57,322 --> 01:02:00,002
- What's that?
- Didrt you ever see one of these?

1101
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:02,521
- It's a wire recorder.
- Can we talk a minute?

1102
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:05,241
It records things.
I just got delivery yesterday.

1103
01:02:05,242 --> 01:02:07,721
It's the most terrific machine
I ever saw in my life.

1104
01:02:07,722 --> 01:02:09,761
- I was up all night with it.
- What do you do?

1105
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:12,482
I bought it for dictation
but you can do anything with it.

1106
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:15,363
Listen to this. I had it home.
Listen to what I picked up.

1107
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:18,378
The first one is my daughter.
Get this.

1108
01:02:20,723 --> 01:02:22,858
Listen to that kid whistle.

1109
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:26,641
That is lifelike, isn't it?

1110
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,963
- Seven years old. Get that tone.
- I'd like to ask a little favour.

1111
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,241
It's your turn now, Daddy.

1112
01:02:33,242 --> 01:02:36,058
She's crazy for me.

1113
01:02:37,802 --> 01:02:41,026
- That's me. - You're very
good. - Now this is my son.

1114
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:44,042
The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.

1115
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:48,426
The capital of California is Sacramento.
- Five years old.

1116
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:51,242
He'll make an announcer someday.

1117
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:54,522
- The capital of Colorado...
- That is alphabetical order.

1118
01:02:54,602 --> 01:02:57,241
- The maid kicked the plug.
- That certainly is...

1119
01:02:57,242 --> 01:02:58,641
Shh! For God's sake.

1120
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:01,522
It is 9:00 so I have to go to sleep.

1121
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:04,002
- It really is...
- Wait. The next is my wife.

1122
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:06,923
- Talk!
- I can't think of anything.

1123
01:03:07,002 --> 01:03:10,962
- It's time.
- Hello. Howard, I can't talk.

1124
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:14,282
- That was my wife.
- That is a wonderful machine. Can we...

1125
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:19,123
I'm gonna take my camera and my bandsaw
and all my hobbies and out they go.

1126
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:23,202
- This is the most fascinating
relaxation ever. - I think I'll get one.

1127
01:03:23,202 --> 01:03:25,722
They're a hundred and a half.
You can't do without it.

1128
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:29,881
Supposing you want to hear Jack Benny,
see. But you can't be home at that hour.

1129
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:33,162
You tell the maid to turn the radio on
when Jack Benny comes on,

1130
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,842
and this automatically comes on
with the radio.

1131
01:03:35,843 --> 01:03:39,283
- When you come home...
- You come home any time you like.

1132
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:42,163
You get yourself a Coke,
sit down, throw the switch,

1133
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:45,122
and there is Jack Benny's programme,
in the middle of the night.

1134
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:48,203
I'm gonna get one,
'cause lots of times I'm on the road,

1135
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,961
and I think, "What I must
be missing on the radio".

1136
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:55,282
- Don't you have a radio in the car?
- Yeah. Whoever thinks of turning it on?

1137
01:03:55,362 --> 01:03:58,682
- Arent you supposed to be in Boston?
- That's what I want to talk about.

1138
01:03:58,763 --> 01:04:00,922
- You got a minute?
- What happened?

1139
01:04:00,922 --> 01:04:03,641
- You didn't crack up again, did you?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:04:03,642 --> 01:04:06,201
Oh!

1141
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:09,362
Geez, you got me worried there
for a minute.

1142
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:12,362
- Well, what's the trouble?
- Well, to tell you the truth,

1143
01:04:12,442 --> 01:04:16,202
I've come to the decision
that I'd rather not travel anymore.

1144
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:20,361
- Not travel? Well, what would you do?
- Remember Christmastime at the party

1145
01:04:20,362 --> 01:04:23,001
you said you'd think
of a spot for me here in town?

1146
01:04:23,002 --> 01:04:26,985
- With us? - Sure. - Oh,
yeah, yeah, I remember.

1147
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:29,361
I couldn't think of anything for you.

1148
01:04:29,362 --> 01:04:33,362
I'll tell you, Howard, the kids
are all grown up now, you know.

1149
01:04:33,443 --> 01:04:35,561
I don't need much anymore.

1150
01:04:35,562 --> 01:04:40,562
If I could take home $65 a week
I could swing it.

1151
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:43,322
- Yeah, but Willy...
- I'll tell you why.

1152
01:04:43,323 --> 01:04:46,883
Speaking frankly
between the two of us, you know,

1153
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:49,721
I'm just a little tired.

1154
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:52,785
Oh.
I can understand that, Willy.

1155
01:04:52,882 --> 01:04:55,122
But you're a road man, Willy.

1156
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:58,242
We're a road business.
We've got half a dozen salesmen here.

1157
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:02,946
God knows, Howard,
I never asked a favour of any man,

1158
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:06,482
but I was with the firm when
your father used to carry you in here.

1159
01:05:06,562 --> 01:05:08,282
- I know.
- Your father came to me

1160
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:11,762
the day you were born and asked me
what I thought of the name Howard.

1161
01:05:11,882 --> 01:05:15,642
I appreciate that, Willy,
but there just is no spot here for you.

1162
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:19,642
If I had a spot I would slam you
right in there, but I just don't.

1163
01:05:19,722 --> 01:05:23,482
- All I need is 50 dollars a week.
- Where am I gonna put you, kid?

1164
01:05:23,602 --> 01:05:26,041
It's not a question
of whether I can sell, huh?

1165
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:29,802
No, but it's a business and
everybody's gotta pull his own weight.

1166
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:32,401
- Let me tell you a story.
- Business is business.

1167
01:05:32,402 --> 01:05:36,321
This is definitely business.
Listen. You don't understand this.

1168
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:40,243
When I was a boy, 18, 19,
I was already on the road.

1169
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:43,722
There was a question in my mind
whether selling had a future for me.

1170
01:05:43,842 --> 01:05:46,963
In those days
I had a yearning to go to Alaska.

1171
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,843
There were three gold strikes
in one month in Alaska.

1172
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:52,762
I felt like going out,
just for the ride, you might say.

1173
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:56,362
- You don't say?
- My father lived many years in Alaska.

1174
01:05:56,482 --> 01:05:58,601
He was an adventurous man.

1175
01:05:58,602 --> 01:06:01,562
We got quite a streak of self-reliance
in our family.

1176
01:06:01,642 --> 01:06:04,762
I thought I'd go out with
my older brother, try to locate him,

1177
01:06:04,842 --> 01:06:06,361
maybe settle in the North.

1178
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,497
I was almost decided to go...

1179
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:13,282
...when I met a salesman
in the Parker House.

1180
01:06:13,282 --> 01:06:15,281
His name was Dave Singleman.

1181
01:06:15,282 --> 01:06:19,562
He was 84 years old and
he'd drummed merchandise in 31 states.

1182
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,242
Old Dave would go up to his room,
put on his green velvet slippers,

1183
01:06:24,162 --> 01:06:26,361
pick up the phone and call the buyers.

1184
01:06:26,362 --> 01:06:29,882
Without ever leaving his room
at the age of 84,

1185
01:06:30,002 --> 01:06:32,098
he made his living.

1186
01:06:32,562 --> 01:06:36,802
When I saw that, I realised that selling
was the greatest career a man could want

1187
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:41,002
because what could be more satisfying
than to be able to go at the age of 84

1188
01:06:41,082 --> 01:06:42,921
into 20 or 30 different cities

1189
01:06:42,922 --> 01:06:45,361
and pick up a phone
and be remembered and loved

1190
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:48,057
and helped by many different people.

1191
01:06:49,202 --> 01:06:51,681
You know, when he died...

1192
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:54,241
And by the way, he died
the death of a salesman,

1193
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:57,554
in his green velvet slippers
in the smoker of the New York,

1194
01:06:57,651 --> 01:07:00,081
New Haven and Hartford
going into Boston.

1195
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,809
When he died, hundreds of salesmen
and buyers were at his funeral.

1196
01:07:05,002 --> 01:07:09,202
Things were sad on a lot of trains
for months after that.

1197
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,690
You see, in those days there was
personality in it, Howard.

1198
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:19,322
There was respect and comradeship and...

1199
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:23,529
...and gratitude.
Today it's all cut and dry.

1200
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:27,362
And there's no chance for bringing
friendship to bear or personality.

1201
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,321
You see what I mean.

1202
01:07:29,322 --> 01:07:32,362
- They don't know me anymore.
- That's just the thing, Willy.

1203
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:34,801
If I had 40 dollars a week,
that's all I need.

1204
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:37,441
- I can't take blood from a stone.
- Howard!

1205
01:07:37,442 --> 01:07:40,282
The year Al Smith was nominated
your father came to me...

1206
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,082
I'm talking about your father!

1207
01:07:43,162 --> 01:07:45,521
There were promises made
across this desk!

1208
01:07:45,522 --> 01:07:48,577
You mustnt tell me
that you got people to see!

1209
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:53,825
I put 34 years into this firm,
Howard! Now I can't pay my insurance!

1210
01:07:53,922 --> 01:07:56,481
You can't eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

1211
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:59,057
A man is not a piece of fruit!

1212
01:08:01,602 --> 01:08:03,857
Pay attention.

1213
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:07,857
No, your father...

1214
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:10,680
Howard...

1215
01:08:10,681 --> 01:08:14,042
In 1928 I had a big year.

1216
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:17,897
I averaged 170 dollars a week.

1217
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:20,978
- You never averaged 170 dollars a week.
- No, no, no!

1218
01:08:21,057 --> 01:08:26,297
I averaged 170 dollars a week
in the year 1928!

1219
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:28,616
And your father came to me, Howard,

1220
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:31,418
right across this desk,
put his hand on my shoulder...

1221
01:08:31,497 --> 01:08:35,225
You have to excuse me, Willy!
I have got to see some people.

1222
01:08:35,418 --> 01:08:38,721
Pull yourself together.
I'll be back in a little while.

1223
01:08:43,178 --> 01:08:44,897
Ah, pull myself together!

1224
01:08:44,898 --> 01:08:46,953
What did I say to him?

1225
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:52,673
Oh, my god.

1226
01:08:53,857 --> 01:08:55,953
I was yelling at him.

1227
01:08:57,537 --> 01:09:01,537
Frank, Frank, don't you remember
what you told me that time?

1228
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,576
You put your hand on my shoulder...

1229
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:06,377
The capital of Delaware...

1230
01:09:06,378 --> 01:09:09,353
Oh, Howard!

1231
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,737
Howard!

1232
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:14,577
Howard, Howard, shut it off!

1233
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,336
Shut it off!

1234
01:09:16,337 --> 01:09:19,178
- Look, Willy...
- I gotta get myself some coffee.

1235
01:09:19,258 --> 01:09:21,337
- I'll get coffee.
- Willy, look...

1236
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:25,858
Look, Willy,
you can't go to Boston for us.

1237
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:31,017
- Why can't I go?
- I don't want you to represent us.

1238
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:36,553
I've been meaning to tell you
for a long time now.

1239
01:09:38,218 --> 01:09:42,657
- Howard, are you firing me?
- I think you need a good long rest.

1240
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:46,698
When you feel better come back
and we'll try to work something out.

1241
01:09:46,777 --> 01:09:48,377
I gotta earn money, Howard.

1242
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:51,258
Where are your sons?
Wort your sons give you a hand?

1243
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:53,936
Oh, they're working on a very big deal.

1244
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:55,657
This is no time for false pride.

1245
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,016
Go to your sons
and tell them you're tired.

1246
01:09:58,017 --> 01:09:59,897
You got two great boys there.

1247
01:09:59,898 --> 01:10:02,097
- No question.
- That's that, huh?

1248
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,017
In the meantime. All right.

1249
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:06,696
I'll go to...
I'll go to Boston tomorrow.

1250
01:10:06,697 --> 01:10:08,456
No!

1251
01:10:08,457 --> 01:10:10,393
No.

1252
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:14,336
I can't throw myself on my kids.
I'm not a freeloader.

1253
01:10:14,337 --> 01:10:16,976
- Kid, I am busy this morning.
- Let me go to Boston.

1254
01:10:16,977 --> 01:10:20,193
I have got a line
of people to see this morning.

1255
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:29,416
- Sit down. Sit.
- What?

1256
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:31,273
Oh.

1257
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:41,337
Take five minutes
and pull yourself together.

1258
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:44,898
And then go home, will you?

1259
01:10:44,978 --> 01:10:47,153
I need the office.

1260
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:52,817
Whenever you can this week,
drop off the samples.

1261
01:10:52,818 --> 01:10:56,538
You'll feel better, Willy,
and then come back. We'll talk.

1262
01:10:59,457 --> 01:11:02,377
Pull yourself together, kid.
There's people outside.

1263
01:11:15,058 --> 01:11:18,017
Oh, Ben!

1264
01:11:19,418 --> 01:11:22,673
How did you do it, huh?

1265
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:25,816
What's the answer?

1266
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:28,256
Did you wind up the Alaska deal already?

1267
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:32,458
Doesrt take much time if you know what
you're doing. I wanted to say good-bye.

1268
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,816
- I gotta talk to you.
- I haven't the time.

1269
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:37,257
Nothing's working out.
I don't know what to do.

1270
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:41,057
I bought timberland in Alaska. I need
a man to look after things for me.

1271
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:42,656
God, timberland!

1272
01:11:42,657 --> 01:11:45,057
Me and my boys and those grand outdoors!

1273
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:46,857
A new continent on your doorstep.

1274
01:11:46,858 --> 01:11:50,858
Get out of these cities. They're full of
talk, time payments and courts of law.

1275
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:54,138
- You can fight for a fortune up there.
- Linda! Linda!

1276
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:56,016
- Linda.
- You're back.

1277
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,576
- I haven't much time.
- Wait.

1278
01:11:57,577 --> 01:11:59,696
He's got a proposition for me in Alaska.

1279
01:11:59,697 --> 01:12:02,657
- But you've got a job here.
- But in Alaska, kid, I could...

1280
01:12:02,737 --> 01:12:05,537
- You are doing well enough.
- Enough for what, dear?

1281
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:09,498
Don't say things like that to him.
Enough to be happy right here, now.

1282
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:13,537
Why must everyone conquer the world?
You're well-liked, the boys love you.

1283
01:12:13,657 --> 01:12:17,097
The other day old man Wagner told him
he'll be a member of the firm.

1284
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:20,417
- Didn't he, Willy?
- I'm building something with this firm.

1285
01:12:20,497 --> 01:12:23,257
If a man is building
he must be on the right track.

1286
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:27,417
- What are you building? Where is it?
- That's true, Linda, there's nothing.

1287
01:12:27,537 --> 01:12:30,458
Why, there's a man 84 years old, Willy.

1288
01:12:30,537 --> 01:12:32,416
That's right, Ben, that's right!

1289
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:35,297
When I look at that man
I say what's there to worry about?

1290
01:12:35,337 --> 01:12:38,457
All he has to do is go into any city,
pick up a phone

1291
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:40,497
and he's making his living. Know why?

1292
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:42,576
- I gotta go.
- Oh, look at this boy.

1293
01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:46,378
Without a penny to his name, three
great universities are begging for him.

1294
01:12:46,457 --> 01:12:50,921
From there the sky's the limit! It's
not what you do, Ben, it's who you know!

1295
01:12:51,017 --> 01:12:54,177
And a smile on your face.
It's contacts, Ben, contacts!

1296
01:12:54,257 --> 01:12:58,417
The whole wealth of Alaska passing over
the lunch table of the Commodore Hotel.

1297
01:12:58,537 --> 01:13:01,256
And that's the wonder,
the wonder of this country,

1298
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:05,497
that a man can end with diamonds
on the basis of being liked.

1299
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:08,657
That's why, when you get
on that field today, it's important,

1300
01:13:08,738 --> 01:13:12,177
'cause thousands of people
will be rooting for you, loving you.

1301
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:16,177
When he walks into a business office,
his name will sound out like a bell,

1302
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:19,017
and all the doors will open to him.
I seen it, Ben.

1303
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:22,897
I seen it a thousand times. You can't
feel it in your hands, but it's there.

1304
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:25,136
- Good-bye.
- Don't you think I'm right?

1305
01:13:25,137 --> 01:13:28,617
- I value your advice.
- A new continent at your doorstep.

1306
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:31,520
You could walk out rich.

1307
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:33,440
Rich!

1308
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:37,161
We're gonna do a hit, Ben, you hear me?
We're gonna do a hit!

1309
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:39,159
Gee, I was afraid you left already.

1310
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,920
- What time is it?
- Ten past one.

1311
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:44,081
Oh, come on everybody,
Ebbets Field, next stop.

1312
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:47,081
- Where's the pennants?
- Did you pack fresh underwear?

1313
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:50,279
- I want to go. - I'm
carrying your helmet. - I am.

1314
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,040
You promised me.
How am I gonna get in the locker room?

1315
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,880
Let him carry the shoulder guards.

1316
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,721
Can I? I told everybody
I was gonna be in the locker room.

1317
01:13:57,761 --> 01:14:00,481
- It's the Clubhouse.
- I meant the Clubhouse.

1318
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:05,041
- Let him carry the shoulder guards.
- Stay close to us.

1319
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:08,928
- Wave when Biff comes out on the
field! You set, boy? - Ready to go, Pop.

1320
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:11,840
- Every muscle is ready.
- You realise what this means.

1321
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:13,719
You're coming home this afternoon

1322
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,440
captain of the All-Scholastic
Championship Team

1323
01:14:16,441 --> 01:14:19,961
- of the city of New York.
- That's right, Pop, and remember,

1324
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,121
when I take off my helmet,
that touchdowrs for you.

1325
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,561
Let's go over.
I got no room for you, Charley.

1326
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:32,239
- Room for what?
- In the car.

1327
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,719
Going for a ride?
I want to shoot some casino.

1328
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,680
Don't you realise what today is?

1329
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:40,080
Oh, he knows, Willy.
He's just kidding you.

1330
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:44,024
That's nothing to kid about. I'm
not kidding, Linda. What's going on?

1331
01:14:44,121 --> 01:14:46,519
He is playing at Ebbets Field today.

1332
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,920
- Baseball in this weather?
- Don't talk to him. We're late.

1333
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:51,879
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What?

1334
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,841
Don't you listen to the radio?
Ebbets Field just blew up.

1335
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:56,960
You go to hell! Everybody in?

1336
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,800
Knock a homer, Biff.
Knock a homer!

1337
01:14:58,801 --> 01:15:00,960
I don't think that was funny, Charley.

1338
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:04,080
Did you hear me, huh?
This is the greatest day in his life.

1339
01:15:04,161 --> 01:15:05,559
When are you gonna grow up?

1340
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,039
When this game is over
you won't be laughing anymore.

1341
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,841
They'll be calling him
another Red Grange, 25,000 a year.

1342
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,240
- That so?
- Yeah!

1343
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,520
- Wait a minute, Willy. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1344
01:15:14,521 --> 01:15:17,561
But tell me something.
Who is Red Grange?

1345
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,160
Put up your hands.
Put up your hands, come on.

1346
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:23,560
Put up your hands. Who do you think
you are, better than everybody?

1347
01:15:23,641 --> 01:15:26,400
Put up your hands! Put up your hands!

1348
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:29,201
Put up your hands.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1349
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,961
You don't know everything,
you big ignorant stupid...

1350
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:35,801
Put up your hands.
What are you walking away for?

1351
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,401
Don't walk away. You gonna say
something to me, say it to my face.

1352
01:15:39,672 --> 01:15:41,671
I know you laugh at me behind my back.

1353
01:15:41,672 --> 01:15:44,953
You'll be laughing out of the other
side of your face after this game.

1354
01:15:45,032 --> 01:15:47,872
The woods are burning.
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1355
01:15:47,953 --> 01:15:52,032
Eighty thousand people!
Right between the goal posts.

1356
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:55,152
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1357
01:15:55,233 --> 01:15:58,272
Hello, baby! Touchdown!

1358
01:15:58,352 --> 01:16:00,511
Touchdown! Ah, Jenny.

1359
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:03,568
Jenny, good to see you.
How are you?

1360
01:16:03,912 --> 01:16:06,912
- Working? Or still honest?
- Fine.

1361
01:16:06,992 --> 01:16:09,753
- How you been feeling?
- Not much any more.

1362
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:13,088
- Oh!
- Hello, Uncle Willy.

1363
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:17,608
Bernard.

1364
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,671
- Look who's here.
- How are you?

1365
01:16:20,672 --> 01:16:23,512
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by to see Pop.

1366
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:26,952
To get off my feet till my train leaves.
I'm going to Washington.

1367
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:29,311
- Is he in?
- He's with the accountant.

1368
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:32,799
Sit down. What are you
gonna do in Washington?

1369
01:16:32,992 --> 01:16:37,039
- Just a case I've got there.
- That so? You gonna play tennis there?

1370
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:39,591
I'm staying with a friend
who's got a court.

1371
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:42,351
You don't say.
Their own tennis court?

1372
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:45,072
- Those are fine people, I bet.
- They're very nice.

1373
01:16:45,153 --> 01:16:47,151
- Dad tells me Biff's in town.
- Yeah.

1374
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:50,432
Biff's in. He's working
on a very big deal, Bernard.

1375
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:54,535
- What's Biff doing? - He's been
doing very big things in the West,

1376
01:16:54,632 --> 01:16:57,231
but he decided
to establish himself here.

1377
01:16:57,232 --> 01:17:00,048
Very big. We're having dinner.

1378
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:04,103
Did I hear your wife had a boy?

1379
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:06,703
That's right. Our second.

1380
01:17:06,704 --> 01:17:08,759
Two boys.

1381
01:17:09,304 --> 01:17:12,184
- What do you know?
- You still with the old firm, Willy?

1382
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:18,384
I'm overjoyed to see how
you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed.

1383
01:17:18,464 --> 01:17:20,703
It's an encouraging thing to see.

1384
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:25,873
A young man really... really...

1385
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:30,255
Ah, it looks very good for Biff.
Very good.

1386
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:42,656
- Bernard. - What is it, Willy?
- What... What's the secret?

1387
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,792
- What secret?
- How did you...?

1388
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,752
- Why didn't he ever catch on?
- Willy, I wouldn't know that.

1389
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:50,471
Oh, you were his friend,
his boyhood friend.

1390
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:52,472
It's something I don't understand.

1391
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:54,991
His life ended
after that Ebbets Field game.

1392
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:57,751
From the age of 17
nothing good ever happened to him.

1393
01:17:57,752 --> 01:18:02,072
- He never trained himself for anything.
- He took correspondence courses.

1394
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:05,712
Radio mechanics, television...
He never made the slightest mark.

1395
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:08,191
- Do you want to talk candidly?
- Bernard.

1396
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:12,233
I regard you as a very brilliant man.
Bernard, I value your advice.

1397
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:14,791
The hell with advice.
I couldn't advise you.

1398
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:17,471
There's one thing
I have always wanted to ask you.

1399
01:18:17,472 --> 01:18:20,672
When he was supposed to graduate
and the teacher flunked him...

1400
01:18:20,752 --> 01:18:22,111
Ruined his life.

1401
01:18:22,112 --> 01:18:25,232
All he had to do was go
to summer school, make up that subject.

1402
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:28,352
- That's right. That's right!
- Did you tell him not to go?

1403
01:18:28,432 --> 01:18:31,152
Me? I begged him to go.
I ordered him to go.

1404
01:18:31,152 --> 01:18:33,671
- Why wouldn't he go?
- Why? Why, Bernard!

1405
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:36,792
That questiors been trailing me
like a ghost for 15 years.

1406
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:41,368
He flunked the subject and he laid down
and died like a hammer hit him.

1407
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,319
Let me talk to you, Bernard.
I got nobody to talk to.

1408
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,424
It wasn't my fault. It keeps going
around in my head, maybe I did something.

1409
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,000
I got nothing to give him.

1410
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,359
Don't take it so hard.

1411
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,736
Why did he lay down?

1412
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
- What is the story there?
- Willy...

1413
01:18:57,001 --> 01:18:58,920
You're his friend. Come on.

1414
01:18:58,921 --> 01:19:02,840
Willy, I remember it was June.
Our grades came out. He'd flunked math.

1415
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,199
That son of a bitch ruined his life.

1416
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,120
Then Biff just got very angry and
he was ready to enrol in summer school.

1417
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,479
- He was?
- He wasn't beaten by it at all.

1418
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,199
But then, Willy, see...

1419
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,759
What?

1420
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,439
He disappeared from the block
for almost a month.

1421
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,720
I got the idea that he'd gone
up to New England to see you.

1422
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,680
Did he ever talk with you then?

1423
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,359
- Willy?
- Yeah.

1424
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,735
Yeah.

1425
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,039
He came to Boston.
What about it?

1426
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,440
Well, it's just
that when he came back...

1427
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,160
I'll never forget this.

1428
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,400
It always mystifies me
because I thought so well of Biff.

1429
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,936
I loved him, Willy, you know.

1430
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,919
He came back after that month
and took his sneakers.

1431
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,280
Remember those sneakers with the
University of Virginia on them?

1432
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,456
He was so proud of them.
Wore them every day.

1433
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,360
He took them down into the cellar,
burned them up in the furnace.

1434
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,855
We had a fistfight.

1435
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,799
It lasted at least half an hour,
just the two of us,

1436
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,800
punching each other down in the cellar,
crying right through it.

1437
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,440
I often thought how strange it was
that I knew he'd given up his life.

1438
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,216
What happened in Boston, Willy?

1439
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,880
I just bring it up because you asked me.

1440
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,959
What's that got to do with it?

1441
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,320
- Don't get sore.
- What are you trying to do, blame me?

1442
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,919
If a boy lays down is that my fault?

1443
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,920
- Don't take it...
- Don't you talk to me that way.

1444
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,319
What does that mean,
huh, what happened?

1445
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,352
Hey!

1446
01:20:45,136 --> 01:20:47,856
- You're gonna miss that train.
- Yeah, I'm going.

1447
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:55,495
Good-bye, Willy.

1448
01:20:55,496 --> 01:21:00,056
- Don't worry about it. If at first you
don't succeed... - Yes, I believe in that.

1449
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:03,296
Sometimes, Willy, it's better for a man
just to walk away.

1450
01:21:03,415 --> 01:21:05,695
- Walk away?
- That's right.

1451
01:21:05,696 --> 01:21:08,391
What if you can't walk away?

1452
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:12,078
I guess that's when it's tough.

1453
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,031
Good-bye, Willy.

1454
01:21:18,816 --> 01:21:20,575
Good-bye, boy.

1455
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:24,255
How do you like this kid?
Gonna argue a case in the Supreme Court.

1456
01:21:24,336 --> 01:21:27,071
- Pop!
- No.

1457
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,895
- The Supreme Court?
- I gotta run.

1458
01:21:29,895 --> 01:21:32,551
- Bye, Dad.
- Knock 'em dead, Bernard.

1459
01:21:36,335 --> 01:21:39,055
The Supreme Court.

1460
01:21:39,336 --> 01:21:41,015
And he didn't even mention it?

1461
01:21:41,016 --> 01:21:43,951
He don't have to.
He's gonna do it.

1462
01:21:44,536 --> 01:21:48,576
And you never told him what to do.
You never took any interest in him.

1463
01:21:48,656 --> 01:21:51,736
My salvation is that I never
took any interest in anything.

1464
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:56,560
Here's some money, 50 dollars.
I got an accountant inside.

1465
01:21:57,296 --> 01:21:59,751
Uh, Charley, look, uh...

1466
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:04,696
I got my insurance to pay.
If you could manage it, I...

1467
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:08,895
I need 110 dollars.

1468
01:22:08,896 --> 01:22:11,855
- I'd draw from my bank, but...
- Sit down, Willy.

1469
01:22:11,975 --> 01:22:14,375
I'm keeping an account of everything.

1470
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:16,855
- Listen to me.
- I'll pay every penny back.

1471
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:20,536
- I want you to know I appreciate...
- What's going on inside your head?

1472
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:23,135
- Why? I'm simply...
- I offered you a job.

1473
01:22:23,136 --> 01:22:26,375
You can make 50 dollars a week
and I won't send you on the road.

1474
01:22:26,456 --> 01:22:28,711
- I got a job.
- Without pay?

1475
01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:32,551
What kind of a job is a job without pay?

1476
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:37,374
Now, look, kid. Enough is enough.

1477
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:40,095
I'm no genius, but I know
when I'm being insulted.

1478
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:42,615
- Insulted?
- Why don't you want to work for me?

1479
01:22:42,616 --> 01:22:44,735
What does it matter with you?
I got a job.

1480
01:22:44,736 --> 01:22:47,831
What do you walk in here every week for?

1481
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:55,936
Well, if... if you don't
want me to walk in here...

1482
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:59,056
- I am offering you a job.
- I don't want your job.

1483
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:02,095
When the hell are you gonna grow up?

1484
01:23:02,536 --> 01:23:05,975
You big ignoramus! If you say
that to me again I'll rap you one.

1485
01:23:05,976 --> 01:23:09,120
I don't care how big...
...how big you are.

1486
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:22,936
- How much do you need, Willy?
- Ah, Charley, I'm strapped.

1487
01:23:23,096 --> 01:23:26,807
I'm strapped. I don't know
what to do. I was just fired.

1488
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:30,671
- Howard fired you?
- That's not no...

1489
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:36,167
Imagine that. I named him Howard.
I named him! I named him Howard!

1490
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:40,295
Willy, when are you gonna realise
that them things don't mean anything?

1491
01:23:40,376 --> 01:23:43,311
You named him Howard
but you can't sell that.

1492
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:46,335
The only thing you got in this
world is what you can sell.

1493
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:50,055
The funny thing is, you're a salesman
and you don't know that.

1494
01:23:50,136 --> 01:23:53,495
I always try to think otherwise,
I guess. I always felt...

1495
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:58,575
...if a man was impressive
and well-liked then nothing...

1496
01:23:58,656 --> 01:24:01,415
Why must everybody like you?
Who liked JP Morgan?

1497
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:04,816
Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath
he looked like a butcher.

1498
01:24:04,896 --> 01:24:09,016
With his pockets on
he was very well-liked.

1499
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:18,815
Now, listen, Willy,
I know you don't like me.

1500
01:24:18,896 --> 01:24:21,936
And nobody can say I'm in love with you.

1501
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:26,896
But I'll give you a job
just for the hell of it.

1502
01:24:27,455 --> 01:24:31,888
- What do you say?
- No. No, I just...

1503
01:24:32,255 --> 01:24:34,535
No, I just can't work for you, Charley.

1504
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,455
- What are you, jealous of me?
- No!

1505
01:24:36,456 --> 01:24:39,095
I can't work for you, that's all.
Don't ask me why.

1506
01:24:39,096 --> 01:24:42,591
You've been jealous of me
all your life, you damn fool.

1507
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:46,751
Here.

1508
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,016
- Pay your insurance.
- I'm keeping strict accounts.

1509
01:24:51,095 --> 01:24:55,863
I got some work to do. Take care
of yourself. And pay your insurance!

1510
01:25:02,184 --> 01:25:06,943
It's funny, after all the highways
and the trains and the appointments

1511
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,319
and the years...

1512
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:14,239
...you end up worth
more dead than alive.

1513
01:25:17,264 --> 01:25:20,343
Willy, nobody's worth nothing dead.

1514
01:25:25,384 --> 01:25:27,519
You hear what I said?

1515
01:25:29,543 --> 01:25:31,559
Willy!

1516
01:25:32,184 --> 01:25:36,248
Oh, apologise to Bernard for me
when you see him.

1517
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:39,183
I didn't mean to argue with him.
He's a fine boy.

1518
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:44,824
They're all fine boys. And they'll
end up big, all of them someday.

1519
01:25:45,743 --> 01:25:47,782
They'll all play tennis together.

1520
01:25:47,783 --> 01:25:50,744
Wish me luck, Charley.
He saw Bill Oliver today.

1521
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:54,487
Good luck.

1522
01:25:54,623 --> 01:25:57,974
Oh, Charley,
you're the only friend I got.

1523
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:07,142
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

1524
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,231
Jesus.

1525
01:26:22,216 --> 01:26:24,782
In the front
you're in the middle of noise.

1526
01:26:24,783 --> 01:26:28,328
Whenever you've got a party, Mr. Loman,
tell me, I'll put you back here.

1527
01:26:28,543 --> 01:26:31,343
You look French.
How's it coming, Stanley?

1528
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:35,464
It's a dog's life. I only wish that
during the war they took me in the Army.

1529
01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:38,383
- I could have been dead.
- You got lobsters?

1530
01:26:38,464 --> 01:26:42,550
- A hundred percent big. - With the claws.
- Don't worry, I don't give you no mice.

1531
01:26:42,743 --> 01:26:45,183
How about some wine?
Put a hat on the meal.

1532
01:26:45,184 --> 01:26:48,744
No, the recipe I brought you from
overseas with the champagne in it

1533
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:52,383
I still got that in the kitchen,
but it'll cost you a buck a piece.

1534
01:26:52,464 --> 01:26:54,742
- That's all right.
- You hit a number?

1535
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,142
My brother, I think
he pulled off a deal today.

1536
01:26:57,143 --> 01:27:00,783
- I think we're going into business.
- That's the best, family business.

1537
01:27:00,903 --> 01:27:03,023
- That's the best.
- That's what I think.

1538
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:06,263
What's the difference?
Somebody steals, it's in the family.

1539
01:27:06,343 --> 01:27:09,079
Shh. Strudel.

1540
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:13,543
- Ma'am?
- I'm expecting someone.

1541
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:19,983
Oh, look at that mouth. Oh, God,
and the binoculars. Wait on her.

1542
01:27:21,384 --> 01:27:23,782
- Would you like a menu?
- I'd like a...

1543
01:27:23,783 --> 01:27:25,982
Why don't you bring her...
Do you mind?

1544
01:27:25,983 --> 01:27:29,663
I sell champagne and I'd like her
to try my brand. Bring her a champagne.

1545
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:32,823
- That's awfully nice of you.
- It's all company money.

1546
01:27:32,904 --> 01:27:35,622
That's a charming product
to be selling, isn't it?

1547
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:38,022
Like everything else,
selling is selling.

1548
01:27:38,023 --> 01:27:41,751
- I suppose? - You don't happen
to sell? - No, I don't sell.

1549
01:27:41,944 --> 01:27:45,183
Would you object to a compliment?
You ought to be on a magazine cover.

1550
01:27:45,456 --> 01:27:49,687
- I have been. -W hat did I say before?
See, Stanley, she's a cover girl.

1551
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:52,462
- Oh, I could see, I could see.
- What magazine?

1552
01:27:52,463 --> 01:27:54,342
A lot of them.
Thank you.

1553
01:27:54,343 --> 01:27:56,343
You know what they say in France?

1554
01:27:56,344 --> 01:27:58,582
Champagne is the drink
of the complexion.

1555
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:01,463
- Hiya, Biffo.
- Sorry I'm late.

1556
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:04,686
- No. No, no, I just got here.
Miss, um...? - Forsythe.

1557
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:07,422
Miss Forsythe, this is my brother.

1558
01:28:07,711 --> 01:28:09,687
Is Dad here?

1559
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:13,951
You might have heard of him.
He's a great football player.

1560
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:16,871
- Really? What team?
- You're familiar with football?

1561
01:28:16,951 --> 01:28:19,711
- I'm afraid I'm not.
- Biff's with the New York Giants.

1562
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,990
- Well, it is nice, isn't it?
- Good health.

1563
01:28:21,991 --> 01:28:23,870
- Happy to meet you.
- That's my name.

1564
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:26,510
It's Harold, but at West Point
they called me Happy.

1565
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:28,030
I see. How do you do?

1566
01:28:28,031 --> 01:28:30,566
- Isn't Dad coming?
- You want her?

1567
01:28:32,551 --> 01:28:35,550
- What? - You want her?
- I could never make that.

1568
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:39,031
I remember the time that idea
would never come into your head.

1569
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:42,679
- I just saw... - Wait, please. I've
got to see the old confidence.

1570
01:28:42,871 --> 01:28:46,111
If you want her she's on call.
I'm telling you, watch this.

1571
01:28:47,295 --> 01:28:50,175
Honey, are you busy?

1572
01:28:50,255 --> 01:28:52,894
Well, I am
but I could make a phone call.

1573
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:56,095
Go and do that, will you, honey,
and see if you can get a friend.

1574
01:28:56,175 --> 01:28:59,815
We'll be here for awhile. Biff,
one of the greatest football players.

1575
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:02,655
- I'm certainly happy to meet you.
- Come back soon.

1576
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:06,975
- I'll try.
- Don't try, honey. Try hard.

1577
01:29:09,215 --> 01:29:12,055
Isn't that a shame?
Beautiful girl like that.

1578
01:29:12,135 --> 01:29:14,854
- That's why I can't get married.
- Hap, look...

1579
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:16,854
- I told you she's on call.
- Cut it out.

1580
01:29:16,855 --> 01:29:19,134
I want to say something.

1581
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:21,414
- Did you see Oliver?
- I saw him, all right.

1582
01:29:21,415 --> 01:29:24,215
I want to tell Dad a couple of things.
I want you to help.

1583
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:27,295
- Is he gonna back you?
- Are you crazy?

1584
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,694
You're out of your head,
do you know that?

1585
01:29:29,695 --> 01:29:31,014
Why, what happened?

1586
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:33,374
I did a terrible thing today, Hap.

1587
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:36,775
It's been the strangest day
I ever went through.

1588
01:29:36,855 --> 01:29:39,334
- I'm a little numb.
- What, he wouldn't see you?

1589
01:29:39,335 --> 01:29:43,222
I waited six hours for him, see.
All day I kept sending my name in.

1590
01:29:43,415 --> 01:29:47,015
Even tried to date his secretary
so she got me through. Not so.

1591
01:29:47,135 --> 01:29:50,335
You're not showing the confidence.
But he remembered you?

1592
01:29:50,415 --> 01:29:54,855
Finally at 5:00 he comes out,
didn't remember who I was or anything.

1593
01:29:54,935 --> 01:29:57,574
Biff, did you tell him my Florida idea?

1594
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:00,174
Hap, he walked away.

1595
01:30:00,175 --> 01:30:03,895
I saw him and for one minute I got
so mad I could have torn the walls down.

1596
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:07,655
How the hell did I ever get the idea
that I was a salesman there?

1597
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,413
I believed myself
that I'd been a salesman for him.

1598
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:14,934
Then he gave me one look and I realised
what a ridiculous lie my life's been.

1599
01:30:15,015 --> 01:30:18,190
We have been talking in a dream
for 15 years.

1600
01:30:18,495 --> 01:30:21,382
- I was a shipping clerk.
- What did you do?

1601
01:30:21,575 --> 01:30:24,575
Well, he... he left, see.

1602
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:28,295
His secretary went out
and I was alone in the waiting room.

1603
01:30:29,495 --> 01:30:32,935
And next thing I know,
I was in his office.

1604
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:36,655
Panel walls and everything.

1605
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:41,055
I can't explain it, Hap.
I took his fountain pen.

1606
01:30:41,134 --> 01:30:43,134
Geez. Did he catch you?

1607
01:30:43,135 --> 01:30:47,174
I ran out. I ran down all 11 flights.
I ran and ran and ran.

1608
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:49,854
Boy, that was dumb, Biff.
Why did you do that?

1609
01:30:49,855 --> 01:30:51,574
I don't know.

1610
01:30:51,575 --> 01:30:54,311
I just wanted to take something.

1611
01:30:57,015 --> 01:30:59,454
You gotta help me, Hap.
I want to tell Pop.

1612
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,431
Are you crazy? What for?

1613
01:31:04,135 --> 01:31:08,335
He's gotta understand I'm not the man
somebody lends that kind of money to.

1614
01:31:08,414 --> 01:31:11,054
He thinks I've been spiting him
all these years.

1615
01:31:11,055 --> 01:31:14,135
Tell him something nice.
Say you got a date with Oliver tomorrow.

1616
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:17,175
- What do I do tomorrow?
- Dad is never so happy

1617
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:20,231
as when he's
looking forward to something.

1618
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:24,254
Gee, I haven't been here in years!

1619
01:31:24,255 --> 01:31:27,015
- Sit down. You want a drink?
- Sure, I don't mind.

1620
01:31:27,094 --> 01:31:29,094
- You look worried.
- No.

1621
01:31:29,095 --> 01:31:31,333
Uh, Scotch all around.
Make it doubles.

1622
01:31:31,334 --> 01:31:34,655
You had a couple already, didn't you?
Did everything go all right?

1623
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:37,855
- I had an experience today, Pop.
- That so? What happened?

1624
01:31:37,935 --> 01:31:40,574
I wanted to tell you everything
from first to last.

1625
01:31:40,575 --> 01:31:43,334
It's been a strange day.
I had to wait quite a while.

1626
01:31:43,335 --> 01:31:44,734
- Oliver?
- Yeah, Oliver.

1627
01:31:44,735 --> 01:31:46,693
All day, as a matter of cold fact.

1628
01:31:46,694 --> 01:31:51,535
And a lot of instances, Pop,
facts about my life came back to me.

1629
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:54,934
Who was it, Pop, whoever said
I was a salesman with Oliver?

1630
01:31:55,054 --> 01:31:57,814
- Well, you were.
- No, I was a shipping clerk, Dad.

1631
01:31:57,895 --> 01:32:00,934
I don't know who said it first
but I was never a salesman for Oliver.

1632
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:03,734
- What are you talking about?
- Hold onto the facts.

1633
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:05,974
I was a shipping clerk.

1634
01:32:05,975 --> 01:32:07,933
- Listen to me...
- Dad, let me finish.

1635
01:32:07,934 --> 01:32:10,454
I'm not interested in stories
about the past.

1636
01:32:10,455 --> 01:32:12,173
The woods are burning, boys.

1637
01:32:12,174 --> 01:32:14,774
There's a big blaze going on all around.

1638
01:32:14,775 --> 01:32:16,293
I was fired today.

1639
01:32:16,294 --> 01:32:17,973
How could you be?

1640
01:32:17,974 --> 01:32:22,015
And I'm looking for a little good news
to tell your mother

1641
01:32:22,135 --> 01:32:24,374
- because the woman has suffered.
- Dad!

1642
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:28,055
I haven't got a story left in my head
so don't give me a lecture about facts.

1643
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:31,134
I am not interested.
Now, what have you got to say to me?

1644
01:32:31,215 --> 01:32:34,350
Did you see Oliver, huh?

1645
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:37,013
- Geez, Dad.
- You didn't go up there?

1646
01:32:37,014 --> 01:32:40,095
- Sure, he went up there.
- I saw him. How could they fire you?

1647
01:32:40,174 --> 01:32:43,655
- What kind of welcome did he give you?
- He won't let you work on commission?

1648
01:32:43,734 --> 01:32:46,333
- I'm out! He gave you a warm welcome?
- Sure, Pop.

1649
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:49,815
I was wondering if he'd remember you.
A man doesn't see him in ten years,

1650
01:32:49,894 --> 01:32:52,614
he gives him a welcome.
You know why he remembered?

1651
01:32:52,615 --> 01:32:56,695
- You impressed him in those days.
- Dad, can we talk and get this down?

1652
01:32:56,774 --> 01:33:00,494
What happened? Did he take you in
his office or talk in the waiting room?

1653
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,174
- He came in...
- I bet he threw his arms around you.

1654
01:33:03,175 --> 01:33:06,214
- He's a fine man, a hard man to see.
- Oh, I know that.

1655
01:33:06,335 --> 01:33:08,494
- Is that where you had the drinks?
- Yeah.

1656
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:11,013
- He told him my Florida idea.
- Don't interrupt.

1657
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:14,135
- How'd he react to the Florida idea?
- Give me a minute to explain.

1658
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:18,095
I've been waiting for you to explain
since I sat down here. What happened?

1659
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:21,334
- I talked, he listened to me.
- Oh, the way he listens.

1660
01:33:21,415 --> 01:33:23,734
- What was his answer?
- An... Answer...

1661
01:33:23,735 --> 01:33:26,534
You're not letting me tell you
what I want to tell you.

1662
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:28,173
- You didn't see him.
- I did.

1663
01:33:28,174 --> 01:33:31,295
- You insult him or something?
- Dad! Will you let me out of it?

1664
01:33:31,415 --> 01:33:33,894
- Will you just let me out of it?
- What happened?

1665
01:33:33,895 --> 01:33:35,693
- I can't talk to him.
- Tell him.

1666
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:39,134
- Shut up and leave me alone.
- No, no. You had to go and flunk math.

1667
01:33:39,254 --> 01:33:42,215
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- Math, math, math.

1668
01:33:42,294 --> 01:33:45,614
- Take it easy, Pop.
- If you hadrt of flunked you'd be set.

1669
01:33:45,695 --> 01:33:48,655
I'm gonna tell you what happened
and you're gonna listen to me.

1670
01:33:48,734 --> 01:33:52,574
I waited six hours and I kept sending
my name in but he wouldn't see me.

1671
01:33:52,655 --> 01:33:55,454
- Finally he came.
- Biff flunked mathl

1672
01:33:55,535 --> 01:33:58,093
- They won't graduate him.
- Where is he?

1673
01:33:58,094 --> 01:34:00,093
He ran off.
He went to Grand Central.

1674
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:01,773
Is Uncle Willy in Boston?

1675
01:34:01,774 --> 01:34:05,135
See, so I'm washed up with Oliver,
Pop, do you understand that?

1676
01:34:05,214 --> 01:34:07,973
- Are you listening?
- If you hadrt have flunked...

1677
01:34:07,974 --> 01:34:11,614
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- I didn't flunk math. What pen?

1678
01:34:11,695 --> 01:34:14,413
- That was dumb, Biff.
- You took Oliver's pen.

1679
01:34:14,414 --> 01:34:17,574
- I just explained it.
- You stole Bill Oliver's fountain pen.

1680
01:34:17,654 --> 01:34:20,413
I didn't exactly steal it.
I was trying to tell you.

1681
01:34:20,414 --> 01:34:23,294
He had it in his hand,
Oliver walked in, he got nervous.

1682
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:26,013
- My god, Biff.
- I never intended to do it...

1683
01:34:26,014 --> 01:34:29,334
- I'm not in my room. I'm not there.
- Ringing Mr Loman.

1684
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:31,573
- Now, stop it.
- Mr Loman does not answer.

1685
01:34:31,574 --> 01:34:33,414
- I'm not there.
- Shall I page him?

1686
01:34:33,415 --> 01:34:36,093
- You're no good, no good for anything.
- I am, Dad.

1687
01:34:36,094 --> 01:34:38,574
I'll find something.
Don't worry about anything.

1688
01:34:38,574 --> 01:34:40,293
- Talk to me.
- Paging Mr Loman.

1689
01:34:40,294 --> 01:34:42,773
- No! No!
- He'll strike something, Pop, please.

1690
01:34:42,774 --> 01:34:45,294
- No!
- Dad, I'm telling you something good.

1691
01:34:45,294 --> 01:34:48,694
Oliver talked to his partner
about the Florida idea.

1692
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:50,693
- You listening, Dad? Dad?
- Yeah.

1693
01:34:50,694 --> 01:34:54,775
He talked to his partner and he came
to me and I'm gonna be all right, Pop.

1694
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:57,013
He said it's just a question
of the amount.

1695
01:34:57,014 --> 01:35:00,494
- Then you... Then you got it?
- It's gonna be terrific, Pop.

1696
01:35:00,614 --> 01:35:02,933
Aw, then you got it, haven't you?

1697
01:35:02,934 --> 01:35:05,734
- You got it, haven't you? You got it!
- No.

1698
01:35:05,814 --> 01:35:08,293
I'm supposed to have lunch
with him tomorrow.

1699
01:35:08,294 --> 01:35:11,134
I'm telling you so you'll know
I can make an impression.

1700
01:35:11,214 --> 01:35:14,454
I'll make good somewheres,
but I can't go tomorrow.

1701
01:35:14,535 --> 01:35:16,574
- Why not? You simply...
- The pen, Pop.

1702
01:35:16,575 --> 01:35:19,214
You give him the pen,
tell him it was an oversight.

1703
01:35:19,215 --> 01:35:20,694
- You have lunch.
- I can't.

1704
01:35:20,695 --> 01:35:23,333
You were doing a crossword puzzle,
you used his pen.

1705
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:27,094
No, listen, kid,
I took those balls years ago, Pop,

1706
01:35:27,174 --> 01:35:30,094
and now I walk in with this fountain pen
that clinches it.

1707
01:35:30,175 --> 01:35:33,175
Don't you understand? I can't face him.
I'll try elsewhere.

1708
01:35:33,254 --> 01:35:36,055
- Don't you want to be anything?
- How can I go back?

1709
01:35:36,134 --> 01:35:37,413
Pop!

1710
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:40,013
You don't want to be anything,
that what's behind it?

1711
01:35:40,014 --> 01:35:43,494
Don't take it that way! You think
it was easy walking into that office?

1712
01:35:43,574 --> 01:35:46,495
A team of horses couldn't
have dragged me to Oliver.

1713
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,333
- Then why did you go?
- Why did I go?

1714
01:35:49,334 --> 01:35:53,014
Why did I go? Dad, look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

1715
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:56,814
- You're gonna go to that lunch.
- I can't. I've got no appointment.

1716
01:35:56,934 --> 01:35:59,213
- Are you spiting me?
- Don't take it that way!

1717
01:35:59,214 --> 01:36:01,975
You rotten little louse.
Are you spiting me?

1718
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:05,374
Dad. I'm no good.
Can't you see what I am?

1719
01:36:05,454 --> 01:36:08,414
You're in a restaurant.
Cut it out, both of you!

1720
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:11,575
- Someone's at the door.
- Hello, girls. Sit down.

1721
01:36:11,654 --> 01:36:13,774
Yes, we might as well.
This is Letta.

1722
01:36:13,775 --> 01:36:16,494
- What do you drink?
- Letta might not be able to stay.

1723
01:36:16,574 --> 01:36:20,573
I gotta get up very early
tomorrow. I've got jury duty.

1724
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:23,534
I'm so excited.
Were you fellas ever on a jury?

1725
01:36:23,614 --> 01:36:26,869
No, I've been in front of a jury.

1726
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:32,270
- This is my father.
- Isn't he cute. Sit down with us, Pops.

1727
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:34,509
- Biff, sit him down.
- Come on, sit down.

1728
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:37,830
- Drink us under the table.
- Willy, are you coming?

1729
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:40,229
Willy, I'm waiting.

1730
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:42,349
- Where are you going?
- To open the door.

1731
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:44,989
- What door?
- The washroom. Where is the door?

1732
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:47,805
Just go straight down.

1733
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,750
Will you stop laughing. Stop. Shh.

1734
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:54,389
Will you stop!

1735
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,406
Shh!

1736
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:58,269
Will you stop!

1737
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,749
I think it's sweet you bring your daddy.

1738
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,789
Oh, he isn't really your father.

1739
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:05,790
Miss Forsythe, you've just seen
a prince walk by.

1740
01:37:05,965 --> 01:37:09,893
A fine troubled prince. A
hard-working, unappreciated prince.

1741
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,389
A pal, do you understand,
a good companion.

1742
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,125
Always for his boys.

1743
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:20,030
- That's so sweet.
- Girls, we're wasting time here.

1744
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,589
What's the programme?
Biff, gather round now.

1745
01:37:22,589 --> 01:37:24,309
Where would you like to go?

1746
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,846
- You do something for me?
- Me?

1747
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:30,590
- Don't you give a damn for him?
- What are you talking about?

1748
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:33,309
- I'm the one...
- You don't give a damn about him.

1749
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,286
Look what I found in the cellar, Hap.

1750
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:39,830
- How can you bear to let that go on?
- Me? Who goes off? Who runs away?

1751
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:43,110
He doesn't mean anything to you.
You could help him, I can't.

1752
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:46,950
Don't you understand what he's gonna do?
He's gonna kill himself.

1753
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,189
- Don't you know that?
- Don't yell at me.

1754
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:51,189
Hap, help him.

1755
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:54,350
Help him!
Help me.

1756
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:56,429
Help me!

1757
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,525
I can't bear to look in his face.

1758
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:03,029
Biff...

1759
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,669
- Biff, where you going?
- What's he so mad about?

1760
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,349
We're gonna catch up with him.

1761
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,069
- I don't like that temper of his.
- He's overstrung.

1762
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:13,230
- Do you want to tell your father?
- That's not my father, just a guy.

1763
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:17,350
Come on, we're gonna catch up with Biff
and honey, we'll paint this town.

1764
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:20,750
I love those bedroom eyes.

1765
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:26,070
- That's how I knew you were friends.
- Mr Loman! Mr Loman! Mr Loman!

1766
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,030
Hey! Mr Loman!

1767
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,229
- Willyl
- What?

1768
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:33,348
Oh.

1769
01:38:33,349 --> 01:38:35,149
No.

1770
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:38,750
Willy, aren't you gonna answer the door?

1771
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,805
Willy...

1772
01:38:42,669 --> 01:38:44,429
Willyl

1773
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:47,405
- Arert you gonna answer the door?
- Sure.

1774
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:52,909
Oh.

1775
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:57,062
Someone's at the door, Willy.
Are you gonna answer the door?

1776
01:38:57,430 --> 01:39:00,229
He's gonna wake up the whole hotell

1777
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:04,005
I'm not expecting anybody.

1778
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:07,190
Why don't you have another drink, honey?

1779
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:10,430
- Stop being so damn self-centred.
- I'm so Ionely.

1780
01:39:10,509 --> 01:39:14,021
You know you ruined me, Willy. From
now on, when you come to the office,

1781
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:16,589
I'll see you
go right through the buyers.

1782
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:19,308
No waiting at my desk anymore.
Willy, you ruined me.

1783
01:39:19,309 --> 01:39:21,509
Oh, that's nice of you to say that.

1784
01:39:21,509 --> 01:39:23,789
Oh, gee, you're self-centred.

1785
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,748
Why so sad?

1786
01:39:25,749 --> 01:39:29,150
You're the saddest, self-centredest soul
I ever did see-saw.

1787
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:32,150
Oh, boy, huh? What?

1788
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:37,925
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1789
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,365
Oh, to be dressing
in the middle of the night.

1790
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,709
Arert you gonna answer the door?

1791
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:50,510
They're knocking on the wrong door.

1792
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:53,069
But they're knocking
and hear us talking.

1793
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,469
- Maybe the hotel's on fire.
- It's a mistake.

1794
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:57,988
- Tell them to go away.
- There's nobody there.

1795
01:39:57,989 --> 01:39:59,789
Willy!

1796
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:04,149
There's somebody standing out there
and it's getting on my nerves.

1797
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:07,270
All right. Stay in the bathroom
and don't come out.

1798
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:10,469
There's a law in Massachusetts,
so don't come out.

1799
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:14,390
It may be the new room clerk.
He looked mean. It's a mistake.

1800
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:17,429
There's no fire.

1801
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:20,910
- Dad. Why didn't you answer?
- Biff.

1802
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:23,790
- What are you doing in Boston?
- Why didn't you answer?

1803
01:40:23,909 --> 01:40:26,549
I was knocking for five minutes.
I called you.

1804
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,550
I just heard you. I was in the bathroom
and had the door shut.

1805
01:40:29,629 --> 01:40:31,988
Did anything happen at home, huh?

1806
01:40:31,989 --> 01:40:34,468
- Dad, I let you down.
- Excuse me?

1807
01:40:34,469 --> 01:40:37,510
Biffo, what's this about?
Come on, let's go get you a malt.

1808
01:40:37,629 --> 01:40:40,349
Dad, I...

1809
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:44,772
- I flunked math. - Not for the term? -
I haven't got enough credits to graduate.

1810
01:40:44,869 --> 01:40:48,709
- Bernard wouldn't give you the answers?
- He did. He tried. I only got a 61.

1811
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:52,309
They wouldn't give you four points?
Birnbaum refused absolutely.

1812
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:55,149
I begged him to give me those points
but he won't listen.

1813
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:58,069
You gotta talk to him.
Dad, before they close the school.

1814
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:01,790
'Cause if he saw the kind of man you are
and you talked to him in your way,

1815
01:41:01,909 --> 01:41:04,389
I'm sure he'd come through for me, Pop.

1816
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:07,789
The class came right before practice,
so I didn't go enough.

1817
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:10,949
Would you talk to him?
He'd like you, the way you can talk.

1818
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:13,668
- I'm gonna drive right back.
- Dad, good work.

1819
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:16,630
- I'm sure he'll change it.
- Tell the clerk I'm checking out.

1820
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:19,349
Go right down.

1821
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,469
The reason he hates me
is one day he was late for class,

1822
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:25,068
so I got up at the blackboard
and imitated him.

1823
01:41:25,069 --> 01:41:27,668
- Crossed my eyes, talked with a lisp.
- You did?

1824
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:29,669
- Yeah.
- The kids like it?

1825
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:32,709
- They nearly died laughing.
- Yeah, what did you do?

1826
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:37,149
The square root of 63 is...

1827
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:38,989
In the middle of it he walks in.

1828
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:42,349
He walked in! All right.

1829
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,909
- Is somebody in there?
- That was next door.

1830
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:50,750
- Somebody got in your bathroom.
- In the next room there's a party.

1831
01:41:50,829 --> 01:41:53,468
Can I come in?

1832
01:41:53,469 --> 01:41:56,749
There's something in the bathtub, Willy,
and it's moving.

1833
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:20,670
Uh, you better go back to your room now.

1834
01:42:20,749 --> 01:42:24,230
They must be finished painting by now.

1835
01:42:24,309 --> 01:42:27,469
See, they're painting her room,
so I let her shower here.

1836
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,709
- Go back.
- I gotta get dressed, Willy.

1837
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:33,150
You get out of here.
This is Miss Francis. She's a buyer.

1838
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:35,909
She lives down the hall
and they're painting her...

1839
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:38,109
- Go back, go back!
- My clothes, Willy!

1840
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,508
- I can't go naked.
- Will you get out of here.

1841
01:42:40,509 --> 01:42:43,269
Where's my stockings?
You promised me stockings.

1842
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:46,590
- I have no stockings.
- You had 2 boxes of sheers. I want 'em.

1843
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:48,468
Yeah, here, here, here.

1844
01:42:48,469 --> 01:42:50,764
Here.

1845
01:42:51,069 --> 01:42:53,508
For God's sake, now get out of here.

1846
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:56,949
I just hope there's nobody in the hall,
that's all I hope.

1847
01:43:01,469 --> 01:43:04,005
You, uh, football or baseball?

1848
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:06,708
Football.

1849
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:09,085
That's me, too.

1850
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:11,805
Good night.

1851
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:19,748
Well, better get going.

1852
01:43:19,749 --> 01:43:22,549
I want to get to the school
first thing in the morning.

1853
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:26,949
So, get my suits out of the closet
and I'll get my valise.

1854
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:33,308
What's the matter?

1855
01:43:33,309 --> 01:43:35,429
She's a buyer, Biff.
She buys for...

1856
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:38,108
She lives down the hall.

1857
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:41,310
She buys for J.H. Simmons
and you know, they're painting...

1858
01:43:44,429 --> 01:43:47,325
Oh, now, you don't imagine that I...

1859
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:51,508
Now, look, pal, she's just a buyer!

1860
01:43:51,509 --> 01:43:55,590
She sees merchandise in her room and
they have to keep it looking just so.

1861
01:43:55,669 --> 01:43:58,829
- Come on, now, get my suits.
- No.

1862
01:43:58,909 --> 01:44:03,309
You stop crying and do as I say.
I gave you an order, Biff.

1863
01:44:04,589 --> 01:44:07,245
Biff, I gave you an order.

1864
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:10,548
Is that what you do
when I give you an order?

1865
01:44:10,549 --> 01:44:12,605
Is it?

1866
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:15,524
Then how dare you cry!

1867
01:44:23,469 --> 01:44:25,564
Oh, now.

1868
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:34,349
Look, Biff, when you grow up
you'll understand about these things.

1869
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:37,789
No, you mustrt overemphasise
a thing like this.

1870
01:44:37,869 --> 01:44:40,709
Come on, III see Birnbaum
first thing in the morning.

1871
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,628
- Never mind.
- Never mind?

1872
01:44:42,629 --> 01:44:45,188
He's gonna give you those points.
I'll see to it.

1873
01:44:45,189 --> 01:44:47,628
- He won't listen to you.
- He certainly will!

1874
01:44:47,629 --> 01:44:49,388
You need those for the U of Virginia.

1875
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:52,653
- I'm not going there.
- What? - I'm not going there.

1876
01:44:52,749 --> 01:44:56,429
If I can't get him to change that mark
you'll make it up in summer school.

1877
01:44:56,509 --> 01:44:59,284
- You got all summer to...
- Dad.

1878
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:07,165
My... my boy.

1879
01:45:09,269 --> 01:45:13,750
She's nothing to me, Biff.
I was Ionely. I was terribly Ionely.

1880
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:16,068
Dad, you gave her Mama's stockings.

1881
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:18,269
I gave you an order!

1882
01:45:18,269 --> 01:45:20,628
- I gave...
- Don't touch me, you liar!

1883
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:23,469
- You apologise for that.
- You fake!

1884
01:45:23,549 --> 01:45:26,389
I gave you an order!
I gave you an order!

1885
01:45:26,469 --> 01:45:29,469
- Now, you come back here.
- You phoney little fake.

1886
01:45:29,549 --> 01:45:31,148
- Come back here!
- You fake!

1887
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:34,549
I gave you an order!
Come back or I'll beat you. I'II...

1888
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:37,004
- Hey.
- I'll whip you.

1889
01:45:38,789 --> 01:45:40,388
I gave you...

1890
01:45:40,389 --> 01:45:41,948
Pick it up, Mr Loman.

1891
01:45:41,949 --> 01:45:44,669
Your boys just left with the chippies.

1892
01:45:45,869 --> 01:45:47,548
They said they'd see you home.

1893
01:45:47,549 --> 01:45:49,949
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

1894
01:45:49,949 --> 01:45:53,076
- Can you make it?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, I'll make it.

1895
01:45:53,269 --> 01:45:56,125
- Mr Loman.
- OK.

1896
01:45:56,989 --> 01:45:59,364
I'll make it.

1897
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:05,605
- I look all right.
- Sure, you look all right.

1898
01:46:05,749 --> 01:46:08,549
Uh... Uh...

1899
01:46:09,389 --> 01:46:12,108
Here. Here. Here's a dollar.

1900
01:46:12,109 --> 01:46:14,868
- Your son paid. It's all right.
- You're a good boy.

1901
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:17,949
- You don't have to.
- Here's more. I don't need it anymore.

1902
01:46:18,029 --> 01:46:21,749
Tell me, is there a seed store
in the neighbourhood?

1903
01:46:21,829 --> 01:46:24,037
Seeds?

1904
01:46:24,389 --> 01:46:28,189
- You mean, like to plant?
- Yes, like carrots, peas.

1905
01:46:28,269 --> 01:46:30,548
There's a hardware store
on Sixth Avenue.

1906
01:46:30,549 --> 01:46:33,349
- It may be too late now.
- I better hurry.

1907
01:46:33,428 --> 01:46:37,509
I gotta get some seeds.
Gotta get some seeds right away.

1908
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:40,700
Well, what are you looking at?

1909
01:46:43,885 --> 01:46:45,764
Nothing is planted right.

1910
01:46:45,765 --> 01:46:48,660
I don't have a thing
in the ground right now.

1911
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:13,972
"Carrots.
Quarter inch apart,

1912
01:47:14,165 --> 01:47:16,820
one foot rows..."

1913
01:47:17,125 --> 01:47:19,260
One foot.

1914
01:47:19,765 --> 01:47:21,661
Beets.

1915
01:47:22,805 --> 01:47:25,788
Lettuce.
One foot.

1916
01:47:25,885 --> 01:47:28,243
Oh, what a proposition.

1917
01:47:28,244 --> 01:47:31,325
Terrific, terrific,
'cause she's suffered, man.

1918
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,580
The woman has suffered.

1919
01:47:34,004 --> 01:47:36,044
A man can't go out the way he came in.

1920
01:47:36,045 --> 01:47:39,005
A man has got to add up to something.
You can't...

1921
01:47:39,084 --> 01:47:41,244
You can't. You gotta consider now.

1922
01:47:41,245 --> 01:47:43,043
Don't answer so quick.

1923
01:47:43,044 --> 01:47:48,365
Remember, it's a guaranteed
$20,000 proposition, huh?

1924
01:47:48,404 --> 01:47:53,125
Now, look, Ben, I want you to go through
the ins and outs of this thing with me.

1925
01:47:53,245 --> 01:47:57,732
I got nobody to talk to. And the
woman has suffered, you hear me?

1926
01:47:57,925 --> 01:48:02,325
- What's the proposition? - It's $20,000
on the barrel head, guaranteed.

1927
01:48:02,404 --> 01:48:04,043
Gilt edge, you understand?

1928
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:06,204
You don't want
to make a fool of yourself.

1929
01:48:06,205 --> 01:48:09,684
- They might not honour the policy.
- How can they refuse? I worked.

1930
01:48:09,765 --> 01:48:13,244
I met every premium on the nose
and now they don't pay off? Impossible.

1931
01:48:13,325 --> 01:48:15,084
It's called a cowardly thing.

1932
01:48:15,085 --> 01:48:19,004
Why does it take more guts to stand here
the rest of my life ringing up a zero?

1933
01:48:19,085 --> 01:48:20,604
That's a point, William.

1934
01:48:20,605 --> 01:48:24,405
And 20,000. That is something
one can feel with their hands.

1935
01:48:24,525 --> 01:48:26,803
That's the whole beauty of it, Ben.

1936
01:48:26,804 --> 01:48:29,645
I see it like a diamond
shining in the dark

1937
01:48:29,725 --> 01:48:32,364
that I can pick up and touch in my hand.

1938
01:48:32,365 --> 01:48:35,765
Not like an appointment.

1939
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:39,684
This would not be another appointment
and it changes all the aspects.

1940
01:48:39,805 --> 01:48:42,805
Because he thinks I'm nothing,
so he spites me.

1941
01:48:42,885 --> 01:48:47,725
But the funeral.
Oh, Ben, that funeral will be massive!

1942
01:48:47,804 --> 01:48:51,125
Oh, they'll come
from Maine, Massachusetts,

1943
01:48:51,204 --> 01:48:54,100
Vermont, New Hampshire.

1944
01:48:54,885 --> 01:48:58,165
All the old-timers
with the strange licence plates.

1945
01:48:58,244 --> 01:49:00,484
That boy will be thunderstruck, Ben,

1946
01:49:00,485 --> 01:49:03,284
because he never realised I am known.

1947
01:49:03,365 --> 01:49:06,765
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
I am known, Ben!

1948
01:49:06,844 --> 01:49:09,443
He'll see it with his eyes!

1949
01:49:09,444 --> 01:49:12,644
Once and for all,
he'll see what I am, oh!

1950
01:49:13,844 --> 01:49:16,100
He's in for a shock, that boy.

1951
01:49:16,365 --> 01:49:19,565
He'll call you a coward, William.

1952
01:49:20,885 --> 01:49:23,404
Oh, no, no, that would be terrible.

1953
01:49:23,405 --> 01:49:27,292
- Yes, and a damn fool.
- No, no!

1954
01:49:27,485 --> 01:49:30,100
He'll hate you, William.

1955
01:49:30,405 --> 01:49:33,459
He mustn't. Oh, I won't have that.

1956
01:49:56,484 --> 01:49:58,980
Mom, what are you doing up?

1957
01:50:00,084 --> 01:50:02,780
Where's Pop? Is he sleeping?

1958
01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:07,723
- Where were you?
- We met two girls, very fine types.

1959
01:50:07,724 --> 01:50:10,404
We brought you some flowers.
Put 'em in your room.

1960
01:50:10,405 --> 01:50:13,083
What did you do that for?
I want you to have flowers.

1961
01:50:13,084 --> 01:50:15,884
Don't you care whether he lives or dies?

1962
01:50:15,885 --> 01:50:18,420
- Biff, let's go up.
- Go away from me.

1963
01:50:19,485 --> 01:50:22,925
What do you mean, lives or dies?
Nobody's dying around here, pal.

1964
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:26,284
Get out of here!
Get out of my sight!

1965
01:50:26,364 --> 01:50:28,124
I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1966
01:50:28,125 --> 01:50:30,860
- You're not going near him.
- Where is he?

1967
01:50:31,484 --> 01:50:34,445
You invite him for dinner,
he looks forward to it all day.

1968
01:50:34,524 --> 01:50:37,324
- And then you desert him there?
- Dad?

1969
01:50:37,325 --> 01:50:39,604
There's no stranger you'd do that to.

1970
01:50:39,604 --> 01:50:42,684
He had a swell time with us.
When I desert him I hope I do it...

1971
01:50:42,765 --> 01:50:45,380
- Get out of here!
- Ma!

1972
01:50:47,004 --> 01:50:50,724
- Mom?
- Did you have to go to women tonight?

1973
01:50:50,725 --> 01:50:53,684
You and your rotten, lousy whores!

1974
01:50:53,765 --> 01:50:57,205
Mom, all we did was follow Biff around
trying to cheer him up.

1975
01:50:57,284 --> 01:50:59,963
- Boy, what a night you gave me.
- Get out of here.

1976
01:50:59,964 --> 01:51:03,044
Both of you, and don't come back.
I don't want you tormenting him anymore.

1977
01:51:03,124 --> 01:51:06,684
- Dad, are you down there?
- You can sleep in his apartment.

1978
01:51:10,564 --> 01:51:14,045
And pick up this stuff!
I'm not your maid anymore.

1979
01:51:14,164 --> 01:51:16,925
Go on, pick it up, you bum, you!

1980
01:51:17,044 --> 01:51:19,124
You're a pair of animals.

1981
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:22,405
There's not one, not a living soul,
who would have the cruelty

1982
01:51:22,484 --> 01:51:25,164
to walk out on that man
in a restaurant.

1983
01:51:25,165 --> 01:51:28,045
- Is that what he said?
- He didn't have to say anything.

1984
01:51:28,124 --> 01:51:32,124
He was so humiliated,
he nearly limped when he came in.

1985
01:51:32,204 --> 01:51:35,220
- Look, Mom, he had a great time.
- Shut up!

1986
01:51:38,325 --> 01:51:42,444
You! Didn't even go to
see if he was all right.

1987
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:46,044
No, Mom, I didn't. I didn't do
a damn thing. How do you like that?

1988
01:51:46,124 --> 01:51:48,899
I left him babbling in a toilet.

1989
01:51:49,045 --> 01:51:52,484
- You louse, you.
- You hit it on the nose.

1990
01:51:52,564 --> 01:51:55,003
The scum of the earth.
You're looking at him.

1991
01:51:55,004 --> 01:51:58,604
- Get out of here.
- I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1992
01:51:58,684 --> 01:52:00,643
You're not going near him. Get out.

1993
01:52:00,644 --> 01:52:03,404
We're gonna have
an abrupt conversation, him and me.

1994
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:06,620
You're not talking to him.

1995
01:52:15,964 --> 01:52:19,044
Please, leave him alone.

1996
01:52:19,124 --> 01:52:21,980
What is he doing out there?

1997
01:52:23,484 --> 01:52:26,444
He's planting the garden.

1998
01:52:27,404 --> 01:52:29,139
Now?

1999
01:52:30,684 --> 01:52:32,644
Oh, my god.

2000
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:36,964
Never even let me carry
the valises in the house.

2001
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:40,164
And simonising, simonising...

2002
01:52:40,804 --> 01:52:42,963
...that little red car.

2003
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:45,020
Why?

2004
01:52:45,684 --> 01:52:50,564
Why can't I give him something
and not have him hate me, huh?

2005
01:52:50,644 --> 01:52:53,444
Let me think about it.
I still have a little time.

2006
01:52:53,524 --> 01:52:55,883
A remarkable proposition.

2007
01:52:55,884 --> 01:52:57,203
Oh.

2008
01:52:57,204 --> 01:53:00,044
You gotta be sure
you're not making a fool of yourself.

2009
01:53:00,124 --> 01:53:02,260
Dad?

2010
01:53:08,445 --> 01:53:11,564
Where is that seed?
You can't see nothing here, boxed in.

2011
01:53:11,644 --> 01:53:13,563
Dad, there are people all around.

2012
01:53:13,564 --> 01:53:16,179
- Don't you realise?
- Don't bother me.

2013
01:53:22,684 --> 01:53:25,884
- I'm saying good-bye to you, Pop.
- Huh?

2014
01:53:26,004 --> 01:53:28,363
I'm not coming back anymore.

2015
01:53:28,364 --> 01:53:31,644
- You're not gonna see Oliver?
- Dad, I've got no appointment.

2016
01:53:31,724 --> 01:53:34,203
- He put his arm around you.
- Dad, get this now.

2017
01:53:34,204 --> 01:53:37,164
Every time I've left
it's been a fight that's sent me out.

2018
01:53:37,244 --> 01:53:41,907
Today I realise something about
myself. I tried to explain it to you.

2019
01:53:42,004 --> 01:53:46,124
I think I'm just not smart enough
to make sense out of it for you.

2020
01:53:46,244 --> 01:53:49,044
To hell with whose fault it is
or anything like that.

2021
01:53:50,405 --> 01:53:52,563
Let's just wrap it up.

2022
01:53:52,564 --> 01:53:55,243
- Come in and we'll tell Mom.
- I don't want to see her.

2023
01:53:55,244 --> 01:53:57,003
- Come on.
- I don't want to see her.

2024
01:53:57,004 --> 01:53:59,443
Don't bother me, will ya?

2025
01:53:59,444 --> 01:54:01,963
Dad, what do you mean?
You don't want to see her?

2026
01:54:01,964 --> 01:54:05,444
Pop, you don't want them
calling you yellow, do you?

2027
01:54:05,524 --> 01:54:09,484
Dad, it's not your fault.
It's me. I'm a bum.

2028
01:54:09,564 --> 01:54:11,940
Now, come on inside.

2029
01:54:12,644 --> 01:54:15,859
Dad, did you hear what I said to you?

2030
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:24,260
Did you plant, dear?

2031
01:54:25,644 --> 01:54:28,140
All right, Mom.

2032
01:54:29,244 --> 01:54:32,364
We had it out.
I'm going and I'm not writing anymore.

2033
01:54:32,444 --> 01:54:34,323
I think it's best, Willy.

2034
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:37,284
There's no use drawing it out.
You two will never get along.

2035
01:54:37,364 --> 01:54:40,204
If people ask where I am,
what I'm doing, you don't know or care.

2036
01:54:40,284 --> 01:54:44,244
That way it'll be off your mind
and you can start brightening up again.

2037
01:54:44,324 --> 01:54:46,780
All right?

2038
01:54:52,284 --> 01:54:54,980
That... That clears it, then, huh?

2039
01:55:10,324 --> 01:55:14,204
- You gonna wish me luck, scout?
- Shake his hand, Willy.

2040
01:55:14,284 --> 01:55:16,443
What do you say?

2041
01:55:16,444 --> 01:55:19,724
There's no necessity to mention...
He put his arm...!

2042
01:55:19,804 --> 01:55:23,364
Dad, you're never gonna see what I am,
so what's the use of arguing?

2043
01:55:23,444 --> 01:55:26,764
If I strike oil I'll send you a cheque.
Meantime, forget I'm alive.

2044
01:55:26,844 --> 01:55:28,763
Spite, see?

2045
01:55:28,764 --> 01:55:31,939
- Shake hands, Dad.
- Not my hand.

2046
01:55:36,404 --> 01:55:38,379
Dad?

2047
01:55:38,764 --> 01:55:42,564
- I was hoping not to go this way.
- This is the way you're going. Bye.

2048
01:55:46,164 --> 01:55:49,843
May you rot in hell
if you leave this house!

2049
01:55:49,924 --> 01:55:52,443
Exactly what is it
that you want from me?

2050
01:55:52,444 --> 01:55:56,124
I want you to know on the train,
in the mountains, in the valleys,

2051
01:55:56,204 --> 01:55:59,564
wherever you go,
that you cut down your life for spite!

2052
01:55:59,644 --> 01:56:02,659
- No, no!
- Spite!

2053
01:56:07,324 --> 01:56:11,204
When you are rotting somewhere
beside a railroad track, remember.

2054
01:56:11,284 --> 01:56:14,003
- Don't you blame it on me.
- I'm not blaming you.

2055
01:56:14,003 --> 01:56:16,443
I'm not taking the rap for this, hear?

2056
01:56:16,444 --> 01:56:19,404
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You're putting a knife in me.

2057
01:56:19,483 --> 01:56:22,123
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

2058
01:56:22,124 --> 01:56:24,723
All right, phoney.
Leave it there. Don't move it.

2059
01:56:24,724 --> 01:56:26,843
- What is that?
- You know damn well.

2060
01:56:26,844 --> 01:56:29,082
- I never saw that.
- You saw it, all right.

2061
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:32,724
Mice didn't bring it into the cellar.
Is that supposed to make you a hero?

2062
01:56:32,804 --> 01:56:36,124
That supposed to make me sorry for you?
There will be no pity for you.

2063
01:56:36,203 --> 01:56:38,122
- Hear that? No pity.
- Hear the spite?

2064
01:56:38,123 --> 01:56:40,602
You're gonna get the truth,
what you are, what I am.

2065
01:56:40,603 --> 01:56:42,242
- Spite!
- Cut it out!

2066
01:56:42,243 --> 01:56:45,084
The man don't know who we are.
The man is gonna know.

2067
01:56:45,924 --> 01:56:48,724
We never told the truth
for ten minutes in this house.

2068
01:56:48,804 --> 01:56:51,562
- We always told truth.
- Are you the assistant buyer?

2069
01:56:51,563 --> 01:56:54,162
You're one of
the two assistants to the assistant.

2070
01:56:54,163 --> 01:56:56,723
- I'm practically...
- You are practically full of it.

2071
01:56:56,724 --> 01:56:58,923
- We all are. I'm through with it.
- Yeah.

2072
01:56:58,924 --> 01:57:01,739
- Hear this, Willy. This is me.
- I know you.

2073
01:57:01,964 --> 01:57:04,722
Do you know why I had no
address for three months?

2074
01:57:04,723 --> 01:57:07,322
I stole a suit in Kansas City
and I was in gaol.

2075
01:57:07,323 --> 01:57:10,524
- I suppose it's my fault.
- Stop crying, I'm through with it!

2076
01:57:10,604 --> 01:57:13,604
I stole myself
out of every good job since high school.

2077
01:57:13,684 --> 01:57:15,043
Whose fault is that?

2078
01:57:15,044 --> 01:57:18,244
I could never get anywhere
'cause you blew me so full of hot air

2079
01:57:18,364 --> 01:57:21,083
that I could never stand
taking orders from anybody.

2080
01:57:21,084 --> 01:57:23,283
- I hear that.
- Stop it!

2081
01:57:23,284 --> 01:57:26,003
I had to be boss big shot
in two weeks and I'm through.

2082
01:57:26,084 --> 01:57:28,403
- Then hang yourself for spite!
- No! No!

2083
01:57:28,404 --> 01:57:32,043
No, nobody is hanging himself, Willy.

2084
01:57:35,043 --> 01:57:39,404
I ran down 11 flights with a pen
in my hand today.

2085
01:57:39,484 --> 01:57:41,723
And suddenly I stopped.
Do you hear me?

2086
01:57:41,724 --> 01:57:44,923
In the middle of that office building...
Do you hear this?

2087
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:47,043
I stopped...

2088
01:57:47,044 --> 01:57:50,924
...in the middle of the building
and I saw the sky!

2089
01:57:51,004 --> 01:57:56,644
And I... I... I saw the things
that I love in this world.

2090
01:57:56,764 --> 01:58:00,068
The work and the food

2091
01:58:00,244 --> 01:58:02,964
and the time to sit and smoke.

2092
01:58:03,043 --> 01:58:07,204
I looked at that pen in my hand and
I said, "What am I grabbing this for?

2093
01:58:07,283 --> 01:58:09,882
Why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

2094
01:58:09,883 --> 01:58:11,483
What am I doing in an office?

2095
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:14,484
Making a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,

2096
01:58:14,563 --> 01:58:17,203
when all that I want
is out there waiting for me?"

2097
01:58:17,204 --> 01:58:20,404
The minute I say it, I know who I am.
Why can't I say that, Willy?

2098
01:58:20,484 --> 01:58:22,403
The door to your life is wide open!

2099
01:58:22,404 --> 01:58:24,802
Pop, I am a dime a dozen and so are you.

2100
01:58:24,803 --> 01:58:27,323
I am not a dime a dozen!

2101
01:58:27,323 --> 01:58:30,163
I am Willy Loman and you are Biff Loman!

2102
01:58:30,244 --> 01:58:33,891
I am not the leader of men, Willy!
And neither are you!

2103
01:58:34,084 --> 01:58:37,404
You were never anything
but a hard-working drummer

2104
01:58:37,524 --> 01:58:40,243
who landed in the ashcan
like all the rest of them.

2105
01:58:40,244 --> 01:58:42,762
I am one dollar an hour, Willy!

2106
01:58:42,763 --> 01:58:46,324
I am not bringing home
any prizes anymore,

2107
01:58:46,404 --> 01:58:48,483
and you're gonna stop waiting for me!

2108
01:58:48,484 --> 01:58:52,164
- You vengeful, spiteful mutt!
- Yeah, Pop!

2109
01:58:52,243 --> 01:58:55,084
Pop, I'm nothing.

2110
01:58:55,163 --> 01:58:58,123
I'm nothing, Pop.
Can't you understand that?

2111
01:58:58,204 --> 01:59:00,443
There's no spite in it anymore.

2112
01:59:00,444 --> 01:59:03,218
I'm just what I am, that's all.

2113
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:08,003
What are you doing?
Aw, what are you doing?

2114
01:59:12,644 --> 01:59:15,764
- Why is he crying?
- Dad...

2115
01:59:16,923 --> 01:59:19,538
Will you let me go, for God's sake?

2116
01:59:20,444 --> 01:59:25,563
Will you take that phoney dream
and burn it before something happens?

2117
02:00:03,323 --> 02:00:06,099
I'll go in the morning.

2118
02:00:09,643 --> 02:00:11,859
Put him to bed.

2119
02:00:18,643 --> 02:00:22,523
Isn't that...
Isn't that remarkable?

2120
02:00:23,563 --> 02:00:26,284
Biff, he...

2121
02:00:27,843 --> 02:00:30,619
He likes me.

2122
02:00:30,883 --> 02:00:34,403
- He loves you, Willy.
- Always did, Pop.

2123
02:00:34,484 --> 02:00:37,042
Aw, Biff, he...

2124
02:00:37,043 --> 02:00:39,699
He cried. He cried to me.

2125
02:00:40,124 --> 02:00:43,603
Aw, that boy.
That boy, he's going to be magnificent.

2126
02:00:44,683 --> 02:00:47,362
Yes, outstanding,
with 20,000 behind him.

2127
02:00:47,363 --> 02:00:49,802
Come to bed, Willy.
It's all settled now.

2128
02:00:49,803 --> 02:00:53,083
Oh, yes, we'll sleep.
Come on, let's go to sleep.

2129
02:00:53,203 --> 02:00:55,682
It takes a great man
to crack thejungle.

2130
02:00:55,683 --> 02:00:58,883
I'm getting married.
Don't forget. I'm changing everything.

2131
02:00:58,963 --> 02:01:01,804
I'm gonna run that department
before the year is up.

2132
02:01:01,883 --> 02:01:04,362
Thejungle is dark
but full of diamonds.

2133
02:01:04,363 --> 02:01:07,723
Be good. You're both good boys.
Just act that way, that's all.

2134
02:01:09,163 --> 02:01:11,571
- Night, Pop.
- Night, boy.

2135
02:01:12,403 --> 02:01:15,802
- Come, dear. -S hh. One must
go in to fetch a diamond out.

2136
02:01:15,803 --> 02:01:18,402
I just want to get settled down
for a little while.

2137
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:21,404
- I want you upstairs.
- A few minutes. I couldn't sleep now.

2138
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:24,284
- Go. You look awful tired.
- Not like an appointment.

2139
02:01:24,363 --> 02:01:27,283
- A diamond is rough and hard to touch.
- I'll be right up.

2140
02:01:27,403 --> 02:01:30,123
- I think it's the only way.
- Sure, it's the best thing.

2141
02:01:30,203 --> 02:01:34,868
Best thing. The only way.
Everything is gonna be...

2142
02:01:35,043 --> 02:01:37,898
Aw, go on, kid. Get to bed.

2143
02:01:38,835 --> 02:01:43,115
- You look so tired. - Now, you
come right up. - Two minutes.

2144
02:01:51,315 --> 02:01:54,275
Loves me. Always loved me.
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

2145
02:01:54,355 --> 02:01:58,515
- Ben, he'll worship me for it.
- It's dark there.

2146
02:01:58,595 --> 02:02:00,314
But full of diamonds, Willy.

2147
02:02:00,315 --> 02:02:03,955
Can you imagine that magnificence
with $20,000 in his pocket?

2148
02:02:04,035 --> 02:02:06,074
Willy, come up.

2149
02:02:06,075 --> 02:02:08,714
Yes, yes, coming, coming!

2150
02:02:08,811 --> 02:02:11,651
It's very smart,
you realise, don't you, sweetheart?

2151
02:02:11,731 --> 02:02:13,450
Even Ben sees it.

2152
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,867
I gotta go, baby.

2153
02:02:19,371 --> 02:02:21,466
Bye-bye.

2154
02:02:22,050 --> 02:02:24,771
When the mail comes
he'll be ahead of Bernard again.

2155
02:02:24,851 --> 02:02:29,210
- A perfect proposition all around.
- Did you see how he cried to me?

2156
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:33,074
- Aw, I could kiss him, Ben.
- Time, William, time.

2157
02:02:33,171 --> 02:02:37,091
Ben, I always knew one way or another
we were gonna make it, Biff and I.

2158
02:02:37,171 --> 02:02:40,331
Boat! We'll be late.

2159
02:02:41,731 --> 02:02:46,771
Now, when you kick off,
I want a 70 yard boot.

2160
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:50,251
And get right down the field
under the ball.

2161
02:02:50,331 --> 02:02:53,531
And when you hit,
hit low and hit hard,

2162
02:02:53,651 --> 02:02:55,929
because it's important, boy.

2163
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:59,890
There's all kinds of
important people in the stands.

2164
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:03,346
The first thing that you know...

2165
02:03:03,691 --> 02:03:05,130
Willy?

2166
02:03:05,131 --> 02:03:07,931
- Ben? Ben, where do I...?
- Willy?

2167
02:03:08,011 --> 02:03:11,931
- Ben! Ben!
- Willy!

2168
02:03:12,971 --> 02:03:14,610
Shh. Shh.

2169
02:03:14,611 --> 02:03:17,250
Shh! Shh!

2170
02:03:17,251 --> 02:03:20,186
- Willy, please come up.
- Oh.

2171
02:03:22,051 --> 02:03:24,186
- Willy!
- Shh!

2172
02:03:28,451 --> 02:03:30,426
Willy?

2173
02:03:32,851 --> 02:03:36,210
- Pop?
- Willy, answer me!

2174
02:03:36,211 --> 02:03:39,386
Willy!

2175
02:03:40,787 --> 02:03:44,547
- Willy!
- Pop! No!

2176
02:03:45,386 --> 02:03:47,962
- No!
- No!

2177
02:03:51,787 --> 02:03:55,787
It's getting dark, Linda.

2178
02:03:57,267 --> 02:04:01,387
How about it, Ma? Better get
some rest. They'll be closing the gates.

2179
02:04:01,507 --> 02:04:04,427
He had no right to do that.
There was no necessity.

2180
02:04:04,507 --> 02:04:07,307
- We would have helped him.
- Come on.

2181
02:04:07,387 --> 02:04:11,425
- Why didn't anybody come?
- It was a very nice funeral.

2182
02:04:11,426 --> 02:04:14,507
Where were the people he knew?
Maybe they blame him.

2183
02:04:14,586 --> 02:04:17,827
It's a rough world, Linda.
They wouldn't blame him.

2184
02:04:17,906 --> 02:04:22,699
I can't understand it.
First time in just about 35 years

2185
02:04:23,067 --> 02:04:26,467
we were almost free and clear.

2186
02:04:27,666 --> 02:04:30,722
He only needed a little salary.

2187
02:04:30,786 --> 02:04:33,627
He was even finished with the dentist.

2188
02:04:33,706 --> 02:04:36,586
No man only needs a little salary.

2189
02:04:38,107 --> 02:04:39,985
I can't understand it.

2190
02:04:39,986 --> 02:04:45,226
There were a lot of nice days when he'd
come home from a trip or on Sundays,

2191
02:04:45,306 --> 02:04:48,547
making the stoop,
finishing the cellar

2192
02:04:48,626 --> 02:04:52,626
when he built the extra bathroom
and put up the garage.

2193
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:57,426
You know, Charley, I think there was
more of him in that front stoop

2194
02:04:57,506 --> 02:04:59,745
than in all the sales he ever made.

2195
02:04:59,746 --> 02:05:03,866
Yep. He was a happy man
with a bunch of cement.

2196
02:05:03,946 --> 02:05:06,666
He was wonderful with his hands.

2197
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:09,787
He had the wrong dreams.
AII, all wrong.

2198
02:05:09,866 --> 02:05:12,994
Don't say that.
The man didn't know who he was.

2199
02:05:13,186 --> 02:05:15,945
Nobody dast blame this man.

2200
02:05:15,946 --> 02:05:18,241
You don't understand.

2201
02:05:18,626 --> 02:05:21,442
Willy was a salesman.

2202
02:05:21,986 --> 02:05:24,706
For a salesman,
there is no rock bottom to the life.

2203
02:05:24,786 --> 02:05:26,585
He don't put a bolt to a nut,

2204
02:05:26,586 --> 02:05:29,266
he don't tell you the law,
don't give you medicine.

2205
02:05:29,267 --> 02:05:31,986
He's a man way out there in the blue,

2206
02:05:33,226 --> 02:05:35,962
riding on a smile and a shoeshine.

2207
02:05:36,427 --> 02:05:40,913
When they start not smiling back,
that's an earthquake.

2208
02:05:41,106 --> 02:05:44,706
You get yourself a couple of spots
on your hat and you're finished.

2209
02:05:46,427 --> 02:05:49,361
Nobody dast blame this man.

2210
02:05:49,707 --> 02:05:53,090
A salesman has got to dream, boy.
Comes with the territory.

2211
02:05:53,267 --> 02:05:57,025
- The man didn't know who he was.
- Don't say that!

2212
02:05:57,026 --> 02:05:59,921
Why don't you come with me, Happy?

2213
02:06:00,506 --> 02:06:02,882
I'm not licked that easily.

2214
02:06:03,226 --> 02:06:06,346
I'm staying right in the city
and I'm gonna beat this racquet.

2215
02:06:08,026 --> 02:06:10,586
- Loman brothers.
- I know who I am, kid.

2216
02:06:10,587 --> 02:06:13,225
All right, boy,
I'm gonna show you and everybody

2217
02:06:13,226 --> 02:06:16,546
that Willy Loman did not die in vain.
He had a good dream.

2218
02:06:16,626 --> 02:06:19,786
It's the only dream you can have,
to come out number one man.

2219
02:06:19,866 --> 02:06:23,394
He fought it out here and this is where
I'm gonna win it for him.

2220
02:06:25,826 --> 02:06:28,441
Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute.

2221
02:06:28,746 --> 02:06:31,393
You go on, Charley.

2222
02:06:31,666 --> 02:06:34,201
Just... just a minute.

2223
02:06:38,386 --> 02:06:41,522
I never had a chance to say good-bye.

2224
02:06:50,347 --> 02:06:52,897
Help me, Willy.

2225
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:55,481
I can't cry.

2226
02:06:56,066 --> 02:07:00,786
Seems to me you're just away on
another trip and I keep expecting you.

2227
02:07:03,146 --> 02:07:05,649
Why did you do it?

2228
02:07:06,986 --> 02:07:09,746
I search and I search,

2229
02:07:10,826 --> 02:07:13,546
and I search,

2230
02:07:14,826 --> 02:07:19,586
and I can't understand it, Willy.

2231
02:07:22,666 --> 02:07:26,122
I made the last payment
on the house today.

2232
02:07:27,586 --> 02:07:29,881
Today!

2233
02:07:36,827 --> 02:07:39,930
And there'll be nobody home.

2234
02:07:41,986 --> 02:07:45,145
We're free and clear.

2235
02:07:48,986 --> 02:07:51,393
We're free.

2236
02:07:52,146 --> 02:07:54,561
We're free.

2237
02:07:59,066 --> 02:08:01,682
We're free.

Come on out!

Woman: The building's falling apart.
Get out of there!

26
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,376
What's going on?

27
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,244
What are you doing here, honey?
Come here, honey.

28
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:40,349
Why? What's going on?

29
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:44,785
Mr. Etesami evacuate the building.
It's collapsing. Hurry up!

30
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,253
- Let's go, everyone!
- Rana! Rana!

31
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,535
- What's going on, Emad?
- Come here, Rana! Hurry up!

35
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,394
Rana! Hurry up! Come on!

36
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,162
- What is it?
- Go down! Go, go!

37
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:12,130

For God's sake, someone help my baby.

00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,557
I'm coming, wait.

40
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,033
Here, here, put this on.

41
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:26,165
- What? Let me come with you.
- No, you can't. Just go down to the alley.

42
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,025
- Go tell everyone to go to the alley.
- Mrs. Samimi! Mrs. Samimi!

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,740
- Where's Hossein?
- I can't get him out of there.

Hossein, get up!

45
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:42,940
Hossein, get up, my boy!
The house is coming down.

46
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,659
Get up, Hossein! Get up!

47
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:50,203
- Emad, come on, everyone's gone.
- Go down to the alley. Go tell everyone.

48
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,824
Mr. Fallah, get everyone
down to the alley.

49
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,574
Come on, Hossein!
What are they doing?

50
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:03,676
- Glasses... my glasses...
- I'll bring your glasses.

The Salesman
Written and Directed by Asghar Farhadi.

52
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:42,315
Guys!
There's no need to bring all your stuff.

53
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,118
- We've got everything down in our place.
- Okay.

54
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:51,687
- I can't find it.
- I don't know, just look around.

55
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,781
- You want me to take these?
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,859
I thought you were supposed to just
bring your towel and toothbrushes?

57
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,852
The towel and the brushes
are in there too.

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
- Did you lock the car?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,060
Ah, keys, keys!
Gimme the keys.

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
- Here.
- Put it in my pocket.

61
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Guys!

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,738
Hey.

63
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:13,820
Hey Kati Hi.

64
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:14,738
What's up, Kati?

65
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,338
You guys are alive?!!

66
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,366
The way Sia said the house
has collapsed...

67
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:21,345
I thought we'd have to drag
you from under the ruins.

68
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,900
Oh, whoa!
What's going on here?

69
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,540
There's smell of gas.

70
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,898
It's from last night.

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,360
Well, then, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,960
Hey.

73
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,938
Why did you come up?

74
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,480
Cut off the electricity,
this is leaking.

75
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,981
I can't find the card, man.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,940
Well, see if it's between
your documents and stuff.

77
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,900
Kati, dear, don't go
there, it's dangerous.

78
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, my God!

79
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,360
<i>You could only hear the sobbing
of Mashti Hassan's wife,</i>

80
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,461
<i>sitting alone with her lit
lantern on the stable's roof</i>

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,980
<i>and the desparate moans of a
cow from inside the stable.</i>

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,858
Sir! Is it a true story?

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,640
True? No, but you could say that
in a way, in Saedi's stories

84
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:24,838
the scenery, the type of characters,
and relationships are real. Very real.

85
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,320
How can someone
turn into a cow, sir?

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,980
Try looking in the mirror.

87
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,280
You think you're funny, huh?

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
But seriously, Sir, how does
a person turn into a cow?

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,700
Gradually...

90
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,340
Sir, are we gonna watch the
film of this story too?

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
Yeah, that's a good idea.

92
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,901
Maybe I bring it next time and
we can watch it together.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes?

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,980
Sir, when are we gonna
see your play?

95
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,340
The performance begins next week.

96
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:51,541
Once we've had a few days to settle in,
I'll definitely invite you all to come.

97
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,760
- Thanks, Sir!
- What's it called, Sir?

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,220
"Death of a Salesman",
who's read it?

99
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,500
"The Enemy"!

100
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,058
Jokes aside,
have any of you read it?

101
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,938
Sir, who's the author?

102
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,820
Arthur Miller.

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,540
Hmm... no, I've not.

104
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,270
Very good.

105
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,840
Excuse me, boys.

106
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,540
Yes?

107
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,540
Hello.

108
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,540
Yes, that's right.

109
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,885
Sorry, I can't talk right now,
I'm in class.

110
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:20,085
If you call back in 10 minutes,
I'll be free.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,660
Yeah, with stick shifts... Silver...

112
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,761
Sure... that's fine.

113
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,058
Sir, what's your role?

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,340
The Salesman.

115
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,780
- What are you selling, Sir?
- Potatoes!

116
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
When you come,
you'll see for yourselves.

117
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,098
What's it's model, Sir?

118
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,590
- What?
- Your Peugeot 206, you know.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,160
- Why do you wanna know?
- Aren't you selling, Sir?

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Sir, his dad's a parking officer, just
tell him to scrap your fines for you.

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you even commit
driving offenses, Sir?

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,060
Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

123
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,340
I didn't hear you.

124
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,420
Why do Iranians call BMW's
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

125
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,921
- Get outa here!
- Dude, just zip it!

126
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,498
That's alright.
He doesn't know, so he's asking.

127
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,040
I don't know either.

128
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,200
Guys... eh,
for your next session...

129
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,080
I want a summary of this story.
I don't want any excuses, like...

130
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,681
"I fell asleep, we had guests",
and... stuff like that.

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Mister, could you please
scooch over a bit?

132
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,620
Sir, can I sit in front and
this young man sits back here?

133
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Father...

134
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,340
Somebody in there?

135
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,900
No, I think the noise
was from the next door.

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,381
- No, no, somebody got in your bathroom!
- No, there's no one there.

137
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,098
It’s the next room, there’s a party.
These kind of noises are normal...

138
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,900
Can I come out?

139
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,542
There’s something moving
in the bathtub, Willy!

140
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,006
Ah, Miss Francis, you better
go back to your room.

141
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,778
They must be finished painting
by now.

142
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,418
But I can't, I’ve got to
get dressed first!

143
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,840
Yes, you can, you can! Please!

144
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,698
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my next-door neighbor.

145
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,240
They were painting her room.
And she asked to come and use the bath.

146
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:04,941
And I said, that's alright.
So, I let her take a shower here.

147
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,060
You can go back to your room now.

148
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,658
But, Willy, I don't have any clothes on!

149
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,440
Please, get out of here!
Go back to your room.

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,900
You promised me stockings, Willy!

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
I have no stockings here!

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Why? You had two boxes of size 9s
for me, and I want them, Willy!

153
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,580
Alright, take one and go.
For God’s sake, will you get outa here!

154
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,081
Please!

155
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,180
Go!

156
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,420
I just hope there’s nobody in the hall.
I can't go out without any clothes!

157
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,100
By the way, are you...
football or...

158
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,420
Dammit!

159
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,420
Siavash!

160
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,520
What happened, mom?

161
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,270
I do my best to ignore it but he
keeps getting worse every night!

162
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,145
Sadra, dear, come
down, let's go!

163
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
Sanam, dear, just ignore him.

164
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,938
He thinks just because I'm playing a
whore, he can do whatever he wants.

165
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,260
- What's that got to do with it?

166
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Why don't you laugh at
the others then, huh?

167
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,774
I was laughing at your
clothes, not you...

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,005
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

169
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
Siavash, come here!

170
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,060
Sanam, don't be childish on
this final night. Sanam...

171
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,400
- Alright, I'm freaking sorry... I'm sorry.

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,220
In this cold, rehearsing every night,
with this child. Let's go, honey.

173
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,820
- You just had to
fuck it up, didn't you?

174
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
- What's that got to do with us?
It's your own husband.

175
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:26,121
- Ah, come on!

176
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:27,218
Let me take the k...

177
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,218
Let go!

178
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,218
Sanam, don't...

179
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,578
I said get off!

180
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,318
- I was kidding... I was kidding!
- I said get off!

181
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:40,141
- I was messing with you.
- Where are you going?

182
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,335
Comes out of the shower
with a raincoat, and says,

183
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,085
"How can I go out
without any clothes?"

184
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,060
I can't, man,
it makes me laugh.

185
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,820
Go after her or she'll get
annoyed and won't come tomorrow.

186
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,800
Don't make me go out without clothes!
I'm shy!

187
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,580
Come on, how can I go out
without any cloth...

188
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,418
Sanam!

189
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,980
The guy's totally nuts!

190
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,338
Did you find a place?

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,658
60 sq. Meters, 3rd floor, no elevator.
40 mils in front, 600k tomans per month.

192
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,240
- Where?
- Amiratabak.

193
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,240
- What sort of a place are you looking for?
- Something temporary...

194
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,102
If we can't find anywhere,
we have to bring our stuff,

195
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,065
and live right in the middle
of the stage.

196
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,140
- You free tomorrow afternoon?
- Why?

197
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm taking you somewhere.

198
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,720
Come on guys... once more from
the top, no interruptions.

199
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,258
You tired?

200
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,258
Nope.

201
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,098
Oh, you're here too!

202
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,980
Aww kitty! Who's this?

203
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,781
Come here, you!

204
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:57,482
He's tame... What's up, kitty?

205
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,160
This place is cool!

206
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,240
Babak.

207
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
Is that the storage room?

208
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,080
- Which one?
- This.

209
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,060
No! It's the second bedroom.

210
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,980
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

211
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,760
- Isn't it too small?
- It's a two-bedroom!

212
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,800
So, it's good?

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,980
You're just two people, what do you
need all this space for anyways?

214
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,428
Watch your mouth, "two people"!

215
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:53,765
Who knows, maybe we end
up being three people...

216
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,100
Rana, is he serious?

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
No, come on!

218
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,281
- He doesn't look like it.
- Why is that?

219
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,001
Is this door locked?
Is it locked?

220
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,160
The previous tenant's stuff is in there.
They're supposed to be collecting it.

221
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,720
Don't be scared, kitty, it's just me.
Come here.

222
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,360
- How long's it been vacant?
- Three weeks.

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,981
What are they doing to this city?

224
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,740
I wish we could tear it
all down, and start over.

225
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,820
They've already destroyed and rebuilt
it, and look how it's turned out...

226
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,538
Babak?

227
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,979
Yes dear.

228
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,659
God have mercy on us.

229
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,583
When do you think she'll
clear her stuff out?

230
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,385
She promised she'll do it
in the next coupla days.

231
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,860
There's no parking, you'll have
to leave your car on the street.

232
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:00,138
That's alright. We're selling the car
to pay your mortgage down payment.

233
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,458
Who mentioned money?

234
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,480
Well, either way...

235
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
Hello, Hello, Mr. Salimi.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,060
0ne of the good things about this
place is Mr. Shanazari and his wife.

237
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,698
- Hello.
- Hello, how're you doing?

238
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,820
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. How do you do, Ma'am?

239
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,920
Babak, which one's the storage?

240
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,920
It's here, come, take a look.

241
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,720
- Mr. Salimi?
- Yes?

242
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,860
The door's open, take a look.

243
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,980
Please. make sure it doesn't
turn out like the last one.

244
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,940
- No, come on, I know these guys.
- You said you knew the last ones too.

245
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,940
Don't worry about it.

246
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,220
- Babak, what do they do?
- They're my friends, they're into arts.

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,920
I hope so.

248
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,340
It's okay for a few months.

249
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,860
Just make sure he lets us pay him for it.
No favors.

250
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,780
Looks like we've finally
caught a break.

251
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,620
Careful, don't rush.

252
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,120
You need help, Sir?
- No, you go ahead and bring the rest.

253
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,900
Just careful not to
hit the lightbulb.

254
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,740
Sorry, sir, thanks for the help.

255
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,580
- Are the keys here too?
- She took that one room's with her.

256
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,840
Where's Ali?

257
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,299
- Ali!
- Yep?

258
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,240
For God's sake, leave that alone,
I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

259
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,320
- It'll only take a second.
- Leave it, man!

260
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,360
If she'd said, we wouldn't have
hired the truck and the movers.

261
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,460
What can I say? She sounded so
sure that, I didn't think she'd bail on us.

262
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,118
So, what's she saying now?

263
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,020
Hasn't answered
ever since this morning.

264
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,060
Why don't you try
from a different number?

265
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,960
Bring your phone, Rana.

266
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,140
We really need that room,
we've brought all our stuff.

267
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,360
Yes.

268
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,060
Okay.

269
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,300
He's here if you like to
talk to him.

270
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,040
Thanks.

271
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,440
Says, she's said all
she has to say to you.

272
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,940
Well, what did she say?

273
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,323
That, she's signed the contract on
a new place two days ago,

274
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,525
but the landlord bucked
at the last moment,

275
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,641
She's looking for a place, and can't move
her stuff until she finds somewhere.

276
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,880
She said to tell you not to let
anyone touch her stuff. Please!

277
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,700
Oh, yeah, and she doesn't
want to talk to you again.

278
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
Any news?
What happened?

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,180
I don't know, nothing for now.
Let me take it, Kati.

280
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,860
- Ali!
- Yes?

281
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,340
You got a screwdriver
in your car?

282
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,220
This is enough stuff
for a bride's dowry!

283
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,440
I thought it was just a
few bits and pieces.

284
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,560
- Maybe we should leave it.
- It's fine, I'll take the responsibility.

285
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,561
Alright, boys, let's move
those things over there.

286
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,620
Rana...

287
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,820
These are people's belongings.

288
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,298
- Huh?
- These belong to someone.

289
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,487
What do you want me to do?
It's been 3 days now.

290
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,081
She keeps saying...
"I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow."

291
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,900
What if she shows up?

292
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,178
Well she should've kept her word then.
Never mind. Come on!

293
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,220
Guys, I can't carry anything heavy!

294
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,060
Come on, let's eat.

295
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,180
Rana, dear!

296
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,900
Yes, dear?

297
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,060
Honey... the charger.

298
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,961
<i>I'll turn into words,
run through your ears...</i>

299
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:28,462
<i>I'll turn into thoughts,
stick in your head...</i>

300
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:31,962
<i>I'll be a Benz,
race under your feet...</i>

301
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,663
<i>I'll be poverty
in your purse...</i>

302
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,963
<i>I'll be a wolf,
raid your herd.</i>

303
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,058
You two, go to the door and
bring over one of those boxes.

304
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,858
Hi guys.

305
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,538
Are these your 206's car parts, Sir?

306
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:24,939
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

307
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:27,580
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

308
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,738
Very good guys, I want the
poem memorized for next time.

309
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:31,859
Okay.

310
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:32,620
Okay.

311
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,860
Thank you.

312
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,098
Bye, Sir.

313
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Bye.

314
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,180
- Bye, Sir!
- So, long.

315
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,818
Thanks Sir.

316
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Goodbye.

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,040
- Sir, can I say something?
- What?

318
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,940
Sir, I was really pissed off
the other day.

319
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,180
Which day?

320
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,700
The day, that woman
insulted you in the Taxi.

321
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,898
Was it an insult?

322
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,018
You know, that she said, she
wants to sit in the front seat.

323
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,538
Sir, after you got out of the car, I
told them that you were my teacher.

324
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,660
And that we all love you so much.
Like, all the guys.

325
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,400
- What was your first name, again?
- Amin.

326
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,140
Amin, I'm sure, some guy must've done
something to her in a taxi before...

327
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:51,341
to make her think
that way about everyone.

328
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,658
Don't worry about it, it's just the
first 100 years that are tough.

329
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,578
So long.

330
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,500
- Bye, sir.
- Bye.

331
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,340
Okay.

332
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,441
Of all the time...

333
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,460
I don't know what to do with her.

334
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,860
Who?

335
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,700
This woman

336
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,660
I called to ask when she'll
clear her stuff out.

337
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,738
She got angry,
started threatening...

338
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,900
Over what?

339
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,178
"Why did you touch my personal things?
Those were my private stuff...

340
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,938
I'll sue you..."

341
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,038
Last night I was running around, saving her
stuff from the rain, up until morning.

342
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,980
Her problem's something else...

343
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,680
- Who Babak, the woman?
- Yeah.

344
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,140
When's she coming
to get her stuff?

345
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
Says, whenever she finds a place.

346
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,060
Sadra, darling, come here with me.
Hurry up.

347
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,900
Hurry up guys, the audience
will be in in five minutes.

348
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:29,701
Emad... Emad...

349
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,818
They're coming here
again after the performance.

350
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,680
They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions,
there's another three left.

351
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,381
Stay around and talk to them.

352
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,879
- Tonight, after the performance?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,258
If it helps, I'll stay.

354
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,440
Sure, or else they might cancel
the whole show tomorrow.

355
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,540
- How many did they say?
- Three... Guys will you please hurry up!

356
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,620
I'll go, then.

357
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,420
Won't you wait around?

358
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,160
No, you'll be stuck here
until around midnight.

359
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
Take the car, then.

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
Where are the house keys?

361
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,418
In my coat's pocket.

362
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,420
- Have a good performance.
- You too!

363
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,040
Say, on your way back, if
the supermarket's open...

364
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,241
buy something, we've got
nothing for breakfast.

365
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,920
Yes, I said, if it's...
if it's open!

366
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,060
Also, pick up some
hand sanitizer.

367
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:56,661
Maybe I take a shower
until you get here.

368
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,040
No, not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't
even wiped off my stage makeup.

369
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll be out soon... soon.

370
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,101
Yup... love you, bye.

371
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,378
- Anything else?
- That's all, thanks.

372
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,418
Be my guest.
Are you paying by card?

373
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,940
No, cash.

374
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,138
- Yes?
- Hello, Ma'am.

375
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,640
Hello.

376
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,018
Good evening, I'm your
upstairs neighbor.

377
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,420
We've just moved in, could
you open the door, please?

378
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,300
Thank you.

379
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,380
Rana!

380
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,300
Rana!

381
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,420
Rana!

382
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,858
Rana!

383
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,978
What happened to you?

384
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,578
Please, step outside, Sir.

385
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,560
You can't be in here, Sir.
We'll call you for the CT scan.

386
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,580
- Wait outside, please.
- Look at me, Rana!

387
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,940
Everything's fine, I'll call
you for the CT scan... Please.

388
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,900
Make sure you change the
locks, first thing tomorrow.

389
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,660
Why? Did someone
get into the house?

390
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,661
I thought she'd fainted,
was dizzy or...

391
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,140
We don't know what happened yet.

392
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,860
All of a sudden we heard shouting
and screaming from upstairs.

393
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,740
Not like, normal, not once,
scream after scream...

394
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,541
I told him go upstairs and check, he said,
couples get into fights all the time.

395
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,332
Then, we heard some heavy
bangs in the stairs,

396
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:13,120
I told him "Muhammad, God
knows, something's up."

397
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,640
Who was it?

398
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,800
When we reached the stairs, we
just saw someone fleeing up the street.

399
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,178
I don't know what happened to his foot,
but, it had bled all over the stairs.

400
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,880
If I'd caught him, 
he'd be dead now.

401
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,720
Then we went upstairs and found
your wife unconscious...

402
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:29,665
there was blood all over
the bathroom floor.

403
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,246
I dressed her and 
brought her here.

404
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,418
Never mind that, thank God
something worse didn't happen.

405
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,620
Woman, do us a favor, go to the ER,
check if there's any news or something.

406
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,618
Sorry for putting you
to all this trouble.

407
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,060
Have a seat, 
sit down, son.

408
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,680
Was anything missing
from the house?

409
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,900
I don't know.
I didn't notice anything.

410
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,240
I don't think it was a robbery. What
would a thief be doing in the bathroom?

411
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,418
Then, who was it?

412
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,658
The guy was one of
that woman's customers.

413
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,900
Who? What woman?

414
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,580
The woman who lived there
before you moving in.

415
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,740
Tell you the truth, she
was kind of messed up...

416
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:21,141
and I think, the guy came here on
account of her still being there.

417
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,740
Don't close the door, 
Ali's coming up.

418
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,280
Sure.

419
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,340
Come on, lie down.

420
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,900
Grab my sleeve, hold it.

421
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,500
Thanks.

422
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,560
Wait, let me take off your scarf.

423
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,638
- You want me to add another pillow?
- No

424
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,120
Turn off the light, 
so she can sleep.

425
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,980
Don't turn it off.

426
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,680
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

427
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,140
Where are you going, Emad?

428
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,418
Darling?

429
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,898
I said, where are you going?

430
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,738
I'm not going anywhere, I'm here.
You need anything?

431
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,460
Nope. 
Leave the door open.

432
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,020
Okay, thanks.

433
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,381
Look, her blood pressure's low,
careful when she's walking.

434
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,380
Thanks for everything.

435
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,818
Sit down guys, I'll make
you some breakfast.

436
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,280
No, thanks, we're late.

437
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,700
Come on, you haven't
eaten since last night.

438
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,080
Kati, you wanna stay here, and
make soup or something for them?

439
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,081
- You want me to stay?
- You want Kati to stay?

440
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,220
- No, no.
- You sure?

441
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,220
You must be tired.
Go, get some rest.

442
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,380
- Call if you need anything.
- Really, man, just let us know.

443
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,380
- Thanks again for everything, guys.
- Bye

444
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,111
<i>scrap metal... Iron doors...
Aluminum doors...</i>

445
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:37,565
<i>Fences... Metal dishes...
buying...</i>

446
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:50,660
<i>scrap metal... lamps... Samovars...
anything, bring it over...</i>

447
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,980
Come on, stand here while
I use the bathroom.

448
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,898
What are you doing?

449
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,680
- Leave it, I'll wash it myself, Rana, dear!
- Come and wash it then.

450
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,801
Alright, turn off the water
and come out.

451
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,260
Then, come and clean it
before I use it.

452
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,060
The police might 
need to see it.

453
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,980
Yes?

454
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,340
Of course, sorry.

455
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,380
Who was it?

456
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,420
One of the neighbors.

457
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,320
- What did they say?
- I'll be right back.

458
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,100
Sorry.

459
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,598
Sorry for all
the trouble, ma'am.

460
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Now, come on, don't say that.
If you ask me, you better call 110...

461
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:26,161
they'll be able to track
him down from his car.

462
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,660
Yeah, definitely. Anyways,
I'll try to find some place...

463
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,580
I thought, when that woman left,
she took all her troubles with her.

464
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,340
Have you ever seen this
car's owner around here?

465
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,058
Well, it wasn't like, just a
coupla guys visiting her.

466
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,540
I might have to trouble you
again when the police comes...

467
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,661
to explain what you exactly saw.

468
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,058
Yeah, sure. Would you like to
take my cell number?

469
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,978
Yes, please.

470
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,398
- I'll get going.
- Thank you so much, ma'am.

471
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,062
They should tie an ewer
around these guys' necks...

472
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:55,020
parade them around
the city, shaming them.

473
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:56,820
0912...

474
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,098
Why are you out here?
Come in.

475
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,340
I'm scared of being
alone in the house.

476
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,940
Where were you?

477
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,700
I went to thank the
neighbors for last night.

478
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,438
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

479
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,498
They asked how you were.

480
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,060
You didn't tell Kati and the
guys what happened, did you?

481
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,300
No.

482
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,820
Okay, I'm going to
the police station...

483
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,500
to file a complaint for them
to start looking for the guy.

484
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,698
How're they gonna find him?

485
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,538
He left his pickup.

486
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,580
And his mobile,
but it's disconnected.

487
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,980
Who was he, Emad?

488
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,140
The neighbors say the woman who
lived here before us, was shady.

489
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,140
The scumbag must've been
one of her customers.

490
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,841
Came here
on account of her.

491
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,540
You remember what he
looked like?

492
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,260
No.

493
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Didn't you get a look at him?

494
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,680
It's cold. Come inside,
you'll catch a cold.

495
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,900
Gimme that.

496
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,500
Who got me
out of the bathroom?

497
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,140
One of the neighbors.

498
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,718
Which one?

499
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,900
I don't know, 
just forget it.

500
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,260
Eat your breakfast. And
then go get some rest.

501
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,540
I can't. As soon as I close my
eyes that scene comes to my mind.

502
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,500
How did he get in?

503
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,580
I opened the door,
I thought it was you.

504
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,100
I came out of the bathroom, buzzed
him in, and then went back.

505
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,300
I was shampooing my hair when I
realized someone had come in.

506
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,820
He put his hand in my hair from
behind, I thought it's you.

507
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,660
Then, I saw his hands,
and after that, it's blank.

508
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,820
Rana...

509
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,540
Darling, have some breakfast.

510
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
Rana, dear...

511
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,740
Sweetie...

512
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,540
What about tonight's performance?

513
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,740
I called and told them
to cancel it.

514
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,798
- No, call and say I'm coming.
- How? In this condition of yours?

515
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,720
It's harder for me to
stay at home.

516
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,656
Put this on,
let's go to the police station.

517
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,725
We might get held up there
for a while anyways.

518
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,780
No, leave it.
Let's not go to the station.

519
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,600
We can't just do nothing!

520
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,400
I don't want to go
stand there, and...

521
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:50,201
tell a bunch of officers or
whoever what happened.

522
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,020
Did something happen
that you can't tell?

523
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,138
No.

524
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,900
Then, don't say anything.
I'll tell 'em myself.

525
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,500
I can't, it'll be too much.

526
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,100
No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.

527
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,180
When I'm walking in the street,
I clearly feel these things...

528
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:21,681
They pass me by, but it's as if they're
laughing at me with their eyes.

529
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,260
Why? Why would they laugh at you? Don't
talk that way about yourself, Willy.

530
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,540
Sometimes they pass me by
as if I don't even exist.

531
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,780
As though nobody sees me.
Nobody notices me. Nothing.

532
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,340
Linda?

533
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:52,620
How long are you going to spend
repairing those socks, huh?

534
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,300
You know it makes me angry.

535
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:59,301
At least don't do it while I'm
home, talking to you. Okay?

536
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,860
Okay, let's talk about something else,
like, my income.

537
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,500
My never-changing income.
God, this is really ridiculous.

538
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,960
<i>What's wrong with you? Why
aren't you saying your lines?</i>

539
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,260
Willy, darling, you're the most
handsome man in the world to me.

540
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,898
You always say this to me, Linda,
always, but it doesn't help me at all.

541
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,258
I'll never be able to make
you happy, you know why?

542
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,500
Because, I'm just a salesman.
I'm nothing! Nothing, Linda!

543
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,180
But, I always tried... why
are you crying, anyways?

544
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,580
Wait, where are you going?

545
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,060
Linda, come back...

546
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,860
Sorry, I have to stop the play.
I apologize to you all.

547
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,358
My wife, the other actor,
isn't feeling well.

548
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:08,857
Please, give us a
ten-minute intermission.

549
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:09,550
Sorry.

550
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,618
Can you carry on?

551
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,580
Carry on what, Kati? Can't you see
she's not well? Go, cancel it.

552
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,420
You wanna go to the other
room and lie down a little?

553
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,180
Alright, guys, let's clear the room.
She's not well.

554
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,338
Sanam, dear.

555
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,218
I'm coming.

556
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,220
Can I get you anything?

557
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,100
Kati darling...

558
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,460
Go and cancel the show.

559
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
What happened there?

560
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,380
The way someone in the audience
was staring at me bothered me.

561
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,860
The audience want to watch the play,
of course they'll be looking at you.

562
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,380
Looked at me just like that guy.

563
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,098
I thought you said
you didn't see him.

564
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,300
I'm really unwell, I just
don't know what to do.

565
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,978
Babak, come here a minute.

566
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,500
Coming...

567
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,500
Is she feeling better?

568
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,000
Goddammit, man,
what can I say to you...?

569
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:46,801
Don't you think you had to let me know
what kind of people used to live there?

570
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,618
- What's happened?
- You're supposed to be my friend.

571
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,500
Seriously, what's happened? What is
it to you who lived there before?

572
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,500
That apartment's infamous
in the whole neighborhood.

573
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,380
- Who's said that?
- Let's say nobody's said anything...

574
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:01,438
why isn't this woman coming
to collect her stuff?

575
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,620
I just wanted to help.
Remembe last week...

576
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,421
you wanted to
sleep on the set?

577
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,400
Regardless, why did you hide from me
that woman's line of work?

578
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,440
What hiding?

579
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,160
Well, yeah. 
Did you tell me or not?

580
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,778
Was I supposed to pass on to you
some unfounded gossip? To upset you?

581
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,018
Well, what's going, anyways?
What's this all about?

582
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,418
Babak, I'm going

583
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,060
I'm coming.

584
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,600
Go take a look at Rana,
you'll see what this is all about.

585
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,080
They said she slipped
in the bathroom.

586
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,260
We said right in front of you we
might be having a kid in that place.

587
00:47:36,361 --> 00:47:38,041
And you didn't say a word,
what kind of...

588
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,140
You were joking!

589
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,458
If we weren't joking,
would you have told us?

590
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,618
Told you what?
Gimme a break!

591
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,780
Put yourself in my shoes, that same
room we sleep in, each night...

592
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:54,281
how many strange men have
been with that woman.

593
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,698
Don't take it so hard on yourself.
I haven't cashed your check yet.

594
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,140
Whenever you find another place whose
previous tenants had your approval,

595
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,525
you can move out.

596
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,638
- Hello.
- Hello

597
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:18,661
How are you doing.

598
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,658
Careful not to slip on the stairs
Mrs. Shahnazari, they're wet.

599
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:31,018
I was actually going to ask the cleaner
to come early and sort these out.

600
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,258
But, I thought you'd want to report it,
the police might want to see them.

601
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,980
Well, it wasn't such a big deal.

602
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,947
You wouldn't say it
if you'd been there and...

603
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:45,270
seen the state your wife was in,
on the bathroom floor.

604
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,559
When Mr. Alimoradi opened
the bathroom door,

605
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:53,098
he thought, God forbid,
your wife was dead.

606
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,900
Say hello for me
to your wife.

607
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,180
Get up, I've made you
some breakfast.

608
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,458
- I'm heading out.
- Wait!

609
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,458
Wait, let me get ready
and come with you.

610
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,420
Where to? I have class.

611
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,180
I know, I'll wait in the car.

612
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,020
It's not just an hour or
two, you'll get tired.

613
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,580
Then, don't go today.

614
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,378
What?

615
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,700
I said, don't go today.

616
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,578
Let's say I don't, what
about tomorrow then?

617
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,178
The day after tomorrow?
It's not gonna work.

618
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,900
I can't stay here alone.

619
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,780
I said, I don't want
to be here alone.

620
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,484
What can I do?

621
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:43,885
You want me to get you a ticket to
visit your parents for a few days?

622
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,100
Looking like this?

623
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,200
I've made up my mind...

624
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:54,301
we either have to go to the police,
or forget this altogether.

625
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,858
Okay, forget it, but let's look for
a place, right from today.

626
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,338
Okay, we'll start looking.

627
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,178
But until we find somewhere, you
need to try and pick yourself up.

628
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,138
What?! It's not something
I can control.

629
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,239
You taking your pills, and not staying up
at nights getting worked up about it...

630
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:09,905
is up to you, isn't it?

631
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,440
Go take a shower.
Here, I'll wait right here.

632
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,980
I don't want to go in
that bathroom.

633
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,818
I'll drop you off at a friend's place.
Use theirs.

634
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,500
Go and tell them we've
come to take a shower?

635
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,640
So, what do you want me to do?

636
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,860
You keep changing your mind.

637
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,795
At night you tell me
not to come near you,

638
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,418
then in the morning you
tell me not to leave you.

639
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,338
Just tell me what the hell
am I supposed to do?

640
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,978
Just go, you're late.

641
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,530
It'll take a couple of weeks
to find a new place.

642
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:43,167
What?

643
00:50:43,193 --> 00:50:46,445
You're not gonna wash up
with that wound of yours?

644
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,900
Sweetheart!

645
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,898
Just think, it could've 
been worse.

646
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,010
What if a piece of glass
had gone in your eye, or...

647
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:16,919
your head had been
hit harder? Then...

648
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,960
then, what the hell
would I have done?

649
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,340
I wish my head
had been hit harder.

650
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,260
God forbid! Honey, don't
say things like that.

651
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,580
Hello, Mr. Etesami.

652
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,420
Hello Sir, how are you doing?

653
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,460
Mr. Yeganeh gave me these
books to give them to you.

654
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,860
Be quiet. 
What's so funny?

655
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,418
Why?

656
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,940
He said they're not
suitable for kids.

657
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,380
Quiet!

658
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,620
Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't
suitable for the kids?

659
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,820
Go, throw them in the trash can.

660
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,738
Why the trash can?

661
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,140
Trash can. Throw them
in the trash can.

662
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,858
Give me your phone.

663
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,138
I don't have a phone, Sir.

664
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,858
Give it to me.

665
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,980
I don't have a cell.

666
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,180
Sir, wait a minute.

667
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,538
Give it to me.

668
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,020
Sir, there's nothing
in it about you.

669
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,938
I want to see what you have.

670
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,858
I've deleted it.

671
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,218
Let me see it.

672
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,018
Sir, please, I've deleted it.

673
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,060
Sir, I have private photos 
in there.

674
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,498
Put your hand down.

675
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,780
That's not fair.

676
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,780
Mr. Etesami?

677
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,700
Sir?

678
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,300
I have personal things on there.
I deleted the video.

679
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,500
On my mother's life, 
I deleted it.

680
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,806
Sir, send it on Telegram, for everyone to see.
It beats watching this movie.

681
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,700
I'll kick you out of the class,
if you say another word.

682
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,098
Mr. Etesami!

683
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,698
Sorry, Sir.

684
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,878
You stay out of this!

685
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,140
I mean all of you.

686
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:11,941
I'm talking to him.

687
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,900
I deleted it.

688
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,900
Please.

689
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,544
Call your father to come to
the school, he needs to see...

690
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:23,625
the kind of photos
you have on your cell.

691
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,020
His dad's dead, Sir.

692
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,798
- Hi, sorry about that.
- Hi, no problem.

693
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:27,673
If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it,
you can leave it in the corner.

694
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,659
Next to the boiler room.

695
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,018
When my husband gets back, he'll
move it to a better place.

696
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,418
I don't want you to keep
going up and down the stairs.

697
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,658
I'm going out for a couple of
hours, you can take my spot.

698
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,698
Don't worry, I'll find
a better place for it.

699
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,418
- Suit yourself.
- Sorry.

700
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:45,058
If you give me the keys,
I can move it for you.

701
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,740
Thanks.

702
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,818
My wife said, you're not
going to report it.

703
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,458
No.

704
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,778
You're doing the right thing, they won't
do anything, even if they catch him.

705
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:01,420
And you'll have to explain over
and over why you opened the door

706
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,821
plus trekking back
and forth to the court.

707
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,738
Endless hassle for nothing.

708
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,138
But, he'll probably be back for his car.
Please, call me if he shows up.

709
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,140
I'll sort out that bastard.

710
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:28,778
I'll take mine out and
then come and park yours.

711
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,538
There's no need,
I'll do it myself.

712
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,020
Okay, then, goodbye. Thanks.

713
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,340
Goodbye.

714
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,018
How's it going?

715
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,378
Hey, you okay?
Is Rana here?

716
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,778
- No, wasn't she with you?
- She's coming on her own.

717
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,700
Any news about the guy?

718
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,620
What guy?

719
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,440
Babak had heard some things
from your neighbors.

720
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,098
Where is he? Is he here?

721
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,178
Babak?

722
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,940
Yep, he's back there.

723
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,380
Hi.

724
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,298
Hi.

725
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,980
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

726
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,618
What should I have told you?

727
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,240
About the man turning up
the other night.

728
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,760
How's Rana?

729
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,140
The neighbors have told you.

730
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,258
They're also worried...

731
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,458
Tell 'em nothing happened,
the guy just barged in.

732
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,618
Then, why are you
keeping his pickup?

733
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,620
Shahnazari said it's
in the parking lot.

734
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,818
Tell 'em we'll be gone soon
we're looking for a new place.

735
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,098
Where will you go?
Like, I'm gonna let you.

736
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,620
Can you find that previous tenant,
and arrange a meeting for me?

737
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,218
Why?

738
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,218
I wanna talk to her.

739
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,218
Ask her why she did this.

740
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,140
Did what?

741
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,218
Did what?

742
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,858
- Sent this thug to our house.
- Why would she do that?

743
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,738
You said yourself, she made threats
about us touching her stuff.

744
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,034
She's nothing like that.

745
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,700
She hasn't taken her stuff because
she still hasn't found a place.

746
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:35,201
She was just mad at me
that day.

747
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,340
Hello.

748
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,938
Feeling better?

749
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,980
Yep, I'm fine, thanks.

750
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,300
Did you tell the guys?

751
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,378
No.

752
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,978
Then how do they know?

753
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,658
One of the neighbor
called Babak.

754
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,500
I'm not sure what they said.

755
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,240
Emad, get dressed and
come for the make up.

756
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,260
My outfit's not here.

757
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,420
Kati's going to take
your place tonight.

758
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,898
And you accepted,
just like that?

759
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,060
What can I do?
It's not up to me.

760
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,258
The director wanted her
to replace you tonight.

761
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,618
If you're alright, and you can
do it, I'll go talk to her.

762
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,300
No, I don't want to.

763
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,380
Have you started
house-hunting?

764
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,660
No, I will do,
when I get time.

765
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,058
When you get time! Like it doesn't
matter how I feel in that place!

766
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,538
You haven't done anything.

767
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,980
Huh?

768
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,458
I want us to go to the police, but
you won't let me. What do you mean?

769
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,818
You said you'd drop by the school, find
a substitute teacher, and pick me up.

770
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,640
Well, I couldn't find anyone.

771
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,940
Auntie?

772
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,938
Yes, Baby?

773
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,660
Why aren't you acting tonight?

774
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,498
I'm not feeling well 
tonight, darling.

775
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,818
Why did you come here then?

776
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,138
I get bored at home.

777
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,618
What?

778
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,980
I get bored at home.

779
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,500
Well... I get bored here.

780
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,500
Would you like to come to
our house this evening?

781
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,898
Do you have SpongeBob?

782
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,138
No, but we can go buy it
on the way home.

783
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,698
From tomorrow you really
need to perform again.

784
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,900
Everything's topsy-turvy.
Everybody's making mistakes.

785
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,338
Why?

786
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,338
I don't know, everyone's upset.

787
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,438
You're better now, you
should act again tomorrow.

788
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,138
- Mommy!
- Darling?

789
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,158
- Can I go to Auntie's house?
- No, baby.

790
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:00,058
Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone.
I'll bring him with me tomorrow.

791
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:05,320
He can't, his dad's coming to pick
him up to go to his house tomorrow.

792
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,340
Well, his dad can pick
him up from our place.

793
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,578
You wanna go?

794
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,420
Yes!

795
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,658
You won't be a nuisance
to Auntie Rana?

796
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,260
He won't.

797
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,620
Tell Emad we're taking the car.

798
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,820
Let me bring his things.

799
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,458
I need to pee, auntie.

800
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,460
I know, go on, go inside.

801
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,098
Whose bike is this?

802
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,260
That... belongs to some kid.

803
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,178
Where's the kid?

804
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,698
The kid's not here anymore.

805
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,898
Where did he go?

806
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,698
Huh?

807
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,380
Where'd he go?

808
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,298
Moved to a new house.
Don't you need to pee?

809
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,018
Oh, yes!

810
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,300
Go on then.

811
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,020
Not that one, over here.

812
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:08,900
Well...

813
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,218
it's dark!

814
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,540
I'm coming...

815
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,858
It's scary in there.

816
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,860
Come on.

817
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,740
No, I don't need 
to go anymore.

818
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,738
Let me help.

819
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:30,660
No, if you go...
I... I'll do it.

820
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,138
Are you feeling shy
in front of me?

821
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,020
Nope!

822
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,940
Can you go yourself?

823
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,900
I'm drawing his mustache.

824
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,940
Yes?

825
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,900
Come up, dear.

826
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,660
Who was it?

827
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,658
Uncle Emad.

828
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,578
If it's my dad, then, tell
him Sadra's not here.

829
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,700
Why?

830
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,138
Because I love my Mom.

831
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,220
Okay.

832
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,060
Rana!

833
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:40,898
Hey.

834
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,658
The pickup isn't 
in the parking.

835
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,658
I parked it outside 
this morning.

836
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,258
Why outside?

837
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,778
I didn't fancy moving it
every ten minutes.

838
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,698
Hello!

839
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,578
Helloooo, how are you, kiddo?

840
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,978
Where are the keys?

841
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,500
Where you'd left them.

842
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,298
How are things 
with my favorite?

843
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,180
Welcome to our house, all good?

844
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,780
Welcome!

845
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,058
Leave it where it is, Emad.

846
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:09,858
I'll be right back.

847
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,860
Emad... Emad...

848
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,898
Let's forget it for
one night, just leave it.

849
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,100
I've made dinner,
go wash up and change.

850
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,820
Go on, darling.

851
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,220
<i>Ready for takeoff,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

852
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,620
Sadra!

853
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,098
Yes!

854
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,098
Emad, it's ready,
come before it gets cold.

855
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,300
Coming.

856
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,298
Let's go wash
those hands of yours.

857
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,978
My hands are clean!

858
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,298
Wash 'em again anyways.

859
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,540
Wow, wow, wow,
look at this!

860
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,140
Thanks so much.

861
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,658
Hands off!

862
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,778
<i>Rana, where are you?</i>

863
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,420
<i>Sadra, come and eat!</i>

864
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,458
Helllllo.

865
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,178
You, rascal! You two were out,
having fun without me?

866
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,439
We went shopping
we hung out together.

867
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,258
But, we didn't 
find SpongeBob.

868
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,258
Yes, unfortunately.

869
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,900
<i>Don't worry, Patrick, eventually a good day
will come when you and I will find someone.</i>

870
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,980
<i>Look at this, SpongeBob!</i>

871
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,100
<i>Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni!</i>

872
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,898
More?

873
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,220
No, no, that's enough.

874
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,378
Okay, just let me know.

875
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,180
Thank you.

876
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,458
Wow, what a nice macaroni!

877
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,458
Bon appetit!

878
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,420
Let's eat it all.

879
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,218
Look what she's made.

880
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,420
Yeah, I know!

881
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,540
How was tonight's performance?

882
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,780
Very...

883
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:02,380
not that great.

884
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,978
It was terrible.

885
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,298
You're lying.

886
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,580
That's how it is without you.

887
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,858
Did you find the credit card?

888
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,220
No.

889
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,860
How did you go shopping?

890
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,980
With the money you left.

891
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,858
What money?

892
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,900
In the drawer.

893
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,540
Why aren't you eating?
Don't you like it?

894
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,380
Is it not yummy?

895
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,860
Don't eat it.

896
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,700
What's up?

897
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,560
It's the money that
scumbag left, that night.

898
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,380
Sadra?

899
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,380
I've got an idea.

900
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,858
Do you like pizza?

901
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,820
Yep.

902
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,100
Then let's order 
some pizza.

903
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,260
Don't eat that, 
it's not good.

904
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,620
What about fries?

905
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,300
And after that, 
Ice Cream, huh?

906
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,001
- Hi there. Gimme a call 
when you can.

907
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,100
Hello? Mum? Mummy?

908
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:11,980
Hello? Ahoo, dear?
You there?

909
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:16,940
It's the 3rd time I'm calling.

910
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,260
Ahoo, darling, it's Babak.

911
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:26,780
Ahoo... Ahooooo...

912
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,980
Are you there?

913
01:08:32,181 --> 01:08:33,481
Guess not.

914
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:39,860
Gimme a call when you get
home, I'll be up late.

915
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,940
What are you doing?

916
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,420
Nothing.

917
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,460
Come on, go sleep.

918
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,500
You haven't slept 
for two nights

919
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,580
I can't sleep.

920
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,578
Why did you open 
her letters?

921
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,018
It's her private stuff.

922
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,498
I wanna find out who the
hell that scumbag was.

923
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,120
Let's say you found out...

924
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,898
He'll say it was a mistake.

925
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,658
He came inside by mistake?

926
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,098
He rang the bell
and I opened the door.

927
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,538
He must've thought it's her,
since I opened the door so easily.

928
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,700
He came here by mistake.

929
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,138
What about when he
realized his mistake?

930
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,858
Why didn't he leave?

931
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,918
Because, the bathroom light was on,
and there was a woman in there?

932
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,340
- How could he know it's a wom...
- From your clothes on the bed.

933
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,998
If I'd just used the damn intercom,
asked who it was...

934
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,900
None of this would've happened.

935
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,018
If you think it's that simple...

936
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,900
You can just tell all the
neighbors about the intercom...

937
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,618
Why are you getting the
neighbors into this?

938
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,298
They knew what was
going on in this house.

939
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,258
So, you're fine with it
if they didn't know?

940
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,260
What are you on about?

941
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,161
Leave me alone.

942
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,978
The pickup's not there.

943
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:14,620
What?

944
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,460
Sorry.

945
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,140
Where was it?

946
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,618
There.

947
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,100
Sorry.

948
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,858
Where did you leave it?

949
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,060
I left it there.

950
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,780
Where?

951
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,160
Over there, where that Peugeot is.

952
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,740
He's taken it

953
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,980
I have to find that asshole.

954
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,660
Jackass!

955
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,340
Okay, slow down!

956
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,460
You're gonna freeze in there.

957
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,538
Never mind.

958
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,738
What do you mean, never mind?
You'll get sick.

959
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,158
Let's go to a public bath.

960
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,560
No, I'll be out quick.
Just wait here.

961
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,218
Hasanpoor, come here a sec.

962
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,980
Hello.

963
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,018
What can I do for you, Sir?

964
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,898
Hi.

965
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
How's it going?

966
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,298
Your dad was a 
traffic cop, right?

967
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,780
He's retired now, why?

968
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,158
- A car hit my wife and drove off.
- Nothing serious, I hope?

969
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,900
No, thank God.

970
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,018
It was a pickup, if I give
you the number plate...

971
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,978
Can your dad find the guy's address?
If it's not too much trouble, that is.

972
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,856
Sure, he has contacts
in the department.

973
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:33,098
If you gimme the license
plate, he can find out.

974
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,138
But, I think you 
should report it.

975
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:39,058
It wasn't anything serious, so I
don't wanna get the police mixed up.

976
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,620
Okay, gimme the registration
and I'll call my Dad.

977
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:44,532
- Get a pen and a paper, then.
- 'Kay.

978
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:52,083
Why don’t you want
to work for me?

979
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,223
Have you lost your mind, Charlie?
I've got a job.

980
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:57,424
Then what’re you walkin’
in here every week for?

981
01:13:02,225 --> 01:13:04,325
Well, if you don’t want
me to walk in here...

982
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:06,177
I'm offering you a job.

983
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:10,527
I don't want your goddam job! I've
got one already. Get outa my way!

984
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:13,028
When the hell are you
going to grow up, huh?

985
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:16,029
Goddam you, Charlie!
You, big ignoramus!

986
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:20,830
Big ignoramus! How dare
you talk to me like that?

987
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:24,031
If you say that to me
again, I’ll rap you one!

988
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:28,532
I don’t care how big you are!

989
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:31,233
You, degenerate!

990
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:45,733
What's wrong with you tonight?

991
01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:47,234
What did I do?

992
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:48,835
Why are you adding dialogues?

993
01:13:49,436 --> 01:13:50,136
What did I add?

994
01:13:50,837 --> 01:13:53,037
If you've got a problem with
me, let's sit and talk.

995
01:13:53,238 --> 01:13:55,638
Not on the stage, calling
me, "You degenerate!"

996
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,139
It's neither improvisation, nor
acting, you're insulting me.

997
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,840
What? 
Did I hurt your feeling?

998
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:01,141
Yeah.

999
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:04,242
And if you do that one more time, I'll
answer you right in front of everyone.

1000
01:14:04,643 --> 01:14:07,143
Degenerate is the one who speaks
his mind through swearing.

1001
01:14:07,344 --> 01:14:08,144
Didn't know that.

1002
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:10,245
I'm really sorry.

1003
01:14:26,245 --> 01:14:28,145
Bakery.

1004
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:37,846
Hello, how're you doing?

1005
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:51,947
<i>Speaking Azeri.</i>

1006
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:02,748
What can I do for you?

1007
01:15:03,849 --> 01:15:04,729
Two baguettes, please.

1008
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,550
- You want 'em cut?
- Thanks a lot.

1009
01:15:11,251 --> 01:15:13,651
- That pickup's yours?
- Why?

1010
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:16,452
There's an officer writing tickets,
from the top of the street.

1011
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:19,253
Majid, come here,
move the car.

1012
01:15:19,654 --> 01:15:21,854
Before the officer
slaps a ticket on it.

1013
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:33,655
Soheil, bring the keys.

1014
01:15:38,256 --> 01:15:39,177
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1015
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:41,157
Later.

1016
01:15:41,858 --> 01:15:42,658
Bye.

1017
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:44,659
Here you go, Sir.

1018
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,860
Thanks.

1019
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:29,061
Thanks, dude.
I'll take a water.

1020
01:16:30,562 --> 01:16:32,262
Hello, mister, sorry
is that your pickup?

1021
01:16:32,863 --> 01:16:33,663
Yeah.

1022
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,464
I had some load, I wanted to
ask you to move it for me.

1023
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:37,945
Nah, that pickup
is for a store.

1024
01:16:38,366 --> 01:16:39,806
Well, not now,
whenever you're free.

1025
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:42,308
No, it's just that, 
I do something else. I don't do that.

1026
01:16:42,468 --> 01:16:43,868
Not even Friday?

1027
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:44,569
Nah.

1028
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:46,994
You can find pickups at
the top of Haft-e-Tir.

1029
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,030
No, it's just that,

1030
01:16:48,056 --> 01:16:51,095
my stuff are books and paintings,
I was looking for a softopper.

1031
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:54,271
You know, on account of
rain or things like that.

1032
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:56,072
I'm really busy.
I don't have time.

1033
01:16:56,373 --> 01:16:59,473
I don't care about the fee. I'll pay. I
just want my stuff to get there safe.

1034
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,474
It's just that, I'm busy.
I can't.

1035
01:17:01,675 --> 01:17:03,995
Majid, come on, man. Help the guy.
Late night or something.

1036
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:07,776
Well, how about you gimme your number?
I'll call you whenever you say.

1037
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:10,177
And if you come yourself,
even better.

1038
01:17:10,278 --> 01:17:12,478
Bro, find some time between
your schedule for him.

1039
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:17,179
Careful not to hit the walls.

1040
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,680
Ah! What're you doing here?

1041
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:27,881
Come here... kitty...

1042
01:17:31,882 --> 01:17:33,322
Careful with that
not to scratch it.

1043
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,583
Babak, tell 'em to come
have a cup of tea.

1044
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:39,384
- There's no need for that.
- It's getting cold.

1045
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:44,985
Where are you taking these?

1046
01:17:45,086 --> 01:17:48,886
I'm taking 'em to my parents' parking lot.
We'll see what happens.

1047
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:50,287
Won't she come to take 'em?

1048
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:53,688
She's got problems of her own.
She hasn't found a place yet.

1049
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,090
Get up, Babak wants to take
away that woman's stuff.

1050
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:04,991
What do you want me to do?

1051
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:10,892
What's going on
between you two?

1052
01:18:11,193 --> 01:18:13,334
Nothing, let him take 'em.
That's okay with me.

1053
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:22,894
Hello? Majid?

1054
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:25,595
It's me, Etesami, 
coupla days ago.

1055
01:18:25,796 --> 01:18:27,496
You free today?

1056
01:18:28,397 --> 01:18:29,397
How about Friday?

1057
01:19:33,897 --> 01:19:34,997
Yeah?

1058
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:37,198
You?

1059
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:41,999
Yeah, come on up.

1060
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,698
Hello, can I help you?

1061
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,099
Hello, Sir. You okay? Have
I come to the right place?

1062
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,280
Majid said, there's some
stuff you need to move.

1063
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:11,801
That's right, come on in.
Why didn't he come himself?

1064
01:20:11,902 --> 01:20:14,802
Well, he was busy,
so he sent me instead.

1065
01:20:16,803 --> 01:20:17,803
- After you.
- You first.

1066
01:20:17,904 --> 01:20:20,204
But, he didn't say anything
about all these stairs.

1067
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:22,405
With this heart of mine.

1068
01:20:22,505 --> 01:20:23,845
Well, if I knew you're coming,

1069
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:26,730
I would've told him about the
stairs, and the broken elevator.

1070
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:31,006
Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir.
Would you gimme a glass of water?

1071
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,307
Have you hired movers?

1072
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:42,107
No, I thought he's coming. And,
we'd take the boxes ourselves.

1073
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,108
Well, the poor guy
was kinda busy today.

1074
01:20:45,409 --> 01:20:47,209
- Is he your son?
- Nah, my son-in-law.

1075
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,510
Doesn't make a difference though.
He's like my own son.

1076
01:20:57,411 --> 01:21:01,511
Sorry, old man, we just moved out.
There's no glasses or anything.

1077
01:21:01,812 --> 01:21:03,692
That's alright, mister.
I'll drink from the tap.

1078
01:21:05,713 --> 01:21:06,913
Where are the boxes?

1079
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,214
In that room.

1080
01:21:09,915 --> 01:21:12,315
We'll see. If there's too
many, we'll call movers.

1081
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:19,216
Give him a call. Maybe he's around
here somewhere. I can pick him up.

1082
01:21:20,017 --> 01:21:21,017
Who?

1083
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,217
Your son-in-law.

1084
01:21:22,918 --> 01:21:26,818
Nah, the poor souls just went shopping
for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony.

1085
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,419
Isn't the janitor
allowed to help here?

1086
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,620
Nah, the building's empty.

1087
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:38,021
The walls caved, the residents
have all moved out.

1088
01:21:38,122 --> 01:21:40,722
Wow, wow! What if it collapses
on us or something?

1089
01:21:41,023 --> 01:21:41,823
Nah.

1090
01:21:42,024 --> 01:21:44,924
Let's take a look and see if
it's worth hiring movers.

1091
01:21:46,025 --> 01:21:46,825
Grandpa!

1092
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:48,426
What?

1093
01:21:48,727 --> 01:21:51,827
Would you come sit here for a sec?
I wanna tell you something.

1094
01:21:51,928 --> 01:21:53,828
Look here, mister, this
isn't my line of work.

1095
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:56,029
Majid said, "there's this guy,
who's called a coupla times...

1096
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:58,930
would you do it?" I
said, okay, why not?

1097
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:00,831
Now, you paying depends on
how generous you're feeling.

1098
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,832
Nah, it's not about... wages,
fees, and stuff like that.

1099
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:08,233
Just sit down. There's
something I have to tell you.

1100
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:13,134
Good news, I hope.

1101
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:18,335
How long do you
know this guy?

1102
01:22:19,036 --> 01:22:20,736
- My son-in-law?
- Yeah.

1103
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:21,737
What for?

1104
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:23,359
I wanna know
if you know him well.

1105
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,659
Well, it's about two years they've
asked for my daughter's hand.

1106
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,140
Have you asked around
about him?

1107
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:33,241
Do you know Majid?

1108
01:22:34,842 --> 01:22:36,942
If there's anything you
know, just tell me.

1109
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:41,843
When my wife and I moved out of
here, we went to a place that...

1110
01:22:43,044 --> 01:22:48,844
its previous tenant was... you
know, a woman of the street.

1111
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:54,845
One night, when I got home a little late.
My wife was alone in the house.

1112
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:59,146
One of these lowlifes on account
of that woman still being there...

1113
01:23:00,347 --> 01:23:01,407
enters my house.

1114
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:05,748
While my wife was
in the bathroom.

1115
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:07,449
The jerk goes
into the bathroom.

1116
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:08,750
Who?

1117
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,751
That filthy
son-in-law of yours.

1118
01:23:14,852 --> 01:23:16,852
Now, how do you know
it was Majid?

1119
01:23:17,053 --> 01:23:20,953
When my wife starts screaming, the
guy makes a run for it, but...

1120
01:23:21,854 --> 01:23:24,095
He was in such a hurry that,
he leaves his pickup behind.

1121
01:23:24,455 --> 01:23:26,955
I found him from his pickup. I
went down to where he works.

1122
01:23:28,256 --> 01:23:31,256
I wanted to go there,
grab hold of him...

1123
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:35,838
and dishonor him in front of
all his co-workers, but...

1124
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,858
I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

1125
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:42,859
This pickup changes hands
a lot in that store.

1126
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,960
That's why I asked him to come here.
To talk to him, and ask...

1127
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,761
if it was him or
someone else.

1128
01:23:47,762 --> 01:23:48,962
Majid's not like that.

1129
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:54,063
if I find out it's been him,
I'll call off everything.

1130
01:23:54,164 --> 01:23:55,464
The wedding and all.

1131
01:24:00,005 --> 01:24:01,765
How's your wife, now?

1132
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:05,666
I don't know what to say.

1133
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:10,967
Let me talk to him tonight.

1134
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:13,268
Give him a call and tell
him I wanna talk to him.

1135
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:15,769
Tell him to come here, I
wanna ask him who's done it.

1136
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:16,670
Well, it's just,

1137
01:24:16,696 --> 01:24:20,495
they've gone with my wife and daughter
for "the exchange of vows" shopping.

1138
01:24:21,571 --> 01:24:23,071
Well, at least give him a call.

1139
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:26,472
Ask him who had his pickup
that night.

1140
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:29,072
When did this happen?

1141
01:24:29,173 --> 01:24:31,773
About two weeks ago.

1142
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:38,674
Okay, so you just let me
talk to him tonight.

1143
01:24:38,975 --> 01:24:40,275
Oh my... oh my...

1144
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,875
But, I wanna talk to him,
old man.

1145
01:24:43,076 --> 01:24:47,676
Wait a second, I wanna talk to him.
... Call him.

1146
01:24:47,877 --> 01:24:50,077
I don't have his number
in my phone.

1147
01:24:50,478 --> 01:24:51,578
I have it.

1148
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,779
When I say call him to come here,
it's because I don't want to...

1149
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,880
go there, make a scene
in front of his co-workers.

1150
01:24:58,881 --> 01:25:00,981
You just let me
make sure it's him.

1151
01:25:01,482 --> 01:25:04,782
I have to talk to him in such a
way that I'll get an answer...

1152
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:06,404
How about I call him
myself, huh?

1153
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:08,984
You want me to do it?

1154
01:25:10,585 --> 01:25:12,285
Okay, let me just
dial his number.

1155
01:25:25,786 --> 01:25:28,986
Hello, Majid? Hi, son...
where are you guys?

1156
01:25:30,287 --> 01:25:32,987
Yeah, I'm here with him.

1157
01:25:35,788 --> 01:25:36,788
Who's with you?

1158
01:25:39,089 --> 01:25:42,989
Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call.
I wanna tell you something.

1159
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:46,790
Call my cell.

1160
01:25:48,191 --> 01:25:50,891
I don't have it memorized.
Ask Moj'gan.

1161
01:25:53,092 --> 01:25:57,192
Okay... it's nothing... Bye.

1162
01:26:00,193 --> 01:26:02,093
He said, he'll call
when he's alone.

1163
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:05,294
Say, what do you do yourself?

1164
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,095
I work with this car of Majid's.
His pickup.

1165
01:26:09,596 --> 01:26:12,296
I sell clothes from the back
of the pickup, at nights.

1166
01:26:12,397 --> 01:26:16,097
And I don't come out during the
day, on account of my heart.

1167
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:17,398
And, how come...

1168
01:26:17,598 --> 01:26:21,498
you don't have your
son-in-law's number?

1169
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:24,599
Well, I just don't. Not
just him, a lot of people.

1170
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,200
Have you just bought
this number of yours?

1171
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:28,301
No.

1172
01:26:45,902 --> 01:26:48,802
How come... your son-in-law
doesn't have your number?

1173
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:52,503
You just told him to get
it from someone else, huh?

1174
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:54,904
I don't know, man,
I don't know.

1175
01:26:55,005 --> 01:26:57,105
I'm so messed up
right now that...

1176
01:26:57,106 --> 01:26:59,506
I don't even remember
my own name.

1177
01:27:01,906 --> 01:27:03,106
Wait a second, old man.

1178
01:27:03,207 --> 01:27:05,308
- It won't open.
- Not so fast. Wait a minute.

1179
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:09,009
If it's okay, I want you
to take off your shoes.

1180
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:10,810
What for?

1181
01:27:11,011 --> 01:27:12,611
I wanna see your foot.

1182
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:16,012
Mister, I'm as old as your father,
you tellin me to take off my shoes?

1183
01:27:16,113 --> 01:27:17,713
Open the door,
let me go!

1184
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:19,904
I didn't do anything to you.
Why are you talking like that?

1185
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:21,715
Take it easy.

1186
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:24,996
Just take off your shoes for a sec. Then,
I'll open the door for you to leave.

1187
01:27:25,017 --> 01:27:28,317
Why should I take off my shoes?
Open the door!

1188
01:27:28,318 --> 01:27:31,318
Hush! Come here.
Let's go over there.

1189
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,819
Sit on the stair, for a
sec, take off your shoes.

1190
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:45,320
Sit!

1191
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:48,421
Sit down!

1192
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:52,722
Just sit, okay?

1193
01:27:58,423 --> 01:27:59,923
Take off your shoes, please.

1194
01:28:00,224 --> 01:28:01,224
I'm not feeling well,
just don't!

1195
01:28:01,525 --> 01:28:04,025
- Well, let me help you.
- I'll take it off, okay.

1196
01:28:05,727 --> 01:28:07,727
<i>Whispering: I'll take it off.</i>

1197
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:16,828
The other one,
take off the other one too.

1198
01:28:24,529 --> 01:28:26,029
Your socks too.

1199
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,430
Mister, what do you want from me?

1200
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:31,431
Take 'em off!
I said, take off your socks.

1201
01:28:31,531 --> 01:28:32,631
Let me do it myself.

1202
01:28:32,832 --> 01:28:35,032
- No!
- Let me! Just let me!

1203
01:29:49,933 --> 01:29:50,933
Hello, Siavash!

1204
01:29:53,934 --> 01:29:55,834
No, I'm a little busy
right now.

1205
01:29:57,335 --> 01:29:59,235
What time is it, anyways?

1206
01:30:00,036 --> 01:30:01,736
No, I'll be there.
Don't worry.

1207
01:30:04,437 --> 01:30:07,737
She'll come herself...
She's a little busy.

1208
01:30:08,324 --> 01:30:09,924
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1209
01:30:10,825 --> 01:30:11,925
Okay, bye.

1210
01:30:14,026 --> 01:30:16,926
Swear on my life, I didn't
want to harass anyone.

1211
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:21,327
Did that woman tell you
to go there that night?

1212
01:30:21,628 --> 01:30:24,528
That woman had been messaging
me for at least a month.

1213
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:28,609
She said, "If you still have the
pickup, come over, I wanna see you."

1214
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,630
And I messaged back,
"Ahoo, dear, sorry...

1215
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:34,831
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1216
01:30:35,632 --> 01:30:38,832
She took it to herself. No matter
how many times I called...

1217
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,133
She never answered.

1218
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:43,234
Didn't want to talk to me.

1219
01:30:43,935 --> 01:30:46,305
That night, I thought I'd drop
by and make it up to her.

1220
01:30:46,436 --> 01:30:48,036
Didn't you know
she's moved out?

1221
01:30:48,237 --> 01:30:50,037
God knows, I had no idea.
Swear on my kids' life...

1222
01:30:50,038 --> 01:30:54,038
You opened the door, and went in. You
saw the furniture is different...

1223
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:55,559
How come you're saying
you didn't know?

1224
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,040
I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff,
the bicycle I had bought myself...

1225
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:03,641
I thought maybe she's moving.

1226
01:31:03,642 --> 01:31:05,942
You're not going anywhere
until you tell the truth.

1227
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:09,383
If I had the slightest idea
that you guys have moved in,

1228
01:31:09,444 --> 01:31:12,444
I would've thought, maybe
there's a man in the bathroom.

1229
01:31:12,645 --> 01:31:15,045
- My wife's clothes were on the bed.
- I didn't saw those.

1230
01:31:15,146 --> 01:31:17,146
You saw those and figured there
must be a woman in the bath.

1231
01:31:17,147 --> 01:31:19,647
All alone, she even
opened the door for you.

1232
01:31:19,648 --> 01:31:21,148
I didn't see any clothes.

1233
01:31:21,549 --> 01:31:24,949
It didn't take even five minutes. I
came in, there was no one there.

1234
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:27,850
Just a minute ago, your wife
had opened the door for me.

1235
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:30,151
Why did your wife
open the door for me?

1236
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,852
Well, she thought it's me.

1237
01:31:31,952 --> 01:31:33,952
Let me tell you
what really happened.

1238
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:38,553
I went by the bathroom door, called
the kid, as soon as I did...

1239
01:31:38,654 --> 01:31:40,454
there starts the screaming.
Then, I ran away.

1240
01:31:40,455 --> 01:31:41,855
You went into the bathroom.

1241
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,556
I didn't go in the bathroom.

1242
01:31:43,657 --> 01:31:45,257
Then, where was your
foot cut like that?

1243
01:31:45,258 --> 01:31:48,858
I have no idea. By the
time I was downstairs...

1244
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:51,049
I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've
stepped on something in the stairs.

1245
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,250
Then, my wife's lying?

1246
01:31:52,251 --> 01:31:53,951
Your wife says I went
into the bathroom?

1247
01:31:53,952 --> 01:31:56,099
My wife was scared and
bumped into the glass,

1248
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:58,852
otherwise God knows what you
would've done, dirty scumbag!

1249
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:01,953
I swear on my life or
whatever's dear to you...

1250
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:04,352
as soon as I found out I'm in
the wrong place, I ran away.

1251
01:32:04,354 --> 01:32:08,754
Well, just tell your wife to come here.
Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her.

1252
01:32:08,775 --> 01:32:10,855
What's my wife
supposed to say?

1253
01:32:11,956 --> 01:32:15,356
My wife's said all she had to say.
It's your wife's turn to come here.

1254
01:32:15,557 --> 01:32:17,857
Call her, and tell her
to come here, right now.

1255
01:32:18,558 --> 01:32:19,258
What for?

1256
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:21,459
What you said, I want you to
repeat in front of your wife.

1257
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,860
Mister, why don't you get it?
I didn't go in that bath...

1258
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,161
Okay, you didn't!

1259
01:32:25,662 --> 01:32:28,662
I want you to tell your wife what
you were doing in that house.

1260
01:32:28,763 --> 01:32:29,763
Call her, right now!

1261
01:32:30,264 --> 01:32:31,664
Get it out, and call her!

1262
01:32:32,165 --> 01:32:33,965
Nope! Get out your cell!

1263
01:32:38,565 --> 01:32:40,965
Don't make me look bad in
front of my wife and kids.

1264
01:32:41,266 --> 01:32:42,266
Call her, right now.

1265
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:44,367
My daughter's about to
get married.

1266
01:32:44,368 --> 01:32:46,008
Your daughter has to know
her real father.

1267
01:32:46,369 --> 01:32:51,369
I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything,
just so he knows his father-in-law.

1268
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:54,470
I don't have to keep you here.
Go on, get out! Go!

1269
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:59,171
I'm gonna call your son-in-law,
tell him to bring your wife here...

1270
01:32:59,172 --> 01:33:01,172
Leave me alone, mister! Ah!

1271
01:33:07,673 --> 01:33:09,573
Someone help me! Help!

1272
01:33:10,274 --> 01:33:12,674
Don't make noises! Quiet!

1273
01:33:14,175 --> 01:33:15,975
Open the door! Open up!
I'll die!

1274
01:33:17,576 --> 01:33:20,976
I'm about to have a stroke.
Open the door!

1275
01:33:22,077 --> 01:33:26,377
Mister! Open the door! I'm
afraid of closed spaces.

1276
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:31,078
Open the door, my boy.

1277
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:40,879
At least turn on the lights.

1278
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,480
Forgive me...

1279
01:34:09,581 --> 01:34:11,181
my dear!

1280
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:15,981
I can’t cry.

1281
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:20,282
Why did you ever
do that to yourself?

1282
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,283
I don’t understand it.

1283
01:34:26,984 --> 01:34:29,184
Help me, Willy!

1284
01:34:34,485 --> 01:34:37,185
It seems to me that you’re
just on another trip.

1285
01:34:37,786 --> 01:34:39,486
I keep expecting you.

1286
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:48,388
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1287
01:34:49,788 --> 01:34:51,288
Right today.

1288
01:34:52,889 --> 01:34:55,689
And there’ll be nobody home.

1289
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,890
We’re free and clear.

1290
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:06,191
We’re free.

1291
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,692
Rana, lock the door,
and take the keys.

1292
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:41,193
Get up... on your feet!

1293
01:36:56,994 --> 01:36:58,194
Here, wait.

1294
01:36:59,995 --> 01:37:00,995
Sit here.

1295
01:37:17,196 --> 01:37:18,496
You go in that room.

1296
01:37:47,697 --> 01:37:50,597
Look how mentally and
emotionally shattered she is.

1297
01:37:58,198 --> 01:37:59,608
There's my wife.

1298
01:38:00,198 --> 01:38:02,598
You still gonna say you haven't
gone into the bathroom?

1299
01:38:04,899 --> 01:38:05,699
I'm sorry.

1300
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,600
Answer me.

1301
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:11,901
I made a mistake.

1302
01:38:12,602 --> 01:38:15,502
Tell me, why did you
go into the bathroom?

1303
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:22,603
I gave into temptation.

1304
01:38:34,005 --> 01:38:35,605
What are you gonna do to him?

1305
01:38:35,906 --> 01:38:40,106
His family are on their way, I want
his wife to know what he's done.

1306
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,300
You're taking your revenge.

1307
01:38:53,101 --> 01:38:54,701
Let him go, let him leave.

1308
01:38:55,402 --> 01:38:57,102
I know what I'm doing.

1309
01:38:58,503 --> 01:39:00,703
You sit here, there's no
need for you to come out.

1310
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:24,104
Where are you going?

1311
01:39:26,305 --> 01:39:28,905
I'm not feeling well at all.
Let me go.

1312
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:30,906
They're coming after you.

1313
01:39:31,407 --> 01:39:33,207
Your son-in-law called,
he asked about you.

1314
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:34,808
I told him to come over.

1315
01:39:35,009 --> 01:39:36,409
And to bring your wife too.

1316
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:40,310
They're on their way.
Sit down.

1317
01:39:46,911 --> 01:39:48,511
I'm begging you, please
let me go.

1318
01:39:49,012 --> 01:39:52,812
When your family's here. Tell 'em
everything you told me. Then leave.

1319
01:39:53,114 --> 01:39:54,214
I'm begging you.

1320
01:40:12,615 --> 01:40:13,715
Miss!

1321
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:16,116
Forgive me.

1322
01:40:16,717 --> 01:40:18,817
Let me go,
before they get here.

1323
01:40:37,317 --> 01:40:39,917
That woman lived with me for
35 years.

1324
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:54,818
Mister! Get up! Get up, go!

1325
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:00,419
You, sit down!

1326
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:01,840
Leave him alone,
let him go.

1327
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,620
He'll go, he will.

1328
01:41:03,821 --> 01:41:06,921
When his family get here,
they can leave together.

1329
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:08,021
Sit down!

1330
01:41:08,222 --> 01:41:09,922
- For the love of God!
- Here, mister, go.

1331
01:41:10,024 --> 01:41:10,824
- Just, sit down.
- Let him go!

1332
01:41:10,825 --> 01:41:12,225
My girl! My boy!

1333
01:41:12,426 --> 01:41:14,826
- Leave him alone, Emad!
- You stay out of this!

1334
01:41:15,627 --> 01:41:17,927
- Sit down!
- Please.

1335
01:41:18,029 --> 01:41:20,929
I said sit down! Ah!
SIT... DOWN! Here.

1336
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:43,731
What? What do you want?

1337
01:41:54,832 --> 01:41:55,932
Oh, my God!

1338
01:41:59,733 --> 01:42:00,733
Emad!

1339
01:42:01,134 --> 01:42:03,934
- Does he, by any chance, take
any under-the-tongue pills?

1340
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,635
I searched. There's
nothing in his pockets.

1341
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:08,437
- What happened?
- Where are you now?

1342
01:42:09,138 --> 01:42:12,738
No, no, get here as soon as you can.
Okay, okay.

1343
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:15,539
- Was it the Emergency?
- His family. They're coming.

1344
01:42:15,741 --> 01:42:18,941
- Oh, my God!
- Mister! Can you hear me?

1345
01:42:19,142 --> 01:42:21,942
Does he have a pulse? Emad,
can you hear his heartbeat?

1346
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:24,543
Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet.
Let me see what I'm doing.

1347
01:42:27,644 --> 01:42:28,445
Where are you going?

1348
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:30,589
He said he's got pills.
Maybe they're in the car.

1349
01:43:01,845 --> 01:43:05,545
Can you hear me?
Open your mouth. Open!

1350
01:43:21,146 --> 01:43:24,046
Mister! Get up!
Can you hear me?

1351
01:43:27,347 --> 01:43:29,847
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1352
01:43:31,548 --> 01:43:33,848
You better now?
You feeling better?

1353
01:43:36,749 --> 01:43:40,449
Breathe! Breathe!
You better, now?

1354
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:55,550
Don't worry, he's better.

1355
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:57,251
You didn't call the Emergency?

1356
01:44:00,041 --> 01:44:01,941
No, I was afraid he might be dead.

1357
01:44:09,502 --> 01:44:10,542
Wait a minute!

1358
01:44:13,843 --> 01:44:17,443
If you say anything to his family, I don't
wanna have anything to do with you.

1359
01:44:26,544 --> 01:44:27,944
Yes?

1360
01:44:32,345 --> 01:44:34,745
- Hello.
- The elevator's broken, use the stairs.

1361
01:44:34,846 --> 01:44:36,546
Okay... Come on, ma!

1362
01:44:37,047 --> 01:44:40,947
You go ahead, I can't run
with this pain in my legs.

1363
01:44:45,648 --> 01:44:47,848
Ya Ali!... My dear.

1364
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:50,649
Come on in. Come in.

1365
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:03,550
Ya Allah! Dad! Dad!

1366
01:45:04,351 --> 01:45:05,751
How are you dad?

1367
01:45:06,052 --> 01:45:07,752
- Majid!
- What? Come in.

1368
01:45:07,854 --> 01:45:11,554
- Dad! Daddy!
- Thank God, he's fine.

1369
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:12,755
You okay, dad?

1370
01:45:13,255 --> 01:45:14,255
I'm fine.

1371
01:45:15,056 --> 01:45:17,856
You're okay.
That was such a scare, dad.

1372
01:45:18,457 --> 01:45:19,857
Where's your mother?

1373
01:45:19,858 --> 01:45:21,558
She's in the stairs.
Let me call her.

1374
01:45:21,559 --> 01:45:22,859
Majid, don't call her.

1375
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,940
- Let's go!
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.

1376
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:28,839
Majid! If mother doesn't see him, she'd
think something must've happened to him.

1377
01:45:28,865 --> 01:45:29,766
Let her see he's fine.

1378
01:45:29,962 --> 01:45:32,962
Hello, sorry. We were in such a
hurry that we didn't notice you.

1379
01:45:33,863 --> 01:45:34,496
That's alright.

1380
01:45:34,522 --> 01:45:36,588
Sit down, dad. What
are you getting up for?

1381
01:45:36,665 --> 01:45:39,465
I thought mother better come up and
see you, and then we'll leave. Sit.

1382
01:45:40,066 --> 01:45:43,566
We're in no hurry. Let him sit
down until he gets better.

1383
01:45:43,867 --> 01:45:45,567
We're really sorry, mister.

1384
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:49,968
Dad, just sit down. Can you?

1385
01:45:50,069 --> 01:45:51,369
Yeah, I'm alright.

1386
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:52,470
Majid!

1387
01:45:54,071 --> 01:45:56,771
What is it, ma? We're here.

1388
01:45:56,972 --> 01:46:00,372
Come. Thank God, dad's
sitting here. He's all right.

1389
01:46:01,073 --> 01:46:04,873
What is, dad? Huh?

1390
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:23,574
- It's nothing, ma.
- What happened?

1391
01:46:25,875 --> 01:46:26,975
What happened to you?

1392
01:46:33,676 --> 01:46:36,076
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?

1393
01:46:41,577 --> 01:46:43,877
See what you're doing
to me and yourself?

1394
01:46:45,778 --> 01:46:48,878
Oh, God.
Thank you so much, God!

1395
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:53,679
God knows, on our way here I
vowed to give away a hundred

1396
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:56,480
different charities, just to
hear his voice one more time.

1397
01:46:57,581 --> 01:46:58,781
Thank God.

1398
01:47:02,882 --> 01:47:04,782
How many times did
I tell you not to go?

1399
01:47:04,883 --> 01:47:08,883
My dear! I don't want you to work.
I don't!

1400
01:47:09,684 --> 01:47:12,725
Darling, you said, "Majid called,
I have to go, I'll be back soon."

1401
01:47:12,785 --> 01:47:14,585
Soon, you call this "soon"?

1402
01:47:14,786 --> 01:47:16,786
Mom, we have to thank these guys,
they stayed with him all this time.

1403
01:47:16,787 --> 01:47:19,587
Or else, we don't know what
would've happened to dad.

1404
01:47:19,588 --> 01:47:21,888
We really don't know
how to thank you.

1405
01:47:21,889 --> 01:47:25,089
May God give you back, miss.

1406
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:29,190
He's my whole life, mister.
Thank you so much.

1407
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:31,291
You gave me my life back.

1408
01:47:31,592 --> 01:47:34,392
He's all I've got.

1409
01:47:35,093 --> 01:47:36,893
Come on, mom, stop it.

1410
01:47:39,294 --> 01:47:40,894
Get up, let's go.

1411
01:47:46,295 --> 01:47:47,895
I'm sorry.

1412
01:47:50,596 --> 01:47:53,037
Did you take all your stuff, dad?
Where's your cellphone?

1413
01:47:53,797 --> 01:47:54,797
Car keys.

1414
01:47:55,297 --> 01:47:57,497
Where's his glasses? Don't
leave without his glasses.

1415
01:47:57,598 --> 01:48:00,998
I've got it... Come here,
I'll give it to you.

1416
01:48:00,999 --> 01:48:02,899
- You go, I'll get it.
- Majid, the glasses...

1417
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,800
No, let him come.
There's...

1418
01:48:05,201 --> 01:48:08,701
this unfinished business
we need to take care of.

1419
01:48:08,901 --> 01:48:10,001
This way.

1420
01:48:10,502 --> 01:48:14,502
What business? You just
saved his life, son.

1421
01:48:15,803 --> 01:48:18,344
No, mister, we've put you
through enough trouble already.

1422
01:48:18,604 --> 01:48:20,104
It's nothing fancy, you know.

1423
01:48:22,004 --> 01:48:23,104
Come on, this way.

1424
01:48:24,305 --> 01:48:26,205
Well, if there's anything
to do, just let me...

1425
01:48:26,706 --> 01:48:29,106
No, let him come himself.
Come on, this way.

1426
01:48:38,107 --> 01:48:39,307
You guys go.

1427
01:48:49,808 --> 01:48:51,708
Majid. Let me...

1428
01:49:36,009 --> 01:49:38,589
How much money did you leave
in the room, that night?

1429
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:40,610
Huh?

1430
01:49:41,211 --> 01:49:42,812
How much money did you
leave in the room?

1431
01:49:43,812 --> 01:49:44,512
I didn't count.

1432
01:51:00,913 --> 01:51:02,413
What happened, dad?

1433
01:51:03,814 --> 01:51:05,814
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!

1434
01:51:07,515 --> 01:51:09,815
What happened to you?
He's sick again.

1435
01:51:10,116 --> 01:51:13,116
What are these?
Where were these?

1436
01:51:13,517 --> 01:51:15,637
- Come on, sit down a little.
- Is it your heart, dad?

1437
01:51:17,618 --> 01:51:21,118
Let him sit for a while.
Come on, this way.

1438
01:51:22,119 --> 01:51:25,319
We can't leave like this. Majid!

1439
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:26,819
Majid, hurry up!

1440
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:40,820
- We're almost there, dad.
- Esmat!

1441
01:51:41,121 --> 01:51:42,621
I'm hear, dear.

1442
01:51:43,722 --> 01:51:45,822
- Esmat!
- Come on, mom.

1443
01:51:46,323 --> 01:51:48,023
Watch it, don't drop him.

1444
01:51:50,824 --> 01:51:53,824
- Esmat! Esmat!
- What? Darling, I'm here.

1445
01:51:54,826 --> 01:51:56,826
What happened to you?
Ya Abalfazl!

1446
01:51:57,827 --> 01:51:59,227
Stretch his legs.

1447
01:51:59,228 --> 01:52:00,728
Dad! Can you hear me?

1448
01:52:04,529 --> 01:52:07,869
- God! Dad! You hear me? Dad!
- Where are his pills?

1449
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:12,530
Where are his pills?
Search his pockets.

1450
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:15,631
Stretch his legs! Hurry up!

1451
01:52:15,632 --> 01:52:16,932
God help us!

1452
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:20,230
Dad, breathe!

1453
01:52:20,631 --> 01:52:22,331
See if his pills are upstairs.

1454
01:52:32,032 --> 01:52:35,832
Miss! Miss! Are my dad's pills here?

1455
01:52:36,633 --> 01:52:38,533
He's got sick again,
he's lying in the stairs.

1456
01:52:48,535 --> 01:52:51,735
Mister, for God's sake, will
you get on the way right away?

1457
01:52:52,336 --> 01:52:55,556
<i>Yes, miss, just give some time
for my colleagues to get there.</i>

1458
01:52:56,236 --> 01:52:59,396
<i>Just follow my instructions. His
legs must be straight, not bent.</i>

1459
01:53:04,837 --> 01:53:05,837
He's lying face up.

1460
01:53:13,738 --> 01:53:15,838
Mister, he's all blue in the face.

1461
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:20,839
<i>Just keep doing what I told you. If you
get tired, let someone else do it.</i>

1462
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,640
<i>Hello? Someone tell me
how he's doing?</i>

1463
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,840
He's not moving, mister...
No, no, nothing.

1464
01:53:30,441 --> 01:53:32,341
<i> Not even his hands or legs?</i>

1465
01:53:32,642 --> 01:53:33,842
No.

1466
01:53:34,842 --> 01:53:37,542
Mister, can we put his
pill under his tongue?

1467
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:41,243
<i>No, no, miss, don't give him
anything, just do what I told you.</i>

1468
01:53:41,844 --> 01:53:43,783
<i>Just make sure his legs,
are stretched, not bent.</i>

1469
01:53:43,809 --> 01:53:44,429
Yeah, yeah.

1470
01:54:24,245 --> 01:54:25,845
Guys, please hurry up!

1471
01:54:29,746 --> 01:54:32,146
- Hello, where's the patient?
- He's inside.

1472
01:56:22,947 --> 01:56:34,747

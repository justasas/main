Hey, Mr. Etesami!

Rana, Missy!

25
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:52,369
Come on out!

Get out of there!

00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,276
What's going on?!

29
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,144
What are you doing here, honey?
Come here, honey.

30
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,249
Why? What's going on?

31
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:17,685
Mr. Etesami evacuate the building.
It's collapsing. Hurry up!

32
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,153
- Let's go, everyone!
- Rana!.. Rana!

33
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:23,323
- What's going on, Emad?
- Come here, Rana! Hurry up!

34
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,624
Let's go, man!

35
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:32,524
- What's going on, Mr. Fallah?
- I don't know. Just evacuate, man!

36
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:36,294
Rana!.. Hurry up!
Come on!

37
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:40,062

00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,832

What?..
Let me come with you.

44
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:58,600
No, you can't.
Just go down to the alley.

45
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,318
Go tell everyone to go to the alley.

46

Hossein get up, my boy!
The house is coming down.

49
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:18,534
Get up, Hossein!.. Get up!

50
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:23,103
- Emad, come on, everyone's gone.
- Go down to the alley. Go tell everyone.

51
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:25,804
Mr. Fallah, get everyone down to the alley.

52
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,474
Come on, Hossein!..
what are they doing?!

53
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,576

- I'll bring your glasses.

Guys!..

56
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:15,215
There's no need to
bring all your stuff.

57
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,018
- We've got everything down in our place.
- Okay.

58
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:24,587
- I can't find it.
- I don't know, just look around.

59
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:26,457
- You want me to take these?
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,759
I thought you were supposed to just
bring your towel and toothbrushes?

61
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,360
The towel and the brushes
are in there too.

62
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
- Did you lock the car?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
Ah, keys, keys!..
Gimme the keys.

64
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Here.

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
Guys!

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,610
Hey

67
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,125
Hey Kati.
Hi.

68
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:48,182
What's up, Kati?

69
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:49,210
You're alive?!

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,247
The way Sia said the
house has collapsed,

71
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:53,920
I thought we'd have to drag
you from under the ruins.

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh, whoa!..
What's going on here?!

73
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,440
There's smell of gas...

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,770
It's from last night.

75
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Well, then, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,840
Hey.

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,810
Why did you come up?

78
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
Cut off the electricity,
this is dripping.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I can't find the card, man.

80
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,840
Well, see if it's between your
documents and stuff.

81
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Kati, dear, don't go there,
it's dangerous.

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,400
Oh, my God...

83
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,260
<i>You could only hear the sobbing
of Mashti Hassan's wife,</i>

84
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,361
<i>... sitting alone with her lit lantern
on the stable's roof</i>

85
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,880
<i>and the desperate moans of a cow
from inside the stable.</i>

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,730
Sir! is it a true story?

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,540
True? No, but you could say that
in a way, in Saedi's stories

88
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:57,740
the scenery, the type of characters,
and relationships are real. Very real.

89
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,000
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,880
Try looking in the mirror.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,180
You think you're funny, huh?

92
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,100
But seriously, Sir,
how does a person turn into a cow?

93
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
Gradually...

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
Sir, are we gonna watch the film
of this story too?

95
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,700
Yeah, that's a good idea.

96
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,801
Maybe I bring it next time and
we can watch it together.

97
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,320
Yes?

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,680
Sir, when can we see your play?

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
The performance begins next week.

100
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:24,441
Once we've had a few days to settle in,
I'll definitely invite you all to come.

101
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,660
- Thank you, Sir!
- What's it called, Sir?

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,840
"Death of a Salesman",
who's read it?

103
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
"The enemy"!

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,960
Jokes aside,
have any of you read it?

105
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,840
Sir, who's the author?

106
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,720
Arthur Miller

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,440
Hmm... no, I've not.

108
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,170
Very good.

109
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,740
Excuse me, boys.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes?

111
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,440
Hello.

112
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Yes.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,770
Sorry, I can't talk right now,
I'm in class.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,960
If you call back in 10
minutes, I'll be free.

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah, with stick shifts... Silver...

116
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,661
Sure... that's fine.

117
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Sir, what's your role?

118
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,240
The Salesman.

119
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,680
- What are you selling, Sir?
- Potatoes!

120
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,540
When you come,
you'll see for yourselves.

121
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,970
What's it's model, Sir?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,490
- What?
- Your Peugeot 206, you know.

123
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,060
- Why do you wanna know?
- Aren't you selling, Sir?

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,740
Sir, his dad's a parking officer,
just tell him to scrap your fines for you.

125
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,900
Do you even commit driving offenses, Sir?

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,960
Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh"s?

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
I didn't hear you.

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,320
Why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh"s?

129
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:33,821
- Get outa here!
- Dude, just zip it!

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,400
That's alright. He doesn't know,
so he's asking.

131
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,940
I don't know either.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,100
Guys... eh, for your next session...

133
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,980
I want a summary of this story.
I don't want any excuses, like...

134
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:54,581
"I fell asleep, we had guests",
and... stuff like that.

135
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,100
Mister, could you please
scooch over a bit?

136
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Sir, can I sit in front and
this young man sits back here?

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Father...

138
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,240
Somebody in there?

139
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,800
No, I think the noise was
from the next door.

140
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,160
- No, no, somebody got in your bathroom!
- No, there's no one there.

141
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,000
It’s the next room, there’s a party.
These kind of noises are normal...

142
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,800
Can I come out?

143
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,301
There’s something moving
in the bathtub, Willy!

144
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,827
Ah, Miss Francis,
you better go back to your room.

145
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:20,073
They must be finished
painting by now.

146
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:22,320
But I can't, I’ve got to get dressed first!

147
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,740
Yes, you can, you can!
Please!

148
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,570
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my next-door neighbor.

149
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,140
They were painting her room.
And she asked to come and use the bath.

150
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,841
And I said, that's alright,
So, I let her take a shower here.

151
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,960
You can go back to your room now.

152
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,530
But Willy, I don't have any clothes on!

153
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,340
Please, get out of here!
Go back to your room.

154
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,800
You promised me stockings, Willy!

155
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,780
I have no stockings here!

156
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,500
Why?! You had two boxes of size 9s for me,
and I want them, Willy!

157
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Alright, take one and go.
For God’s sake, will you get outa here!

158
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:54,981
Please!

159
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,080
Go!

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,320
I just hope there’s nobody in the hall.
I can't go out without any clothes!

161
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,000
By the way, are you
football or...

162
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Dammit!

163
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
Siavash!

164
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,420
What happened, mom?

165
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,133
I do my best to ignore it but he
keeps getting worse every night!

166
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,020
Sadra, dear, come down, let's go!

167
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,740
Sanam, dear, just ignore him.

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
He thinks just because I'm playing a whore,
he can do whatever he wants.

169
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,160
What's that got to do with it?

170
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,900
Why don't you laugh at the others then, huh?

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,340
- I was laughing at your clothes, not you...
- Shut up! Shut the hell up!

172
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,500
Siavash, come here!

173
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,960
Sanam, don't be childish on
this final night. Sanam...

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,300
Alright, I'm freaking sorry...
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,257
In this cold, rehearsing every night,
with this child.

176
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:54,120
Let's go, honey.

177
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
You just had to fuck it up,
didn't you?

178
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,470
What's that got to do with us?

179
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,020
It's your own husband.

180
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Let me take the k...

181
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,090
Let go!

182
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,785
Sanam don't...

183
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,450
I said get off!

184
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,120
I was kidding...
I said get off!

185
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,360
I was kidding...

186
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,361
- I was messing with you.
- Where are you going?

187
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,157
Comes out of the shower with a raincoat,
and says,

188
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,960
"How can I go out
without any clothes?"

189
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,960
I can't, man,
it makes me laugh.

190
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,720
Go after her or she'll get annoyed
and won't come tomorrow.

191
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,700
Don't make me go out without clothes!
I'm shy!

192
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,880
Come on, how can I go out
without any cloth...

193
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,290
Sanam!

194
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,880
The guy's totally nuts!

195
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,210
Did you find a place?

196
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,560
60 sq. metres, 3rd floor, no elevator.
40 mils in front, 600k tomans per month.

197
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,140
- Where?
- Amiratabak

198
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,140
- What sort of a place are you looking for?
- Something temporary...

199
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,694
...If we can't find anywhere,

200
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,900
We have to bring our stuff,
and live right in the middle of the stage.

201
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
You free tomorrow afternoon?

202
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,040
How come?

203
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm taking you somewhere.

204
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,620
Come on guys...
once more from the top, no interruptions.

205
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
You tired?

206
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,130
Nope

207
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,005
Oh, you're here too!

208
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,880
Aww kitty!
Who's this?

209
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,981
Come here, you!

210
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:30,382
He's tame... What's up, kitty?

211
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,060
This place is cool!

212
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
Babak

213
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,980
Is that the storage room?

214
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,980
- Which one?
- This

215
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,960
No! It's the second bedroom

216
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,880
- Really?!
- Well, yeah.

217
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,660
- Isn't it too small?
- It's a two-bedroom!

218
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,700
So it's good?

219
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,880
You're just two people,
what do you need all this space for anyways?

220
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,380
Watch your mouth, "two people"!

221
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,640
Who knows,
maybe we end up being three people...

222
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,000
Rana, is he serious?

223
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,180
No, come on!

224
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,880
- He doesn't look like it.
- Why is that?

225
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,700
Is this door locked?
Is it locked?

226
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,960
The previous tenant's stuff is in there;
they're supposed to be collecting it.

227
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,120
Don't be scared kitty, it's just me.

228
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
- How long's it been vacant?
- Three weeks.

229
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,820
What are they doing to this city?

230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,640
I wish we could tear it
all down and start again

231
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,720
They've already destroyed and rebuilt it,
and look how it's turned out...

232
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,085
Babak?

233
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:11,850
Yes dear

234
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,530
God have mercy on us.

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,137
When do you think they'll
clear their stuff out?

236
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,080
They promised they'll be
here in the next day or two

237
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,760
There's no parking, you'll have to
leave your car on the street.

238
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,619
We don't need parking anyways.

239
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,040
We're selling our car to pay
your mortgage down payment.

240
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,210
Who mentioned money?

241
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,380
Well, either way...

242
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,440
Hello
Hello Mr Salimi.

243
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,960
One of the good things about this
place are Mr. Shanazari and his wife.

244
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,570
- Hello.
- Hello, how're you doing?

245
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. how do you do Ma'am?

246
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,820
Babak, which one's the storage?

247
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,820
It's here, come, take a look.

248
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,210
- Mr Salimi?
- Yes?

249
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,760
The door's open, take a look.

250
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,880
Please make sure it doesn't
turn out like the last one.

251
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,840
- No, come on, I know these guys.
- You said you knew the last ones too.

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
Don't worry about it.

253
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,120
- Babak, what do they do?
- They're my friends, they're into arts.

254
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,820
I hope so

255
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,240
It's okay for a few months.

256
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Just make sure he lets us pay him for it.
No favors.

257
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
Looks like we've finally caught a break.

258
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
Careful, don't rush

259
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,620
- You need help, Sir?
- No, you go ahead and bring the rest.

260
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,800
Just be careful not to hit the light-bulb.

261
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,640
Sorry sir, thanks for the help.

262
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
- Are the keys here too?
- They took that one room's with 'em.

263
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,740
Where's Ali?

264
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,640
Ali...

265
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,170
Yep?

266
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,140
For God's sake, leave that alone,
I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

267
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,820
It'll only take a second

268
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,240
Leave it, man!

269
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,260
If she'd said, we wouldn't have hired
the truck and the movers.

270
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,558
How was I supposed to know?

271
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,360
She sounded so sure that I
didn't think she'd bail on us.

272
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,990
So, what's she saying now?

273
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,920
Hasn't answered
ever since this morning.

274
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,960
Why don't you try from a different number?

275
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,860
Bring your phone Nana.

276
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,800
We really need that room,
we've brought a pickup full our things.

277
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,260
Yes

278
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,960
Okay

279
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,200
He's here if you like to speak to him,

280
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,940
Thanks

281
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,320
Says, she's said all
she has to say to you.

282
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,840
Well, what did she say?

283
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,161
She signed the contract on
a new place two days ago,

284
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,400
but the landlord bucked
at the last moment,

285
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,680
She's looking for a place, but can't come
for her stuff until she finds somewhere.

286
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,780
She said to tell you not to
let anyone touch her stuff. Please.

287
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,120
Oh, yeah, and she doesn't want
to talk to you again.

288
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,700
Any news? What happened?

289
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,080
I don't know, nothing for now.
Let me take it, Kati.

290
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,760
Ali

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,980
- Yes?
- You got a screwdriver in your car?

292
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,120
This is enough stuff for a bride's dowry!

293
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,980
I thought it was just
a few bits and pieces.

294
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,160
- Maybe we should leave it...
- It's fine, I'll take responsibility for it

295
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:57,561
Alright, boys,
let's move those things over there.

296
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,320
Rana...

297
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
<i>mumbling</i>

298
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,170
These are people's belongings

299
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,280
What do you want me to do? It's been
3 days now. She keeps saying...

300
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,940
... "I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow."

301
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,800
What if she shows up?

302
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,080
Well she should've kept her word then.
Never mind. Come on!

303
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,120
Guys, I can't carry anything heavy!

304
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,320
Mr?

305
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,960
Come on, let's eat.

306
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,080
Rana, dear!

307
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,800
Yes dear?

308
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,960
Honey... the charger.

309
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:58,861
<i>I'll turn into words,
run through your ears...</i>

310
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:01,362
<i>I'll turn into thoughts,
stick in your head...</i>

311
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:04,862
<i>I'll be a Benz,
race under your feet...</i>

312
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:08,563
<i>I'll be poverty
in your purse...</i>

313
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:10,863
<i>I'll be a wolf,
raid your herd.</i>

314
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,960
You two, go to the door and
bring over one of those boxes.

315
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,730
Hi guys

316
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,410
Are these your 206's car parts, Sir?

317
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,646
Put these in front of
the principal's office,

318
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:57,810
tell the librarian to come see me.

319
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,294
Put these in front of
the principal's office,

320
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,480
tell the librarian to come see me.

321
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,640
Very good guys, I want the poem
memorized for next time.

322
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,520
Okay.

323
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,760
Thank you.

324
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
Bye, Sir.

325
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,000
Bye.

326
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
- Bye, Sir!
- So, long.

327
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,065
Thanks Sir

328
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,720
Goodbye

329
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,940
- Sir, can I say something?
- What?

330
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,840
Sir, I was really pissed off the other day.

331
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
Which day?

332
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,600
The day that woman insulted you
in the Taxi.

333
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,770
Was it an insult?

334
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,890
You know, that she said,
she wants to sit in the front seat.

335
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,440
Sir, after you got out of the car,
I told them that you were my teacher.

336
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,560
And that we all love you so much.
Like, all the guys.

337
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
What was your first name again?

338
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,580
Amin..

339
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Amin, you can be sure, some guy had
done something to her in a taxi before...

340
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:23,941
...to make her think
that way about everyone.

341
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,560
Don't worry about it, it's just
the first 100 years that are tough.

342
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,450
See you

343
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,720
Bye
See you

344
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,400
Bye

345
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,240
Okay

346
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,341
Of all the time...

347
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,360
I don't know what to do with her.

348
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,760
Who?

349
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,600
This woman

350
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,495
I called to ask when she'll
clear her stuff out.

351
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:26,640
She got angry, started threatening...

352
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,800
Over what?

353
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,080
"Why did you touch my personal things?
those were my private stuff...

354
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,810
... I'll sue you.."

355
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,940
Last night I was running around, saving
her stuff from the rain, up until morning.

356
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,880
Her problem's something else...

357
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,580
- Who Babak, the woman?
- Yeah.

358
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,740
When's she coming to get her stuff?

359
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,700
Says, whenever she finds a place.

360
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,960
Sadra darling, come here with me.
Hurry up.

361
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Hurry up guys, the audience will
be in in five minutes.

362
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,675
Emad... Emad, they're coming here
again after the performance.

363
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:10,580
They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions,
there's another three left.

364
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,281
if you stay around after the performance,
you can talk to them.

365
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,880
Tonight after the performance?

366
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,270
Yes

367
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,130
If it helps, I'll stay.

368
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,340
Sure, or else there's a chance they
might cancel the whole show tomorrow.

369
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,840
How many did they say?

370
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,440
Three... Guys will you please hurry up!

371
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,520
I'll go, then.

372
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,320
Won't you wait around?

373
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,060
No, you'll be stuck here
until around midnight.

374
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,800
Take the car, then.

375
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,400
Where are the house keys?

376
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,995
In my coat's pocket.

377
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,420
Have a good performance

378
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
You too!

379
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,940
Say, on your way back, if
the supermarket's open...

380
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,541
... buy something, we've got
nothing for breakfast.

381
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,520
Yes, I said if it's open. If it's open!

382
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,960
Also, pick up some hand sanitizer.

383
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,561
Maybe I take a shower
until you get here.

384
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,540
No not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't
even wiped off my stage makeup.

385
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,300
I'll be out soon... soon.

386
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:43,001
Yup... love you, bye.

387
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,250
Anything else?

388
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
That's all, thanks.

389
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
Be my guest.
Are you paying by card?

390
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,840
No, cash.

391
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
Hello Ma'am

392
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,480
Hello?

393
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,890
Good evening, I'm your upstairs neighbor.

394
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,320
We've just moved in,
could you open the door please?

395
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,200
Thank you.

396
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,280
Rana?

397
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,200
Rana?

398
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,320
Rana?

399
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,730
Rana!

400
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,105
What happened to you?

401
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,450
Please step outside, Sir.

402
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,960
You can't be in here, Sir.
We'll call you when for the CT scan.

403
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,680
Wait outside, please.

404
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,160
Look at me Rana...

405
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,840
Everything's fine,
I'll call you for the CT scan... Please.

406
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,800
Make sure you change the locks
first thing tomorrow.

407
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,560
Why? Did someone get into the house?

408
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,561
I thought she'd fainted,
was dizzy or...

409
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
We don't know what happened yet

410
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,760
All of a sudden we heard shouting
and screaming from upstairs.

411
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,640
Not like, normal, not once,
scream after scream...

412
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,634
I told him go upstairs and check,

413
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,441
he said,
couples get into fights all the time.

414
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,160
Then we heard some heavy
bangs in the stairs,

415
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,940
I told him "Muhammad,
God knows, something's up."

416
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Who was it?

417
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,700
By the time we reached the stairs,
we just saw someone fleeing up the street.

418
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,080
I don't know what happened to his foot,
but it had bled all over the stairs.

419
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,780
If I'd caught him, he'd be dead now.

420
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,620
Then we went upstairs and
found your wife unconscious...

421
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:04,121
there was blood all over the bathroom floor.
I dressed her and brought her here.

422
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,290
Never mind that, thank God
something worse didn't happen.

423
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,520
Woman, do us a favour, go to the ER,
and check if there's any news or something.

424
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,520
Sorry about putting you to all this trouble.

425
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,960
Have a seat, sit down, son.

426
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,580
Was anything missing from the house?

427
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,800
I don't know.
I didn't notice anything.

428
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,640
I don't think it was a robbery.
What would a thief be doing in the bathroom?

429
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,290
Then who was it?

430
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,560
The guy was one of
that woman's customers.

431
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,800
Who? What woman?

432
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,480
The woman who lived there
before you moving in.

433
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,640
Tell you the truth, she
was kind of messed up...

434
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,441
... and I think, the guy came here
on account of her still being there.

435
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,685
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up

436
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:08,680
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

437
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,120
Sure

438
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,240
Come on, lie down.

439
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,800
Take my sleeve, hold this bit.

440
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,400
Thanks

441
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
Wait, let me take off your scarf.

442
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,640
You want me to put
two pillows for you?

443
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,560
No.

444
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,920
Turn off the light, so she can sleep.

445
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,880
Don't turn it off.

446
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,080
Can I get you anything?

447
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,120
No, thanks.

448
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,040
Where are you going, Emad?

449
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,290
Darling?

450
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,770
I said, where are you going?

451
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,640
I'm not going anywhere,
I'll be here. Do you need anything?

452
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,360
Nope. Leave the door open.

453
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,920
Okay, thanks

454
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,440
Look, her blood pressure's low,
be careful when she's walking around.

455
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,080
Thanks for everything.

456
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,920
Sit down guys,
I'll make you some breakfast.

457
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,880
No thanks, I'm fine.

458
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,600
Come on, you haven't eaten
since last night.

459
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,280
Kati, you wanna stay here, and
make soup or something for them?

460
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,381
- You want me to stay?
- You want Kati to stay?

461
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,120
No, no.

462
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,360
Are you sure?

463
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,120
You must be tired.
Go, get some rest.

464
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,680
Call if you need anything.

465
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,250
Really, man, just let us know.

466
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
- Thanks again for everything, guys.
- Bye

467
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,795
<i>... scrap metal... Iron doors...
Aluminium doors...</i>

468
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:11,680
<i>Fences... Metal dishes...
buying...</i>

469
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:23,840
<i>... scrap metal... lamps...Samovars...
anything, bring it over...</i>

470
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,080
Come on, stand here
while I use the bathroom.

471
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,770
What are you doing?

472
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,320
Leave it, I'll wash it myself,
Rana, dear. Leave it.

473
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,580
Come and wash it then.

474
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,920
Alright, turn off the water
and come out.

475
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,760
Then, come and clean it
before I use it.

476
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,560
The police might need to see it.

477
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,880
Yes?

478
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,240
Of course, sorry

479
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Who was it?

480
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,920
A neighbor

481
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,840
What did they say?

482
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,680
I'll be right back.

483
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,000
Sorry

484
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm really sorry for all the trouble
you've been put through, ma'am.

485
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,260
Now, come on, don't say that.

486
00:37:56,261 --> 00:37:59,061
I think you should call 110, they'll be
able to track him down through the car.

487
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,560
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.
Anyways, I'll try to find some place...

488
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,480
Here I was thinking, when that woman left
she's taken all her troubles with her.

489
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,240
Have you ever seen
this car's owner around here?

490
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,045
Well, it wasn't like, just
a couple guys visiting her.

491
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:15,440
I might have to trouble you again
when the police comes...

492
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:17,541
...if they have any questions
about exactly what you saw.

493
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,960
Of course, it's our duty. Would you
like to take my mobile number?

494
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,980
Yes, please.

495
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,970
I'll get going.

496
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,220
Thank you so much, ma'am.

497
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,905
They should put an ewer
around these guys necks,

498
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:27,920
and parade them around the city,
shaming them.

499
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,720
0912...

500
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,970
Why are you out here? Come in

501
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm scared of being
alone in the house.

502
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,840
Where did you go?

503
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,600
I went to thank the neighbors
for last night.

504
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,440
What did they say?

505
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,740
Nothing.

506
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,370
They asked how you were.

507
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,960
You didn't tell Kati and the guys
what happened, did you?

508
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,200
No.

509
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,720
Okay, I'm going to
the police station.

510
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,400
We have to file a complaint
for them to start looking for the guy.

511
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,565
How will they find him?

512
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:19,410
He left his pickup behind.

513
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,480
His mobile too,
but it's disconnected.

514
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
Who was he, Emad?

515
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,840
The neighbors are saying the woman
who lived here before us was shady.

516
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,440
The scumbag must've been
one of her customers.

517
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,641
Came here on account of her.

518
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
Do you remember what he looked like?

519
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
No

520
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,500
Didn't you get a look at him?

521
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,180
It's cold.
Come inside, you'll catch a cold.

522
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
Gimme that.

523
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,400
Who helped me out of the bathroom?

524
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,040
One of the neighbors.

525
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,590
Which one?

526
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,800
I don't know, just forget it.

527
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,160
Eat your breakfast.
and then go get some rest.

528
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,440
I can't. As soon as I close my eyes
that scene comes to my mind.

529
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,400
How did he get in?

530
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,480
I opened the door,
I thought it was you.

531
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,000
I came out of the bathroom,
buzzed him in, and then went back.

532
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,000
I was shampooing my hair when
I realised someone had come in.

533
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,720
He put his hand in my hair from behind
and I thought it was you.

534
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,260
But then I saw his hands
and after that it's blank.

535
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,720
Rana...

536
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,440
Darling, have some breakfast.

537
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,280
Rana, dear...

538
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,640
Sweetie...

539
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
What about tonight's performance?

540
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
I called and told them to cancel it.

541
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,505
No, call and say I'm coming.

542
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,200
How? In this condition of yours?

543
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,020
It's harder for me to stay at home.

544
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,540
Put this on,
let's go to the police station.

545
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,600
We might get held up there
for a while anyways.

546
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,500
No, leave it.
Let's not go to the station.

547
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,200
We can't just do nothing!

548
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,497
I don't want to have
to go there and tell

549
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:22,400
a bunch of officers or
whoever what happened.

550
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,920
Did something happen
that you can't tell?

551
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,010
No.

552
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,800
Then, you don't have to say anything.
I'll tell 'em myself.

553
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
I can't, it'll be too much.

554
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.

555
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,080
When I'm walking in the street,
I clearly feel these things...

556
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:54,581
...They pass me by, but it's as if they're
laughing at me with their eyes.

557
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,160
Why? Why would they laugh at you?
Don't talk that way about yourself, Willy.

558
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,440
Sometimes they pass me by
as if I don't even exist.

559
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,680
As though nobody sees me.
Nobody notices me. Nothing.

560
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,240
Linda?

561
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,520
How long are you going to spend
repairing those socks, huh?

562
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,200
You know it makes me angry.

563
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:32,201
At least don't do it while I'm home,
talking to you. Okay?

564
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,760
Okay, we'll talk about something else,
for example my income.

565
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,400
My never-changing income.
God, this is really ridiculous.

566
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,493
<i>What's wrong with you?..</i>

567
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,780
<i>why aren't you saying your lines?</i>

568
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,160
Willy, darling, you're the most
handsome man in the world to me.

569
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,800
You always say this to me, Linda, always,
but it doesn't help me at all.

570
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,130
I'll never be able to make you happy,
do you know why?

571
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,400
Because I'm just a salesman.
I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Linda!

572
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,080
But I always tried...
why are you crying, anyways?

573
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,480
Wait, where are you going?

574
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,960
Linda, come back...

575
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,760
Sorry, I have to stop the play.
I apologize to you all.

576
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,172
My wife, the other actor,
isn't feeling well.

577
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:42,600
Please give us a ten minute intermission.
Sorry.

578
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,490
Can you carry on?

579
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,811
What do you mean, Kati?

580
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,480
Can't you see she's not well?
Go on, cancel it.

581
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,320
Do you wanna go to the other room
and lie down a little?

582
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,080
Alright, guys, let's just clear the room.
She's not well.

583
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,245
Sanam, dear.

584
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,090
I'm coming.

585
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Can I get you anything?

586
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,000
Kati darling...

587
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,360
Go and cancel the show

588
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,360
What happened there?

589
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,280
The way someone in the audience
was staring at me bothered me.

590
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,760
The audience've come to watch the play,
of course they'll be looking at you.

591
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,280
Looked at me just like that guy.

592
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,970
I thought you said you didn't see him.

593
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,200
I'm really unwell, I just
don't know what to do.

594
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,880
Babak, come here a minute.

595
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,400
Coming...

596
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,400
Is she feeling better?

597
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,900
Goddamit, man,
what can I say to you...?

598
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:17,765
Don't you think you had
to let me know about

599
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:19,701
the kind of people who
used to live in there?

600
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,490
- What's happened?
- You're supposed to be my friend

601
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,400
Seriously, what's happened?
What is it to you who lived there before?

602
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,400
That apartment's infamous
in the whole neighborhood.

603
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,980
Who's said such a thing?

604
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,581
Let's say nobody's said anything,

605
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:33,840
why isn't this woman coming
to collect her stuff?

606
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,820
I just wanted to help.

607
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,321
Remember the state you were in, last week?
Ready to sleep on the set?

608
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,300
Regardless, should you have hidden
that woman's line of work from me?

609
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,340
What hiding?

610
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,060
Well, yeah. Did you tell me or not?

611
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:52,680
Was I supposed to pass on to you some
unfounded gossip? To upset you?

612
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,920
Well, what's going, anyways?
What's this all about?

613
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,320
Babak, I'm going

614
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:56,960
I'm coming.

615
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,240
Go take a look at Rana,
you'll see what this is all about.

616
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,680
They said she slipped
in the bathroom.

617
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,160
We said right in front of you
we might be having a kid in that place.

618
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,761
And you didn't say a word, what kind of...

619
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,040
You were joking!

620
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,360
If we weren't joking,
would you have told us?

621
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,490
Told you what?!

622
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,380
Put yourself in my shoes,
the same room we sleep in, each night...

623
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:26,881
...how many strange men
have been with that woman.

624
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,600
Don't take it so hard on yourself.
I haven't cashed your check yet.

625
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,587
Whenever you find another
place whose previous tenants

626
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:38,400
had your approval,
you can move out.

627
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,010
Hello

628
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,440
Hello
Hello

629
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,810
Hello

630
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,560
How are you doing

631
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,530
Be careful not to slip on the
stairs Mrs Shahnazari, they're wet.

632
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:02,345
I was actually going to ask the cleaner
to come early and sort these out.

633
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:08,160
But, I thought you'd want to report it,
the police might want to see them.

634
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,880
Well, it wasn't such a big deal.

635
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,591
You wouldn't say that,
if you'd been there and seen

636
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:18,120
the state your wife was in,
on the bathroom floor.

637
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:26,000
When Mr. Alimoradi opened the bathroom door,
he thought, God forbid, your wife was dead.

638
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,800
Say hello from me.

639
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,080
Get up, I've made some breakfast for you.

640
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,360
I'm heading out.

641
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,120
Wait.

642
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,360
Wait, I'll get ready and come with you.

643
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,320
Where to? I have class.

644
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,080
I know, I'll wait in the car.

645
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,920
It's not just an hour or two,
you'll get tired.

646
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,480
Then don't go today.

647
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,250
What?

648
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,600
I said, don't go today.

649
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,485
Let's say I don't,
what about tomorrow then?

650
00:50:00,515 --> 00:50:03,080
The day after tomorrow?
It's not gonna work.

651
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,800
I can't stay here alone.

652
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,680
I said, I don't want
to be here alone.

653
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,022
What can I do?
You want me to get you

654
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,760
a ticket to visit your
parents for a few days?

655
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,000
Looking like this?

656
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,100
I've made up my mind...

657
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:27,201
... we either have to go to the police,
or forget this altogether.

658
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,760
Okay forget it,but let's look for
a new apartment right from today.

659
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,210
Okay, we'll start looking.

660
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,080
But until we find somewhere,
you need to try and pick yourself up.

661
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,032
What do you mean?
It's not something I can control.

662
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:39,985
You taking your pills and
not staying up all night

663
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:42,080
getting worked up about it,
is up to you, isn't it?

664
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,640
Go take a shower, I'll wait here.

665
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,880
I don't want to go in that bathroom.

666
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,720
I'll drop you off at a friend's place.
Use theirs.

667
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,400
Go and tell them we've
come to take a shower?

668
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,140
What do you want me to do?

669
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,760
You keep changing your mind.

670
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,678
At night you tell me
not to come near you,

671
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:10,320
then in the morning you
tell me not to leave you.

672
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,240
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

673
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:12,850
Just go, you're late

674
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,986
It'll take a couple weeks to find a place.
What?

675
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:19,320
You're not gonna wash up
with that wound of yours?

676
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,800
I love you.

677
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,770
Just think, it could've been worse.

678
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,329
What if a piece of glass
had gone in your eye,

679
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,544
or your head had been hit harder?
Then...

680
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,760
...then what the hell would I have done?

681
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,240
I wish my head had been hit harder.

682
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,160
God forbid! Honey,
don't say things like that.

683
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,480
Hello, Mr. Etesami.

684
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,320
Hello Sir, how are you doing?

685
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,360
Mr. Yeganeh gave me these books
to give them to you.

686
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,760
Be quiet. What's so funny?

687
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,290
Why?

688
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,840
He said they're not suitable for kids.

689
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,280
Quiet!

690
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,520
Mr. Yeganeh decided these
weren't suitable for the kids?!

691
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,720
Go, throw them in the bin.

692
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,610
Why the bin?

693
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
Just throw them away.

694
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,730
Give me your phone.

695
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,040
I don't have a phone, Sir.

696
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:54,730
Give it to me.

697
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,880
I don't have a cell.

698
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,080
Sir, wait a minute.

699
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,410
Give it to me.

700
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,740
Sir, there's nothing in it about you.

701
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,840
I want to see what you have

702
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,980
I've deleted it

703
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,090
Let me see it

704
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,890
Sir please, I've deleted it

705
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,960
Sir, I have private photos in there

706
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,425
Put your hand down

707
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:14,680
That's not fair

708
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,680
Mr Etesami?

709
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,600
Sir?

710
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,200
I have personal things on there.
I deleted the video.

711
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,400
On my mother's life, I deleted it

712
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,051
Sir, send it on Telegram,
so that everyone can see.

713
00:54:33,081 --> 00:54:34,690
It's much better than this movie.

714
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,600
I'll kick you out of the class,
if you say another word.

715
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,825
Mr. Etesami!

716
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:39,570
Sorry, Sir

717
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,480
You stay out of this!

718
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,330
Mr Etesami?

719
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,340
I mean all of you.

720
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:44,841
I'm talking to him.

721
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,800
I deleted it

722
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,800
Please

723
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,004
Call your father to
come to the school

724
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:56,000
and see the kind of photos
you have on your cell.

725
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,920
His dad's dead, Sir.

726
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,800
Hi, sorry about that

727
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,380
Hi, no problem.

728
00:55:57,381 --> 00:56:01,381
If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it,
then you can leave it in the corner.

729
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:01,530
Next to the boiler room.

730
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,925
When my husband gets back
he'll move it to a better place.

731
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:08,320
I don't want you to have to keep
going up and down the stairs.

732
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,560
I'm going out for a couple of hours
you can take my spot.

733
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,600
Don't worry,
I'll find a better place for it.

734
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,120
Suit yourself.

735
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:15,370
Sorry

736
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,960
If you give me the keys, I can do it

737
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,640
Thanks

738
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,720
My wife said, you're not going to report it.

739
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,330
No.

740
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,615
You're doing the right thing,

741
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:28,650
they won't do anything,
even if they catch him.

742
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,320
And you'll have to explain over and over
why you opened the door

743
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:36,721
... plus trekking back
and forth to the court.

744
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,610
Endless hassle for nothing

745
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,040
But he'll probably be back for his car.
Please, call me if he shows up.

746
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,040
I'll sort out that bastard.

747
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,680
I'll take mine out and
then come and park yours.

748
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,440
There's no need,
I'll do it myself.

749
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,920
Okay, then, goodbye.
Thanks.

750
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,240
Goodbye

751
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,890
How's it going?

752
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,280
Hey, you okay?
Is Rana here?

753
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,540
No, wasn't she with you?

754
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,070
She's coming on her own

755
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,600
Any news about the guy?

756
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,520
Who?

757
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,640
Babak had heard some things
from your neighbors.

758
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,000
Where is he?
Is he here?

759
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,050
Babak?

760
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,840
Yep, he's back there.

761
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,280
Hi

762
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,170
Hi

763
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,880
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

764
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,490
What should I have told you?

765
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,640
About the man turning up
the other night.

766
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,560
How's Rana?

767
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,840
The neighbors told you

768
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,130
They're also worried...

769
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,360
Tell 'em nothing happened,
the guy just barged in.

770
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,440
Then why are you keeping his pickup?

771
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,520
Shahnazari said it's in the parking lot.

772
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,720
Tell them we'll be gone soon
we're looking for a new place.

773
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,920
Where will you go?

774
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,120
I won't let you

775
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,320
Can you find that previous tenant
and arrange a meeting for me?

776
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,090
Why?

777
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,105
I wanna talk to her.

778
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:50,120
Ask her why she did this

779
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,040
Did what?

780
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,090
Did what?

781
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,760
Sent this thug to our house

782
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,850
Why would she do that?

783
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,640
You said yourself, she made threats
about us touching her stuff.

784
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,379
She's nothing like that.
She hasn't taken her stuff

785
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,600
because she still
hasn't found a place.

786
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:08,101
She was just annoyed
with me that day.

787
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,240
Hello

788
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,810
Feeling better?

789
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,880
Yep, I'm fine thanks

790
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,200
Did you tell the guys?

791
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,250
No

792
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,850
Then how do they know?

793
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,560
One of the neighbor had called Babak.

794
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,400
I'm not sure what they said

795
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,140
Emad, get dressed and
come for the make up.

796
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,960
My outfit's not here

797
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,920
Kati's going to take your place tonight.

798
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,945
And you accepted, just like that?

799
00:59:55,975 --> 00:59:57,960
What can I do?
It's not up to me.

800
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,130
The director wanted her
to replace you tonight.

801
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,520
If you're alright, and you can do it,
I'll go talk to her.

802
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,200
No, I don't want to

803
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,280
Have you started house-hunting?

804
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,760
No, I will do

805
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,330
As soon as I get time

806
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,960
When you get time! Like it doesn't
matter how I feel in that place!

807
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,440
You haven't done anything

808
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,880
Huh?

809
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,330
I want us to go to the police,
but you won't let me. What do you mean?

810
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,920
You said you'd drop by the school,
find a substitute teacher, and pick me up.

811
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,540
I couldn't find anyone
to cover my class.

812
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
Auntie?

813
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,810
Yes Baby?

814
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,560
Why aren't you acting tonight?

815
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,400
I'm not feeling well tonight, darling.

816
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,720
Why did you come here then?

817
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,040
I get bored at home

818
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,490
What?

819
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,880
I get bored at home

820
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,400
Well, I get bored here.

821
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,400
Would you like to come
to our house this evening?

822
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,770
Do you have Spongebob?

823
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,010
No, but we can go buy it on the way home.

824
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,570
From tomorrow you really
need to perform again.

825
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,800
Everything's Topsy turvy.
Everybody's making mistakes.

826
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,210
Why?

827
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,210
I don't know, everyone's upset

828
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,640
You're better now,
you should act again tomorrow.

829
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,340
Mum?

830
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,010
Darling?

831
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,160
Can I go to Auntie's house?

832
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,050
No, baby.

833
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,935
Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone.
I'll bring him with me tomorrow.

834
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:37,820
He can't, his dad's coming to pick him up
to go to his house tomorrow.

835
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,040
Well, his Dad can pick him up
from our place.

836
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,480
You wanna go?

837
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,320
Yes!

838
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,560
You won't be a nuisance for Auntie Rana?

839
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,160
He won't.

840
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,520
Tell Emad we're taking the car.

841
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,720
I'll bring his things over.

842
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,705
I need to pee, auntie.

843
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:10,360
I know, go on, go inside

844
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,970
Whose bike is this?

845
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,160
That... belongs to some kid.

846
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,050
Where's the kid?

847
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,600
The kid's not here anymore.

848
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,800
Where did he go?

849
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,570
Huh?

850
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,280
Where'd he go?

851
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,200
Moved to a new house.
Don't you need to pee?

852
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,200
Oh, yes!

853
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,200
Go on then

854
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,920
Not that one, over here

855
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,800
Well...

856
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,265
...it's dark!

857
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:45,440
I'm coming...

858
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,760
It's scary in there

859
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,760
Come on

860
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,640
No, I don't need to go anymore.

861
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,610
Let me help

862
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,560
No, you go... I... I'll do it

863
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,040
Are you feeling shy in front of me?

864
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:06,920
Nope!

865
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,840
Can you do it yourself?

866
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,800
I'm drawing his mustache

867
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,840
Yes?

868
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,800
Come up, dear.

869
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,560
Who was it?

870
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,530
Uncle Emad

871
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,480
If it's my dad,
then tell him Sadra's not here.

872
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,600
Why?

873
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,040
Because I love my Mom

874
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,120
Okay

875
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,960
Rana?

876
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:13,770
Hey

877
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,665
The pickup isn't in the parking.

878
01:04:15,695 --> 01:04:17,560
I parked it outside this morning.

879
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,130
Why?

880
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,680
I didn't fancy moving
it every ten minutes

881
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,570
Hello!

882
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,480
Helloooo, how are you kid?

883
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,940
Where are the keys?

884
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,400
Where you'd left them.

885
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,265
How are things with my favorite?

886
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:34,080
Welcome to our house, all good?

887
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,680
Welcome!

888
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,960
Leave it where it is Emad

889
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:43,360
I'll be right back

890
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:44,760
Emad... Emad...

891
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,865
Let's forget all that for tonight,
just leave it.

892
01:04:49,895 --> 01:04:53,000
I've made dinner,
go wash your hands and change.

893
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,720
Go on, darling

894
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,120
Ready for takeoff
ladies and gentleman!

895
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,520
Sadra!

896
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,970
Yes!

897
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Emad it's ready,
come before it gets cold.

898
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,200
Coming

899
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,200
Let's go wash those hands of yours.

900
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:22,850
My hands are clean!

901
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,145
Let's wash them again anyways.

902
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,440
Wow, wow, wow, look at this!

903
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,040
Thanks so much

904
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,530
Get your hands off it!

905
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,650
<i>Rana, where are you?</i>

906
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,320
<i>Sadra, come and eat!</i>

907
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,330
Helllllo

908
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,080
Hello trouble, have you two been
having fun without me?

909
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,410
We went shopping
and then hung out

910
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,960
Well done!
We went shopping and then hung out

911
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,520
We went shopping and then hung out

912
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,160
But we didn't find Spongebob

913
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,130
Yes, unfortunately.

914
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,947
<i>Don't worry, Patrick,
eventually a good day will come</i>

915
01:05:58,977 --> 01:06:00,800
<i>when you and I will find someone.</i>

916
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,880
<i>Look at this, Spongebob!</i>

917
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,000
Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni!

918
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,770
More?

919
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,120
No no, that's enough

920
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,280
Okay, just let me know

921
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:17,080
Thank you

922
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,360
Wow, what a nice macaroni!

923
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,840
Bon appetit!

924
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,320
Let's eat it all

925
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,120
Look what she's made.

926
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,320
Yeah, I know!

927
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,440
How was tonight's performance?

928
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,680
Very...

929
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,280
not that great.

930
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,845
It was terrible

931
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,170
You're lying

932
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,480
That's how it is without you

933
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,760
Did you find the credit card?

934
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,120
No

935
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,760
How did you go shopping?

936
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,880
With the money you'd left

937
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,485
What money?

938
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:54,800
In the drawer.

939
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,440
Why aren't you eating?
Do you not like it?

940
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,280
Is it not tasty?

941
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,760
Don't eat it

942
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,600
What's up?

943
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,360
That scumbag had left it behind
the other night.

944
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,280
Sadra?

945
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,280
I've got an idea

946
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,760
Do you like pizza?

947
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,720
Yep

948
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,000
Then let's order some pizza.

949
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,160
Don't eat that, it's not good

950
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,520
Do you like fries?

951
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,200
And after that Ice Cream?

952
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:34,901
Hi there.
Gimme a call when you can.

953
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,000
Hello? Mum? Mummy?

954
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,880
Hello? Uncle?
Are you there?

955
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,840
It's the 3rd time I'm calling.

956
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,160
Ahoo darling, it's Babak

957
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,680
Ahoo... Ahoo...

958
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,880
Are you there?

959
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:12,760
Gimme a call when you get home,
I'll be up late.

960
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,840
What are you doing?

961
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,320
Nothing

962
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,360
Come on, go sleep.

963
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,400
You haven't slept for two nights

964
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,480
I can't sleep.

965
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,480
Why did you open her letters?

966
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,890
It's her private stuff.

967
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,800
I wanna find out
who the hell that scumbag was.

968
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,020
Let's say you find out how it was...

969
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,045
He'll say it was a mistake

970
01:09:44,075 --> 01:09:45,530
He came inside by mistake?

971
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,970
He rang the bell
and I opened the door.

972
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,440
He must've thought it's that woman
since I opened the door so easily.

973
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,600
He came here by mistake?

974
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,040
Any when he realized his mistake...

975
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,730
...Why didn't he leave?

976
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,520
Because he saw the bathroom light's on
and there's a woman in there?

977
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,180
How would he know it's a...

978
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,840
From your clothes on the bed.

979
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,600
If I'd just used the damn intercom...

980
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,120
If I'd just asked who it was...

981
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,800
None of this would've happened

982
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,890
If you think it's that simple...

983
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,800
You can just tell all the neighbors
about the intercom...

984
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,535
Why are you getting
the neighbors into this?

985
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:23,347
They knew what was
going on in this house.

986
01:10:23,377 --> 01:10:25,160
So it'd be fine with you,
if they didn't know?

987
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,160
What are you on about?

988
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:29,861
Leave me alone.

989
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,880
The pickup wasn't there

990
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:47,520
What?

991
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,360
Sorry

992
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,040
Where was it?

993
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,805
There

994
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:56,000
Sorry

995
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,760
Where did you leave it?

996
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,960
I left it there

997
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,680
Where?

998
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,360
Over there, where the Peugeot is

999
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,640
He's taken it

1000
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,880
I have to find that asshole

1001
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,560
Jackass!

1002
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,240
Okay, slow down!

1003
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,360
It's freezing in there.

1004
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,410
Never mind.

1005
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,640
What do you mean, never mind?
You'll get sick.

1006
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:17,730
Let's go to a public bath.

1007
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,160
No, I'll be out quick.
Just wait here.

1008
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,120
Hasanpoor, come here a sec.

1009
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,880
<i>Hello</i>

1010
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,920
What can I do for you, Sir?

1011
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:41,770
Hi

1012
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,800
How's it going?

1013
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,200
Your dad was a traffic cop, right?

1014
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,680
He's retired now, why?

1015
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,285
A car hit my wife and drove off.

1016
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:51,800
Hope it's nothing serious, Sir!

1017
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,800
No, thank God

1018
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,890
It was a pickup, if I give you
the number plate...

1019
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,880
Can your Dad find the guy's address?
If it's not too much trouble, that is.

1020
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,739
Sure,
he has contacts in the department.

1021
01:13:03,769 --> 01:13:06,000
If you gimme the license plate,
he can find out.

1022
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,010
But, I think you should report it.

1023
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,960
It wasn't anything serious, so
I don't wanna get the police mixed up.

1024
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:14,520
Okay, gimme the registration
and I'll call my Dad.

1025
01:13:15,732 --> 01:13:17,432
- Get a pen and a paper, then.
- Okay.

1026
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:24,822
Why don’t you want to work for me?

1027
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:27,123
Have you lost your mind, Charlie?
I've got a job.

1028
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:30,324
Then what’re you walkin’
in here every week for?

1029
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:37,225
Well, if you don’t want me to
walk in here...

1030
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:38,997
I'm offering you a job.

1031
01:13:39,027 --> 01:13:43,427
I don't want your goddam job!
I've got one already. Get outa my way!

1032
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:45,928
When the hell are you
going to grow up, huh?

1033
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:48,929
Goddam you, Charlie!
You big ignoramus!

1034
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:53,730
Big ignoramus!
How dare you talk to me like that?

1035
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:56,931
If you say that to me again,
I’II rap you one!

1036
01:13:59,932 --> 01:14:01,432
I don’t care how big you are!

1037
01:14:01,933 --> 01:14:04,133
You degenerate!

1038
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:18,633
What's wrong with you tonight?

1039
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,134
What did I do?

1040
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:21,735
Why are you adding dialogues?

1041
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:23,036
What did I add?

1042
01:14:23,737 --> 01:14:25,937
If you've got a problem with me,
let's sit and talk.

1043
01:14:26,138 --> 01:14:28,538
Not on the stage, calling me,
"You degenerate!"

1044
01:14:28,539 --> 01:14:31,039
It's neither improvisation, nor acting,
you're insulting me.

1045
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,740
What?
Did I hurt your feeling?

1046
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:34,041
Yeah.

1047
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:37,142
And if you do that one more time,
I'll answer you right in front of everyone.

1048
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:40,043
Degenerate is the one who speaks his mind
through swearing.

1049
01:14:40,244 --> 01:14:41,044
Didn't know that.

1050
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,145
I'm really sorry.

1051
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:01,045
Bakery

1052
01:15:09,646 --> 01:15:10,746
Hello, how're you doing?

1053
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:24,047
<i>Speaking Azeri</i>

1054
01:15:34,248 --> 01:15:35,648
What can I do for you?

1055
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:37,549
Two baguettes, please.

1056
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,450
You want 'em cut?
Thanks a lot.

1057
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:46,551
That pickup is yours?
Why?

1058
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:49,352
There's an officer writing tickets,
from the top of the street.

1059
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:52,153
Majid, come here, go move the car.

1060
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:54,754
...before the officer slaps a ticket on it.

1061
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:06,555
Soheil, bring the keys.

1062
01:16:11,156 --> 01:16:12,056
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1063
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:14,057
Later.

1064
01:16:14,758 --> 01:16:15,558
Bye.

1065
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,559
Here you go, Sir.

1066
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,760
Thanks.

1067
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:01,961
Thanks, dude.
I'll take a water.

1068
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:05,162
Hello, mister, sorry
is that your pickup?

1069
01:17:05,763 --> 01:17:06,563
Yeah.

1070
01:17:06,864 --> 01:17:09,364
I had some load, I wanted to
ask you to move it for me.

1071
01:17:09,565 --> 01:17:10,765
Nah, that pickup is for a store.

1072
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:12,566
Well, not now, whenever you're free.

1073
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:14,867
No, it's just that, I do something else.
I don't do that.

1074
01:17:15,368 --> 01:17:16,768
Not even Friday?

1075
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:17,089
Nah.

1076
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:19,869
You can find pickups at
the top of Haft-e-Tir.

1077
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,019
No, it's just that,
my stuff are books and paintings

1078
01:17:22,049 --> 01:17:23,970
and things like that,
I was looking for a softopper.

1079
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:27,171
You know, on account of rain
or things like that.

1080
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:28,972
I'm really busy.
I don't have time.

1081
01:17:29,273 --> 01:17:32,373
I don't care about the fee. I'll pay.
I just want my stuff to get there safe.

1082
01:17:32,474 --> 01:17:34,374
It's just that, I'm busy.
I can't.

1083
01:17:34,575 --> 01:17:36,875
Majid, come on, man.
Help the guy. Late night or something.

1084
01:17:37,676 --> 01:17:40,676
Well, how about you gimme your number?
I'll call you whenever you say.

1085
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:43,077
And if you come yourself,
even better.

1086
01:17:43,178 --> 01:17:45,378
Bro, find some time between
your schedule for him.

1087
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:50,079
Careful not to hit the walls.

1088
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:57,580
Ah! what're you doing here?

1089
01:17:58,781 --> 01:18:00,781
Come here... kitty...

1090
01:18:04,782 --> 01:18:06,182
Careful with that not to scratch it.

1091
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,483
Babak, tell 'em to come
have a cup of tea.

1092
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:11,984
- There's no need for that.
- It's getting cold.

1093
01:18:16,085 --> 01:18:17,885
Where are you taking these?

1094
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:21,786
I'm taking'em to my parent's parking lot.
We'll see what happens.

1095
01:18:21,987 --> 01:18:23,187
Won't she come to take 'em?

1096
01:18:23,888 --> 01:18:26,588
She's got problems of her own.
She hasn't found a place yet.

1097
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,990
Get up, Babak wants to
take away that woman's stuff.

1098
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:37,891
What do you want me to do?

1099
01:18:42,192 --> 01:18:43,792
What's going on
between you two?

1100
01:18:44,093 --> 01:18:45,893
Nothing, let him take 'em.
That's okay with me.

1101
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:55,794
Hello? Majid?

1102
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,495
It's me, Etesami, couple days ago.

1103
01:18:58,696 --> 01:19:00,396
You free today?

1104
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:02,297
How about Friday?

1105
01:20:06,797 --> 01:20:07,897
Yeah?

1106
01:20:09,698 --> 01:20:10,398
You?

1107
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:14,899
Yeah, come on up.

1108
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,598
Hello, can I help you?

1109
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:39,999
Hello, Sir. You okay?
Have I come to the right place?

1110
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,000
Majid said, there's some stuff
you need to move.

1111
01:20:42,581 --> 01:20:44,701
That's right, come on in.
Why didn't he come himself?

1112
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:47,702
Well, he was busy,
so he sent me instead.

1113
01:20:49,703 --> 01:20:50,703
- After you.
- You first.

1114
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,804
But he didn't say anything
about all these stairs.

1115
01:20:54,005 --> 01:20:55,305
With this heart of mine.

1116
01:20:55,405 --> 01:20:56,780
Well, if I knew you're coming,

1117
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,605
I would've told him about the stairs,
and the broken elevator.

1118
01:20:59,906 --> 01:21:03,906
Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir.
Would you gimme a glass of water?

1119
01:21:09,107 --> 01:21:10,207
Have you hired movers?

1120
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:15,007
No, I thought he's coming.
And, we'd take the boxes ourselves.

1121
01:21:15,108 --> 01:21:17,008
Well, the poor guy
was kinda busy today.

1122
01:21:18,309 --> 01:21:20,109
- Is he your son?
- Nah, my son-in-law.

1123
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:22,410
Doesn't make a difference though.
He's like my own son.

1124
01:21:30,311 --> 01:21:34,411
Sorry, old man, we just moved out.
There's no glasses or anything.

1125
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:36,512
That's alright, mister.
I'll drink from the tap.

1126
01:21:38,613 --> 01:21:39,813
Where are the boxes?

1127
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:42,114
In that room.

1128
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,915
We'll see. If there's too many,
we'll call movers.

1129
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:51,816
Give him a call. Maybe he's around
here somewhere. I can pick him up.

1130
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:53,917
Who?

1131
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:55,117
Your son-in-law.

1132
01:21:55,818 --> 01:21:59,518
Nah, the poor souls just went shopping
for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony.

1133
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,319
Isn't the janitor
allowed to help here?

1134
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,520
Nah, the building's empty.

1135
01:22:08,621 --> 01:22:10,921
The walls caved,
the residents have all moved out.

1136
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:13,622
Wow, wow! what if it collapses
on us or something?

1137
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:14,723
Nah.

1138
01:22:14,924 --> 01:22:17,824
Let's take a look and see
if it's worth hiring movers.

1139
01:22:18,925 --> 01:22:19,725
Grandpa!

1140
01:22:20,626 --> 01:22:21,326
What?

1141
01:22:21,627 --> 01:22:24,727
Would you come sit here for a sec?
I wanna tell you something.

1142
01:22:24,828 --> 01:22:26,728
Look here, mister,
this isn't my line of work.

1143
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:28,929
Majid, said, "there's this guy,
who's called a couple times...

1144
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:31,830
...would you do it?"
I said, okay, why not?

1145
01:22:31,831 --> 01:22:33,731
Now, you paying depends on
how generous you're feeling.

1146
01:22:33,732 --> 01:22:37,732
Nah, it's not about... wages,
fees, and stuff like that.

1147
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,133
Just sit down. There's something
I have to tell you.

1148
01:22:44,134 --> 01:22:46,034
Good news, I hope.

1149
01:22:49,635 --> 01:22:51,235
How long do you know this guy?

1150
01:22:51,936 --> 01:22:53,636
- My son-in-law?
- Yeah.

1151
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:54,637
What for?

1152
01:22:54,938 --> 01:22:56,238
I wanna know
if you know him well.

1153
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,339
Well, it's about two years they've
asked for my daughter's hand.

1154
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,040
Have you asked around
about him?

1155
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:06,141
Do you know Majid?

1156
01:23:07,742 --> 01:23:09,642
If there's anything you know,
just tell me.

1157
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:14,743
When my wife and I moved out of here,
we went to a place that...

1158
01:23:15,944 --> 01:23:21,744
...it's previous tenant was... you know,
a woman of the street.

1159
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:27,745
One night, when I got home a little late.
My wife was alone in the house.

1160
01:23:28,746 --> 01:23:32,046
One of these lowlifes on account of
that woman still being there...

1161
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:33,947
...enters my house.

1162
01:23:36,748 --> 01:23:38,648
When my wife was
in the bathroom.

1163
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:40,349
The jerk goes
into the bathroom.

1164
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:41,650
Who?

1165
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:43,651
That filthy
son-in-law of yours.

1166
01:23:47,752 --> 01:23:49,752
Now, how do you know
it was Majid?

1167
01:23:49,953 --> 01:23:53,853
When my wife starts screaming,
the guys makes a run for it, but...

1168
01:23:54,754 --> 01:23:56,854
He was in such a hurry that,
he leaves his pickup behind.

1169
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:59,855
I found him from his pickup.
I went down to where he works.

1170
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:04,156
I wanted to go there,
grab hold of him...

1171
01:24:06,457 --> 01:24:08,157
...and dishonor him in front
of all his co-workers, but...

1172
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:12,758
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1173
01:24:12,859 --> 01:24:15,759
This pickup changes hands
a lot in that store.

1174
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,860
That's why I asked him to come here.
To talk to him, and ask him...

1175
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:20,661
... if it was him or someone else.

1176
01:24:20,662 --> 01:24:21,862
Majid's not like that...

1177
01:24:23,863 --> 01:24:26,963
if I find out it's been him,
I'll call off everything.

1178
01:24:27,064 --> 01:24:27,964
The wedding and all.

1179
01:24:32,905 --> 01:24:34,665
How's your wife, now?

1180
01:24:37,066 --> 01:24:38,566
I don't know what to say.

1181
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,867
Let me talk to him tonight.

1182
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:46,168
Give him a call and tell him
I wanna talk to him.

1183
01:24:46,269 --> 01:24:48,669
Tell him to come here,
I wanna ask him who's done it.

1184
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:51,323
Well, it's just,
they've gone with my wife and daughter

1185
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,170
for "the exchange of vows" shopping.

1186
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:55,971
Well, at least give him a call.

1187
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:59,072
Ask him who had his pickup
that night.

1188
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:01,972
When did this happen?

1189
01:25:02,073 --> 01:25:04,673
About two weeks ago.

1190
01:25:06,974 --> 01:25:11,574
Okay, so you just let me
talk to him tonight... Oh my...

1191
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,775
But, I wanna talk to him,
old man.

1192
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:20,576
Wait a second, I wanna talk to him.
Call him.

1193
01:25:20,777 --> 01:25:22,977
I don't have his number
in my phone.

1194
01:25:23,378 --> 01:25:24,478
I have it.

1195
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:29,679
When I say call him to come here,
it's because I don't want to...

1196
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,780
...go down to the store,
make a scene in front of his co-workers.

1197
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:33,881
You just let me
make sure it's him.

1198
01:25:34,782 --> 01:25:37,782
I have to talk to him in such a way
that I'll get an answer...

1199
01:25:37,783 --> 01:25:39,083
How about I call him myself, huh?

1200
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,684
You want me to do it?

1201
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:45,185
Okay, let me just
dial his number.

1202
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,886
Hello, Majid? Hi, son...
where are you guys?

1203
01:26:03,187 --> 01:26:05,887
Yeah, I'm here with him.

1204
01:26:08,688 --> 01:26:09,688
Who's with you?

1205
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:15,889
Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call.
I wanna tell you something.

1206
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:19,690
Call my cell.

1207
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:23,791
I don't have it memorized.
Ask Moj'gan.

1208
01:26:25,992 --> 01:26:30,092
Okay... it's nothing...
Bye.

1209
01:26:34,593 --> 01:26:34,793
He said, he'll call when he's alone.

1210
01:26:35,994 --> 01:26:37,894
Say, what do you do yourself?

1211
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,995
I work with this car of Majid's.
His pickup.

1212
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:45,196
I sell clothes from the
back of the pickup, at nights.

1213
01:26:45,297 --> 01:26:48,197
and I don't come out during the day,
on account of my heart.

1214
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,298
And, how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

1215
01:26:54,799 --> 01:26:57,499
Well, I just don't.
Not just him, a lot of people.

1216
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,100
Have you just bought
this number of yours?

1217
01:27:00,401 --> 01:27:01,201
No.

1218
01:27:18,802 --> 01:27:21,702
How come... your son-in-law
doesn't have your number?

1219
01:27:23,003 --> 01:27:25,403
You just told him to
get it from someone else, huh?

1220
01:27:25,904 --> 01:27:27,804
I don't know, man, I don't know.

1221
01:27:28,705 --> 01:27:31,405
I'm so messed up right now that,
I don't even remember my own name.

1222
01:27:34,806 --> 01:27:36,006
Wait a second, old man.

1223
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:37,907
- It won't open.
- Not so fast. Wait a minute.

1224
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:41,909
If it's okay, I want you
to take off your shoes.

1225
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:43,710
What for?

1226
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:45,511
I wanna see your foot.

1227
01:27:46,712 --> 01:27:48,912
Mister, I'm as old as your father,
you telling me to take off my shoes?

1228
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,613
Open the door, let me go!

1229
01:27:50,914 --> 01:27:52,804
I didn't do anything to you.
Why are you talking like that?

1230
01:27:52,915 --> 01:27:54,615
Take it easy.

1231
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,716
Just take off your shoes for a sec.
Then, I'll open the door for you to leave.

1232
01:27:57,917 --> 01:28:01,217
Why should I take off my shoes?
Open the door!

1233
01:28:01,218 --> 01:28:04,218
Hush! Come here.
Let's go over there.

1234
01:28:14,119 --> 01:28:16,219
Sit on the stair, for a sec,
take off your shoes.

1235
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,220
Sit!

1236
01:28:20,721 --> 01:28:21,321
Sit down!

1237
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:25,622
Just sit, okay?

1238
01:28:31,323 --> 01:28:32,823
Take off your shoes, please.

1239
01:28:33,124 --> 01:28:34,124
I'm not feeling well, just don't!

1240
01:28:34,425 --> 01:28:35,725
Well, let me help you.

1241
01:28:35,926 --> 01:28:36,926
I'll take it off, okay.

1242
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:40,527
<i>whispering: I'll take it off.</i>

1243
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:49,728
The other one,
take off the other one too.

1244
01:28:57,729 --> 01:28:58,729
Your socks too.

1245
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,330
Mister, what do you want from me?

1246
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:04,331
Take 'em off!
I said, take off your socks.

1247
01:29:04,431 --> 01:29:05,531
Let me do it myself.

1248
01:29:05,732 --> 01:29:07,932
- No!
- Let me!.. just let me!

1249
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,833
Hello, Siavash!

1250
01:30:26,834 --> 01:30:28,734
No, I'm a little busy right now.

1251
01:30:30,235 --> 01:30:32,135
What time is it, anyways?

1252
01:30:32,936 --> 01:30:34,636
No I'll be there.
Don't worry.

1253
01:30:37,337 --> 01:30:40,637
She'll come herself...
She's a little busy.

1254
01:30:41,224 --> 01:30:42,824
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1255
01:30:43,725 --> 01:30:44,825
Okay, bye.

1256
01:30:47,126 --> 01:30:49,826
Swear on my life, I didn't
want to hurt anyone.

1257
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:54,227
Did that woman tell
you to go there that night?

1258
01:30:54,828 --> 01:30:57,428
That woman had been messaging me
for at least a month.

1259
01:30:57,729 --> 01:31:01,509
She said, "If you still have the pickup,
come over, I wanna see you."

1260
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,530
And I messaged back,
"Ahoo, dear, sorry...

1261
01:31:05,631 --> 01:31:07,731
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1262
01:31:08,832 --> 01:31:11,732
She took it to herself.
No matter how many times I called...

1263
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,033
She never answered.

1264
01:31:14,934 --> 01:31:16,134
Didn't want to talk to me.

1265
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:19,205
That night, I thought I'd drop by
and make it up to her.

1266
01:31:19,536 --> 01:31:20,936
Didn't you know she's moved out?

1267
01:31:21,237 --> 01:31:22,937
God knows, I had no idea.
Swear on my kids' life...

1268
01:31:22,938 --> 01:31:26,938
You opened the door, and went in.
You saw the furniture is different...

1269
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,339
How come you're saying
you didn't know?

1270
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:32,940
I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff,
the bicycle I had bought myself...

1271
01:31:34,941 --> 01:31:36,841
I thought maybe she's moving.

1272
01:31:36,842 --> 01:31:38,842
You're not going out of that door,
until you tell the truth.

1273
01:31:38,943 --> 01:31:42,283
If I had the slightest idea that
you guys have moved in,

1274
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:45,344
I would've thought, maybe
there's a man in the bathroom.

1275
01:31:45,845 --> 01:31:47,945
- My wife's clothes were on the bed.
- I didn't saw those.

1276
01:31:48,046 --> 01:31:50,046
You saw those and figured
there must be a woman in the bath.

1277
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:52,547
...all alone, she even
opened the door for you.

1278
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:54,048
I didn't see any clothes.

1279
01:31:54,449 --> 01:31:57,849
It didn't take even five minutes.
I came in, there was no one there.

1280
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:00,750
Just a minute ago, your wife
had opened the door for me.

1281
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:03,051
Why did your wife
open the door for me?

1282
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:04,752
Well, she thought it's me.

1283
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,852
Let me tell you
what really happened.

1284
01:32:06,953 --> 01:32:11,453
I went by the bathroom door,
called the kid, as soon as I did...

1285
01:32:11,554 --> 01:32:13,354
...there starts the screaming.
Then, I ran away.

1286
01:32:13,355 --> 01:32:14,755
You went into the bathroom.

1287
01:32:14,856 --> 01:32:16,456
I didn't go in the bathroom.

1288
01:32:16,557 --> 01:32:18,157
Then, where was your foot cut like that?

1289
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:21,758
I have no idea.
By the time I was downstairs...

1290
01:32:21,779 --> 01:32:23,949
I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've
stepped on something running down stairs.

1291
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:25,150
Then, my wife's lying?

1292
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:26,851
Your wife says I went into the bathroom?

1293
01:32:26,852 --> 01:32:28,932
My wife was scared and
bumped into the glass,

1294
01:32:28,962 --> 01:32:31,752
otherwise God knows what you
would've done, dirty scumbag!

1295
01:32:31,753 --> 01:32:34,853
I swear on my life or
whatever's dear to you...

1296
01:32:34,854 --> 01:32:37,224
as soon as I found out I'm
in the wrong place, I ran away.

1297
01:32:37,254 --> 01:32:41,654
Well, just tell your wife to come here.
Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her.

1298
01:32:41,675 --> 01:32:43,755
What's my wife supposed to say?

1299
01:32:44,856 --> 01:32:47,856
My wife's said all she had to say.
It's your wife's turn to come here.

1300
01:32:48,457 --> 01:32:50,457
Call her, and tell her to
come here, right now.

1301
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:52,158
What for?

1302
01:32:52,259 --> 01:32:54,359
What you said, I want you to repeat
in front of your wife.

1303
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,760
Mister, why don't you get it?
I didn't go in that bath...

1304
01:32:56,761 --> 01:32:58,061
Okay, you didn't!

1305
01:32:58,562 --> 01:33:01,562
I want you to tell your wife
what you were doing in that house.

1306
01:33:01,663 --> 01:33:02,663
Call her, right now!

1307
01:33:03,164 --> 01:33:04,564
Get it out, and call her!

1308
01:33:05,065 --> 01:33:06,665
Nope! Get out your cell!

1309
01:33:11,665 --> 01:33:13,765
Don't make me look bad
in front of my wife and kids.

1310
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:15,166
Call her, right now.

1311
01:33:15,367 --> 01:33:17,267
My daughter's about to get married.

1312
01:33:17,268 --> 01:33:18,768
Your daughter has to know
her real father.

1313
01:33:19,269 --> 01:33:24,269
I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything,
just so he knows his father-in-law.

1314
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:27,370
I don't have have to keep you here.
Go on, get out! Go!

1315
01:33:28,471 --> 01:33:32,071
I'm gonna call your son-in-law,
tell him to bring your wife here...

1316
01:33:32,072 --> 01:33:33,872
Leave me alone, mister! Ah!

1317
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:42,473
Someone help me!
Help!

1318
01:33:43,174 --> 01:33:45,574
Don't make noises!
Quiet!

1319
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:48,675
Open the door! Open up!
I'll die!

1320
01:33:50,476 --> 01:33:53,876
I'm about to have a stroke.
Open the door!

1321
01:33:54,977 --> 01:33:59,277
Mister! open the door!
I'm afraid of closed spaces.

1322
01:34:03,178 --> 01:34:04,178
Open the door, my boy.

1323
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,779
At least turn on the lights.

1324
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,380
Forgive me...

1325
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:44,081
... my dear!

1326
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:48,881
I can’t cry.

1327
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:53,182
Why did you ever do that to yourself?

1328
01:34:57,183 --> 01:34:59,183
I don’t understand it.

1329
01:34:59,884 --> 01:35:02,084
Help me, Willy!

1330
01:35:07,485 --> 01:35:09,785
It seems to me that you’re
just on another trip.

1331
01:35:10,886 --> 01:35:12,386
I keep expecting you.

1332
01:35:19,188 --> 01:35:21,188
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1333
01:35:22,988 --> 01:35:24,188
Right today.

1334
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:28,589
And there’II
be nobody home.

1335
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,790
We’re free and clear.

1336
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:39,091
We’re free.

1337
01:36:57,992 --> 01:36:59,592
Rana, lock the door,
and take the keys.

1338
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,093
Get up, on your feet.

1339
01:37:29,894 --> 01:37:31,094
Here, wait.

1340
01:37:32,895 --> 01:37:33,895
Sit here.

1341
01:37:50,096 --> 01:37:51,396
You go in that room.

1342
01:38:20,897 --> 01:38:23,097
Look how mentally and
emotionally shattered she is.

1343
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:35,798
There's my wife. Are you gonna keep saying
you haven't gone into the bathroom?

1344
01:38:37,799 --> 01:38:38,599
I'm sorry.

1345
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,500
Answer me.

1346
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:44,801
I made a mistake.

1347
01:38:45,502 --> 01:38:48,402
Tell me, why did you
go into the bathroom?

1348
01:38:54,003 --> 01:38:55,503
I gave into temptation.

1349
01:39:07,205 --> 01:39:08,505
What are you gonna do to him?

1350
01:39:08,906 --> 01:39:13,006
His family are on their way,
I want his wife to know what he's done.

1351
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,200
You're taking your revenge.

1352
01:39:26,201 --> 01:39:27,601
Let him go, let him leave.

1353
01:39:28,502 --> 01:39:30,002
I know what I'm doing.

1354
01:39:31,603 --> 01:39:33,603
You sit here, there's no need
for you to come out.

1355
01:39:56,004 --> 01:39:57,504
Where are you going?

1356
01:39:59,405 --> 01:40:01,805
I'm not feeling right at all.
Let me go.

1357
01:40:02,806 --> 01:40:03,606
They're coming after you.

1358
01:40:04,307 --> 01:40:06,107
Your son-in-law called,
he asked about you.

1359
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:07,708
I told him to come over.

1360
01:40:07,909 --> 01:40:09,309
And to bring your wife too.

1361
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:13,710
They're on their way.
Sit down.

1362
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:21,411
I'm begging you, please
let me go.

1363
01:40:22,312 --> 01:40:23,812
When your family get here.
Tell them everything you told me.

1364
01:40:25,713 --> 01:40:25,713
Then you can leave.

1365
01:40:26,314 --> 01:40:27,314
I'm begging you.

1366
01:40:46,115 --> 01:40:47,115
Miss!

1367
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:49,016
Forgive me.

1368
01:40:49,817 --> 01:40:51,717
Let me go, before they get here.

1369
01:41:10,217 --> 01:41:12,817
That woman lived with me for
35 years.

1370
01:41:26,018 --> 01:41:27,718
Mister! get up!
Get up, go!

1371
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:33,319
You, sit down!

1372
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:34,719
Leave him alone, let him go.

1373
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,820
He'll go, he will. When his family get here,
they can leave together.

1374
01:41:40,021 --> 01:41:40,921
Sit down.

1375
01:41:41,122 --> 01:41:41,822
For the love of God!

1376
01:41:41,923 --> 01:41:42,823
Here, mister, go.

1377
01:41:42,924 --> 01:41:43,724
- Just, sit down.
- Let him go!

1378
01:41:43,725 --> 01:41:45,125
My girl!..
My boy!

1379
01:41:45,326 --> 01:41:47,726
- Leave him alone, Emad!
- You stay out of this!

1380
01:41:49,027 --> 01:41:51,327
- Sit down!
- Please.

1381
01:41:51,329 --> 01:41:51,829
I said sit down! Ah!

1382
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:54,130
SIT... DOWN!
Here.

1383
01:42:13,631 --> 01:42:16,631
What?..
What do you want?

1384
01:42:27,732 --> 01:42:28,832
Oh, my God!

1385
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:33,633
Emad!

1386
01:42:34,034 --> 01:42:36,834
Does he, by any chance,
take any under-the-tongue pills?

1387
01:42:37,435 --> 01:42:39,535
I searched. There's nothing
in his pockets.

1388
01:42:39,537 --> 01:42:41,337
- What happened?
- Where are you now?

1389
01:42:42,038 --> 01:42:45,638
No, no, get here as soon as you can.
Okay, okay.

1390
01:42:46,339 --> 01:42:48,439
- Was it the Emergency?
- His family. They're coming.

1391
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:51,841
- Oh, my God!
- Mister! can you hear me?

1392
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:54,842
Does he have a pulse?
Emad, can you hear his heartbeat?

1393
01:42:54,843 --> 01:42:57,443
Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet.
Let me see what I'm doing.

1394
01:43:00,544 --> 01:43:01,230
Where are you going?

1395
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,044
He said he's got pills.
Maybe they're in the car.

1396
01:43:34,745 --> 01:43:38,445
Can you hear me?..
Open your mouth. Open!

1397
01:43:54,046 --> 01:43:56,946
Mister! get up!
Can you hear me?

1398
01:44:00,247 --> 01:44:02,747
Oh, God!..
Oh, God!

1399
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:06,748
You better now?
You feeling better?

1400
01:44:09,649 --> 01:44:13,349
Breathe! Breathe!
You better, now?

1401
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:28,450
Don't worry,
he's better.

1402
01:44:28,451 --> 01:44:30,151
You didn't call the Emergency?

1403
01:44:32,941 --> 01:44:34,841
No, I was afraid he might be dead.

1404
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:43,442
Wait a minute!

1405
01:44:46,743 --> 01:44:50,343
If you say anything to his family,
I don't wanna have anything to do with you.

1406
01:44:59,444 --> 01:45:00,844
Yes?

1407
01:45:05,445 --> 01:45:07,645
- Hello.
- The elevator's broken, use the stairs.

1408
01:45:07,746 --> 01:45:09,446
Come on, ma!

1409
01:45:10,647 --> 01:45:13,847
You go ahead,
I can't run with this pain in my legs.

1410
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,748
Ya Ali!
My dear.

1411
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:23,549
Come on in.
Come in.

1412
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:36,450
Ya Allah! Dad!
Dad!

1413
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:38,651
How are you dad?

1414
01:45:38,952 --> 01:45:40,652
- Majid!
- What? Come in.

1415
01:45:40,754 --> 01:45:44,454
- Dad! Daddy!
- Thank God, he's fine.

1416
01:45:44,455 --> 01:45:45,655
You okay, dad?

1417
01:45:46,155 --> 01:45:47,155
I'm fine.

1418
01:45:47,956 --> 01:45:50,756
You're okay.
That was such a scare, dad.

1419
01:45:51,357 --> 01:45:52,757
Where's you mother?

1420
01:45:52,758 --> 01:45:54,458
She's in the stairs.
Let me call her.

1421
01:45:54,459 --> 01:45:55,759
Majid, don't call her.

1422
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,760
- Let's go!
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.

1423
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:00,610
Majid! if mother doesn't see him,
she'd think something

1424
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,461
must've happened to him.
Let her see he's fine.

1425
01:46:02,962 --> 01:46:05,662
Hello, sorry. We were in such a hurry
that we didn't notice you.

1426
01:46:06,763 --> 01:46:07,409
That's alright.

1427
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:09,463
Sit down, dad. What
are you getting up for?

1428
01:46:09,565 --> 01:46:11,965
I thought mother better come up and see you,
and then we'll leave. Sit.

1429
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:16,466
We're in no hurry.
Let him sit down until he gets better.

1430
01:46:16,767 --> 01:46:18,467
We're really sorry, mister.

1431
01:46:18,968 --> 01:46:22,868
Dad, just sit down.
Can you?

1432
01:46:22,969 --> 01:46:24,269
Yeah, I'm alright.

1433
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:25,370
Majid!

1434
01:46:26,971 --> 01:46:29,671
What is it, ma?
We're here.

1435
01:46:29,872 --> 01:46:33,272
Come. Thank God, dad's sitting here.
He's all right.

1436
01:46:33,973 --> 01:46:37,773
What is, dad?..
Huh?

1437
01:46:53,674 --> 01:46:56,474
- It's nothing, ma.
- What happened?

1438
01:46:58,775 --> 01:46:59,875
What happened to you?

1439
01:47:06,576 --> 01:47:08,976
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?

1440
01:47:14,777 --> 01:47:16,777
See what you're doing to me and yourself?

1441
01:47:18,678 --> 01:47:21,778
Oh, God.
Thank you so much, God!

1442
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:26,579
God knows, on our way here
I vowed to give away a hundred

1443
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:29,180
different charities, just to
hear his voice one more time.

1444
01:47:30,681 --> 01:47:31,681
Thank God.

1445
01:47:36,082 --> 01:47:37,682
How many times did
I tell you not to go?

1446
01:47:37,783 --> 01:47:41,783
My dear! I don't want you to work.
I don't.

1447
01:47:42,984 --> 01:47:45,484
Darling, you said, "Majid called,
I have to go, I'll be back soon."

1448
01:47:45,685 --> 01:47:47,485
Soon, you call this "soon"?

1449
01:47:47,686 --> 01:47:49,686
Mom, we have to thank these guys,
they stayed with him all this time.

1450
01:47:49,687 --> 01:47:52,487
or else, we don't know
what would've happened to dad.

1451
01:47:52,488 --> 01:47:54,488
We really don't know how to thank you.
That was so kind of you.

1452
01:47:54,489 --> 01:47:57,989
May God give you back, miss.

1453
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:02,090
He's my whole life, mister.
Thank you so much.

1454
01:48:02,891 --> 01:48:04,191
You gave me my life back.

1455
01:48:04,492 --> 01:48:07,292
He's all I've got.

1456
01:48:07,993 --> 01:48:09,793
Come on, mom, stop it.

1457
01:48:12,194 --> 01:48:13,794
Get up, let's go.

1458
01:48:23,496 --> 01:48:25,696
Did you take all your stuff, dad?
Where's your cellphone?

1459
01:48:26,697 --> 01:48:27,697
Car keys.

1460
01:48:29,697 --> 01:48:30,997
Where's his glasses?
Don't leave without his glasses.

1461
01:48:30,998 --> 01:48:33,698
I've got it...
Come here, I'll give it to you.

1462
01:48:34,499 --> 01:48:36,099
- You go, I'll get it
- Majid, the glasses...

1463
01:48:41,901 --> 01:48:43,001
This way.

1464
01:48:43,702 --> 01:48:47,402
What business?
You just saved his life, son.

1465
01:48:49,003 --> 01:48:51,003
No, mister, we've put you through
enough trouble already.

1466
01:48:51,504 --> 01:48:53,004
It's nothing fancy, you know.

1467
01:48:54,904 --> 01:48:56,004
Come on, this way.

1468
01:48:57,205 --> 01:48:59,105
Well, if there's anything to do,
just let me...

1469
01:48:59,606 --> 01:49:02,006
No, let him come himself.
Come on, this way.

1470
01:49:11,007 --> 01:49:12,207
You guys go.

1471
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:24,108
Majid. let me...

1472
01:50:09,409 --> 01:50:10,709
How much money did you
leave in the room, that night?

1473
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,510
Huh?

1474
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:15,511
How much money did you
leave in the room?

1475
01:50:16,712 --> 01:50:17,412
I didn't count.

1476
01:51:34,413 --> 01:51:35,813
What happened, dad?

1477
01:51:36,714 --> 01:51:38,714
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!

1478
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:42,715
What happened to you?
He's sick again.

1479
01:51:43,016 --> 01:51:46,016
What are these?..
Where were these?

1480
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,717
- Come on, sit down a little.
- Is it your heart, dad?

1481
01:51:50,518 --> 01:51:54,018
Let him sit for a while.
Come on, this way.

1482
01:51:56,019 --> 01:51:58,419
We can't take him like this. Majid!

1483
01:51:58,619 --> 01:51:59,719
Majid, hurry up!

1484
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,720
- We're almost there, dad.
- Esmat!

1485
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:15,521
I'm hear, dear.

1486
01:52:17,722 --> 01:52:18,722
Come on, mom.

1487
01:52:19,223 --> 01:52:20,923
Watch it, don't drop him.

1488
01:52:23,724 --> 01:52:26,724
- Esmat! Esmat!
- What? Darling, I'm here.

1489
01:52:27,726 --> 01:52:29,726
What happened to you?
Ya Abalfazl!

1490
01:52:31,127 --> 01:52:32,127
Stretch his legs.

1491
01:52:38,729 --> 01:52:40,729
- God! Dad! you hear me? Dad!
- Where are his pills?

1492
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:45,430
Where are his pills?
Search his pockets.

1493
01:52:46,331 --> 01:52:48,531
Stretch his legs! Hurry up!

1494
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:53,130
- God help us!
- Dad, breathe!

1495
01:52:54,431 --> 01:52:54,731
See if his pills are upstairs.

1496
01:53:05,332 --> 01:53:08,732
Miss! Miss! are my dad's pills here?

1497
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:11,433
He's got sick again,
he's lying in the stairs.

1498
01:53:22,435 --> 01:53:24,935
Mister, for God's sake, will you
get on the way right away?

1499
01:53:25,936 --> 01:53:27,736
Yes, miss, just give some time
for my colleagues to get there.

1500
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:31,736
Just follow my instructions.
His legs must be straight, not bent.

1501
01:53:37,737 --> 01:53:38,737
He's lying face up.

1502
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:48,738
Mister, he's all blue in the face.

1503
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:53,739
Just keep doing what I told you.
If you get tired, let someone else do it.

1504
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:02,740
Mister, he's not moving...
No, no, nothing. He's not moving at all.

1505
01:54:07,742 --> 01:54:10,442
Mister,
can we put his pill under his tongue?

1506
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:14,143
No, no, miss, don't give him anything,
just do what I told you.

1507
01:54:14,744 --> 01:54:16,522
Just make sure his legs,
are stretched, not bent.

1508
01:54:16,552 --> 01:54:17,144
Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:54:57,345 --> 01:54:58,745
Guys, please hurry up!

1510
01:55:02,946 --> 01:55:05,046
- Hello, where's the patient?
- He's inside.

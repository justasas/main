1
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,110
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

2
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,472
Willy?

3
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,351
It's all right.
I came back.

4
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:12,437
Why, what happened?
Did something happen, Willy?

5
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:14,981
- Nothing happened.
- You didn't smash the car?

6
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,608
I said nothing happened!

7
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,194
- Didn't you hear me?
- Don't you feel well?

8
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:23,156
I'm tired to the death.

9
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:26,742
I, uh, I couldn't make it.

10
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,536
I just couldn't make it, Linda.

11
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:30,955
Where were you all day?
You look terrible.

12
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh, I got as far
as a little above Yonkers.

13
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,252
I stopped for a cup of coffee.

14
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,796
- Maybe it was the coffee.
- What?

15
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:41,007
I suddenly couldn't drive anymore.

16
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,259
The car kept going off
onto the shoulder.

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,677
Maybe it's the steering.

18
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,054
I don't think
Angelo knows the Studebaker.

19
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:50,309
No, it's me. Suddenly I realise
I'm going 60 miles an hour

20
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:53,019
and I don't remember
the last five minutes.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,479
I can't seem to keep my mind to it.

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,567
Maybe it's your glasses.
You never went for new glasses.

23
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,360
I see everything.
I came back ten miles an hour.

24
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,863
It took me nearly four hours
from Yonkers.

25
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,701
You just gotta take a rest.
You can't continue like this.

26
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,202
Aw, I just got back from Florida.

27
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:12,204
But you didn't rest your mind.

28
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:15,500
Your mind is overactive
and the mind is what counts, dear.

29
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,337
I'll start out in the morning.
Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.

30
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,214
Oh, these... these arch supports
are killing me.

31
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,841
Take an aspirin.

32
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,385
Should I get you an aspirin?
Lt'll soothe you.

33
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,656
I was driving along, understand?
I was fine.

34
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:32,641
I was even observing the scenery.

35
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:36,480
You can imagine me looking at scenery
on the road every week of my life.

36
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,773
But it's so beautiful up there, Linda.

37
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,941
The trees are thick and the sun is warm.

38
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,237
I just open the windshield
and let the warm air bathe over me.

39
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,839
And then all of a sudden I'm...

40
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,116
...l'm going off the road.

41
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,953
I'm telling you,
I absolutely forgot I was driving.

42
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,457
If I'd have gone the other way
over the white line

43
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,059
I might have killed somebody.

44
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:03,381
So, I went on again and five minutes
later I'm dreaming again and I nearly...

45
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,262
I have such thoughts.
I have such strange thoughts.

46
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,681
Talk to them again, Willy.

47
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,727
There's no reason
why you can't work in New York.

48
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,688
I'm the New England man.
I'm vital in New England.

49
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:22,567
You're 60 years old. They can't expect
you to keep driving every week.

50
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,695
I'll have to send a wire to Portland.

51
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,950
I'm supposed to see Brown and Morrison
tomorrow morning to show the line.

52
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,159
- Oh, I could sell them.
- Now, Willy.

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,620
Go down to that place again.
Talk to Howard.

54
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,999
Tell him you gotta work in New York.
You're too accommodating.

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,711
If old man Wagner was alive,
I'd have been in charge of New York now.

56
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,338
That man was a prince.
He was a masterful man.

57
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,924
That boy of his, Howard,
he don't appreciate.

58
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,676
When I went north the first time,

59
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,512
the Wagner Company didn't know
where New England was.

60
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,806
Why don't you
tell these things to Howard?

61
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,534
Oh, I will. I definitely will.

62
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,898
- Oh, is there any cheese?
- I'll make you a sandwich.

63
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,233
Go to sleep. I'll take some milk.

64
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,210
Geez.

65
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,589
Maybe he smashed up the car again.

66
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:14,244
He's gonna get his licence taken away
if he keeps that up.

67
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,787
I'm getting nervous about him, you know.

68
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:19,373
- His eyes are gone.
- No, I've driven with him.

69
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:22,335
He sees all right.
Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.

70
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,628
I drove into the city
with him last week.

71
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,339
He stops at a green light.
It turns red and he goes.

72
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,174
- Maybe he's colour blind.
- Pop?

73
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,844
He's got the finest eye for colour
in the business.

74
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,221
- The boys in?
- They're sleeping.

75
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,974
- Happy took Biff on a date tonight.
- Is that so?

76
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:39,811
It was so thrilling,
seeing them shaving together,

77
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,189
one behind the other in the bathroom
and going out together.

78
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,190
- Did you notice?
- Hm?

79
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,236
The whole house smells
of shaving lotion.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,112
Figure it out.

81
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:53,283
Work a lifetime to pay off a house.
You finally own it.

82
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,367
There's nobody to live in it.

83
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,870
Life's a casting off.
It's always that way.

84
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,539
No, no, some people
accomplish something.

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,250
Did Biff say anything
after I went this morning?

86
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:06,838
You shouldn't have criticised him,
after he just got off the train.

87
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,425
- You must not lose your temper at him.
- When did I lose my temper?

88
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,968
I simply asked him
if he was making any money.

89
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,348
- Is that criticism?
- Willy, how could he make any money?

90
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,807
There's such an undercurrent in him.

91
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,312
He became a moody man. Did he apologise
when I left this morning?

92
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:26,149
He was crestfallen, Willy.
Now, you know how he admires you.

93
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:30,278
I think when he finds himself you'll
both be happier and you won't fight.

94
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,988
How can he find himself on a farm?
Is that a life?

95
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,115
A farmhand in the beginning
when he was young,

96
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:39,079
I thought, a young man, it's good
for him to travel, take differentjobs.

97
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:42,457
It's more than ten years and
he has yet to make 35 dollars a week.

98
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,583
He is finding himself, Willy.

99
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,377
Not finding yourself at the age of 34
is a disgrace.

100
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,880
- Shh!
- The trouble is, he's lazy!

101
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,343
- Willy, please, they are sleeping.
- Biff is a lazy...

102
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,302
...bum!
- Go down!

103
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:58,013
Get yourself something to eat
and be quiet.

104
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:59,848
Why did he come home?

105
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,184
I would like to know
what brought him home.

106
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,355
Well, I don't know.
I think he's still lost, Willy.

107
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,272
I think he's very lost.

108
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,318
Biff Loman is lost
in the greatest country in the world.

109
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,571
A young man with such
personal attractiveness gets lost?

110
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:16,866
And such a hard worker.

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,493
There's one thing about Biff.
He's not lazy.

112
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,804
Never.

113
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:26,251
I'll see him in the morning, have
a talk with him, get him a job selling.

114
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,043
He'd be big in no time.

115
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:31,506
Remember the way they used to
follow him around in high school?

116
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,802
Oh, when he just smiled at them
their faces lit up.

117
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:40,306
When he walked down the
street with a crowd of kids behind him.

118
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,641
Will you ever forget that?

119
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,018
- You smoking?
- You want one?

120
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,872
I can never sleep when I smell it.

121
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:52,443
It's funny, Biff, you know... us.

122
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:56,155
Sleeping in here again, huh?
The old beds.

123
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,116
All the talk that went across
those two beds, huh?

124
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:01,343
- Our whole lives.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,412
A lotta dreams and plans.

126
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,875
About 500 women would like to know
what was said in this room.

127
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:11,004
- Remember that big Betsy something?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,007
What the hell was her name?
Over on Bushwick Avenue.

129
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,967
- With the collie dog.
- Yeah, that's the one.

130
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,014
- I got you in there, man.
- That was my first time, I think.

131
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,017
Boy, there was a pig.

132
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,604
You taught me everything I know
about women. Don't forget that.

133
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:31,316
I bet you forgot how bashful
you used to be, especially with girls.

134
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,444
Oh, I still am, Biff.
I just control it, that's all.

135
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,571
I think I got less bashful.

136
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,615
You got more so.

137
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:43,244
What happened, Biff?
Where's your old humour?

138
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:47,081
The old confidence?
What's the matter?

139
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,878
- Why does Dad mock me all the time?
- He's not mocking you, Biff.

140
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:55,590
Everything I say there's mockery
on his face. I can't get near him.

141
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,091
I think the fact
that you're not settled,

142
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,926
that you're still up in the air.

143
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,471
I think there's other things
depressing him.

144
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,265
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Don't lay it all to me.

145
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,601
But I think if you just got started...

146
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,563
I mean, is there any future
for you out there?

147
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,609
I don't know what the future is.
I don't know what I'm supposed to want.

148
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,193
What do you mean?

149
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:21,240
I spent six or seven years after
high school trying to work myself up.

150
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:24,660
Shipping clerk, salesman,
business of one kind or another.

151
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,953
It's a measly manner of existence.

152
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:30,458
To get on that subway
in the hot mornings in the summer,

153
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,796
to devote your whole life
to keeping stock or making phone calls.

154
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,214
And the selling, the buying.

155
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:41,594
To suffer 50 weeks of the year
for the sake of a two week vacation,

156
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:46,808
when all you really desire
is to be outdoors with your shirt off.

157
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:50,186
And always to have to get ahead
of the next fellow.

158
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,396
Still, that's how you build a future.

159
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:56,359
I bought a new kind
of American type cheese. It's whipped.

160
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,360
Why do you get American?
I like Swiss.

161
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:01,447
- I thought you'd like a change.
- I don't want a change.

162
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,118
- Why am I always being contradicted?
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

163
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:08,746
- Why don't you open a window in here?
- They're all open.

164
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,333
They boxed us in here.
Bricks and windows, windows and bricks.

165
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,835
We should have bought
the land next door.

166
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,880
There's not a breath of fresh air
in the neighbourhood.

167
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,799
The grass don't grow anymore.
You can't raise a carrot.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,719
They should have had a law
against apartment houses.

169
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,890
Remember those two beautiful elm trees?

170
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:33,020
When I and Biff
hung the swing between them, huh?

171
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,438
Like being a million miles
from the city.

172
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,901
They should have arrested the builder
for cutting those down.

173
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,670
They massacred the neighbourhood.

174
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:48,703
More and more I think of those days,
Linda, this time of year.

175
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:51,496
It was lilacs and wisteria

176
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:54,667
and then the peonies
would come out... daffodils.

177
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,502
What fragrance in this room.

178
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,673
- People had to move somewhere.
- There's more people now.

179
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:03,341
- I don't think...
- There's more people!

180
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:07,513
That's what's ruining this country!
Population is getting out of control!

181
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,348
The competition is maddening!

182
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:14,979
Smell the stink from that apartment
house and another on the other side!

183
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,960
How can they whip cheese?

184
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,197
Go down, try it and be quiet.

185
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:33,748
You're not worried about me,
are you, sweetheart, huh?

186
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:39,003
No, you've got too much on the ball
to be worried about, my darling.

187
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:43,883
You're my foundation
and my support, Linda.

188
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:47,970
Oh, just try to relax.
You make mountains out of molehills.

189
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,846
I won't fight with him anymore.

190
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,931
If he wants to go to Texas, let him go.

191
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,558
- He'll find his way.
- Sure.

192
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,520
Certain men just don't get started
till later in life.

193
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,649
Like Thomas Edison, I think,

194
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:02,417
or B.F. Goodrich.

195
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,171
One of them was deaf.

196
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:08,865
I'll put my money on Biff.

197
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:12,745
And Willy, if it's warm Sunday
we'll drive in the country.

198
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,413
We'll open the windshield,
we'll take lunch.

199
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,083
The windshields don't open
on the new cars.

200
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:21,420
- But you opened it today.
- Me?

201
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,315
I didn't.

202
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,236
Now, isn't that peculiar?

203
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:35,184
- Isn't that remarkable?
- What, dear?

204
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:39,814
That is the most remarkable thing.

205
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:43,041
What, darling?

206
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,169
I was thinking of the Chevy.

207
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:52,618
1928, when I had that red Chevy.

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,306
Isn't that funny?

209
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,752
I could have sworn
I was back in that Chevy today.

210
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:06,465
That's nothing.
Something must have reminded you.

211
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,693
Remarkable.

212
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,946
Remember those days, huh?

213
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:17,101
The way Biff used to simonise that car?

214
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:20,688
Dealer refused to believe
there was 80,000 miles on it.

215
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:25,568
Close your eyes.
I'll be right up.

216
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,570
Now, you be careful on the stairs.

217
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,824
- The cheese is on the middle shelf.
- Eighty thousand mi...

218
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:34,760
Eighty-two thousand.

219
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,252
No, I've always made a point
of not wasting my life.

220
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:47,131
Whenever I come back here I know that
all I've done is to waste my life.

221
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,966
You're a poet, Biff.
You know that?

222
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:54,722
- You're an idealist.
- No, I'm mixed up very bad.

223
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,725
Maybe I ought to get married, right?

224
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,935
Maybe I ought
to get stuck into something.

225
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,478
Maybe that's my trouble.

226
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:06,233
I'm like a boy.
I'm not married, I'm not in business.

227
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:09,044
I'm just like a boy.

228
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,530
Are you content, Hap?

229
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:15,200
You're a success, aren't you?
Are you content?

230
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:18,077
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You're making money.

231
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,665
All I can do now is wait for
the merchandise manager to die.

232
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:30,382
Listen, kid, why don't you
come out West with me?

233
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,216
And you and I?

234
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:36,221
Maybe we can buy a ranch,
raise cattle, use some muscles.

235
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:39,223
Men built like we are
should be working in the open.

236
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,809
- The Loman brothers?
- We'd be known all over.

237
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,479
Biff, Biff, that's
what I dream of sometimes.

238
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,651
Sometimes I want to rip my clothes off
and outbox the merchandise manager.

239
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,152
I can outbox, out lift,
outrun anybody in the store

240
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:53,696
and I have to take orders
from those sons of bitches.

241
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,531
If you were with me I'd be happier.

242
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:59,203
Everybody around me is so false
that I am constantly lowering my ideals.

243
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:02,915
Together we'd stand up for one another.

244
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:06,001
We werert brought up to grub for money.
I don't know how.

245
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,419
- Neither can I.
- Let's go.

246
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,089
The only thing is,
what can you make out there?

247
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,090
Hap!

248
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,678
I got to show some
of those pompous executives there

249
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,613
that Hap Loman can make the grade, huh?

250
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:21,491
Then I'll go with you, Biff.

251
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,018
We'll be together yet.

252
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,913
I swear, huh?

253
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:31,060
But take those two we had tonight.
Werert they gorgeous creatures?

254
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,603
Yeah, most gorgeous I've had in years.

255
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,857
I get that any time I want, Biff.
Whenever I feel disgusted.

256
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:40,069
The only trouble is,
it gets like bowling or something.

257
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,364
I just keep knocking them over.
It doesn't mean anything.

258
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,532
- You still run around a lot?
- Nah.

259
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:49,703
I'd like to find a girl steady,
somebody with substance.

260
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:52,664
- Mm-hmm. That's what I long for.
- Go on.

261
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,958
- You'd never come home.
- I would.

262
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,960
Somebody with character, like Mom.

263
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,838
You're gonna call me a bastard
when I tell you this.

264
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,675
That girl Charlotte I was with,
engaged to be married.

265
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,592
- No kidding.
- Sure.

266
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:07,178
Guy's in line
for the vice-presidency of the store.

267
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,680
I don't know what gets into me.

268
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:11,642
Maybe I have an overdeveloped
sense of competition.

269
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,728
I went and ruined her.
Furthermore, I can't get rid of her.

270
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,980
He's the third executive
I've done that to.

271
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:19,107
Isn't that a crummy characteristic?

272
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,252
And to top it all,
I go to their weddings.

273
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,031
Don't get your sweater dirty!
Biff!

274
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,074
Doesrt he know Mom can hear that?

275
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:31,662
Oh, what a simonising job. Huh?

276
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,665
Look, Biff, don't leave again, will you?

277
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:37,041
You'll find a job here, Biff.

278
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,085
- You gotta stay.
- Hey, Biff-o!

279
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,963
I don't know what to do.
It's getting embarrassing.

280
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh, boy, what a simonising job.

281
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:50,139
Look, you go to sleep now but
talk to him in the morning, will ya?

282
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:53,559
- With her in the house?
- We should have a good talk with him.

283
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,645
- That selfish, stupid...
- Shh. Sleep, Biff.

284
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:04,377
No kidding, Biff.
You got a date?

285
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:13,704
Listen, um, you just want
to be careful with those...

286
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,914
...those girls, Biff.
That's all.

287
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,583
Don't make any promises,
no promises, Biff.

288
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,127
No promises of any kind.

289
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:24,924
'Cause the girls, you know,
they always believe what you tell them.

290
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,342
You're very young, Biff.

291
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:32,348
You're too young
to be talking seriously to girls.

292
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:35,893
You want to watch your schooling first.

293
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,602
Stand where you were.

294
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,396
When you're all set, though,

295
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:45,319
there will be plenty of girls

296
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,922
for a boy like you.

297
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:51,841
That so?

298
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,511
The girls pay for you?

299
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:58,598
Boy, you must really be making a hit.

300
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,586
I've been wondering why
you polished the car so careful there.

301
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,831
Uh...

302
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:12,462
Don't leave the hubcaps.
Get the chamois to the hubcaps.

303
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:17,108
Happy, use newspaper on the windows.
It's easy.

304
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,844
Use it like a pad.

305
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,072
That's it, good work.
You're going all right.

306
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,727
Biff, um...

307
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,354
First thing we gotta do
when we get time,

308
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,857
we gotta clip that big branch
over the house.

309
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,710
I'm afraid it's gonna fall on the roof.

310
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:40,173
Tell you what, we get a, uh...

311
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,242
We get a rope and sling her around,

312
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:45,953
we climb up there with saws
and take her down.

313
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,664
Soon as you finish the car, boys,
I want to see you.

314
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:50,291
I got a surprise for you, boys.

315
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:54,421
- What do you got, Dad?
- No, no, you finish first.

316
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,550
Never leave a job till you finish.
You remember that.

317
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,319
Biff?

318
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:06,850
Up in Albany I saw a beautiful hammock.
I think I'll buy it next trip

319
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:10,411
and we'll hang it
between those two elms there, huh?

320
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:13,164
Wouldrt that be...
Huh?

321
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,191
Wouldrt that be something?

322
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:19,905
Just hanging... Just swinging there
under those branches?

323
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:21,989
Oh, boy, that would be something.

324
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,784
How's that, Pop? Professional?

325
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:27,954
Terrific. That's a terrific job, boys.

326
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,401
- Good work, Biff. - Where's the
surprise? - In the back seat of the car.

327
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:37,130
What is it? Tell me. What did you buy?
-Never mind, something I want you to have.

328
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,507
- What is it, Happy?
- It's a punching bag.

329
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:42,719
- It's got Gene Tunney's signature.
- How'd you know?

330
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:45,638
- The finest thing for the timing.
- I'm losing weight.

331
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,307
- Jumping rope is good, too.
- See the football I got?

332
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,228
- Where'd you get a new ball?
- Coach told me to practice passing.

333
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,231
- He gave you the ball?
- I borrowed it from the locker room.

334
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:56,732
- I want you to return that.
- I told you.

335
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,661
- I'm bringing it back.
- He's gotta practice with a ball.

336
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,288
Coach will congratulate you
on your initiative.

337
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,375
- He keeps congratulating my initiative.
- He likes you.

338
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:08,295
Somebody else took that ball,
there'd be an uproar.

339
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:11,172
What's the report, boys?
What's the report?

340
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,426
Where'd you go this time, Pop?
We were lonesome for you.

341
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,471
I'll tell you a secret, boys.
Don't breathe it to a soul.

342
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:21,224
Someday I'll have my own business
and I'll never have to leave home.

343
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:24,226
- Like Uncle Charley?
- Bigger than Uncle Charley.

344
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,490
Charley is not liked.
He's liked but he's not well liked.

345
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:32,319
- Where'd you go this time?
- I went to Providence. Met the mayor.

346
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,071
- The mayor of Providence?
- He was in the hotel lobby.

347
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:37,698
- What did he say?
- He said, "Good morning".

348
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,867
I said, "You got a fine state here".

349
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,205
He had coffee with me,
then I went to Waterbury.

350
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:47,150
Waterbury is a fine city, a big clock
city. The famous Waterbury clock.

351
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:53,131
Sold a nice bill there. And then Boston.
Boston was the cradle of the Revolution.

352
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,508
A fine city.
A couple other towns in Mass,

353
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,843
on to Portland, Bangor
and straight home.

354
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:00,054
- Love to go with you.
- As soon as summer comes.

355
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:03,350
- Promise?
- You, Hap and I, I'll show you.

356
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,226
One thing, boys, I have friends.

357
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:09,022
I can park my car on any street
and the cops protect it like their own.

358
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,983
This summer we'll take
our bathing suits...

359
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,193
- We'll carry your bags.
- That'd be something,

360
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:17,447
coming to the Boston stores
with you boys carrying my bags!

361
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,240
A sensation.

362
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,244
- You nervous about the game?
- Not if you're gonna be there.

363
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,578
What do they say
now that you're captain?

364
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,331
There's a crowd of girls around him
when classes change.

365
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:30,794
This Saturday, just for you,
I'm gonna break through for a touchdown.

366
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:33,671
- You are supposed to pass...
- I'm doing one play for Pop.

367
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,633
When I take off my helmet
that means I'm breaking out.

368
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:39,886
- Watch me cross that line.
- Wait till I tell this in Boston.

369
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,680
- Biff, where are you?
- Hey, look at Bernard!

370
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,598
What are you looking so anaemic about?

371
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,519
Gotta study, Uncle Willy.
He's got Regents next week.

372
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,894
Come on, let's box.

373
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:51,689
I heard Mr. Birnbaum say
if you don't start studying math

374
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,735
he's gonna flunk you and you won't
graduate. -You better study with him.

375
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:59,114
- Pop, you didn't see my sneakers.
- A beautiful job of printing.

376
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:03,660
Just because he prints University of
Virginia doesn't mean they gotta graduate him.

377
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:07,289
With scholarships to three universities
they're gonna flunk him?

378
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,124
- I heard Mr. Birnbaum say...
- Don't be a pest.

379
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,685
What an anaemic.

380
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:17,265
I'm waiting for you in my house, Biff.

381
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,308
Bernard is not well-liked, is he?

382
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,144
He's liked but he's not well-liked.

383
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,480
Bernard can get
the best marks in school,

384
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:28,318
but when he gets out to the business
world you'll be ahead of him.

385
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:31,946
That's why I thank Almighty God
you're both built like Adonises.

386
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,823
The man who makes an appearance
in the business world,

387
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:38,369
the man who creates personal interest,
is the man who gets ahead.

388
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,555
Be liked and you will never want, hm?

389
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:45,502
Take me, for instance. I never
have to wait in line to see a buyer.

390
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:48,253
Willy Loman is here,
that's all they have to know.

391
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:50,589
- I go straight through.
- Did you knock 'em dead?

392
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,510
Knocked them cold in Providence,
slaughtered in Boston.

393
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:57,055
- I'm losing weight, Pop.
- Hello, dear. - Sweetheart.

394
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,433
- How'd the Chevy run?
- Chevrolet's the greatest car ever.

395
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:03,060
Since when do you
let your mother carry wash?

396
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:06,973
Where to, Ma? -Just hang it on the
line. Biff, you gotta go to your friends.

397
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,769
- The cellar is filled with boys.
- When Pop comes home they can wait.

398
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:14,606
- Better go tell them what to do, Biff.
- Sweep out the furnace room.

399
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:18,568
- Good work, Biff. - The way they
obey him. - That's the training.

400
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,528
I was selling thousands,
but I had to come home.

401
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,198
The block will be at that game.
You sell anything?

402
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,077
I did 500 gross in Providence,
700 gross in Boston.

403
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,030
Wait, wait, I got a pencil.

404
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:34,617
That makes your commission 200...

405
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,535
My God!

406
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:40,165
- Two hundred and twelve dollars!
- I didn't figure it yet.

407
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:43,710
- How much did you do?
- A hundred eighty gross in Providence.

408
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:46,503
It comes to roughly 200 gross
on the whole trip.

409
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:49,465
See, three of the stores
were half closed for inventory.

410
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,425
I would have broke records.

411
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:54,261
It makes 70 dollars and some pennies.
Very good.

412
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,138
- What do we owe?
- Well...

413
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,807
- Sixteen dollars on the refrigerator.
- Why 16?

414
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,644
- The fan belt broke. It was $1.80.
- It's brand new.

415
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,731
Well, it's like the man says.
It's got to work itself in.

416
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:07,107
I hope we didn't get stuck
on that machine.

417
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,484
It's got the biggest ads of any of them!

418
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,320
It's a fine machine.
What else?

419
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:15,241
Well, there's $9.60
for the washing machine,

420
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,412
for the vacuum cleaner there's three and
a half due on the 15th, then the roof.

421
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:23,416
- You've got 21 dollars. - It don't
leak? - They did a wonderful job.

422
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:26,961
- You owe five for the carburettor.
- I'm not gonna pay that man.

423
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:31,382
That lousy, rotten Chevrolet, they ought
to prohibit the manufacture of that car.

424
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:33,634
Well, you owe him three and a half.

425
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:37,347
And odds and ends comes to
around 120 dollars by the 15th.

426
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,975
A hundred and twenty dollars?
If business don't pick up I don't know.

427
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,103
- Next week you'll do better.
- I'll knock them dead.

428
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:47,064
I'll go to Hartford.
I'm well-liked in Hartford.

429
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,693
You know what the trouble is, Linda?
People don't seem to take to me.

430
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,362
- Don't be so foolish.
- I know it when I walk in.

431
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:56,114
- They seem to laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

432
00:24:56,115 --> 00:25:00,119
- Don't talk like that.
- They just pass me by.

433
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:04,549
- You're making 70 to 100 dollars a week.
- I gotta be at in 10, 12 hours a day.

434
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:07,501
Other men, I don't know why,
they do it easier.

435
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:10,253
I don't know why I can't stop myself.
I talk too much.

436
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:13,575
- Oh! - A man ought to come
in with a few words.

437
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,636
Charley, he's a man of few words
and they respect him.

438
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,471
You don't talk too much.
You're just lively.

439
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:22,433
Well, I figure, what the hell.
Life is short.

440
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,120
A couple of jokes...

441
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:30,357
- I joke too much.
- Why, you're...

442
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:33,085
I'm short.

443
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:36,446
I'm very foolish to look at, Linda.

444
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:40,893
I didn't tell you, but at Christmastime
I happened to be calling on F.H. Stewarts,

445
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:45,206
another salesman I know
as I was going to see the buyer.

446
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,502
I heard him say something
about "the shrimp".

447
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:54,882
And I cracked him...
I cracked him right across the face.

448
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:56,717
I won't take that.

449
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:59,595
I simply will not take that.

450
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:05,183
But they do laugh at me.
Oh, I know that.

451
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,477
- Darling?
- No, I gotta overcome it.

452
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,729
- I know I gotta overcome it.
- Darling?

453
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm not dressing to advantage, maybe.

454
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:17,864
Willy, darling, you're
the handsomest man in the world.

455
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:24,203
You're the best. You're a pal.

456
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,584
On the road I want to grab you sometimes
and just kiss the life out of you.

457
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:34,672
I get so lonely,
especially when business is bad,

458
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,717
I get the feeling
I'll never sell anything.

459
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,527
I want to make a living for you.

460
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:45,357
Or business. Business for the boys.
There's so much I want to make for them.

461
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,393
Me? You didn't make me, Willy.
I picked you.

462
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,520
- You picked me, huh?
- I did.

463
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:54,692
I'm sitting at that desk, watching all
the salesmen go by, day in and day out.

464
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:58,279
You got such a sense of humour.
And we do have a good time together.

465
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:01,281
- Sure, sure. Why do you have to go?
- It's 2:00.

466
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,202
- Come on.
- My sisters will be scandalised.

467
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:07,120
- When will you be back?
- Two weeks. Will you come up?

468
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:11,167
Sure thing. You do make me laugh.
That's good for me.

469
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,960
And I think you're a wonderful man.

470
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:18,658
- You picked me, huh? - I did, 'cause
you're so sweet and such a kidder.

471
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:20,926
I'll see you next time I'm in Boston.

472
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,720
- I'll put you through to the buyers.
- Right. Well.

473
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:26,389
Well, bottoms up.

474
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,352
Willy! You just kill me, Willy!

475
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:32,079
You just kill me!

476
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:36,025
And thanks for the stockings.
I love a lot of stockings.

477
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,487
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

478
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,489
Oh, and keep your pores open.

479
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,716
Willy!

480
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:50,748
You are, Willy, the handsomest.

481
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:59,005
I'll make it all up to you, Linda.

482
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,675
There's nothing to make up.
You're doing fine.

483
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,010
- What's that?
- I'm mending my stockings.

484
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:07,223
- They're so expensive.
- I won't have you mending stockings!

485
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:09,391
- Willy...
- Where is he? If he doesn't...

486
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:12,102
- Give him the answers.
- I do, but I can't on a Regents.

487
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:15,189
- It's a state exam.
- Biff! Where is he?

488
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,482
You better give back that football.

489
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:20,861
- Biff, where is he?
- He's too rough with the girls.

490
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:24,031
- He's driving without a licence.
- Shut up.

491
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,281
Willy.

492
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:28,369
- Get out of here.
- If he doesn't buckle down he'll flunk.

493
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:33,124
- You gotta do something about that boy.
- There's nothing the matter with him.

494
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,920
You want him to be a worm like Bernard?

495
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:42,591
Aw, he's got spirit, personality.

496
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:46,137
He's loaded with it, loaded.
What is he stealing?

497
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,448
He's giving it back, isn't he?

498
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:53,702
Why is he stealing?

499
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:57,606
What did I tell him?
I never in my life told him anything...

500
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:01,234
Come on up, Pop.
Let's go up.

501
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,045
Huh?

502
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,823
Why did she have
to wax the floors herself?

503
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,869
Every time she waxes the floors
she keels over.

504
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,162
- She knows that.
- Take it easy, Pop.

505
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:15,583
- Hey, what brought you back tonight?
- I got an awful scare.

506
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,851
I nearly hit a kid in Yonkers.

507
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:21,672
Why didn't I go to Alaska
with my brother Ben that time?

508
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:24,925
Ben, that man was a genius.
That man was success incarnate.

509
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,802
What a mistake.
He begged me to go.

510
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:31,932
The man started with the clothes on his
back and ended up with diamond mines.

511
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,142
I'd like to know how he did it.

512
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:36,227
The man knew what he wanted, got it.

513
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:39,732
Walks into a jungle, comes out
the age of 21 and he's rich.

514
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:44,403
The world is an oyster, but
you don't crack it open on a mattress.

515
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,197
Pop, I told you,
I'm gonna retire you for life.

516
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:50,242
You're gonna retire me for life
on 70 dollars a week

517
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:53,537
and your women and your car
and your apartment. You retire me?

518
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,208
I couldn't get past Yonkers today.
Where are you guys? Where are you?

519
00:29:57,291 --> 00:30:02,154
The woods are burning. I can't
drive a car. - Everything all right?

520
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,007
- What's the matter?
- Everything's fine.

521
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:10,720
- I thought something happened.
- No. - Can't we do something about the walls?

522
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:14,766
You sneeze in here, in my house hats
blow off. - Come on, let's go up, huh?

523
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,187
- You go ahead. I'm not tired.
- All right. Take it easy.

524
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,568
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had a heartburn.

525
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:27,278
- You don't know how to eat.
- I eat with my mouth.

526
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,115
You gotta know about vitamins
and things like that.

527
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:33,410
- Come on, let's shoot. Tire you out.
- All right.

528
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:36,372
- You got cards?
- I got them someplace.

529
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:41,417
What is it with those vitamins?

530
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,920
They build up your bones. Chemistry.

531
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:47,091
- There's no bones in a heartburn.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:49,717
- You don't know about it.
- I'll get insulted.

533
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:52,888
Don't talk about something
you don't know anything about.

534
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:03,081
- What are you doing home?
- A little trouble with the car.

535
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,542
Oh.

536
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:10,698
- I'd like to take a trip to California.
- Don't say.

537
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:16,328
You want a job? - I got a job, I told you
that. What are you offering me a job for?

538
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:19,122
- Don't get insulted.
- Don't insult me.

539
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,916
- You don't have to go on this way.
- I got a good job.

540
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:24,878
- What do you keep coming in here for?
- You want me to go?

541
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,048
I can't understand it.
He's going back to Texas again.

542
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:29,882
- What is that?
- Let him go.

543
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:32,385
I've got nothing to give him.
I'm clean.

544
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:36,515
- I'm clean.
- He won't starve. None of them starve.

545
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:39,893
- Forget about it.
- Then what have I got to remember?

546
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:45,299
You take it too hard. When a deposit bottle
is broken you don't get your nickel back.

547
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:48,527
- That's easy for you to say.
- That ain't easy for me to say.

548
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:54,199
You see the ceiling
I put up in here, hmm?

549
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:57,260
Yeah, that's a piece of work.

550
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:02,039
Putting up a ceiling is a mystery to me.

551
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,060
How do you do it?
What's the difference?

552
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:08,212
- Huh?
- Well, talk about it.

553
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:10,423
- You gonna put up a ceiling?
- How can I?

554
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:13,217
- What are you bothering me for?
- You're insulted.

555
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,970
A man who can't handle tools
is not a man.

556
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:19,933
- You're disgusting.
- Don't call me disgusting, Willy.

557
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:23,145
Oh, I'm getting...

558
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:28,984
- I'm getting awfully tired, Ben.
- Keep playing. You'll sleep better.

559
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:31,795
Did you call me Ben?

560
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:37,493
That's funny. For a second
you reminded me of my brother, Ben.

561
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:41,079
- I only have a few minutes.
- You never heard from him again?

562
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:45,693
Didn't Linda tell you? A couple weeks ago
we got a letter from his wife in Africa.

563
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:49,253
- He died. - Is that so?
- This is Brooklyn, huh?

564
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:52,424
- Maybe you're in for some of his money.
- He had seven sons.

565
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,842
There was one opportunity
I had with that man.

566
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,428
There are several properties
I'm looking at.

567
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:01,308
If I'd have gone with him to Alaska
everything would have been different.

568
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:04,770
- You'd have froze to death.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:09,608
Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska.
I'm surprised you're not up there.

570
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,568
There's the only man I ever met
who knew the answers.

571
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,153
- How are you all?
- Fine.

572
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:16,989
- Fine.
- Pretty sharp tonight.

573
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,325
- Is Mother living with you?
- She died long ago.

574
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,786
- Who?
- Fine specimen of a lady, Mother.

575
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,955
- I'd hoped to see the old girl.
- Who died?

576
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:26,457
- You heard from Father?
- What do you mean, who died?

577
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,709
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about!

578
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,586
- It's half past eight.
- That's my bill.

579
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,214
- I put the ace.
- If you don't know how to play...

580
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:36,134
- It's my ace, for God's sake.
- I'm through!

581
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:38,052
- When did Mother die?
- Long ago.

582
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:40,680
- You never knew how to play cards.
- All right.

583
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:42,848
Next time I'll bring a deck
with five aces.

584
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,061
- I don't play that kind of game.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

585
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,770
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

586
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:51,108
- Ignoramus.
- So, you're William?

587
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:53,167
Oh, Ben.

588
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,237
I've been waiting for you so long.

589
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:58,823
What's the answer?
How did you do it?

590
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:00,950
There's a story in that.

591
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,785
- Is this Ben?
- How do you do?

592
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:05,496
Where have you been?
Willy's been wondering...

593
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:07,581
Where is Dad?
How did you get started?

594
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:11,920
- I don't know how much you remember.
- I was just a baby, 3 or 4 years old.

595
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:14,505
- Three years, eleven months.
- What a memory.

596
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:17,049
I have many enterprises
and I've never kept books.

597
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,677
I was sitting under the wagon.
What was it, Nebraska?

598
00:34:19,678 --> 00:34:21,846
South Dakota and I gave you wildflowers.

599
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:25,517
- I remember you walking down some road.
- I was going to find Father in Alaska.

600
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,477
In those days
I had a very faulty view of geography.

601
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:31,063
I discovered after a few days
I was heading south.

602
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:35,484
Instead of Alaska I ended up in
Africa. - Africa? - The Gold Coast!

603
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:38,279
- Principally, diamond mines.
- Diamond mines!

604
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,906
Yes, but I'm afraid
I only have a few minutes.

605
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,994
Boys, boys, listen to this!

606
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,870
This is your Uncle Ben!

607
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:49,332
A great man!
Ben, tell my boys.

608
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:52,794
Why, boys, when I was 17
I walked into the jungle.

609
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,379
When I was 21, I walked out.

610
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,217
- And by God, I was rich!
- See what I've been talking about?

611
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:02,971
- The greatest things can happen.
- I have an appointment in Ketchikan.

612
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:05,222
Tell about Dad.
I want my boys to hear.

613
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:07,850
I want them to know
the stock they spring from.

614
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:12,438
All I remember is a man with a big beard.
I was sitting on Mama's lap around the fire.

615
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:16,442
- There was some kind of high
music. - He played the flute.

616
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:21,239
- The flute, that's right. - Father was
a very great, very wild-hearted man.

617
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:24,534
He'd start in Boston
and toss the whole family in the wagon,

618
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,286
and he'd drive the team
right across the country.

619
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:31,082
Through lowa, Michigan, Illinois
and all the western states.

620
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,711
We'd stop in the towns and
he'd sell the flutes he made on the way.

621
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,420
A great inventor, Father.

622
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:40,759
With one gadget he made more in one week
than a man like you makes in a lifetime.

623
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:44,888
That's the way I'm bringing them up,
rugged, well-liked, all around.

624
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,306
- Yeah? Hit me, boy, hard as you can.
- No.

625
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:49,058
Oh, come on, get to me.

626
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,893
Go ahead, show him.

627
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,814
Like I taught you.
Give him the old shoulderjab.

628
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:59,069
Hey!

629
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:08,035
- How's that?
- Very good, Willy, very good.

630
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:11,873
- Shake hands, boys. Attaway.
- Look out, Biff.

631
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:14,375
Never fight fair with a stranger, boy.

632
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,254
You'll never get
out of the jungle that way.

633
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,590
It was an honour and a pleasure
to meet you, Linda.

634
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,260
Have a nice trip.

635
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:27,556
Oh, and good luck with your, uh...
What do you do?

636
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:30,349
- Oh, uh, selling.
- Oh, yes, really?

637
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,478
I don't want you to think...
It's Brooklyn, but we hunt too.

638
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,938
- Really, now?
- There's snakes and rabbits

639
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:39,150
That's why I moved out.
Biff can fell any one of these trees.

640
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:42,546
Go over to where they're building
the apartment and get some sand.

641
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,314
We're gonna rebuild the front stoop.
Watch us.

642
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,151
I lost weight, Pop, you notice?

643
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:50,736
They steal more
they'll put the cops on them.

644
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:54,032
- Don't let Biff take any more.
- The load they brought last week,

645
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,160
at least a dozen six by tens,
won'th all kinds of money.

646
00:36:57,244 --> 00:37:00,247
If that watchman sees them...

647
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,333
I got a couple of fearless characters.

648
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,252
Willy, the gaols are full
of fearless characters.

649
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:09,423
- And the Stock Exchange.
- Uncle Willy!

650
00:37:09,506 --> 00:37:12,258
Uncle Willy,
the watchmars chasing Biff!

651
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,844
Shut up.
He's not stealing anything.

652
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:16,721
Where is he?

653
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:19,683
Oh, there's nothing wrong.
What is the matter with you?

654
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,000
Nervy boy, good.

655
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,711
Nerves of iron, that Biff.

656
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:26,046
I don't know what it is.

657
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,799
My New England man comes back
and he's bleeding.

658
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,387
- Couldrt sell a nickel for five cents.
- It's contacts, Charley.

659
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,306
- I got important contacts.
- Glad to hear it, Willy.

660
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,142
Come in later,
we'll shoot a little casino.

661
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:40,995
I'll take some of your Portland money.

662
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:50,738
All business is bad, it's murderous.

663
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:54,366
But not for me, of course.

664
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:58,804
- I'll stop by on my way
back to Africa. - Ben, wait.

665
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:02,851
Can't you stay a few days, huh?

666
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:05,460
You're just what I need, Ben.

667
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,088
You know, I have a fine position here,

668
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,843
but Dad left when I was such a baby,
I never had a chance to talk to him.

669
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,803
I still feel
kind of temporary about myself.

670
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:19,350
- I'll be late for my train.
- Ben, my boys. Can't we talk?

671
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,937
See, they'd go
into the jaws of hell for me, but I...

672
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:27,442
You're being first-rate with your boys.
Outstanding, manly chaps.

673
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:30,445
Ben, that's good to hear
because sometimes I'm afraid

674
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:32,946
I'm not teaching them
the right kind of...

675
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,364
How should I teach them?

676
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:38,328
William, when I walked
into the jungle, I was 17.

677
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,497
When I walked out I was 21.

678
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,584
And by God, I was rich!

679
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,312
Was rich!

680
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:56,679
That's just the spirit
I want to imbue them with,

681
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:59,431
to walk into a jungle...
Oh, boy.

682
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:03,519
I was right. I was right. I was right!

683
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:06,872
- I was right!
- Willy?

684
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:11,326
Willy, dear, did you get some cheese?

685
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,132
It's awful late, darling.
Come to bed.

686
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:22,288
You gotta break your neck
to see a star in this yard.

687
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:25,474
Are you coming up, Willy?

688
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,670
Whatever happened
to that diamond watch fob?

689
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:31,088
When Ben came from Africa that time,

690
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:33,715
didn't he give me a watch fob
with a diamond in it?

691
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:38,554
You pawned it, dear, 12, 13 years ago
for Biff's radio correspondence course.

692
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:41,390
That was a beautiful thing.
I'll take a walk.

693
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,684
But in your slippers, Willy?

694
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:48,523
What a man, huh?
Now, there was a man won'th talking to.

695
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,525
- But in your slippers!
- I was right.

696
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:53,735
I was, I was right!

697
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:56,739
- I was right.
- What is he doing out here?

698
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,990
- Shh!
- God Almighty, Mom.

699
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:02,036
- How long's he been doing this?
- Don't. He'll hear you.

700
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,788
What the hell is the matter with him?

701
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:08,759
- It'll pass by morning.
- Shouldn't we do anything?

702
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,171
Oh, my dear,
you should do a lot of things.

703
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,881
There's nothing to do.
Go to bed.

704
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:18,136
- I never heard him so loud, Mom.
- You'll hear him.

705
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:21,054
- Why didn't you write me about this?
- How would I?

706
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:23,515
For over three months
you've had no address.

707
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,702
I was on the move.
I thought of you all the time.

708
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:29,729
But he likes to have a letter

709
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,109
just to know there's still
the possibility of better things.

710
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:36,571
- He's not like this all the time.
- When you come home he's the worst.

711
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:38,405
When you write you're coming,

712
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:41,701
he's all smiles, he talks about
the future, he's wonderful.

713
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:45,538
The closer you come the more shaky
he gets and by the time you get here,

714
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:47,789
he's arguing,
he seems to be angry at you.

715
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,627
I think it's just because he can't
bring himself to open up to you.

716
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:54,797
- Why are you so hateful to each other?
- I'm not hateful.

717
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:58,301
Oh! You no sooner walk through
that door than you're fighting.

718
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:01,262
I don't know why.
I mean to change, Mom. I'm trying.

719
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,930
- Are you home to stay now?
- I don't know.

720
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:07,226
- I'll look around.
- You can't look around all your life.

721
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,605
I just can't take hold.
I can't take hold to some kind of life.

722
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:14,609
Biff, a man is not a bird
to come and go with the springtime.

723
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:18,086
Your hair.

724
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,822
Your hair's getting so gray.

725
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:23,283
It's been gray
since you were in high school.

726
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:26,829
- I just stopped dying it.
- Well, dye it again, Mom.

727
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:30,498
I don't want my pal looking old.

728
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,210
You are such a boy!

729
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:37,465
You think you can go away for a year?
You've got to get it into your head now.

730
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:41,344
One day you'll knock on this door,
there will be strange people here.

731
00:41:41,427 --> 00:41:44,263
What are you talking about?
You're not even 60 yet.

732
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:45,972
What about your father?

733
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,683
- Well, I meant him, too.
- He admires Pop.

734
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:52,104
If you don't have feeling for him,
you can't have feelings for me.

735
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,897
- Sure, I can.
- No, Biff.

736
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:56,775
You can'tjust come to see me!

737
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:59,694
Because I love him.

738
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:02,030
He's the dearest man in the world to me

739
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:06,994
and I won't have anyone making him feel
unwanted and low and blue.

740
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:10,873
You have got to make up your mind now.
There's no leeway anymore.

741
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,583
Either he's your father,

742
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:15,961
and you pay him that respect,

743
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:17,796
or else you're not to come here.

744
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,925
- Hey, Biffo!
- What the hell is the matter with him?

745
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,718
- Don't go near him.
- Stop making excuses for him.

746
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,348
He always wiped the floor with you.
He never had an ounce of respect.

747
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:30,350
- He always had respect for her.
- What do you know?

748
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:32,852
- Don't call him crazy.
- He's got no character.

749
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:35,105
Charley wouldn't do this,
not in his house.

750
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:38,025
- Peeling that vomit from his mind.
- Charley never had what he's got.

751
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:41,070
People are worse off than Willy Loman,
I've seen them.

752
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:44,448
Then make Charley your father.
You can't do that, can you?

753
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:47,242
I am not saying he's a great man.

754
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,788
Willy Loman never earned a lot of money.
His name was never in the paper.

755
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,706
He's not the finest character.

756
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:54,958
But he's a human being.

757
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:59,304
And a terrible thing is happening
to him. So attention must be paid.

758
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:04,218
He must not be allowed
to fall into his grave like an old dog.

759
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:08,889
Attention! Attention must
finally be paid to such a person.

760
00:43:09,014 --> 00:43:11,766
- You called him crazy?
- Mom, I didn't...

761
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:14,937
Wait a minute. A lot of people think
he's lost his balance,

762
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:18,274
but you don't have to be very smart
to know what his trouble is.

763
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:20,358
- The man is exhausted.
- Sure.

764
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,027
A small man can be
just as exhausted as a great man.

765
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:27,783
He works for a company
36 years this March,

766
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:31,203
he opens up uneard of territories
to their trademark,

767
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,663
and now, in his old age,

768
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:35,999
they take his salary away!

769
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,253
- I didn't know that, Mom.
- You never asked, my dear!

770
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:41,880
Now you get your spending money
somewhere else

771
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:44,842
- you don't trouble your mind with him.
- I gave you money.

772
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,093
Christmastime, 50 dollars.

773
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:50,389
To fix the hot water it cost $97.50!

774
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:53,601
For five weeks
he's been on straight commission,

775
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,852
like a beginner, an unknown.

776
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:57,896
Those ungrateful bastards!

777
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:00,190
Are they any worse than his sons?

778
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:03,944
He drives 700 miles,

779
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:07,990
and when he gets there no one
knows him anymore, no one welcomes him.

780
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:11,702
And what goes through a mars mind

781
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:14,705
driving 700 miles home

782
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:18,375
without having earned a cent?
Why shouldn't he talk to himself?

783
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:22,588
Why not, when
he has to go to Charley every week

784
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:26,300
and borrow 50 dollars from him,
and pretend to me it's his pay.

785
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:29,594
How long can that go on?
How long?

786
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:33,933
And you tell me he has no character?

787
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:38,187
The man who never worked a day
in his life but for your benefit!

788
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,730
And when does he get the medal for that?

789
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,859
Is this his reward?

790
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:48,364
To turn around at the age of 63
and find his sons,

791
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:51,450
who he loved better than his life,

792
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:54,578
- one a philandering bum...
- Mom!

793
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:57,247
That is all you are, my baby.

794
00:44:57,248 --> 00:45:00,834
And you! What happened
to the love you had for him?

795
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,502
You were such pals.

796
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:05,213
How you used to talk every night
on the phone,

797
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:08,092
how lonely he was
till he could come home to you.

798
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,051
All right, Mom.

799
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:13,514
I'll live in my room, I'll get a job,
I'll just keep away from him.

800
00:45:13,597 --> 00:45:17,226
No, Biff, you can't stay here
and fight all the time.

801
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,310
He threw me out of this house.

802
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:20,979
Why did he do that?

803
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,983
- Because I know he's a fake.
- A fake!

804
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,486
- In what way? What do you mean?
- Just don't lay it all at my feet.

805
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:30,113
It's between me and him.
That's all I have to say.

806
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,575
I'll chip in from now on.
He'll settle for half my paycheque.

807
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:36,327
- He'll be all right.
- He won't be all right!

808
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:39,347
I hate this city and I'll stay here.

809
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:41,216
Now, what do you want?

810
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,662
- He's dying, Biff.
- Why is he dying?

811
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:47,306
He's been trying to kill himself.

812
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,975
How?

813
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:56,716
Do you remember I wrote you that
he smashed the car again in February?

814
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,050
Well?

815
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,453
The insurance inspector came.

816
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:06,458
There's evidence that all the accidents
in the last year werert accidents.

817
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,417
How can they tell?
That's a lie.

818
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:11,255
- It seems there's a woman...
- What woman?

819
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,231
What?

820
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:15,133
- Nothing.
- What did you say?

821
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:17,986
- I said, "What woman?"
- What about her?

822
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,651
She was walking down the road.

823
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:27,613
She saw his car.
She said he wasrt driving fast at all.

824
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:29,405
He didn't skid, she said.

825
00:46:29,406 --> 00:46:33,369
He came to that little bridge and
deliberately smashed into the railing.

826
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:36,204
It was the shallowness of the water
that saved him.

827
00:46:36,205 --> 00:46:39,266
Mom, he probably just fell asleep again.

828
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:44,505
- No. I don't think he fell asleep.
- Why not?

829
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:49,150
Last month...

830
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:53,780
Oh, boys, it's so hard
to say a thing like this.

831
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:59,520
I was looking for a fuse, the lights
blew out, I went down in the cellar.

832
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:02,355
Behind the fuse box,
it happened to fall out,

833
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:06,276
was this length of rubber pipe,
just short.

834
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,902
No kidding.

835
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:10,238
There was an attachment
on the end of it.

836
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,633
I knew right away, and sure enough.

837
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,704
On the bottom of the hot water heater
there's a new nipple on the gas pipe.

838
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:21,182
- Thatjerk.
- Did you have it taken off?

839
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:24,644
I'm ashamed to.

840
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:27,731
How can I mention it to him?

841
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,716
Every day I go down

842
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,971
and I take away
that little rubber pipe.

843
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:37,808
But when he comes home
I put it back where it was.

844
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,328
How can I insult him that way?

845
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:47,067
It sounds so silly and old-fashioned,
but I tell you,

846
00:47:47,151 --> 00:47:50,045
he's put his whole life into you.

847
00:47:50,988 --> 00:47:53,548
And you've turned your backs on him.

848
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:58,662
Biff, his life is in your hands.

849
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:03,141
I feel like a damn fool.

850
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,626
All right.

851
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:08,271
All right.

852
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:13,927
It's settled now.
I've been remiss, I know that.

853
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:18,223
But now I'll stay and I swear to you,
Mama, I'll apply myself.

854
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:21,727
It's just that, see,
I don't fit in business.

855
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,730
Not that I won't try.
I'll try and I'll make good.

856
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:27,774
The trouble was,
you never tried to please people.

857
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:30,318
It's like when you worked
for Bob Harrison.

858
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,028
He said you were tops.

859
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:36,200
Then you go and do some damn fool thing
like whistling songs in the elevator.

860
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:38,075
So what? I like to whistle.

861
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:40,996
You don't raise a guy
to a responsible job who whistles.

862
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,622
Don't argue about it.

863
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,916
You'd go for a swim
in the middle of the day.

864
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:47,920
You don't take off?
You run off sometimes, on a nice day.

865
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:50,338
- Sure, but I cover myself.
- Oh, boys.

866
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:51,756
I'll tell you something.

867
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:54,635
In the business world
some of them think you're crazy.

868
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:58,805
- Screw the business world.
- Right. Great. But cover yourself.

869
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,515
I don't care!
They've laughed at Dad for years.

870
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:04,895
You know why? Because we don't belong
in this nuthouse of a city.

871
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:09,066
We should be mixing cement somewhere
on some open plain, or carpenters.

872
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:11,192
A carpenter's allowed to whistle.

873
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:14,321
Even your grandfather was better
than a carpenter.

874
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:17,090
You never grew up.

875
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:20,911
Bernard does not whistle
in the elevator, I assure you.

876
00:49:23,038 --> 00:49:26,667
- I bet you do.
- I never whistled in an elevator.

877
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:31,546
And who in the business world
thinks I'm crazy, hmm?

878
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:34,675
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't make a thing out of it.

879
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:38,136
Go back to the West.
Be a carpenter or a cowboy.

880
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,846
- Enjoy yourself.
- He was just saying things.

881
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:42,640
- I heard what he said.
- Come on.

882
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,266
They laugh at me, huh?

883
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,352
Go to Filene's, go to the Hub,

884
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,481
go to Slattery's, Boston
and call out the name Willy Loman.

885
00:49:49,564 --> 00:49:52,526
- See what happens. Big shot. Big.
- All right, Pop.

886
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:54,794
All right.

887
00:50:01,743 --> 00:50:03,994
Why do you always insult me?

888
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:05,955
Dad, I didn't say a word.

889
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:08,917
- Did I say a word?
- He didn't say anything, Willy.

890
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,584
No.

891
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:13,422
- All right, good night.
- Willy! He's decided...

892
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:17,384
If you get tired hanging around
tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up.

893
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,218
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

894
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,971
He's gonna see Bill Oliver, Pop.

895
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:24,240
Oliver?

896
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:27,476
For what?

897
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:31,231
Well, he always said he'd stake me
and I'd like to go into business,

898
00:50:31,314 --> 00:50:33,149
so maybe I'll take him up on it.

899
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,069
- Isn't that wonderful?
- What's wonderful about it?

900
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:39,573
There's 50 men in the city of New York
that would stake him.

901
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:42,826
- Sporting goods?
- I guess so.

902
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,121
- I know something about it.
- He knows something about it!

903
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:50,792
You know sporting goods
better than Spalding, for God's sake.

904
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:54,337
- How much is he giving you?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.

905
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:58,717
- Then what are you talking about?
- All I said was I was gonna go see him.

906
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,510
- You're counting your chickens again.
- Jesus.

907
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,681
- Don't curse in this house.
- Since when did you get so clean?

908
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:08,143
Don't use that language to me.
I won't have it!

909
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:12,930
I got an idea, a feasible idea. Let's
talk this over. Let's talk sense.

910
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:17,827
When I was in Florida last time I thought
of a great idea to sell sporting goods.

911
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:21,455
It just came back to me.
We have a line, the Loman line.

912
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:25,409
- We put on a couple of exhibitions.
- That's an idea. - Wait!

913
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,287
We form two basketball teams,
two water polo teams.

914
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:31,249
We play each other.
It's a million dollars of publicity.

915
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,959
Two brothers, see?
The Loman brothers.

916
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,839
- We could sell sporting goods.
- That is a one million dollar idea.

917
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:39,673
Marvellous.

918
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:42,134
I'm in great shape
as far as that's concerned.

919
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:45,722
It wouldn't be like a business at all.
We'd be out playing ball again.

920
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:49,392
- That's what I was talking about.
- You won't get fed up. It'd be family.

921
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:53,939
Lick the world. You guys together could
absolutely lick the civilised world.

922
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,649
I'll see Oliver.
If we could work that out...

923
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,945
- I think everything is...
- Stop interrupting!

924
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,363
Don't wear a sports jacket and slacks.

925
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:05,450
A business suit
and talk as little as possible.

926
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:08,285
- And don't crack any jokes.
- Hey, he did like me.

927
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:10,621
- He always liked me.
- Oh, he loved you.

928
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:12,581
Will you stop!

929
00:52:12,582 --> 00:52:15,669
Walk in very serious.
You're not applying for a boy's job.

930
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:18,797
Money is to pass.
Be quiet, fine and serious.

931
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,757
Everybody likes a kidder
but nobody lends them money.

932
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:24,803
- I'll try to get some myself.
- I see great things for you.

933
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:28,515
I think your troubles are over.
Start big, you'll end big. Ask for 15.

934
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:30,307
How much you gonna ask for?

935
00:52:30,308 --> 00:52:33,185
- Gee, I don't...
- Don't say gee. Gee is a boy's word.

936
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:36,147
A man walking in for $15,000
does not say "gee".

937
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:38,357
- Ten would be top.
- Don't be so modest.

938
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:41,236
You always start it too low.
Walk in with a big laugh.

939
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:44,698
Start off with a couple of your
good stories to lighten things up.

940
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,533
It's not what you say
but how you say it,

941
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:50,077
because personality always wins the day.

942
00:52:50,078 --> 00:52:53,039
- Oliver always thought...
- Will you let me talk!

943
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:54,999
Dad, stop yelling at her.

944
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,459
I was talking, wasrt I?

945
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,087
I just don't like you
yelling at her all the time.

946
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:02,673
- I'm telling you.
- You taking over this house?

947
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:05,969
- Willy, he didn't mean...
- Don't take his side all the time!

948
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,821
Stop yelling at her.

949
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:36,332
Give my best to Bill Oliver.

950
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:45,307
- He may remember me.
- Why did you have to start that?

951
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:49,304
Did you see how sweet he was
as soon as you talked hopefully?

952
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:54,275
Go up.
Say good night to him.

953
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,820
- Don't let him go to bed that way.
- Biff, let's buck him up.

954
00:53:58,021 --> 00:54:02,666
Please, dear.
It takes so little to make him happy.

955
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:06,061
Come.

956
00:54:07,864 --> 00:54:10,825
Your pyjamas are hanging
in the bathroom, Willy.

957
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:12,326
What a woman.

958
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:15,788
They broke the mould when they made her.
You know that, Biff?

959
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:18,640
He's off salary.

960
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,934
My god, working on commission.

961
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:23,478
Let's face it.
He's no hotshot selling man.

962
00:54:23,479 --> 00:54:26,356
Sometimes you gotta admit
he's a sweet personality.

963
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:29,109
Lend me ten bucks.
I'm gonna buy some new ties.

964
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,488
I'll take you to a place I know.
Wear one of my striped shirts.

965
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:35,742
Mom got so gray.
She got awful old.

966
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm gonna go in and see Oliver tomorrow
and I'm gonna knock him...

967
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:43,832
Come on up and tell Dad.
Let's give him a whirl.

968
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,543
With ten thousand bucks... boy.

969
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:49,338
That's the first time
I've heard the old confidence.

970
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:53,593
You're gonna live with me, kid,
and I'm telling you, any babe you want.

971
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:55,802
You say the word.

972
00:54:55,803 --> 00:54:58,639
Can you do something about the shower?
It drips.

973
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:02,935
Oh, all of a sudden
everything falls to pieces.

974
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,439
That damn plumbing.
They ought to be sued, those people.

975
00:55:06,522 --> 00:55:10,318
- Hardly finished putting it in...
- I'm wondering if Oliver will remember.

976
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:14,830
- You think he might? -Remember him?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

977
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:17,866
If he'd have stayed with Oliver,
he'd be on top now.

978
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:23,339
Wait till Oliver gets a look at him. You
don't know the average calibre anymore.

979
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:27,418
The average young man today
has got a calibre of zero.

980
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,836
The greatest thing for him
was to bum up...

981
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,855
Willy.

982
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:42,141
- Glad to hear it, boy.
- He wanted to say good night to you.

983
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:45,327
Oh, yeah, you knock them dead, boy.

984
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:50,124
What do you want to tell me?

985
00:55:55,988 --> 00:55:58,323
Take it easy, Pop, good night.

986
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:01,536
If anything falls off the desk
while you're talking to him,

987
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,454
like a package or something,
don't you pick it up.

988
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:07,875
- They have office boys.
- I'll make a big breakfast.

989
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:13,506
Will you let me finish, hmm?

990
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:17,468
Tell him you were in business
in the West, not farm work.

991
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:20,721
- All right, Dad. I will.
- I think everything's gonna be...

992
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,478
And don't undersell yourself.
No less than $15,000.

993
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:31,023
- OK. Good night, Mom.
- Because you got a greatness in you.

994
00:56:31,107 --> 00:56:33,250
Biff!

995
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:39,047
Remember that.

996
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:43,126
- You got all kinds of greatness.
- Sleep well, darling.

997
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:47,414
- I'm gonna get married, Mom. I wanted
to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear.

998
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:50,293
I just wanted to tell you.

999
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:53,019
Keep up the good work.

1000
00:57:08,644 --> 00:57:13,232
Do you remember that Ebbets Field
game, the championship of the city?

1001
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:14,858
Hmm?

1002
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:17,419
Just rest, dear.

1003
00:57:18,362 --> 00:57:20,780
- Should I sing to you?
- Yeah, you sing to me.

1004
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:25,244
You know, when that team came out,
he was the tallest.

1005
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:26,953
You remember?

1006
00:57:26,954 --> 00:57:30,541
- All in gold.
- Oh, like a young god.

1007
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:37,598
Hercules, something like that. And
the sun, the sun all around him.

1008
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,735
Remember how he waved to me?

1009
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:47,333
Right from the field, with the representatives
from three colleges standing by,

1010
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:50,936
and the buyers I brought.

1011
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,563
Oh, the cheers when he came out.

1012
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:56,750
Loman! Loman!

1013
00:57:57,777 --> 00:58:00,863
Loman!

1014
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:10,180
God Almighty, he'll be great yet.

1015
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:16,921
A star like that, magnificent,

1016
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:20,107
can never really fade away.

1017
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:28,323
- Oh, boy.
- Willy?

1018
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:31,243
Dear?

1019
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:35,914
What has he got against you?

1020
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:41,712
I'm so tired. Don't talk anymore.

1021
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:46,700
Will you ask Howard
if he'll let you work in New York?

1022
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,079
First thing in the morning.
Everything will be all right.

1023
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:55,100
Gee.

1024
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:59,212
Look at the moon
moving between the buildings.

1025
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:11,493
Oh, oh, wonderful coffee!

1026
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:14,037
- A meal in itself.
- Can I make you some eggs?

1027
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:17,957
- Take a breath.
- You look so rested, dear.

1028
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,720
I slept like a dead one.
First time in months.

1029
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:23,630
Imagine sleeping till 10
on a Tuesday morning.

1030
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:27,976
- Boys left nice and early? - They
were out of here by 8:00. - Good work.

1031
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:30,595
It was thrilling, them leaving together.

1032
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:33,883
I cannot get over the smell
of shaving lotion in this house.

1033
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:37,834
Biff was very changed this morning.
His attitude seemed to be hopeful.

1034
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,589
- He couldn't wait to see Oliver.
- He's heading for a change.

1035
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,985
- Certain men take longer to get...
- Solidified.

1036
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:47,671
- How did he dress?
- His blue suit.

1037
01:00:48,414 --> 01:00:51,500
He looked so handsome.
He could be anything in that suit.

1038
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:54,252
Boy, there's no question.
No question at all.

1039
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:58,215
Gee, on the way home tonight
I'd like to buy some seeds.

1040
01:00:58,299 --> 01:01:01,927
Wonderful, but not enough sun
gets back there. Nothing will grow.

1041
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,846
Before it's over
we'll get a place in the country,

1042
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,724
- I'll raise vegetables, chickens.
- You'll do it.

1043
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:10,769
They'll get married and visit.
I'll build a guest house.

1044
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:14,732
I've got so many tools. All I'd need
would be lumber and peace of mind.

1045
01:01:14,815 --> 01:01:17,400
- I sewed the liner.
- I could build two houses

1046
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,486
- so they'd both come.
- Yes.

1047
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,491
- He decide how much he's gonna ask for?
- He didn't, but I imagine ten.

1048
01:01:23,574 --> 01:01:27,703
Fifteen thousand.
You're gonna talk to Howard today?

1049
01:01:27,786 --> 01:01:32,082
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll put it to him straight and simple.

1050
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:35,044
- He'll have to take me off the road.
- Ask for a little advance.

1051
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:38,255
We've got the insurance premium.
It's the grace period.

1052
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,717
It's $108.68 because
we're a little short this month.

1053
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,552
- Why are we short?
- You had the job done on the car.

1054
01:01:44,553 --> 01:01:47,514
- That damn Studebaker.
- One more payment on the refrigerator.

1055
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:50,016
- Itjust broke again.
- It's old, dear.

1056
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:52,727
We should have bought
a well advertised machine.

1057
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:56,106
Charley bought a General Electric.
It's 20 years old and it's good.

1058
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:00,485
- Willy, please! - Whoever heard
of a Hastings refrigerator?

1059
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:04,782
Once in my life I'd like to buy
something outright before it's broken.

1060
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:08,702
I am always in a race with the junkyard.
I just finished paying for the car.

1061
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:11,747
It's on its last legs.
The refrigerator consumes belts.

1062
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,706
- Willy.
- They time those things!

1063
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:17,419
They time them so when you finally
pay for them they're used up.

1064
01:02:17,503 --> 01:02:20,422
All told, about 200 dollars
would carry us dear,

1065
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:24,510
but that includes the last payment
on the mortgage.

1066
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:28,639
When we've made that payment, Willy,
the house belongs to us.

1067
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:32,392
- That's 25 years.
- Biff was nine when we bought it.

1068
01:02:32,393 --> 01:02:37,481
Well, that's a great thing,
to weather a 25 year mortgage.

1069
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:40,425
It's an accomplishment.

1070
01:02:41,276 --> 01:02:45,847
All the cement, the lumber. The
reconstruction I put in this house.

1071
01:02:45,948 --> 01:02:49,326
There ain't a crack
to be found in it anymore.

1072
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,078
- Well, it served its purpose.
- What purpose?

1073
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,207
Some stranger will come along,
move in, and that's that.

1074
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:59,837
If only Biff would take this house
and raise a family.

1075
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:05,967
- Good-bye. I'm late.
- I forgot to tell you.

1076
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:10,305
You're supposed to meet them for dinner.
Frank's Chop House, near Sixth Avenue.

1077
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:12,348
Is that so? How about you?

1078
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:15,394
Just the three of you.
They are gonna blow you to a big meal.

1079
01:03:15,477 --> 01:03:18,271
- Who thought of that?
- Biff came to me this morning.

1080
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:22,517
He said, "Tell Dad we're gonna blow
him to a big meal. Be there 6:00".

1081
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:25,061
You and your two boys
are gonna have dinner.

1082
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:27,897
- Gee whiz, that's really something.
- Yeah.

1083
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:30,400
I'm gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid.

1084
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:33,946
I'll get an advance
and I'll come home with a New York job!

1085
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:36,865
- I'm gonna do it!
- That's the spirit, Willy!

1086
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,743
I will never get behind the wheel
the rest of my life!

1087
01:03:39,827 --> 01:03:42,537
It's changing, Willy.
I can feel it changing.

1088
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:45,057
- Beyond a question.
- Oh!

1089
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,417
- You got your glasses?
- Yeah.

1090
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:50,546
And your handkerchief?
And your saccharine?

1091
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:53,632
- And my saccharine.
- Be careful on the subway stairs.

1092
01:03:53,757 --> 01:03:58,137
Will you stop mending stockings?
It gets me nervous. I can't tell you.

1093
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,680
And don't forget,
Frank's Chop House.

1094
01:04:00,881 --> 01:04:05,427
- Maybe beets would grow out there.
- Oh, Willy, you tried so many times.

1095
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:08,722
- Yeah, well, don't work hard.
- Now, you be careful.

1096
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:11,449
Come on, give me a little something.

1097
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,871
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1098
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:33,363
- Psst.
- Hello, Willy.

1099
01:04:33,564 --> 01:04:37,526
- I'd like to talk to you, Howard.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

1100
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:40,445
- What's that?
- Didrt you ever see one of these?

1101
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:43,072
- It's a wire recorder.
- Can we talk a minute?

1102
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:45,908
It records things.
I just got delivery yesterday.

1103
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:48,494
It's the most terrific machine
I ever saw in my life.

1104
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:50,621
- I was up all night with it.
- What do you do?

1105
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:53,458
I bought it for dictation
but you can do anything with it.

1106
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:56,462
Listen to this. I had it home.
Listen to what I picked up.

1107
01:04:56,587 --> 01:04:59,606
The first one is my daughter.
Get this.

1108
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:04,277
Listen to that kid whistle.

1109
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:08,222
That is lifelike, isn't it?

1110
01:05:08,223 --> 01:05:12,728
- Seven years old. Get that tone.
- I'd like to ask a little favour.

1111
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:15,104
It's your turn now, Daddy.

1112
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:18,041
She's crazy for me.

1113
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:23,221
- That's me. - You're very
good. - Now this is my son.

1114
01:05:23,322 --> 01:05:26,366
The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.

1115
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:30,937
The capital of California is Sacramento.
- Five years old.

1116
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:33,873
He'll make an announcer someday.

1117
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:37,294
- The capital of Colorado...
- That is alphabetical order.

1118
01:05:37,377 --> 01:05:40,129
- The maid kicked the plug.
- That certainly is...

1119
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,589
Shh! For God's sake.

1120
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,593
It is 9:00 so I have to go to sleep.

1121
01:05:44,676 --> 01:05:47,178
- It really is...
- Wait. The next is my wife.

1122
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:50,224
- Talk!
- I can't think of anything.

1123
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:54,436
- It's time.
- Hello. Howard, I can't talk.

1124
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,898
- That was my wife.
- That is a wonderful machine. Can we...

1125
01:05:58,023 --> 01:06:02,945
I'm gonna take my camera and my bandsaw
and all my hobbies and out they go.

1126
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:07,198
- This is the most fascinating
relaxation ever. - I think I'll get one.

1127
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,826
They're a hundred and a half.
You can't do without it.

1128
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:14,163
Supposing you want to hear Jack Benny,
see. But you can't be home at that hour.

1129
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:17,584
You tell the maid to turn the radio on
when Jack Benny comes on,

1130
01:06:17,668 --> 01:06:20,378
and this automatically comes on
with the radio.

1131
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:23,966
- When you come home...
- You come home any time you like.

1132
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:26,969
You get yourself a Coke,
sit down, throw the switch,

1133
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:30,055
and there is Jack Benny's programme,
in the middle of the night.

1134
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:33,267
I'm gonna get one,
'cause lots of times I'm on the road,

1135
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:36,143
and I think, "What I must
be missing on the radio".

1136
01:06:36,144 --> 01:06:40,649
- Don't you have a radio in the car?
- Yeah. Whoever thinks of turning it on?

1137
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:44,194
- Arent you supposed to be in Boston?
- That's what I want to talk about.

1138
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:46,529
- You got a minute?
- What happened?

1139
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:49,365
- You didn't crack up again, did you?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:52,034
Oh!

1141
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:55,330
Geez, you got me worried there
for a minute.

1142
01:06:55,455 --> 01:06:58,458
- Well, what's the trouble?
- Well, to tell you the truth,

1143
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:02,462
I've come to the decision
that I'd rather not travel anymore.

1144
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:06,799
- Not travel? Well, what would you do?
- Remember Christmastime at the party

1145
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,552
you said you'd think
of a spot for me here in town?

1146
01:07:09,553 --> 01:07:13,706
- With us? - Sure. - Oh,
yeah, yeah, I remember.

1147
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:16,183
I couldn't think of anything for you.

1148
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:20,355
I'll tell you, Howard, the kids
are all grown up now, you know.

1149
01:07:20,439 --> 01:07:22,648
I don't need much anymore.

1150
01:07:22,649 --> 01:07:27,863
If I could take home $65 a week
I could swing it.

1151
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:30,740
- Yeah, but Willy...
- I'll tell you why.

1152
01:07:30,741 --> 01:07:34,453
Speaking frankly
between the two of us, you know,

1153
01:07:34,536 --> 01:07:37,413
I'm just a little tired.

1154
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:40,608
Oh.
I can understand that, Willy.

1155
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:43,044
But you're a road man, Willy.

1156
01:07:43,045 --> 01:07:46,298
We're a road business.
We've got half a dozen salesmen here.

1157
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:51,203
God knows, Howard,
I never asked a favour of any man,

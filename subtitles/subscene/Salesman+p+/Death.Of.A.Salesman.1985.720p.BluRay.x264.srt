1
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,772
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

2
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,142
Willy?

3
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:11,027
It's all right.
I came back.

4
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,119
Why, what happened?
Did something happen, Willy?

5
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,668
- Nothing happened.
- You didn't smash the car?

6
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,300
I said nothing happened!

7
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,891
- Didn't you hear me?
- Don't you feel well?

8
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,859
I'm tired to the death.

9
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,453
I, uh, I couldn't make it.

10
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:30,250
I just couldn't make it, Linda.

11
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,674
Where were you all day?
You look terrible.

12
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh, I got as far
as a little above Yonkers.

13
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:37,982
I stopped for a cup of coffee.

14
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,531
- Maybe it was the coffee.
- What?

15
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:42,747
I suddenly couldn't drive anymore.

16
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,002
The car kept going off
onto the shoulder.

17
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,423
Maybe it's the steering.

18
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,805
I don't think
Angelo knows the Studebaker.

19
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:52,066
No, it's me. Suddenly I realise
I'm going 60 miles an hour

20
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,782
and I don't remember
the last five minutes.

21
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:57,247
I can't seem to keep my mind to it.

22
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,342
Maybe it's your glasses.
You never went for new glasses.

23
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,140
I see everything.
I came back ten miles an hour.

24
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,648
It took me nearly four hours
from Yonkers.

25
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:09,493
You just gotta take a rest.
You can't continue like this.

26
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,999
Aw, I just got back from Florida.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,006
But you didn't rest your mind.

28
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,308
Your mind is overactive
and the mind is what counts, dear.

29
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:21,153
I'll start out in the morning.
Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.

30
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:24,035
Oh, these... these arch supports
are killing me.

31
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,665
Take an aspirin.

32
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,214
Should I get you an aspirin?
Lt'll soothe you.

33
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:31,493
I was driving along, understand?
I was fine.

34
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,483
I was even observing the scenery.

35
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:38,330
You can imagine me looking at scenery
on the road every week of my life.

36
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,627
But it's so beautiful up there, Linda.

37
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,800
The trees are thick and the sun is warm.

38
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,102
I just open the windshield
and let the warm air bathe over me.

39
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:48,709
And then all of a sudden I'm...

40
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:50,991
...l'm going off the road.

41
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,834
I'm telling you,
I absolutely forgot I was driving.

42
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:57,346
If I'd have gone the other way
over the white line

43
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,953
I might have killed somebody.

44
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,286
So, I went on again and five minutes
later I'm dreaming again and I nearly...

45
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:11,178
I have such thoughts.
I have such strange thoughts.

46
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,604
Talk to them again, Willy.

47
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:17,656
There's no reason
why you can't work in New York.

48
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,623
I'm the New England man.
I'm vital in New England.

49
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:24,510
You're 60 years old. They can't expect
you to keep driving every week.

50
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:27,644
I'll have to send a wire to Portland.

51
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:31,907
I'm supposed to see Brown and Morrison
tomorrow morning to show the line.

52
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,121
- Oh, I could sell them.
- Now, Willy.

53
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,587
Go down to that place again.
Talk to Howard.

54
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:39,972
Tell him you gotta work in New York.
You're too accommodating.

55
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,692
If old man Wagner was alive,
I'd have been in charge of New York now.

56
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,324
That man was a prince.
He was a masterful man.

57
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,916
That boy of his, Howard,
he don't appreciate.

58
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,671
When I went north the first time,

59
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:53,512
the Wagner Company didn't know
where New England was.

60
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,811
Why don't you
tell these things to Howard?

61
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:58,545
Oh, I will. I definitely will.

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,919
- Oh, is there any cheese?
- I'll make you a sandwich.

63
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,259
Go to sleep. I'll take some milk.

64
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,240
Geez.

65
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,626
Maybe he smashed up the car again.

66
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:16,290
He's gonna get his licence taken away
if he keeps that up.

67
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,838
I'm getting nervous about him, you know.

68
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,429
- His eyes are gone.
- No, I've driven with him.

69
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,397
He sees all right.
Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.

70
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,695
I drove into the city
with him last week.

71
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:29,411
He stops at a green light.
It turns red and he goes.

72
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,250
- Maybe he's colour blind.
- Pop?

73
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,925
He's got the finest eye for colour
in the business.

74
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,307
- The boys in?
- They're sleeping.

75
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:39,065
- Happy took Biff on a date tonight.
- Is that so?

76
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,908
It was so thrilling,
seeing them shaving together,

77
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,292
one behind the other in the bathroom
and going out together.

78
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,298
- Did you notice?
- Hm?

79
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:50,350
The whole house smells
of shaving lotion.

80
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,231
Figure it out.

81
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,408
Work a lifetime to pay off a house.
You finally own it.

82
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:57,496
There's nobody to live in it.

83
00:05:57,497 --> 00:06:00,004
Life's a casting off.
It's always that way.

84
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,678
No, no, some people
accomplish something.

85
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,394
Did Biff say anything
after I went this morning?

86
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:08,990
You shouldn't have criticised him,
after he just got off the train.

87
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:12,584
- You must not lose your temper at him.
- When did I lose my temper?

88
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,133
I simply asked him
if he was making any money.

89
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:18,519
- Is that criticism?
- Willy, how could he make any money?

90
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,983
There's such an undercurrent in him.

91
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:24,494
He became a moody man. Did he apologise
when I left this morning?

92
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:28,339
He was crestfallen, Willy.
Now, you know how he admires you.

93
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:32,476
I think when he finds himself you'll
both be happier and you won't fight.

94
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,192
How can he find himself on a farm?
Is that a life?

95
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,323
A farmhand in the beginning
when he was young,

96
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:41,295
I thought, a young man, it's good
for him to travel, take differentjobs.

97
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,680
It's more than ten years and
he has yet to make 35 dollars a week.

98
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,810
He is finding himself, Willy.

99
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:49,610
Not finding yourself at the age of 34
is a disgrace.

100
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:52,118
- Shh!
- The trouble is, he's lazy!

101
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,587
- Willy, please, they are sleeping.
- Biff is a lazy...

102
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,551
...bum!
- Go down!

103
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,267
Get yourself something to eat
and be quiet.

104
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,105
Why did he come home?

105
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,446
I would like to know
what brought him home.

106
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,623
Well, I don't know.
I think he's still lost, Willy.

107
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,545
I think he's very lost.

108
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,596
Biff Loman is lost
in the greatest country in the world.

109
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,856
A young man with such
personal attractiveness gets lost?

110
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,158
And such a hard worker.

111
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,790
There's one thing about Biff.
He's not lazy.

112
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,106
Never.

113
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:28,561
I'll see him in the morning, have
a talk with him, get him a job selling.

114
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,357
He'd be big in no time.

115
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:33,827
Remember the way they used to
follow him around in high school?

116
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,131
Oh, when he just smiled at them
their faces lit up.

117
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:42,645
When he walked down the
street with a crowd of kids behind him.

118
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,985
Will you ever forget that?

119
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,367
- You smoking?
- You want one?

120
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,227
I can never sleep when I smell it.

121
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,806
It's funny, Biff, you know... us.

122
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,526
Sleeping in here again, huh?
The old beds.

123
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,493
All the talk that went across
those two beds, huh?

124
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,725
- Our whole lives.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,797
A lotta dreams and plans.

126
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:09,268
About 500 women would like to know
what was said in this room.

127
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,405
- Remember that big Betsy something?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:16,414
What the hell was her name?
Over on Bushwick Avenue.

129
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,379
- With the collie dog.
- Yeah, that's the one.

130
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,434
- I got you in there, man.
- That was my first time, I think.

131
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:26,444
Boy, there was a pig.

132
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:30,038
You taught me everything I know
about women. Don't forget that.

133
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:33,757
I bet you forgot how bashful
you used to be, especially with girls.

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,891
Oh, I still am, Biff.
I just control it, that's all.

135
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,025
I think I got less bashful.

136
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,073
You got more so.

137
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:45,709
What happened, Biff?
Where's your old humour?

138
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:49,554
The old confidence?
What's the matter?

139
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:54,360
- Why does Dad mock me all the time?
- He's not mocking you, Biff.

140
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:58,080
Everything I say there's mockery
on his face. I can't get near him.

141
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,586
I think the fact
that you're not settled,

142
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,424
that you're still up in the air.

143
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,974
I think there's other things
depressing him.

144
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,774
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Don't lay it all to me.

145
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,115
But I think if you just got started...

146
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,083
I mean, is there any future
for you out there?

147
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:17,137
I don't know what the future is.
I don't know what I'm supposed to want.

148
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,724
What do you mean?

149
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:23,781
I spent six or seven years after
high school trying to work myself up.

150
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:27,207
Shipping clerk, salesman,
business of one kind or another.

151
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,505
It's a measly manner of existence.

152
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:33,018
To get on that subway
in the hot mornings in the summer,

153
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:37,365
to devote your whole life
to keeping stock or making phone calls.

154
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,788
And the selling, the buying.

155
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:44,177
To suffer 50 weeks of the year
for the sake of a two week vacation,

156
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,401
when all you really desire
is to be outdoors with your shirt off.

157
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,785
And always to have to get ahead
of the next fellow.

158
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,000
Still, that's how you build a future.

159
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,971
I bought a new kind
of American type cheese. It's whipped.

160
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,976
Why do you get American?
I like Swiss.

161
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,070
- I thought you'd like a change.
- I don't want a change.

162
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:07,747
- Why am I always being contradicted?
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

163
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:11,383
- Why don't you open a window in here?
- They're all open.

164
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,977
They boxed us in here.
Bricks and windows, windows and bricks.

165
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:17,484
We should have bought
the land next door.

166
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,535
There's not a breath of fresh air
in the neighbourhood.

167
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,460
The grass don't grow anymore.
You can't raise a carrot.

168
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:26,386
They should have had a law
against apartment houses.

169
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:31,567
Remember those two beautiful elm trees?

170
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:35,705
When I and Biff
hung the swing between them, huh?

171
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,128
Like being a million miles
from the city.

172
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:41,598
They should have arrested the builder
for cutting those down.

173
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,373
They massacred the neighbourhood.

174
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:51,420
More and more I think of those days,
Linda, this time of year.

175
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:54,210
It was lilacs and wisteria

176
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:57,378
and then the peonies
would come out... daffodils.

177
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,210
What fragrance in this room.

178
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,378
- People had to move somewhere.
- There's more people now.

179
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:06,044
- I don't think...
- There's more people!

180
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:10,211
That's what's ruining this country!
Population is getting out of control!

181
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,044
The competition is maddening!

182
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:17,670
Smell the stink from that apartment
house and another on the other side!

183
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,643
How can they whip cheese?

184
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,879
Go down, try it and be quiet.

185
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,421
You're not worried about me,
are you, sweetheart, huh?

186
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:41,671
No, you've got too much on the ball
to be worried about, my darling.

187
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:46,545
You're my foundation
and my support, Linda.

188
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,628
Oh, just try to relax.
You make mountains out of molehills.

189
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,503
I won't fight with him anymore.

190
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,585
If he wants to go to Texas, let him go.

191
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,212
- He'll find his way.
- Sure.

192
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,170
Certain men just don't get started
till later in life.

193
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:02,296
Like Thomas Edison, I think,

194
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,061
or B.F. Goodrich.

195
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:08,812
One of them was deaf.

196
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,503
I'll put my money on Biff.

197
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:15,379
And Willy, if it's warm Sunday
we'll drive in the country.

198
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:18,045
We'll open the windshield,
we'll take lunch.

199
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,712
The windshields don't open
on the new cars.

200
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:24,045
- But you opened it today.
- Me?

201
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,936
I didn't.

202
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,854
Now, isn't that peculiar?

203
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,795
- Isn't that remarkable?
- What, dear?

204
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:42,421
That is the most remarkable thing.

205
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:45,645
What, darling?

206
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,769
I was thinking of the Chevy.

207
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:55,212
1928, when I had that red Chevy.

208
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,894
Isn't that funny?

209
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,337
I could have sworn
I was back in that Chevy today.

210
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:09,045
That's nothing.
Something must have reminded you.

211
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,270
Remarkable.

212
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,520
Remember those days, huh?

213
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,671
The way Biff used to simonise that car?

214
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:23,255
Dealer refused to believe
there was 80,000 miles on it.

215
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:28,131
Close your eyes.
I'll be right up.

216
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:31,130
Now, you be careful on the stairs.

217
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,380
- The cheese is on the middle shelf.
- Eighty thousand mi...

218
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,313
Eighty-two thousand.

219
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,797
No, I've always made a point
of not wasting my life.

220
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,671
Whenever I come back here I know that
all I've done is to waste my life.

221
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:52,504
You're a poet, Biff.
You know that?

222
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:57,255
- You're an idealist.
- No, I'm mixed up very bad.

223
00:13:57,338 --> 00:14:00,255
Maybe I ought to get married, right?

224
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,462
Maybe I ought
to get stuck into something.

225
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:05,004
Maybe that's my trouble.

226
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:08,755
I'm like a boy.
I'm not married, I'm not in business.

227
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,563
I'm just like a boy.

228
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,045
Are you content, Hap?

229
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,713
You're a success, aren't you?
Are you content?

230
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:20,587
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You're making money.

231
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,171
All I can do now is wait for
the merchandise manager to die.

232
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:32,879
Listen, kid, why don't you
come out West with me?

233
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,712
And you and I?

234
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:38,713
Maybe we can buy a ranch,
raise cattle, use some muscles.

235
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,712
Men built like we are
should be working in the open.

236
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,295
- The Loman brothers?
- We'd be known all over.

237
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:46,963
Biff, Biff, that's
what I dream of sometimes.

238
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:51,130
Sometimes I want to rip my clothes off
and outbox the merchandise manager.

239
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,629
I can outbox, out lift,
outrun anybody in the store

240
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,171
and I have to take orders
from those sons of bitches.

241
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:58,003
If you were with me I'd be happier.

242
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:01,672
Everybody around me is so false
that I am constantly lowering my ideals.

243
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:05,380
Together we'd stand up for one another.

244
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:08,463
We werert brought up to grub for money.
I don't know how.

245
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:10,878
- Neither can I.
- Let's go.

246
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,546
The only thing is,
what can you make out there?

247
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,547
Hap!

248
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,131
I got to show some
of those pompous executives there

249
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:21,063
that Hap Loman can make the grade, huh?

250
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,938
Then I'll go with you, Biff.

251
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,463
We'll be together yet.

252
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,355
I swear, huh?

253
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:33,498
But take those two we had tonight.
Werert they gorgeous creatures?

254
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:36,038
Yeah, most gorgeous I've had in years.

255
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,289
I get that any time I want, Biff.
Whenever I feel disgusted.

256
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:42,498
The only trouble is,
it gets like bowling or something.

257
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,789
I just keep knocking them over.
It doesn't mean anything.

258
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:47,956
- You still run around a lot?
- Nah.

259
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:52,122
I'd like to find a girl steady,
somebody with substance.

260
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:55,080
- Mm-hmm. That's what I long for.
- Go on.

261
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,372
- You'd never come home.
- I would.

262
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,372
Somebody with character, like Mom.

263
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,247
You're gonna call me a bastard
when I tell you this.

264
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:05,082
That girl Charlotte I was with,
engaged to be married.

265
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,997
- No kidding.
- Sure.

266
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:09,580
Guy's in line
for the vice-presidency of the store.

267
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,080
I don't know what gets into me.

268
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:14,039
Maybe I have an overdeveloped
sense of competition.

269
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:17,122
I went and ruined her.
Furthermore, I can't get rid of her.

270
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,372
He's the third executive
I've done that to.

271
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,497
Isn't that a crummy characteristic?

272
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,639
And to top it all,
I go to their weddings.

273
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:28,414
Don't get your sweater dirty!
Biff!

274
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,455
Doesrt he know Mom can hear that?

275
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,040
Oh, what a simonising job. Huh?

276
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,039
Look, Biff, don't leave again, will you?

277
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,413
You'll find a job here, Biff.

278
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,455
- You gotta stay.
- Hey, Biff-o!

279
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:44,331
I don't know what to do.
It's getting embarrassing.

280
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:47,165
Oh, boy, what a simonising job.

281
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:52,498
Look, you go to sleep now but
talk to him in the morning, will ya?

282
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:55,914
- With her in the house?
- We should have a good talk with him.

283
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,997
- That selfish, stupid...
- Shh. Sleep, Biff.

284
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:06,723
No kidding, Biff.
You got a date?

285
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:16,041
Listen, um, you just want
to be careful with those...

286
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,249
...those girls, Biff.
That's all.

287
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,915
Don't make any promises,
no promises, Biff.

288
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,456
No promises of any kind.

289
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:27,249
'Cause the girls, you know,
they always believe what you tell them.

290
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,665
You're very young, Biff.

291
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:34,666
You're too young
to be talking seriously to girls.

292
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:38,207
You want to watch your schooling first.

293
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,915
Stand where you were.

294
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,706
When you're all set, though,

295
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:47,624
there will be plenty of girls

296
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:51,223
for a boy like you.

297
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,139
That so?

298
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,807
The girls pay for you?

299
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:00,890
Boy, you must really be making a hit.

300
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,874
I've been wondering why
you polished the car so careful there.

301
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,114
Uh...

302
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:14,739
Don't leave the hubcaps.
Get the chamois to the hubcaps.

303
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:19,381
Happy, use newspaper on the windows.
It's easy.

304
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,115
Use it like a pad.

305
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,339
That's it, good work.
You're going all right.

306
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:28,991
Biff, um...

307
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,614
First thing we gotta do
when we get time,

308
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:35,114
we gotta clip that big branch
over the house.

309
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,964
I'm afraid it's gonna fall on the roof.

310
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:42,423
Tell you what, we get a, uh...

311
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:45,489
We get a rope and sling her around,

312
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,197
we climb up there with saws
and take her down.

313
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,906
Soon as you finish the car, boys,
I want to see you.

314
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:52,531
I got a surprise for you, boys.

315
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,657
- What do you got, Dad?
- No, no, you finish first.

316
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,782
Never leave a job till you finish.
You remember that.

317
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:03,549
Biff?

318
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:09,074
Up in Albany I saw a beautiful hammock.
I think I'll buy it next trip

319
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:12,632
and we'll hang it
between those two elms there, huh?

320
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:15,382
Wouldrt that be...
Huh?

321
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,408
Wouldrt that be something?

322
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:22,116
Just hanging... Just swinging there
under those branches?

323
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:24,199
Oh, boy, that would be something.

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,991
How's that, Pop? Professional?

325
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:30,157
Terrific. That's a terrific job, boys.

326
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:34,600
- Good work, Biff. - Where's the
surprise? - In the back seat of the car.

327
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:39,324
What is it? Tell me. What did you buy?
-Never mind, something I want you to have.

328
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,699
- What is it, Happy?
- It's a punching bag.

329
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,908
- It's got Gene Tunney's signature.
- How'd you know?

330
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:47,824
- The finest thing for the timing.
- I'm losing weight.

331
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:50,490
- Jumping rope is good, too.
- See the football I got?

332
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,408
- Where'd you get a new ball?
- Coach told me to practice passing.

333
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,408
- He gave you the ball?
- I borrowed it from the locker room.

334
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:58,906
- I want you to return that.
- I told you.

335
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,832
- I'm bringing it back.
- He's gotta practice with a ball.

336
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,457
Coach will congratulate you
on your initiative.

337
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,541
- He keeps congratulating my initiative.
- He likes you.

338
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,458
Somebody else took that ball,
there'd be an uproar.

339
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,332
What's the report, boys?
What's the report?

340
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,583
Where'd you go this time, Pop?
We were lonesome for you.

341
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,625
I'll tell you a secret, boys.
Don't breathe it to a soul.

342
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,374
Someday I'll have my own business
and I'll never have to leave home.

343
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,374
- Like Uncle Charley?
- Bigger than Uncle Charley.

344
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,633
Charley is not liked.
He's liked but he's not well liked.

345
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:34,459
- Where'd you go this time?
- I went to Providence. Met the mayor.

346
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,208
- The mayor of Providence?
- He was in the hotel lobby.

347
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,832
- What did he say?
- He said, "Good morning".

348
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,998
I said, "You got a fine state here".

349
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:45,334
He had coffee with me,
then I went to Waterbury.

350
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:49,275
Waterbury is a fine city, a big clock
city. The famous Waterbury clock.

351
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:55,250
Sold a nice bill there. And then Boston.
Boston was the cradle of the Revolution.

352
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,625
A fine city.
A couple other towns in Mass,

353
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:59,957
on to Portland, Bangor
and straight home.

354
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,166
- Love to go with you.
- As soon as summer comes.

355
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:05,459
- Promise?
- You, Hap and I, I'll show you.

356
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,333
One thing, boys, I have friends.

357
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:11,126
I can park my car on any street
and the cops protect it like their own.

358
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,084
This summer we'll take
our bathing suits...

359
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:16,291
- We'll carry your bags.
- That'd be something,

360
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:19,542
coming to the Boston stores
with you boys carrying my bags!

361
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,333
A sensation.

362
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:24,334
- You nervous about the game?
- Not if you're gonna be there.

363
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,666
What do they say
now that you're captain?

364
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,416
There's a crowd of girls around him
when classes change.

365
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:32,876
This Saturday, just for you,
I'm gonna break through for a touchdown.

366
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,750
- You are supposed to pass...
- I'm doing one play for Pop.

367
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,709
When I take off my helmet
that means I'm breaking out.

368
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,958
- Watch me cross that line.
- Wait till I tell this in Boston.

369
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:44,750
- Biff, where are you?
- Hey, look at Bernard!

370
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,666
What are you looking so anaemic about?

371
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,584
Gotta study, Uncle Willy.
He's got Regents next week.

372
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,958
Come on, let's box.

373
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,750
I heard Mr. Birnbaum say
if you don't start studying math

374
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:57,792
he's gonna flunk you and you won't
graduate. -You better study with him.

375
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:01,168
- Pop, you didn't see my sneakers.
- A beautiful job of printing.

376
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:05,709
Just because he prints University of
Virginia doesn't mean they gotta graduate him.

377
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:09,335
With scholarships to three universities
they're gonna flunk him?

378
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:12,167
- I heard Mr. Birnbaum say...
- Don't be a pest.

379
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,725
What an anaemic.

380
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:19,300
I'm waiting for you in my house, Biff.

381
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:21,342
Bernard is not well-liked, is he?

382
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:24,175
He's liked but he's not well-liked.

383
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,508
Bernard can get
the best marks in school,

384
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,342
but when he gets out to the business
world you'll be ahead of him.

385
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,967
That's why I thank Almighty God
you're both built like Adonises.

386
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,841
The man who makes an appearance
in the business world,

387
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:40,384
the man who creates personal interest,
is the man who gets ahead.

388
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:43,567
Be liked and you will never want, hm?

389
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,510
Take me, for instance. I never
have to wait in line to see a buyer.

390
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:50,258
Willy Loman is here,
that's all they have to know.

391
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,592
- I go straight through.
- Did you knock 'em dead?

392
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:55,510
Knocked them cold in Providence,
slaughtered in Boston.

393
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:59,051
- I'm losing weight, Pop.
- Hello, dear. - Sweetheart.

394
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,426
- How'd the Chevy run?
- Chevrolet's the greatest car ever.

395
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,051
Since when do you
let your mother carry wash?

396
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:08,960
Where to, Ma? -Just hang it on the
line. Biff, you gotta go to your friends.

397
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,752
- The cellar is filled with boys.
- When Pop comes home they can wait.

398
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:16,585
- Better go tell them what to do, Biff.
- Sweep out the furnace room.

399
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:20,543
- Good work, Biff. - The way they
obey him. - That's the training.

400
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:23,500
I was selling thousands,
but I had to come home.

401
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,167
The block will be at that game.
You sell anything?

402
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:29,044
I did 500 gross in Providence,
700 gross in Boston.

403
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,993
Wait, wait, I got a pencil.

404
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:36,576
That makes your commission 200...

405
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,493
My God!

406
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:42,118
- Two hundred and twelve dollars!
- I didn't figure it yet.

407
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:45,660
- How much did you do?
- A hundred eighty gross in Providence.

408
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:48,450
It comes to roughly 200 gross
on the whole trip.

409
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:51,409
See, three of the stores
were half closed for inventory.

410
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:53,368
I would have broke records.

411
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,201
It makes 70 dollars and some pennies.
Very good.

412
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,076
- What do we owe?
- Well...

413
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,742
- Sixteen dollars on the refrigerator.
- Why 16?

414
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:03,576
- The fan belt broke. It was $1.80.
- It's brand new.

415
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Well, it's like the man says.
It's got to work itself in.

416
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:09,034
I hope we didn't get stuck
on that machine.

417
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,408
It's got the biggest ads of any of them!

418
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,242
It's a fine machine.
What else?

419
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,159
Well, there's $9.60
for the washing machine,

420
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:21,326
for the vacuum cleaner there's three and
a half due on the 15th, then the roof.

421
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:25,326
- You've got 21 dollars. - It don't
leak? - They did a wonderful job.

422
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,868
- You owe five for the carburettor.
- I'm not gonna pay that man.

423
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:33,284
That lousy, rotten Chevrolet, they ought
to prohibit the manufacture of that car.

424
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,535
Well, you owe him three and a half.

425
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:39,244
And odds and ends comes to
around 120 dollars by the 15th.

426
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:42,869
A hundred and twenty dollars?
If business don't pick up I don't know.

427
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:45,993
- Next week you'll do better.
- I'll knock them dead.

428
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:48,952
I'll go to Hartford.
I'm well-liked in Hartford.

429
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:52,577
You know what the trouble is, Linda?
People don't seem to take to me.

430
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,243
- Don't be so foolish.
- I know it when I walk in.

431
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,992
- They seem to laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

432
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:01,993
- Don't talk like that.
- They just pass me by.

433
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:06,420
- You're making 70 to 100 dollars a week.
- I gotta be at in 10, 12 hours a day.

434
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:09,369
Other men, I don't know why,
they do it easier.

435
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,118
I don't know why I can't stop myself.
I talk too much.

436
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,436
- Oh! - A man ought to come
in with a few words.

437
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:18,494
Charley, he's a man of few words
and they respect him.

438
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:21,327
You don't talk too much.
You're just lively.

439
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:24,286
Well, I figure, what the hell.
Life is short.

440
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:27,968
A couple of jokes...

441
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:32,202
- I joke too much.
- Why, you're...

442
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:34,927
I'm short.

443
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,284
I'm very foolish to look at, Linda.

444
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:42,727
I didn't tell you, but at Christmastime
I happened to be calling on F.H. Stewarts,

445
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:47,036
another salesman I know
as I was going to see the buyer.

446
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,328
I heard him say something
about "the shrimp".

447
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:56,702
And I cracked him...
I cracked him right across the face.

448
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,535
I won't take that.

449
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:01,410
I simply will not take that.

450
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,992
But they do laugh at me.
Oh, I know that.

451
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:09,285
- Darling?
- No, I gotta overcome it.

452
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:11,535
- I know I gotta overcome it.
- Darling?

453
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,702
I'm not dressing to advantage, maybe.

454
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:19,661
Willy, darling, you're
the handsomest man in the world.

455
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:25,993
You're the best. You're a pal.

456
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:31,370
On the road I want to grab you sometimes
and just kiss the life out of you.

457
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,453
I get so lonely,
especially when business is bad,

458
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:39,495
I get the feeling
I'll never sell anything.

459
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:42,302
I want to make a living for you.

460
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:47,128
Or business. Business for the boys.
There's so much I want to make for them.

461
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:50,160
Me? You didn't make me, Willy.
I picked you.

462
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:52,286
- You picked me, huh?
- I did.

463
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:56,454
I'm sitting at that desk, watching all
the salesmen go by, day in and day out.

464
00:26:56,536 --> 00:27:00,037
You got such a sense of humour.
And we do have a good time together.

465
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:03,036
- Sure, sure. Why do you have to go?
- It's 2:00.

466
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:05,954
- Come on.
- My sisters will be scandalised.

467
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:08,869
- When will you be back?
- Two weeks. Will you come up?

468
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,912
Sure thing. You do make me laugh.
That's good for me.

469
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:15,702
And I think you're a wonderful man.

470
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:20,396
- You picked me, huh? - I did, 'cause
you're so sweet and such a kidder.

471
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,661
I'll see you next time I'm in Boston.

472
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,452
- I'll put you through to the buyers.
- Right. Well.

473
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:28,118
Well, bottoms up.

474
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:31,078
Willy! You just kill me, Willy!

475
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:33,803
You just kill me!

476
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,745
And thanks for the stockings.
I love a lot of stockings.

477
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,204
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

478
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:44,206
Oh, and keep your pores open.

479
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,435
Willy!

480
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:52,469
You are, Willy, the handsomest.

481
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:00,729
I'll make it all up to you, Linda.

482
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,400
There's nothing to make up.
You're doing fine.

483
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:05,736
- What's that?
- I'm mending my stockings.

484
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:08,951
- They're so expensive.
- I won't have you mending stockings!

485
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,119
- Willy...
- Where is he? If he doesn't...

486
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,831
- Give him the answers.
- I do, but I can't on a Regents.

487
00:28:13,832 --> 00:28:16,920
- It's a state exam.
- Biff! Where is he?

488
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,214
You better give back that football.

489
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:22,595
- Biff, where is he?
- He's too rough with the girls.

490
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,766
- He's driving without a licence.
- Shut up.

491
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,016
Willy.

492
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:30,106
- Get out of here.
- If he doesn't buckle down he'll flunk.

493
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:34,863
- You gotta do something about that boy.
- There's nothing the matter with him.

494
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,660
You want him to be a worm like Bernard?

495
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:44,333
Aw, he's got spirit, personality.

496
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,881
He's loaded with it, loaded.
What is he stealing?

497
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:51,193
He's giving it back, isn't he?

498
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,449
Why is he stealing?

499
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:59,354
What did I tell him?
I never in my life told him anything...

500
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,984
Come on up, Pop.
Let's go up.

501
00:29:02,985 --> 00:29:04,796
Huh?

502
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,575
Why did she have
to wax the floors herself?

503
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:11,622
Every time she waxes the floors
she keels over.

504
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:13,916
- She knows that.
- Take it easy, Pop.

505
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:17,338
- Hey, what brought you back tonight?
- I got an awful scare.

506
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,607
I nearly hit a kid in Yonkers.

507
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,429
Why didn't I go to Alaska
with my brother Ben that time?

508
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,684
Ben, that man was a genius.
That man was success incarnate.

509
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,562
What a mistake.
He begged me to go.

510
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:33,693
The man started with the clothes on his
back and ended up with diamond mines.

511
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:35,905
I'd like to know how he did it.

512
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,990
The man knew what he wanted, got it.

513
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:41,497
Walks into a jungle, comes out
the age of 21 and he's rich.

514
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,170
The world is an oyster, but
you don't crack it open on a mattress.

515
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,964
Pop, I told you,
I'm gonna retire you for life.

516
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:52,011
You're gonna retire me for life
on 70 dollars a week

517
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,307
and your women and your car
and your apartment. You retire me?

518
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:58,980
I couldn't get past Yonkers today.
Where are you guys? Where are you?

519
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:03,927
The woods are burning. I can't
drive a car. - Everything all right?

520
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:07,781
- What's the matter?
- Everything's fine.

521
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:12,497
- I thought something happened.
- No. - Can't we do something about the walls?

522
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:16,545
You sneeze in here, in my house hats
blow off. - Come on, let's go up, huh?

523
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:19,967
- You go ahead. I'm not tired.
- All right. Take it easy.

524
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,351
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had a heartburn.

525
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:29,062
- You don't know how to eat.
- I eat with my mouth.

526
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:31,900
You gotta know about vitamins
and things like that.

527
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:35,197
- Come on, let's shoot. Tire you out.
- All right.

528
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:38,160
- You got cards?
- I got them someplace.

529
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:43,207
What is it with those vitamins?

530
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,710
They build up your bones. Chemistry.

531
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,883
- There's no bones in a heartburn.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,509
- You don't know about it.
- I'll get insulted.

533
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,682
Don't talk about something
you don't know anything about.

534
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:04,879
- What are you doing home?
- A little trouble with the car.

535
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,341
Oh.

536
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:12,499
- I'd like to take a trip to California.
- Don't say.

537
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:18,131
You want a job? - I got a job, I told you
that. What are you offering me a job for?

538
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:20,926
- Don't get insulted.
- Don't insult me.

539
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,721
- You don't have to go on this way.
- I got a good job.

540
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:26,684
- What do you keep coming in here for?
- You want me to go?

541
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:29,856
I can't understand it.
He's going back to Texas again.

542
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,691
- What is that?
- Let him go.

543
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,194
I've got nothing to give him.
I'm clean.

544
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:38,326
- I'm clean.
- He won't starve. None of them starve.

545
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:41,705
- Forget about it.
- Then what have I got to remember?

546
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:47,114
You take it too hard. When a deposit bottle
is broken you don't get your nickel back.

547
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,343
- That's easy for you to say.
- That ain't easy for me to say.

548
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:56,017
You see the ceiling
I put up in here, hmm?

549
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:59,079
Yeah, that's a piece of work.

550
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,860
Putting up a ceiling is a mystery to me.

551
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,883
How do you do it?
What's the difference?

552
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,036
- Huh?
- Well, talk about it.

553
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:12,248
- You gonna put up a ceiling?
- How can I?

554
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:15,043
- What are you bothering me for?
- You're insulted.

555
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:17,798
A man who can't handle tools
is not a man.

556
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,762
- You're disgusting.
- Don't call me disgusting, Willy.

557
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:24,975
Oh, I'm getting...

558
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:30,817
- I'm getting awfully tired, Ben.
- Keep playing. You'll sleep better.

559
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,629
Did you call me Ben?

560
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:39,329
That's funny. For a second
you reminded me of my brother, Ben.

561
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:42,916
- I only have a few minutes.
- You never heard from him again?

562
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:47,532
Didn't Linda tell you? A couple weeks ago
we got a letter from his wife in Africa.

563
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,094
- He died. - Is that so?
- This is Brooklyn, huh?

564
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:54,265
- Maybe you're in for some of his money.
- He had seven sons.

565
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,685
There was one opportunity
I had with that man.

566
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:59,272
There are several properties
I'm looking at.

567
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:03,153
If I'd have gone with him to Alaska
everything would have been different.

568
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:06,617
- You'd have froze to death.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,456
Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska.
I'm surprised you're not up there.

570
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,417
There's the only man I ever met
who knew the answers.

571
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:16,003
- How are you all?
- Fine.

572
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,841
- Fine.
- Pretty sharp tonight.

573
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:21,178
- Is Mother living with you?
- She died long ago.

574
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,639
- Who?
- Fine specimen of a lady, Mother.

575
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,809
- I'd hoped to see the old girl.
- Who died?

576
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,312
- You heard from Father?
- What do you mean, who died?

577
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:30,565
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about!

578
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,443
- It's half past eight.
- That's my bill.

579
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,071
- I put the ace.
- If you don't know how to play...

580
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:37,992
- It's my ace, for God's sake.
- I'm through!

581
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,912
- When did Mother die?
- Long ago.

582
00:33:39,913 --> 00:33:42,540
- You never knew how to play cards.
- All right.

583
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,710
Next time I'll bring a deck
with five aces.

584
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:47,924
- I don't play that kind of game.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

585
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:49,633
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

586
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:52,972
- Ignoramus.
- So, you're William?

587
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:55,033
Oh, Ben.

588
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:58,103
I've been waiting for you so long.

589
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,692
What's the answer?
How did you do it?

590
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,819
There's a story in that.

591
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,655
- Is this Ben?
- How do you do?

592
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:07,367
Where have you been?
Willy's been wondering...

593
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:09,453
Where is Dad?
How did you get started?

594
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:13,794
- I don't know how much you remember.
- I was just a baby, 3 or 4 years old.

595
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:16,380
- Three years, eleven months.
- What a memory.

596
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:18,925
I have many enterprises
and I've never kept books.

597
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,554
I was sitting under the wagon.
What was it, Nebraska?

598
00:34:21,555 --> 00:34:23,724
South Dakota and I gave you wildflowers.

599
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:27,397
- I remember you walking down some road.
- I was going to find Father in Alaska.

600
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,357
In those days
I had a very faulty view of geography.

601
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:32,944
I discovered after a few days
I was heading south.

602
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:37,367
Instead of Alaska I ended up in
Africa. - Africa? - The Gold Coast!

603
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:40,163
- Principally, diamond mines.
- Diamond mines!

604
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:42,791
Yes, but I'm afraid
I only have a few minutes.

605
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,880
Boys, boys, listen to this!

606
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:47,757
This is your Uncle Ben!

607
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:51,220
A great man!
Ben, tell my boys.

608
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:54,684
Why, boys, when I was 17
I walked into the jungle.

609
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,270
When I was 21, I walked out.

610
00:34:57,271 --> 00:35:01,109
- And by God, I was rich!
- See what I've been talking about?

611
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:04,865
- The greatest things can happen.
- I have an appointment in Ketchikan.

612
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,117
Tell about Dad.
I want my boys to hear.

613
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,746
I want them to know
the stock they spring from.

614
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:14,335
All I remember is a man with a big beard.
I was sitting on Mama's lap around the fire.

615
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:18,341
- There was some kind of high
music. - He played the flute.

616
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:23,140
- The flute, that's right. - Father was
a very great, very wild-hearted man.

617
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:26,436
He'd start in Boston
and toss the whole family in the wagon,

618
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:29,189
and he'd drive the team
right across the country.

619
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,987
Through lowa, Michigan, Illinois
and all the western states.

620
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:36,617
We'd stop in the towns and
he'd sell the flutes he made on the way.

621
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,326
A great inventor, Father.

622
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:42,668
With one gadget he made more in one week
than a man like you makes in a lifetime.

623
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,798
That's the way I'm bringing them up,
rugged, well-liked, all around.

624
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:49,218
- Yeah? Hit me, boy, hard as you can.
- No.

625
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,969
Oh, come on, get to me.

626
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,806
Go ahead, show him.

627
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,728
Like I taught you.
Give him the old shoulderjab.

628
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:00,986
Hey!

629
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:09,956
- How's that?
- Very good, Willy, very good.

630
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:13,795
- Shake hands, boys. Attaway.
- Look out, Biff.

631
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:16,297
Never fight fair with a stranger, boy.

632
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:19,177
You'll never get
out of the jungle that way.

633
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,515
It was an honour and a pleasure
to meet you, Linda.

634
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,186
Have a nice trip.

635
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:29,484
Oh, and good luck with your, uh...
What do you do?

636
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:32,278
- Oh, uh, selling.
- Oh, yes, really?

637
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:35,408
I don't want you to think...
It's Brooklyn, but we hunt too.

638
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:37,869
- Really, now?
- There's snakes and rabbits

639
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,082
That's why I moved out.
Biff can fell any one of these trees.

640
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,480
Go over to where they're building
the apartment and get some sand.

641
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,249
We're gonna rebuild the front stoop.
Watch us.

642
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,087
I lost weight, Pop, you notice?

643
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:52,672
They steal more
they'll put the cops on them.

644
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,970
- Don't let Biff take any more.
- The load they brought last week,

645
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:59,099
at least a dozen six by tens,
won'th all kinds of money.

646
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,188
If that watchman sees them...

647
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:05,274
I got a couple of fearless characters.

648
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,194
Willy, the gaols are full
of fearless characters.

649
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:11,367
- And the Stock Exchange.
- Uncle Willy!

650
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,203
Uncle Willy,
the watchmars chasing Biff!

651
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:16,790
Shut up.
He's not stealing anything.

652
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,668
Where is he?

653
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,631
Oh, there's nothing wrong.
What is the matter with you?

654
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,949
Nervy boy, good.

655
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,661
Nerves of iron, that Biff.

656
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,997
I don't know what it is.

657
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,750
My New England man comes back
and he's bleeding.

658
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:34,340
- Couldrt sell a nickel for five cents.
- It's contacts, Charley.

659
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:37,260
- I got important contacts.
- Glad to hear it, Willy.

660
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:40,097
Come in later,
we'll shoot a little casino.

661
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,951
I'll take some of your Portland money.

662
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:52,699
All business is bad, it's murderous.

663
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:56,329
But not for me, of course.

664
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,768
- I'll stop by on my way
back to Africa. - Ben, wait.

665
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:04,817
Can't you stay a few days, huh?

666
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,427
You're just what I need, Ben.

667
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:10,056
You know, I have a fine position here,

668
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:13,812
but Dad left when I was such a baby,
I never had a chance to talk to him.

669
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:16,773
I still feel
kind of temporary about myself.

670
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:21,322
- I'll be late for my train.
- Ben, my boys. Can't we talk?

671
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:24,911
See, they'd go
into the jaws of hell for me, but I...

672
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:29,417
You're being first-rate with your boys.
Outstanding, manly chaps.

673
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,422
Ben, that's good to hear
because sometimes I'm afraid

674
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,924
I'm not teaching them
the right kind of...

675
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:36,342
How should I teach them?

676
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:40,307
William, when I walked
into the jungle, I was 17.

677
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,478
When I walked out I was 21.

678
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:46,567
And by God, I was rich!

679
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:50,296
Was rich!

680
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:58,666
That's just the spirit
I want to imbue them with,

681
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,419
to walk into a jungle...
Oh, boy.

682
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,509
I was right. I was right. I was right!

683
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,863
- I was right!
- Willy?

684
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:13,318
Willy, dear, did you get some cheese?

685
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:19,127
It's awful late, darling.
Come to bed.

686
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:24,285
You gotta break your neck
to see a star in this yard.

687
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:27,473
Are you coming up, Willy?

688
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:30,669
Whatever happened
to that diamond watch fob?

689
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:33,089
When Ben came from Africa that time,

690
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,716
didn't he give me a watch fob
with a diamond in it?

691
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:40,558
You pawned it, dear, 12, 13 years ago
for Biff's radio correspondence course.

692
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:43,395
That was a beautiful thing.
I'll take a walk.

693
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:45,690
But in your slippers, Willy?

694
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:50,532
What a man, huh?
Now, there was a man won'th talking to.

695
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:53,534
- But in your slippers!
- I was right.

696
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,745
I was, I was right!

697
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,748
- I was right.
- What is he doing out here?

698
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,999
- Shh!
- God Almighty, Mom.

699
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,045
- How long's he been doing this?
- Don't. He'll hear you.

700
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:06,797
What the hell is the matter with him?

701
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:10,768
- It'll pass by morning.
- Shouldn't we do anything?

702
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:14,181
Oh, my dear,
you should do a lot of things.

703
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:16,890
There's nothing to do.
Go to bed.

704
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:20,145
- I never heard him so loud, Mom.
- You'll hear him.

705
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:23,063
- Why didn't you write me about this?
- How would I?

706
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:25,524
For over three months
you've had no address.

707
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:28,711
I was on the move.
I thought of you all the time.

708
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,738
But he likes to have a letter

709
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:35,118
just to know there's still
the possibility of better things.

710
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:38,580
- He's not like this all the time.
- When you come home he's the worst.

711
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,414
When you write you're coming,

712
00:40:40,415 --> 00:40:43,710
he's all smiles, he talks about
the future, he's wonderful.

713
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:47,548
The closer you come the more shaky
he gets and by the time you get here,

714
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,799
he's arguing,
he seems to be angry at you.

715
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,636
I think it's just because he can't
bring himself to open up to you.

716
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,806
- Why are you so hateful to each other?
- I'm not hateful.

717
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,310
Oh! You no sooner walk through
that door than you're fighting.

718
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:03,271
I don't know why.
I mean to change, Mom. I'm trying.

719
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:05,940
- Are you home to stay now?
- I don't know.

720
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:09,235
- I'll look around.
- You can't look around all your life.

721
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:12,614
I just can't take hold.
I can't take hold to some kind of life.

722
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:16,618
Biff, a man is not a bird
to come and go with the springtime.

723
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:20,095
Your hair.

724
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,831
Your hair's getting so gray.

725
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:25,292
It's been gray
since you were in high school.

726
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:28,838
- I just stopped dying it.
- Well, dye it again, Mom.

727
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:32,508
I don't want my pal looking old.

728
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:35,220
You are such a boy!

729
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:39,475
You think you can go away for a year?
You've got to get it into your head now.

730
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:43,354
One day you'll knock on this door,
there will be strange people here.

731
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:46,273
What are you talking about?
You're not even 60 yet.

732
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:47,982
What about your father?

733
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:50,693
- Well, I meant him, too.
- He admires Pop.

734
00:41:50,694 --> 00:41:54,114
If you don't have feeling for him,
you can't have feelings for me.

735
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:55,907
- Sure, I can.
- No, Biff.

736
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:58,785
You can'tjust come to see me!

737
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:01,704
Because I love him.

738
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:04,040
He's the dearest man in the world to me

739
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:09,004
and I won't have anyone making him feel
unwanted and low and blue.

740
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:12,883
You have got to make up your mind now.
There's no leeway anymore.

741
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:15,593
Either he's your father,

742
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:17,971
and you pay him that respect,

743
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:19,806
or else you're not to come here.

744
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,935
- Hey, Biffo!
- What the hell is the matter with him?

745
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,728
- Don't go near him.
- Stop making excuses for him.

746
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:29,358
He always wiped the floor with you.
He never had an ounce of respect.

747
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:32,360
- He always had respect for her.
- What do you know?

748
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:34,862
- Don't call him crazy.
- He's got no character.

749
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:37,115
Charley wouldn't do this,
not in his house.

750
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:40,035
- Peeling that vomit from his mind.
- Charley never had what he's got.

751
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,080
People are worse off than Willy Loman,
I've seen them.

752
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:46,458
Then make Charley your father.
You can't do that, can you?

753
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,252
I am not saying he's a great man.

754
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:52,798
Willy Loman never earned a lot of money.
His name was never in the paper.

755
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,716
He's not the finest character.

756
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,968
But he's a human being.

757
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:01,314
And a terrible thing is happening
to him. So attention must be paid.

758
00:43:01,515 --> 00:43:06,228
He must not be allowed
to fall into his grave like an old dog.

759
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:10,899
Attention! Attention must
finally be paid to such a person.

760
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,776
- You called him crazy?
- Mom, I didn't...

761
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:16,947
Wait a minute. A lot of people think
he's lost his balance,

762
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:20,283
but you don't have to be very smart
to know what his trouble is.

763
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,368
- The man is exhausted.
- Sure.

764
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,038
A small man can be
just as exhausted as a great man.

765
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,794
He works for a company
36 years this March,

766
00:43:29,878 --> 00:43:33,214
he opens up uneard of territories
to their trademark,

767
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:35,674
and now, in his old age,

768
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:38,010
they take his salary away!

769
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:41,264
- I didn't know that, Mom.
- You never asked, my dear!

770
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:43,890
Now you get your spending money
somewhere else

771
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:46,852
- you don't trouble your mind with him.
- I gave you money.

772
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,103
Christmastime, 50 dollars.

773
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:52,400
To fix the hot water it cost $97.50!

774
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:55,612
For five weeks
he's been on straight commission,

775
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:57,863
like a beginner, an unknown.

776
00:43:57,864 --> 00:43:59,906
Those ungrateful bastards!

777
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,201
Are they any worse than his sons?

778
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:05,955
He drives 700 miles,

779
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,001
and when he gets there no one
knows him anymore, no one welcomes him.

780
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:13,713
And what goes through a mars mind

781
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:16,715
driving 700 miles home

782
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:20,386
without having earned a cent?
Why shouldn't he talk to himself?

783
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,599
Why not, when
he has to go to Charley every week

784
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:28,310
and borrow 50 dollars from him,
and pretend to me it's his pay.

785
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:31,604
How long can that go on?
How long?

786
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:35,944
And you tell me he has no character?

787
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:40,198
The man who never worked a day
in his life but for your benefit!

788
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,740
And when does he get the medal for that?

789
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:45,870
Is this his reward?

790
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:50,375
To turn around at the age of 63
and find his sons,

791
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,460
who he loved better than his life,

792
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:56,588
- one a philandering bum...
- Mom!

793
00:44:56,672 --> 00:44:59,257
That is all you are, my baby.

794
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:02,844
And you! What happened
to the love you had for him?

795
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:04,512
You were such pals.

796
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:07,224
How you used to talk every night
on the phone,

797
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:10,103
how lonely he was
till he could come home to you.

798
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,061
All right, Mom.

799
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:15,525
I'll live in my room, I'll get a job,
I'll just keep away from him.

800
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:19,238
No, Biff, you can't stay here
and fight all the time.

801
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:21,321
He threw me out of this house.

802
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,990
Why did he do that?

803
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:25,994
- Because I know he's a fake.
- A fake!

804
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:29,497
- In what way? What do you mean?
- Just don't lay it all at my feet.

805
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:32,124
It's between me and him.
That's all I have to say.

806
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:35,586
I'll chip in from now on.
He'll settle for half my paycheque.

807
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,339
- He'll be all right.
- He won't be all right!

808
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,358
I hate this city and I'll stay here.

809
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:43,227
Now, what do you want?

810
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:46,673
- He's dying, Biff.
- Why is he dying?

811
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:49,317
He's been trying to kill himself.

812
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:51,986
How?

813
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:58,727
Do you remember I wrote you that
he smashed the car again in February?

814
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,061
Well?

815
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,464
The insurance inspector came.

816
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:08,469
There's evidence that all the accidents
in the last year werert accidents.

817
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:10,428
How can they tell?
That's a lie.

818
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:13,266
- It seems there's a woman...
- What woman?

819
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,242
What?

820
00:46:15,518 --> 00:46:17,144
- Nothing.
- What did you say?

821
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:19,997
- I said, "What woman?"
- What about her?

822
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:26,662
She was walking down the road.

823
00:46:26,663 --> 00:46:29,624
She saw his car.
She said he wasrt driving fast at all.

824
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,416
He didn't skid, she said.

825
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:35,380
He came to that little bridge and
deliberately smashed into the railing.

826
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:38,215
It was the shallowness of the water
that saved him.

827
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:41,277
Mom, he probably just fell asleep again.

828
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,516
- No. I don't think he fell asleep.
- Why not?

829
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:51,161
Last month...

830
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,791
Oh, boys, it's so hard
to say a thing like this.

831
00:46:57,443 --> 00:47:01,531
I was looking for a fuse, the lights
blew out, I went down in the cellar.

832
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:04,366
Behind the fuse box,
it happened to fall out,

833
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:08,288
was this length of rubber pipe,
just short.

834
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:09,914
No kidding.

835
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:12,249
There was an attachment
on the end of it.

836
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,645
I knew right away, and sure enough.

837
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,715
On the bottom of the hot water heater
there's a new nipple on the gas pipe.

838
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,193
- Thatjerk.
- Did you have it taken off?

839
00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:26,655
I'm ashamed to.

840
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,743
How can I mention it to him?

841
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:32,728
Every day I go down

842
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,983
and I take away
that little rubber pipe.

843
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,820
But when he comes home
I put it back where it was.

844
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,340
How can I insult him that way?

845
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,078
It sounds so silly and old-fashioned,
but I tell you,

846
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:52,056
he's put his whole life into you.

847
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,560
And you've turned your backs on him.

848
00:47:57,253 --> 00:48:00,673
Biff, his life is in your hands.

849
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:05,153
I feel like a damn fool.

850
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,637
All right.

851
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,283
All right.

852
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:15,939
It's settled now.
I've been remiss, I know that.

853
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:20,234
But now I'll stay and I swear to you,
Mama, I'll apply myself.

854
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,738
It's just that, see,
I don't fit in business.

855
00:48:23,822 --> 00:48:26,742
Not that I won't try.
I'll try and I'll make good.

856
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:29,786
The trouble was,
you never tried to please people.

857
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,329
It's like when you worked
for Bob Harrison.

858
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,039
He said you were tops.

859
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,211
Then you go and do some damn fool thing
like whistling songs in the elevator.

860
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:40,087
So what? I like to whistle.

861
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:43,008
You don't raise a guy
to a responsible job who whistles.

862
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:44,634
Don't argue about it.

863
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:46,928
You'd go for a swim
in the middle of the day.

864
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:49,932
You don't take off?
You run off sometimes, on a nice day.

865
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:52,350
- Sure, but I cover myself.
- Oh, boys.

866
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:53,767
I'll tell you something.

867
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:56,646
In the business world
some of them think you're crazy.

868
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,817
- Screw the business world.
- Right. Great. But cover yourself.

869
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:03,527
I don't care!
They've laughed at Dad for years.

870
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:06,907
You know why? Because we don't belong
in this nuthouse of a city.

871
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,078
We should be mixing cement somewhere
on some open plain, or carpenters.

872
00:49:11,162 --> 00:49:13,204
A carpenter's allowed to whistle.

873
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:16,334
Even your grandfather was better
than a carpenter.

874
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:19,102
You never grew up.

875
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:22,924
Bernard does not whistle
in the elevator, I assure you.

876
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:28,680
- I bet you do.
- I never whistled in an elevator.

877
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,558
And who in the business world
thinks I'm crazy, hmm?

878
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:36,688
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't make a thing out of it.

879
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,149
Go back to the West.
Be a carpenter or a cowboy.

880
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:42,859
- Enjoy yourself.
- He was just saying things.

881
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,653
- I heard what he said.
- Come on.

882
00:49:44,654 --> 00:49:46,278
They laugh at me, huh?

883
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:48,364
Go to Filene's, go to the Hub,

884
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:51,494
go to Slattery's, Boston
and call out the name Willy Loman.

885
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:54,539
- See what happens. Big shot. Big.
- All right, Pop.

886
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:56,807
All right.

887
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:06,007
Why do you always insult me?

888
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:07,967
Dad, I didn't say a word.

889
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:10,929
- Did I say a word?
- He didn't say anything, Willy.

890
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:12,596
No.

891
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:15,434
- All right, good night.
- Willy! He's decided...

892
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:19,396
If you get tired hanging around
tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up.

893
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:21,230
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

894
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:23,983
He's gonna see Bill Oliver, Pop.

895
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,253
Oliver?

896
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:29,488
For what?

897
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:33,241
Well, he always said he'd stake me
and I'd like to go into business,

898
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,159
so maybe I'll take him up on it.

899
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,078
- Isn't that wonderful?
- What's wonderful about it?

900
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:41,580
There's 50 men in the city of New York
that would stake him.

901
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,832
- Sporting goods?
- I guess so.

902
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:48,126
- I know something about it.
- He knows something about it!

903
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:52,795
You know sporting goods
better than Spalding, for God's sake.

904
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:56,339
- How much is he giving you?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.

905
00:50:56,424 --> 00:51:00,718
- Then what are you talking about?
- All I said was I was gonna go see him.

906
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,510
- You're counting your chickens again.
- Jesus.

907
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:06,679
- Don't curse in this house.
- Since when did you get so clean?

908
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:10,140
Don't use that language to me.
I won't have it!

909
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:14,926
I got an idea, a feasible idea. Let's
talk this over. Let's talk sense.

910
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:19,820
When I was in Florida last time I thought
of a great idea to sell sporting goods.

911
00:51:20,022 --> 00:51:23,447
It just came back to me.
We have a line, the Loman line.

912
00:51:23,649 --> 00:51:27,400
- We put on a couple of exhibitions.
- That's an idea. - Wait!

913
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:30,277
We form two basketball teams,
two water polo teams.

914
00:51:30,278 --> 00:51:33,238
We play each other.
It's a million dollars of publicity.

915
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:35,946
Two brothers, see?
The Loman brothers.

916
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:39,826
- We could sell sporting goods.
- That is a one million dollar idea.

917
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:41,659
Marvellous.

918
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,118
I'm in great shape
as far as that's concerned.

919
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:47,705
It wouldn't be like a business at all.
We'd be out playing ball again.

920
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:51,374
- That's what I was talking about.
- You won't get fed up. It'd be family.

921
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:55,919
Lick the world. You guys together could
absolutely lick the civilised world.

922
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:58,628
I'll see Oliver.
If we could work that out...

923
00:51:58,629 --> 00:52:01,923
- I think everything is...
- Stop interrupting!

924
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:04,340
Don't wear a sports jacket and slacks.

925
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:07,426
A business suit
and talk as little as possible.

926
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,260
- And don't crack any jokes.
- Hey, he did like me.

927
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,595
- He always liked me.
- Oh, he loved you.

928
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,554
Will you stop!

929
00:52:14,555 --> 00:52:17,641
Walk in very serious.
You're not applying for a boy's job.

930
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,768
Money is to pass.
Be quiet, fine and serious.

931
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,726
Everybody likes a kidder
but nobody lends them money.

932
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,771
- I'll try to get some myself.
- I see great things for you.

933
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:30,483
I think your troubles are over.
Start big, you'll end big. Ask for 15.

934
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,274
How much you gonna ask for?

935
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,151
- Gee, I don't...
- Don't say gee. Gee is a boy's word.

936
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,111
A man walking in for $15,000
does not say "gee".

937
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:40,321
- Ten would be top.
- Don't be so modest.

938
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:43,199
You always start it too low.
Walk in with a big laugh.

939
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,661
Start off with a couple of your
good stories to lighten things up.

940
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:49,494
It's not what you say
but how you say it,

941
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:52,037
because personality always wins the day.

942
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:54,998
- Oliver always thought...
- Will you let me talk!

943
00:52:55,082 --> 00:52:56,958
Dad, stop yelling at her.

944
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,416
I was talking, wasrt I?

945
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,043
I just don't like you
yelling at her all the time.

946
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:04,628
- I'm telling you.
- You taking over this house?

947
00:53:04,629 --> 00:53:07,923
- Willy, he didn't mean...
- Don't take his side all the time!

948
00:53:08,715 --> 00:53:10,774
Stop yelling at her.

949
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,275
Give my best to Bill Oliver.

950
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,246
- He may remember me.
- Why did you have to start that?

951
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:51,241
Did you see how sweet he was
as soon as you talked hopefully?

952
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:56,211
Go up.
Say good night to him.

953
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:59,755
- Don't let him go to bed that way.
- Biff, let's buck him up.

954
00:53:59,955 --> 00:54:04,599
Please, dear.
It takes so little to make him happy.

955
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:07,992
Come.

956
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:12,755
Your pyjamas are hanging
in the bathroom, Willy.

957
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:14,255
What a woman.

958
00:54:14,256 --> 00:54:17,715
They broke the mould when they made her.
You know that, Biff?

959
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,566
He's off salary.

960
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,859
My god, working on commission.

961
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,403
Let's face it.
He's no hotshot selling man.

962
00:54:25,404 --> 00:54:28,280
Sometimes you gotta admit
he's a sweet personality.

963
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:31,032
Lend me ten bucks.
I'm gonna buy some new ties.

964
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:34,409
I'll take you to a place I know.
Wear one of my striped shirts.

965
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:37,663
Mom got so gray.
She got awful old.

966
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:42,999
I'm gonna go in and see Oliver tomorrow
and I'm gonna knock him...

967
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,751
Come on up and tell Dad.
Let's give him a whirl.

968
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:48,460
With ten thousand bucks... boy.

969
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:51,254
That's the first time
I've heard the old confidence.

970
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:55,508
You're gonna live with me, kid,
and I'm telling you, any babe you want.

971
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,716
You say the word.

972
00:54:57,717 --> 00:55:00,552
Can you do something about the shower?
It drips.

973
00:55:00,636 --> 00:55:04,847
Oh, all of a sudden
everything falls to pieces.

974
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,348
That damn plumbing.
They ought to be sued, those people.

975
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,227
- Hardly finished putting it in...
- I'm wondering if Oliver will remember.

976
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:16,737
- You think he might? -Remember him?
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

977
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,772
If he'd have stayed with Oliver,
he'd be on top now.

978
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:25,242
Wait till Oliver gets a look at him. You
don't know the average calibre anymore.

979
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:29,320
The average young man today
has got a calibre of zero.

980
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:31,737
The greatest thing for him
was to bum up...

981
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:33,755
Willy.

982
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:44,037
- Glad to hear it, boy.
- He wanted to say good night to you.

983
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:47,222
Oh, yeah, you knock them dead, boy.

984
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,018
What do you want to tell me?

985
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:00,213
Take it easy, Pop, good night.

986
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:03,425
If anything falls off the desk
while you're talking to him,

987
00:56:03,508 --> 00:56:06,342
like a package or something,
don't you pick it up.

988
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:09,762
- They have office boys.
- I'll make a big breakfast.

989
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:15,391
Will you let me finish, hmm?

990
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:19,351
Tell him you were in business
in the West, not farm work.

991
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:22,602
- All right, Dad. I will.
- I think everything's gonna be...

992
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,358
And don't undersell yourself.
No less than $15,000.

993
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:32,902
- OK. Good night, Mom.
- Because you got a greatness in you.

994
00:56:32,985 --> 00:56:35,128
Biff!

995
00:56:38,281 --> 00:56:40,923
Remember that.

996
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,001
- You got all kinds of greatness.
- Sleep well, darling.

997
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:49,287
- I'm gonna get married, Mom. I wanted
to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear.

998
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:52,165
I just wanted to tell you.

999
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:54,889
Keep up the good work.

1000
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:15,095
Do you remember that Ebbets Field
game, the championship of the city?

1001
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:16,720
Hmm?

1002
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:19,281
Just rest, dear.

1003
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,641
- Should I sing to you?
- Yeah, you sing to me.

1004
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:27,104
You know, when that team came out,
he was the tallest.

1005
00:57:27,188 --> 00:57:28,813
You remember?

1006
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:32,401
- All in gold.
- Oh, like a young god.

1007
00:57:34,068 --> 00:57:39,457
Hercules, something like that. And
the sun, the sun all around him.

1008
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,593
Remember how he waved to me?

1009
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,190
Right from the field, with the representatives
from three colleges standing by,

1010
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:52,792
and the buyers I brought.

1011
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:55,419
Oh, the cheers when he came out.

1012
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,606
Loman! Loman!

1013
00:57:59,632 --> 00:58:02,718
Loman!

1014
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,033
God Almighty, he'll be great yet.

1015
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,773
A star like that, magnificent,

1016
00:58:18,855 --> 00:58:21,958
can never really fade away.

1017
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:30,174
- Oh, boy.
- Willy?

1018
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:33,093
Dear?

1019
00:58:34,662 --> 00:58:37,764
What has he got against you?

1020
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,561
I'm so tired. Don't talk anymore.

1021
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:48,548
Will you ask Howard
if he'll let you work in New York?

1022
00:58:48,632 --> 00:58:51,926
First thing in the morning.
Everything will be all right.

1023
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:56,946
Gee.

1024
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:01,057
Look at the moon
moving between the buildings.

1025
01:00:09,282 --> 01:00:13,326
Oh, oh, wonderful coffee!

1026
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,869
- A meal in itself.
- Can I make you some eggs?

1027
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:19,789
- Take a breath.
- You look so rested, dear.

1028
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,553
I slept like a dead one.
First time in months.

1029
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:25,462
Imagine sleeping till 10
on a Tuesday morning.

1030
01:00:25,463 --> 01:00:29,807
- Boys left nice and early? - They
were out of here by 8:00. - Good work.

1031
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:32,425
It was thrilling, them leaving together.

1032
01:00:32,426 --> 01:00:35,713
I cannot get over the smell
of shaving lotion in this house.

1033
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:39,663
Biff was very changed this morning.
His attitude seemed to be hopeful.

1034
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,417
- He couldn't wait to see Oliver.
- He's heading for a change.

1035
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:46,813
- Certain men take longer to get...
- Solidified.

1036
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:49,499
- How did he dress?
- His blue suit.

1037
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:53,327
He looked so handsome.
He could be anything in that suit.

1038
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:56,078
Boy, there's no question.
No question at all.

1039
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,041
Gee, on the way home tonight
I'd like to buy some seeds.

1040
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:03,752
Wonderful, but not enough sun
gets back there. Nothing will grow.

1041
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:06,671
Before it's over
we'll get a place in the country,

1042
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:09,548
- I'll raise vegetables, chickens.
- You'll do it.

1043
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:12,593
They'll get married and visit.
I'll build a guest house.

1044
01:01:12,677 --> 01:01:16,555
I've got so many tools. All I'd need
would be lumber and peace of mind.

1045
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:19,222
- I sewed the liner.
- I could build two houses

1046
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:21,309
- so they'd both come.
- Yes.

1047
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,313
- He decide how much he's gonna ask for?
- He didn't, but I imagine ten.

1048
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:29,523
Fifteen thousand.
You're gonna talk to Howard today?

1049
01:01:29,607 --> 01:01:33,902
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll put it to him straight and simple.

1050
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:36,864
- He'll have to take me off the road.
- Ask for a little advance.

1051
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:40,074
We've got the insurance premium.
It's the grace period.

1052
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:43,535
It's $108.68 because
we're a little short this month.

1053
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:46,370
- Why are we short?
- You had the job done on the car.

1054
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:49,331
- That damn Studebaker.
- One more payment on the refrigerator.

1055
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,833
- Itjust broke again.
- It's old, dear.

1056
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:54,544
We should have bought
a well advertised machine.

1057
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:57,922
Charley bought a General Electric.
It's 20 years old and it's good.

1058
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:02,300
- Willy, please! - Whoever heard
of a Hastings refrigerator?

1059
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,596
Once in my life I'd like to buy
something outright before it's broken.

1060
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,517
I am always in a race with the junkyard.
I just finished paying for the car.

1061
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,561
It's on its last legs.
The refrigerator consumes belts.

1062
01:02:13,644 --> 01:02:15,519
- Willy.
- They time those things!

1063
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,232
They time them so when you finally
pay for them they're used up.

1064
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:22,235
All told, about 200 dollars
would carry us dear,

1065
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:26,322
but that includes the last payment
on the mortgage.

1066
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:30,450
When we've made that payment, Willy,
the house belongs to us.

1067
01:02:30,575 --> 01:02:34,203
- That's 25 years.
- Biff was nine when we bought it.

1068
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:39,291
Well, that's a great thing,
to weather a 25 year mortgage.

1069
01:02:39,374 --> 01:02:42,234
It's an accomplishment.

1070
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:47,656
All the cement, the lumber. The
reconstruction I put in this house.

1071
01:02:47,756 --> 01:02:51,134
There ain't a crack
to be found in it anymore.

1072
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:53,885
- Well, it served its purpose.
- What purpose?

1073
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:57,013
Some stranger will come along,
move in, and that's that.

1074
01:02:58,348 --> 01:03:01,642
If only Biff would take this house
and raise a family.

1075
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:07,772
- Good-bye. I'm late.
- I forgot to tell you.

1076
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:12,109
You're supposed to meet them for dinner.
Frank's Chop House, near Sixth Avenue.

1077
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:14,152
Is that so? How about you?

1078
01:03:14,153 --> 01:03:17,197
Just the three of you.
They are gonna blow you to a big meal.

1079
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,073
- Who thought of that?
- Biff came to me this morning.

1080
01:03:20,074 --> 01:03:24,319
He said, "Tell Dad we're gonna blow
him to a big meal. Be there 6:00".

1081
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,862
You and your two boys
are gonna have dinner.

1082
01:03:26,863 --> 01:03:29,698
- Gee whiz, that's really something.
- Yeah.

1083
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:32,200
I'm gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid.

1084
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:35,746
I'll get an advance
and I'll come home with a New York job!

1085
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:38,664
- I'm gonna do it!
- That's the spirit, Willy!

1086
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:41,542
I will never get behind the wheel
the rest of my life!

1087
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:44,335
It's changing, Willy.
I can feel it changing.

1088
01:03:44,336 --> 01:03:46,855
- Beyond a question.
- Oh!

1089
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,215
- You got your glasses?
- Yeah.

1090
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:52,343
And your handkerchief?
And your saccharine?

1091
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:55,429
- And my saccharine.
- Be careful on the subway stairs.

1092
01:03:55,554 --> 01:03:59,933
Will you stop mending stockings?
It gets me nervous. I can't tell you.

1093
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:02,476
And don't forget,
Frank's Chop House.

1094
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:07,222
- Maybe beets would grow out there.
- Oh, Willy, you tried so many times.

1095
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:10,517
- Yeah, well, don't work hard.
- Now, you be careful.

1096
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:13,243
Come on, give me a little something.

1097
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:18,664
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1098
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:35,154
- Psst.
- Hello, Willy.

1099
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:39,316
- I'd like to talk to you, Howard.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

1100
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,235
- What's that?
- Didrt you ever see one of these?

1101
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:44,861
- It's a wire recorder.
- Can we talk a minute?

1102
01:04:44,862 --> 01:04:47,696
It records things.
I just got delivery yesterday.

1103
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:50,282
It's the most terrific machine
I ever saw in my life.

1104
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,409
- I was up all night with it.
- What do you do?

1105
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,245
I bought it for dictation
but you can do anything with it.

1106
01:04:55,246 --> 01:04:58,249
Listen to this. I had it home.
Listen to what I picked up.

1107
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:01,392
The first one is my daughter.
Get this.

1108
01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:06,062
Listen to that kid whistle.

1109
01:05:07,923 --> 01:05:10,010
That is lifelike, isn't it?

1110
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:14,524
- Seven years old. Get that tone.
- I'd like to ask a little favour.

1111
01:05:14,607 --> 01:05:16,904
It's your turn now, Daddy.

1112
01:05:16,905 --> 01:05:19,847
She's crazy for me.

1113
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:25,036
- That's me. - You're very
good. - Now this is my son.

1114
01:05:25,137 --> 01:05:28,187
The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.

1115
01:05:28,313 --> 01:05:32,766
The capital of California is Sacramento.
- Five years old.

1116
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:35,707
He'll make an announcer someday.

1117
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:39,134
- The capital of Colorado...
- That is alphabetical order.

1118
01:05:39,217 --> 01:05:41,974
- The maid kicked the plug.
- That certainly is...

1119
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:43,436
Shh! For God's sake.

1120
01:05:43,437 --> 01:05:46,445
It is 9:00 so I have to go to sleep.

1121
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:49,035
- It really is...
- Wait. The next is my wife.

1122
01:05:49,036 --> 01:05:52,086
- Talk!
- I can't think of anything.

1123
01:05:52,169 --> 01:05:56,306
- It's time.
- Hello. Howard, I can't talk.

1124
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:59,775
- That was my wife.
- That is a wonderful machine. Can we...

1125
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:04,830
I'm gonna take my camera and my bandsaw
and all my hobbies and out they go.

1126
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:09,091
- This is the most fascinating
relaxation ever. - I think I'll get one.

1127
01:06:09,092 --> 01:06:11,723
They're a hundred and a half.
You can't do without it.

1128
01:06:11,724 --> 01:06:16,068
Supposing you want to hear Jack Benny,
see. But you can't be home at that hour.

1129
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:19,495
You tell the maid to turn the radio on
when Jack Benny comes on,

1130
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,294
and this automatically comes on
with the radio.

1131
01:06:22,295 --> 01:06:25,888
- When you come home...
- You come home any time you like.

1132
01:06:25,972 --> 01:06:28,897
You get yourself a Coke,
sit down, throw the switch,

1133
01:06:28,979 --> 01:06:31,988
and there is Jack Benny's programme,
in the middle of the night.

1134
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,206
I'm gonna get one,
'cause lots of times I'm on the road,

1135
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:38,087
and I think, "What I must
be missing on the radio".

1136
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:42,601
- Don't you have a radio in the car?
- Yeah. Whoever thinks of turning it on?

1137
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:46,152
- Arent you supposed to be in Boston?
- That's what I want to talk about.

1138
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,491
- You got a minute?
- What happened?

1139
01:06:48,492 --> 01:06:51,332
- You didn't crack up again, did you?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:54,005
Oh!

1141
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:57,307
Geez, you got me worried there
for a minute.

1142
01:06:57,432 --> 01:07:00,441
- Well, what's the trouble?
- Well, to tell you the truth,

1143
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:04,452
I've come to the decision
that I'd rather not travel anymore.

1144
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:08,796
- Not travel? Well, what would you do?
- Remember Christmastime at the party

1145
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:11,555
you said you'd think
of a spot for me here in town?

1146
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:15,715
- With us? - Sure. - Oh,
yeah, yeah, I remember.

1147
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:18,197
I couldn't think of anything for you.

1148
01:07:18,198 --> 01:07:22,376
I'll tell you, Howard, the kids
are all grown up now, you know.

1149
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:24,673
I don't need much anymore.

1150
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:29,897
If I could take home $65 a week
I could swing it.

1151
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:32,779
- Yeah, but Willy...
- I'll tell you why.

1152
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,498
Speaking frankly
between the two of us, you know,

1153
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:39,464
I'm just a little tired.

1154
01:07:39,465 --> 01:07:42,665
Oh.
I can understand that, Willy.

1155
01:07:42,765 --> 01:07:45,104
But you're a road man, Willy.

1156
01:07:45,105 --> 01:07:48,365
We're a road business.
We've got half a dozen salesmen here.

1157
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:53,279
God knows, Howard,
I never asked a favour of any man,

1158
01:07:53,595 --> 01:07:57,076
but I was with the firm when
your father used to carry you in here.

1159
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:58,938
- I know.
- Your father came to me

1160
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:02,542
the day you were born and asked me
what I thought of the name Howard.

1161
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:06,560
I appreciate that, Willy,
but there just is no spot here for you.

1162
01:08:06,684 --> 01:08:10,702
If I had a spot I would slam you
right in there, but I just don't.

1163
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:14,678
- All I need is 50 dollars a week.
- Where am I gonna put you, kid?

1164
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:17,328
It's not a question
of whether I can sell, huh?

1165
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:21,222
No, but it's a business and
everybody's gotta pull his own weight.

1166
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,914
- Let me tell you a story.
- Business is business.

1167
01:08:23,915 --> 01:08:27,972
This is definitely business.
Listen. You don't understand this.

1168
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:32,033
When I was a boy, 18, 19,
I was already on the road.

1169
01:08:32,116 --> 01:08:35,636
There was a question in my mind
whether selling had a future for me.

1170
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,992
In those days
I had a yearning to go to Alaska.

1171
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,973
There were three gold strikes
in one month in Alaska.

1172
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:44,997
I felt like going out,
just for the ride, you might say.

1173
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,725
- You don't say?
- My father lived many years in Alaska.

1174
01:08:48,849 --> 01:08:51,065
He was an adventurous man.

1175
01:08:51,066 --> 01:08:54,161
We got quite a streak of self-reliance
in our family.

1176
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:57,508
I thought I'd go out with
my older brother, try to locate him,

1177
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,179
maybe settle in the North.

1178
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,460
I was almost decided to go...

1179
01:09:03,782 --> 01:09:06,418
...when I met a salesman
in the Parker House.

1180
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,508
His name was Dave Singleman.

1181
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:12,986
He was 84 years old and
he'd drummed merchandise in 31 states.

1182
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:16,834
Old Dave would go up to his room,
put on his green velvet slippers,

1183
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:20,095
pick up the phone and call the buyers.

1184
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:23,779
Without ever leaving his room
at the age of 84,

1185
01:09:23,904 --> 01:09:26,095
he made his living.

1186
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:31,014
When I saw that, I realised that selling
was the greatest career a man could want

1187
01:09:31,056 --> 01:09:35,406
because what could be more satisfying
than to be able to go at the age of 84

1188
01:09:35,492 --> 01:09:37,413
into 20 or 30 different cities

1189
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:39,966
and pick up a phone
and be remembered and loved

1190
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,785
and helped by many different people.

1191
01:09:43,983 --> 01:09:46,575
You know, when he died...

1192
01:09:46,576 --> 01:09:49,253
And by the way, he died
the death of a salesman,

1193
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:52,717
in his green velvet slippers
in the smoker of the New York,

1194
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:55,359
New Haven and Hartford
going into Boston.

1195
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,258
When he died, hundreds of salesmen
and buyers were at his funeral.

1196
01:10:00,505 --> 01:10:04,899
Things were sad on a lot of trains
for months after that.

1197
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:10,637
You see, in those days there was
personality in it, Howard.

1198
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,481
There was respect and comradeship and...

1199
01:10:16,568 --> 01:10:19,881
...and gratitude.
Today it's all cut and dry.

1200
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:23,889
And there's no chance for bringing
friendship to bear or personality.

1201
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:25,938
You see what I mean.

1202
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:29,118
- They don't know me anymore.
- That's just the thing, Willy.

1203
01:10:29,244 --> 01:10:31,668
If I had 40 dollars a week,
that's all I need.

1204
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:34,431
- I can't take blood from a stone.
- Howard!

1205
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:37,400
The year Al Smith was nominated
your father came to me...

1206
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,329
I'm talking about your father!

1207
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:42,880
There were promises made
across this desk!

1208
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:46,076
You mustnt tell me
that you got people to see!

1209
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:51,564
I put 34 years into this firm,
Howard! Now I can't pay my insurance!

1210
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,341
You can't eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

1211
01:10:54,342 --> 01:10:57,035
A man is not a piece of fruit!

1212
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:02,056
Pay attention.

1213
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,238
No, your father...

1214
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:09,191
Howard...

1215
01:11:09,192 --> 01:11:12,706
In 1928 I had a big year.

1216
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,738
I averaged 170 dollars a week.

1217
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,960
- You never averaged 170 dollars a week.
- No, no, no!

1218
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:25,522
I averaged 170 dollars a week
in the year 1928!

1219
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:27,948
And your father came to me, Howard,

1220
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:30,878
right across this desk,
put his hand on my shoulder...

1221
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:34,860
You have to excuse me, Willy!
I have got to see some people.

1222
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:38,516
Pull yourself together.
I'll be back in a little while.

1223
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:44,974
Ah, pull myself together!

1224
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:47,125
What did I say to him?

1225
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,105
Oh, my god.

1226
01:11:54,345 --> 01:11:56,535
I was yelling at him.

1227
01:11:58,192 --> 01:12:02,376
Frank, Frank, don't you remember
what you told me that time?

1228
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,509
You put your hand on my shoulder...

1229
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,436
The capital of Delaware...

1230
01:12:07,437 --> 01:12:10,549
Oh, Howard!

1231
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,043
Howard!

1232
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:16,014
Howard, Howard, shut it off!

1233
01:12:16,097 --> 01:12:17,852
Shut it off!

1234
01:12:17,853 --> 01:12:20,824
- Look, Willy...
- I gotta get myself some coffee.

1235
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:23,082
- I'll get coffee.
- Willy, look...

1236
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:27,810
Look, Willy,
you can't go to Boston for us.

1237
01:12:29,356 --> 01:12:33,206
- Why can't I go?
- I don't want you to represent us.

1238
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:38,995
I've been meaning to tell you
for a long time now.

1239
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:45,379
- Howard, are you firing me?
- I think you need a good long rest.

1240
01:12:45,463 --> 01:12:49,604
When you feel better come back
and we'll try to work something out.

1241
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:51,360
I gotta earn money, Howard.

1242
01:12:51,361 --> 01:12:54,372
Where are your sons?
Wort your sons give you a hand?

1243
01:12:54,414 --> 01:12:57,174
Oh, they're working on a very big deal.

1244
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:58,973
This is no time for false pride.

1245
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,441
Go to your sons
and tell them you're tired.

1246
01:13:01,442 --> 01:13:03,408
You got two great boys there.

1247
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:05,709
- No question.
- That's that, huh?

1248
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,716
In the meantime. All right.

1249
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,518
I'll go to...
I'll go to Boston tomorrow.

1250
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,359
No!

1251
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,384
No.

1252
01:13:15,623 --> 01:13:18,507
I can't throw myself on my kids.
I'm not a freeloader.

1253
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:21,269
- Kid, I am busy this morning.
- Let me go to Boston.

1254
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,633
I have got a line
of people to see this morning.

1255
01:13:32,523 --> 01:13:34,278
- Sit down. Sit.
- What?

1256
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,220
Oh.

1257
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:46,745
Take five minutes
and pull yourself together.

1258
01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:50,469
And then go home, will you?

1259
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:52,827
I need the office.

1260
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:58,750
Whenever you can this week,
drop off the samples.

1261
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:02,642
You'll feel better, Willy,
and then come back. We'll talk.

1262
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,748
Pull yourself together, kid.
There's people outside.

1263
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:25,104
Oh, Ben!

1264
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:29,956
How did you do it, huh?

1265
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:33,226
What's the answer?

1266
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:35,765
Did you wind up the Alaska deal already?

1267
01:14:35,766 --> 01:14:40,137
Doesrt take much time if you know what
you're doing. I wanted to say good-bye.

1268
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:42,591
- I gotta talk to you.
- I haven't the time.

1269
01:14:42,592 --> 01:14:45,130
Nothing's working out.
I don't know what to do.

1270
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:49,085
I bought timberland in Alaska. I need
a man to look after things for me.

1271
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:50,748
God, timberland!

1272
01:14:50,749 --> 01:14:53,246
Me and my boys and those grand outdoors!

1273
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:55,119
A new continent on your doorstep.

1274
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,283
Get out of these cities. They're full of
talk, time payments and courts of law.

1275
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,695
- You can fight for a fortune up there.
- Linda! Linda!

1276
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,649
- Linda.
- You're back.

1277
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:06,272
- I haven't much time.
- Wait.

1278
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:08,480
He's got a proposition for me in Alaska.

1279
01:15:08,481 --> 01:15:11,559
- But you've got a job here.
- But in Alaska, kid, I could...

1280
01:15:11,643 --> 01:15:14,556
- You are doing well enough.
- Enough for what, dear?

1281
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,677
Don't say things like that to him.
Enough to be happy right here, now.

1282
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:22,881
Why must everyone conquer the world?
You're well-liked, the boys love you.

1283
01:15:23,004 --> 01:15:26,584
The other day old man Wagner told him
he'll be a member of the firm.

1284
01:15:26,668 --> 01:15:30,039
- Didn't he, Willy?
- I'm building something with this firm.

1285
01:15:30,122 --> 01:15:32,993
If a man is building
he must be on the right track.

1286
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,322
- What are you building? Where is it?
- That's true, Linda, there's nothing.

1287
01:15:37,447 --> 01:15:40,486
Why, there's a man 84 years old, Willy.

1288
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,524
That's right, Ben, that's right!

1289
01:15:42,525 --> 01:15:45,521
When I look at that man
I say what's there to worry about?

1290
01:15:45,563 --> 01:15:48,809
All he has to do is go into any city,
pick up a phone

1291
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:50,932
and he's making his living. Know why?

1292
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:53,096
- I gotta go.
- Oh, look at this boy.

1293
01:15:53,097 --> 01:15:57,050
Without a penny to his name, three
great universities are begging for him.

1294
01:15:57,134 --> 01:16:01,778
From there the sky's the limit! It's
not what you do, Ben, it's who you know!

1295
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:05,167
And a smile on your face.
It's contacts, Ben, contacts!

1296
01:16:05,249 --> 01:16:09,578
The whole wealth of Alaska passing over
the lunch table of the Commodore Hotel.

1297
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:12,532
And that's the wonder,
the wonder of this country,

1298
01:16:12,533 --> 01:16:16,944
that a man can end with diamonds
on the basis of being liked.

1299
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:20,233
That's why, when you get
on that field today, it's important,

1300
01:16:20,317 --> 01:16:23,894
'cause thousands of people
will be rooting for you, loving you.

1301
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:28,057
When he walks into a business office,
his name will sound out like a bell,

1302
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:31,012
and all the doors will open to him.
I seen it, Ben.

1303
01:16:31,013 --> 01:16:35,049
I seen it a thousand times. You can't
feel it in your hands, but it's there.

1304
01:16:35,134 --> 01:16:37,379
- Good-bye.
- Don't you think I'm right?

1305
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,001
- I value your advice.
- A new continent at your doorstep.

1306
01:16:41,401 --> 01:16:44,021
You could walk out rich.

1307
01:16:44,022 --> 01:16:46,019
Rich!

1308
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,890
We're gonna do a hit, Ben, you hear me?
We're gonna do a hit!

1309
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:51,969
Gee, I was afraid you left already.

1310
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:53,802
- What time is it?
- Ten past one.

1311
01:16:53,803 --> 01:16:57,091
Oh, come on everybody,
Ebbets Field, next stop.

1312
01:16:57,174 --> 01:17:00,212
- Where's the pennants?
- Did you pack fresh underwear?

1313
01:17:00,296 --> 01:17:03,540
- I want to go. - I'm
carrying your helmet. - I am.

1314
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:06,412
You promised me.
How am I gonna get in the locker room?

1315
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,328
Let him carry the shoulder guards.

1316
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:11,283
Can I? I told everybody
I was gonna be in the locker room.

1317
01:17:11,325 --> 01:17:14,155
- It's the Clubhouse.
- I meant the Clubhouse.

1318
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:18,901
- Let him carry the shoulder guards.
- Stay close to us.

1319
01:17:18,983 --> 01:17:22,945
- Wave when Biff comes out on the
field! You set, boy? - Ready to go, Pop.

1320
01:17:23,144 --> 01:17:25,973
- Every muscle is ready.
- You realise what this means.

1321
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,930
You're coming home this afternoon

1322
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:30,761
captain of the All-Scholastic
Championship Team

1323
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:34,425
- of the city of New York.
- That's right, Pop, and remember,

1324
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:37,712
when I take off my helmet,
that touchdowrs for you.

1325
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:45,453
Let's go over.
I got no room for you, Charley.

1326
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:47,200
- Room for what?
- In the car.

1327
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:49,781
Going for a ride?
I want to shoot some casino.

1328
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:51,820
Don't you realise what today is?

1329
01:17:51,821 --> 01:17:55,359
Oh, he knows, Willy.
He's just kidding you.

1330
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:59,462
That's nothing to kid about. I'm
not kidding, Linda. What's going on?

1331
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:02,059
He is playing at Ebbets Field today.

1332
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:05,597
- Baseball in this weather?
- Don't talk to him. We're late.

1333
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,636
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What?

1334
01:18:07,637 --> 01:18:10,717
Don't you listen to the radio?
Ebbets Field just blew up.

1335
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:12,921
You go to hell! Everybody in?

1336
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,836
Knock a homer, Biff.
Knock a homer!

1337
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,083
I don't think that was funny, Charley.

1338
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:20,331
Did you hear me, huh?
This is the greatest day in his life.

1339
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,870
When are you gonna grow up?

1340
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:24,451
When this game is over
you won't be laughing anymore.

1341
01:18:24,452 --> 01:18:27,364
They'll be calling him
another Red Grange, 25,000 a year.

1342
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:28,821
- That so?
- Yeah!

1343
01:18:28,822 --> 01:18:31,193
- Wait a minute, Willy. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1344
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:34,356
But tell me something.
Who is Red Grange?

1345
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,062
Put up your hands.
Put up your hands, come on.

1346
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:40,599
Put up your hands. Who do you think
you are, better than everybody?

1347
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:43,555
Put up your hands! Put up your hands!

1348
01:18:43,638 --> 01:18:46,468
Put up your hands.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1349
01:18:46,593 --> 01:18:50,380
You don't know everything,
you big ignorant stupid...

1350
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:53,336
Put up your hands.
What are you walking away for?

1351
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:57,082
Don't walk away. You gonna say
something to me, say it to my face.

1352
01:18:57,364 --> 01:18:59,444
I know you laugh at me behind my back.

1353
01:18:59,445 --> 01:19:02,859
You'll be laughing out of the other
side of your face after this game.

1354
01:19:02,941 --> 01:19:05,896
The woods are burning.
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1355
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,225
Eighty thousand people!
Right between the goal posts.

1356
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:13,471
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1357
01:19:13,554 --> 01:19:16,717
Hello, baby! Touchdown!

1358
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:19,048
Touchdown! Ah, Jenny.

1359
01:19:19,049 --> 01:19:22,228
Jenny, good to see you.
How are you?

1360
01:19:22,585 --> 01:19:25,707
- Working? Or still honest?
- Fine.

1361
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:28,663
- How you been feeling?
- Not much any more.

1362
01:19:29,745 --> 01:19:32,133
- Oh!
- Hello, Uncle Willy.

1363
01:19:34,696 --> 01:19:36,837
Bernard.

1364
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:40,024
- Look who's here.
- How are you?

1365
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,979
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by to see Pop.

1366
01:19:43,064 --> 01:19:46,559
To get off my feet till my train leaves.
I'm going to Washington.

1367
01:19:46,642 --> 01:19:49,013
- Is he in?
- He's with the accountant.

1368
01:19:49,014 --> 01:19:52,643
Sit down. What are you
gonna do in Washington?

1369
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:57,054
- Just a case I've got there.
- That so? You gonna play tennis there?

1370
01:19:57,255 --> 01:19:59,710
I'm staying with a friend
who's got a court.

1371
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,582
You don't say.
Their own tennis court?

1372
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,413
- Those are fine people, I bet.
- They're very nice.

1373
01:20:05,497 --> 01:20:07,576
- Dad tells me Biff's in town.
- Yeah.

1374
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:10,990
Biff's in. He's working
on a very big deal, Bernard.

1375
01:20:11,115 --> 01:20:15,259
- What's Biff doing? - He's been
doing very big things in the West,

1376
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,064
but he decided
to establish himself here.

1377
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:20,995
Very big. We're having dinner.

1378
01:20:22,344 --> 01:20:25,214
Did I hear your wife had a boy?

1379
01:20:25,215 --> 01:20:27,920
That's right. Our second.

1380
01:20:27,921 --> 01:20:30,062
Two boys.

1381
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,630
- What do you know?
- You still with the old firm, Willy?

1382
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,088
I'm overjoyed to see how
you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed.

1383
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:42,503
It's an encouraging thing to see.

1384
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:47,889
A young man really... really...

1385
01:20:48,272 --> 01:20:52,454
Ah, it looks very good for Biff.
Very good.

1386
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:05,372
- Bernard. - What is it, Willy?
- What... What's the secret?

1387
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,597
- What secret?
- How did you...?

1388
01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:10,681
- Why didn't he ever catch on?
- Willy, I wouldn't know that.

1389
01:21:10,764 --> 01:21:13,513
Oh, you were his friend,
his boyhood friend.

1390
01:21:13,514 --> 01:21:15,598
It's something I don't understand.

1391
01:21:15,599 --> 01:21:18,222
His life ended
after that Ebbets Field game.

1392
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:21,097
From the age of 17
nothing good ever happened to him.

1393
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:25,599
- He never trained himself for anything.
- He took correspondence courses.

1394
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:29,390
Radio mechanics, television...
He never made the slightest mark.

1395
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:31,972
- Do you want to talk candidly?
- Bernard.

1396
01:21:31,973 --> 01:21:36,183
I regard you as a very brilliant man.
Bernard, I value your advice.

1397
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,848
The hell with advice.
I couldn't advise you.

1398
01:21:38,849 --> 01:21:41,639
There's one thing
I have always wanted to ask you.

1399
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,974
When he was supposed to graduate
and the teacher flunked him...

1400
01:21:45,058 --> 01:21:46,473
Ruined his life.

1401
01:21:46,474 --> 01:21:49,724
All he had to do was go
to summer school, make up that subject.

1402
01:21:49,807 --> 01:21:52,974
- That's right. That's right!
- Did you tell him not to go?

1403
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:55,891
Me? I begged him to go.
I ordered him to go.

1404
01:21:55,892 --> 01:21:58,515
- Why wouldn't he go?
- Why? Why, Bernard!

1405
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:01,766
That questiors been trailing me
like a ghost for 15 years.

1406
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:06,534
He flunked the subject and he laid down
and died like a hammer hit him.

1407
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:09,607
Let me talk to you, Bernard.
I got nobody to talk to.

1408
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:13,883
It wasn't my fault. It keeps going
around in my head, maybe I did something.

1409
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:15,525
I got nothing to give him.

1410
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:16,941
Don't take it so hard.

1411
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:19,418
Why did he lay down?

1412
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:22,817
- What is the story there?
- Willy...

1413
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,816
You're his friend. Come on.

1414
01:22:24,817 --> 01:22:28,900
Willy, I remember it was June.
Our grades came out. He'd flunked math.

1415
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:31,357
That son of a bitch ruined his life.

1416
01:22:31,358 --> 01:22:35,441
Then Biff just got very angry and
he was ready to enrol in summer school.

1417
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:37,898
- He was?
- He wasn't beaten by it at all.

1418
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:40,731
But then, Willy, see...

1419
01:22:40,732 --> 01:22:42,357
What?

1420
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:45,148
He disappeared from the block
for almost a month.

1421
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:48,564
I got the idea that he'd gone
up to New England to see you.

1422
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,648
Did he ever talk with you then?

1423
01:22:51,732 --> 01:22:54,438
- Willy?
- Yeah.

1424
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:56,914
Yeah.

1425
01:22:58,023 --> 01:23:00,355
He came to Boston.
What about it?

1426
01:23:00,356 --> 01:23:03,896
Well, it's just
that when he came back...

1427
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:08,812
I'll never forget this.

1428
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:12,188
It always mystifies me
because I thought so well of Biff.

1429
01:23:12,271 --> 01:23:14,828
I loved him, Willy, you know.

1430
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:17,936
He came back after that month
and took his sneakers.

1431
01:23:17,937 --> 01:23:22,478
Remember those sneakers with the
University of Virginia on them?

1432
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:25,785
He was so proud of them.
Wore them every day.

1433
01:23:26,312 --> 01:23:29,853
He took them down into the cellar,
burned them up in the furnace.

1434
01:23:29,936 --> 01:23:32,452
We had a fistfight.

1435
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:35,518
It lasted at least half an hour,
just the two of us,

1436
01:23:35,519 --> 01:23:39,685
punching each other down in the cellar,
crying right through it.

1437
01:23:39,768 --> 01:23:43,477
I often thought how strange it was
that I knew he'd given up his life.

1438
01:23:47,809 --> 01:23:50,534
What happened in Boston, Willy?

1439
01:23:51,518 --> 01:23:54,351
I just bring it up because you asked me.

1440
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,517
What's that got to do with it?

1441
01:23:56,518 --> 01:24:00,017
- Don't get sore.
- What are you trying to do, blame me?

1442
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,723
If a boy lays down is that my fault?

1443
01:24:02,724 --> 01:24:05,849
- Don't take it...
- Don't you talk to me that way.

1444
01:24:05,934 --> 01:24:08,348
What does that mean,
huh, what happened?

1445
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:11,507
Hey!

1446
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:18,282
- You're gonna miss that train.
- Yeah, I'm going.

1447
01:24:24,282 --> 01:24:26,238
Good-bye, Willy.

1448
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:30,989
- Don't worry about it. If at first you
don't succeed... - Yes, I believe in that.

1449
01:24:31,072 --> 01:24:34,363
Sometimes, Willy, it's better for a man
just to walk away.

1450
01:24:34,488 --> 01:24:36,863
- Walk away?
- That's right.

1451
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,670
What if you can't walk away?

1452
01:24:40,237 --> 01:24:43,511
I guess that's when it's tough.

1453
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:46,587
Good-bye, Willy.

1454
01:24:50,528 --> 01:24:52,361
Good-bye, boy.

1455
01:24:52,362 --> 01:24:56,194
How do you like this kid?
Gonna argue a case in the Supreme Court.

1456
01:24:56,278 --> 01:24:59,127
- Pop!
- No.

1457
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,068
- The Supreme Court?
- I gotta run.

1458
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:04,835
- Bye, Dad.
- Knock 'em dead, Bernard.

1459
01:25:08,776 --> 01:25:11,609
The Supreme Court.

1460
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:13,650
And he didn't even mention it?

1461
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,710
He don't have to.
He's gonna do it.

1462
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:21,526
And you never told him what to do.
You never took any interest in him.

1463
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,817
My salvation is that I never
took any interest in anything.

1464
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:29,842
Here's some money, 50 dollars.
I got an accountant inside.

1465
01:25:30,608 --> 01:25:33,166
Uh, Charley, look, uh...

1466
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:38,316
I got my insurance to pay.
If you could manage it, I...

1467
01:25:39,858 --> 01:25:42,690
I need 110 dollars.

1468
01:25:42,691 --> 01:25:45,773
- I'd draw from my bank, but...
- Sit down, Willy.

1469
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:48,397
I'm keeping an account of everything.

1470
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,981
- Listen to me.
- I'll pay every penny back.

1471
01:25:50,982 --> 01:25:54,814
- I want you to know I appreciate...
- What's going on inside your head?

1472
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:57,522
- Why? I'm simply...
- I offered you a job.

1473
01:25:57,523 --> 01:26:00,897
You can make 50 dollars a week
and I won't send you on the road.

1474
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:03,331
- I got a job.
- Without pay?

1475
01:26:04,063 --> 01:26:07,331
What kind of a job is a job without pay?

1476
01:26:09,647 --> 01:26:12,354
Now, look, kid. Enough is enough.

1477
01:26:12,355 --> 01:26:15,188
I'm no genius, but I know
when I'm being insulted.

1478
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:17,811
- Insulted?
- Why don't you want to work for me?

1479
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:20,021
What does it matter with you?
I got a job.

1480
01:26:20,022 --> 01:26:23,245
What do you walk in here every week for?

1481
01:26:26,729 --> 01:26:31,687
Well, if... if you don't
want me to walk in here...

1482
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:34,936
- I am offering you a job.
- I don't want your job.

1483
01:26:35,019 --> 01:26:38,101
When the hell are you gonna grow up?

1484
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:42,143
You big ignoramus! If you say
that to me again I'll rap you one.

1485
01:26:42,144 --> 01:26:45,419
I don't care how big...
...how big you are.

1486
01:26:55,184 --> 01:26:59,809
- How much do you need, Willy?
- Ah, Charley, I'm strapped.

1487
01:26:59,975 --> 01:27:03,841
I'm strapped. I don't know
what to do. I was just fired.

1488
01:27:04,142 --> 01:27:07,866
- Howard fired you?
- That's not no...

1489
01:27:09,066 --> 01:27:13,590
Imagine that. I named him Howard.
I named him! I named him Howard!

1490
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:17,890
Willy, when are you gonna realise
that them things don't mean anything?

1491
01:27:17,974 --> 01:27:21,031
You named him Howard
but you can't sell that.

1492
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:24,181
The only thing you got in this
world is what you can sell.

1493
01:27:24,306 --> 01:27:28,056
The funny thing is, you're a salesman
and you don't know that.

1494
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,639
I always try to think otherwise,
I guess. I always felt...

1495
01:27:33,763 --> 01:27:36,931
...if a man was impressive
and well-liked then nothing...

1496
01:27:37,015 --> 01:27:39,889
Why must everybody like you?
Who liked JP Morgan?

1497
01:27:39,973 --> 01:27:43,431
Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath
he looked like a butcher.

1498
01:27:43,512 --> 01:27:47,804
With his pockets on
he was very well-liked.

1499
01:27:53,179 --> 01:27:58,025
Now, listen, Willy,
I know you don't like me.

1500
01:27:58,109 --> 01:28:01,283
And nobody can say I'm in love with you.

1501
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:06,466
But I'll give you a job
just for the hell of it.

1502
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:11,678
- What do you say?
- No. No, I just...

1503
01:28:12,062 --> 01:28:14,443
No, I just can't work for you, Charley.

1504
01:28:14,444 --> 01:28:16,448
- What are you, jealous of me?
- No!

1505
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:19,206
I can't work for you, that's all.
Don't ask me why.

1506
01:28:19,207 --> 01:28:22,857
You've been jealous of me
all your life, you damn fool.

1507
01:28:24,931 --> 01:28:27,203
Here.

1508
01:28:28,774 --> 01:28:31,656
- Pay your insurance.
- I'm keeping strict accounts.

1509
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:36,719
I got some work to do. Take care
of yourself. And pay your insurance!

1510
01:28:43,321 --> 01:28:48,292
It's funny, after all the highways
and the trains and the appointments

1511
01:28:48,376 --> 01:28:50,774
and the years...

1512
01:28:52,762 --> 01:28:55,912
...you end up worth
more dead than alive.

1513
01:28:59,071 --> 01:29:02,287
Willy, nobody's worth nothing dead.

1514
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:09,782
You hear what I said?

1515
01:29:11,896 --> 01:29:14,001
Willy!

1516
01:29:14,653 --> 01:29:18,899
Oh, apologise to Bernard for me
when you see him.

1517
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:21,964
I didn't mean to argue with him.
He's a fine boy.

1518
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:27,855
They're all fine boys. And they'll
end up big, all of them someday.

1519
01:29:28,816 --> 01:29:30,946
They'll all play tennis together.

1520
01:29:30,947 --> 01:29:34,040
Wish me luck, Charley.
He saw Bill Oliver today.

1521
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:37,948
Good luck.

1522
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:41,591
Oh, Charley,
you're the only friend I got.

1523
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,166
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

1524
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:01,703
Jesus.

1525
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:09,589
In the front
you're in the middle of noise.

1526
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:13,293
Whenever you've got a party, Mr. Loman,
tell me, I'll put you back here.

1527
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:16,442
You look French.
How's it coming, Stanley?

1528
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:20,746
It's a dog's life. I only wish that
during the war they took me in the Army.

1529
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:23,795
- I could have been dead.
- You got lobsters?

1530
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:28,147
- A hundred percent big. - With the claws.
- Don't worry, I don't give you no mice.

1531
01:30:28,349 --> 01:30:30,897
How about some wine?
Put a hat on the meal.

1532
01:30:30,898 --> 01:30:34,616
No, the recipe I brought you from
overseas with the champagne in it

1533
01:30:34,783 --> 01:30:38,417
I still got that in the kitchen,
but it'll cost you a buck a piece.

1534
01:30:38,501 --> 01:30:40,881
- That's all right.
- You hit a number?

1535
01:30:40,882 --> 01:30:43,387
My brother, I think
he pulled off a deal today.

1536
01:30:43,388 --> 01:30:47,191
- I think we're going into business.
- That's the best, family business.

1537
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:49,529
- That's the best.
- That's what I think.

1538
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:52,914
What's the difference?
Somebody steals, it's in the family.

1539
01:30:52,997 --> 01:30:55,855
Shh. Strudel.

1540
01:30:56,674 --> 01:31:00,518
- Ma'am?
- I'm expecting someone.

1541
01:31:02,648 --> 01:31:07,244
Oh, look at that mouth. Oh, God,
and the binoculars. Wait on her.

1542
01:31:08,707 --> 01:31:11,211
- Would you like a menu?
- I'd like a...

1543
01:31:11,212 --> 01:31:13,509
Why don't you bring her...
Do you mind?

1544
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:17,354
I sell champagne and I'd like her
to try my brand. Bring her a champagne.

1545
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:20,654
- That's awfully nice of you.
- It's all company money.

1546
01:31:20,738 --> 01:31:23,578
That's a charming product
to be selling, isn't it?

1547
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,084
Like everything else,
selling is selling.

1548
01:31:26,085 --> 01:31:29,979
- I suppose? - You don't happen
to sell? - No, I don't sell.

1549
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:33,563
Would you object to a compliment?
You ought to be on a magazine cover.

1550
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:38,267
- I have been. -W hat did I say before?
See, Stanley, she's a cover girl.

1551
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:41,166
- Oh, I could see, I could see.
- What magazine?

1552
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:43,129
A lot of them.
Thank you.

1553
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,218
You know what they say in France?

1554
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,558
Champagne is the drink
of the complexion.

1555
01:31:47,559 --> 01:31:50,567
- Hiya, Biffo.
- Sorry I'm late.

1556
01:31:50,651 --> 01:31:53,933
- No. No, no, I just got here.
Miss, um...? - Forsythe.

1557
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:56,791
Miss Forsythe, this is my brother.

1558
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:59,156
Is Dad here?

1559
01:32:00,059 --> 01:32:03,608
You might have heard of him.
He's a great football player.

1560
01:32:03,693 --> 01:32:06,659
- Really? What team?
- You're familiar with football?

1561
01:32:06,743 --> 01:32:09,625
- I'm afraid I'm not.
- Biff's with the New York Giants.

1562
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:12,007
- Well, it is nice, isn't it?
- Good health.

1563
01:32:12,008 --> 01:32:13,968
- Happy to meet you.
- That's my name.

1564
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:16,727
It's Harold, but at West Point
they called me Happy.

1565
01:32:16,728 --> 01:32:18,315
I see. How do you do?

1566
01:32:18,316 --> 01:32:20,963
- Isn't Dad coming?
- You want her?

1567
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:26,168
- What? - You want her?
- I could never make that.

1568
01:32:26,169 --> 01:32:29,805
I remember the time that idea
would never come into your head.

1569
01:32:29,888 --> 01:32:33,614
- I just saw... - Wait, please. I've
got to see the old confidence.

1570
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:37,198
If you want her she's on call.
I'm telling you, watch this.

1571
01:32:38,436 --> 01:32:41,444
Honey, are you busy?

1572
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:44,284
Well, I am
but I could make a phone call.

1573
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:47,626
Go and do that, will you, honey,
and see if you can get a friend.

1574
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,511
We'll be here for awhile. Biff,
one of the greatest football players.

1575
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:54,479
- I'm certainly happy to meet you.
- Come back soon.

1576
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:58,989
- I'll try.
- Don't try, honey. Try hard.

1577
01:33:01,329 --> 01:33:04,296
Isn't that a shame?
Beautiful girl like that.

1578
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:07,219
- That's why I can't get married.
- Hap, look...

1579
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,307
- I told you she's on call.
- Cut it out.

1580
01:33:09,308 --> 01:33:11,689
I want to say something.

1581
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,071
- Did you see Oliver?
- I saw him, all right.

1582
01:33:14,072 --> 01:33:16,996
I want to tell Dad a couple of things.
I want you to help.

1583
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:20,213
- Is he gonna back you?
- Are you crazy?

1584
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:22,718
You're out of your head,
do you know that?

1585
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,098
Why, what happened?

1586
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,563
I did a terrible thing today, Hap.

1587
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:30,114
It's been the strangest day
I ever went through.

1588
01:33:30,197 --> 01:33:32,787
- I'm a little numb.
- What, he wouldn't see you?

1589
01:33:32,788 --> 01:33:36,848
I waited six hours for him, see.
All day I kept sending my name in.

1590
01:33:37,049 --> 01:33:40,809
Even tried to date his secretary
so she got me through. Not so.

1591
01:33:40,934 --> 01:33:44,277
You're not showing the confidence.
But he remembered you?

1592
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,998
Finally at 5:00 he comes out,
didn't remember who I was or anything.

1593
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:51,837
Biff, did you tell him my Florida idea?

1594
01:33:51,838 --> 01:33:54,553
Hap, he walked away.

1595
01:33:54,554 --> 01:33:58,430
I saw him and for one minute I got
so mad I could have torn the walls down.

1596
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:02,349
How the hell did I ever get the idea
that I was a salesman there?

1597
01:34:02,431 --> 01:34:05,223
I believed myself
that I'd been a salesman for him.

1598
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:09,934
Then he gave me one look and I realised
what a ridiculous lie my life's been.

1599
01:34:10,018 --> 01:34:13,327
We have been talking in a dream
for 15 years.

1600
01:34:13,645 --> 01:34:16,654
- I was a shipping clerk.
- What did you do?

1601
01:34:16,854 --> 01:34:19,981
Well, he... he left, see.

1602
01:34:20,065 --> 01:34:23,857
His secretary went out
and I was alone in the waiting room.

1603
01:34:25,107 --> 01:34:28,692
And next thing I know,
I was in his office.

1604
01:34:28,776 --> 01:34:32,568
Panel walls and everything.

1605
01:34:32,652 --> 01:34:37,153
I can't explain it, Hap.
I took his fountain pen.

1606
01:34:37,237 --> 01:34:39,320
Geez. Did he catch you?

1607
01:34:39,321 --> 01:34:43,531
I ran out. I ran down all 11 flights.
I ran and ran and ran.

1608
01:34:43,615 --> 01:34:46,322
Boy, that was dumb, Biff.
Why did you do that?

1609
01:34:46,323 --> 01:34:48,115
I don't know.

1610
01:34:48,116 --> 01:34:50,967
I just wanted to take something.

1611
01:34:53,786 --> 01:34:56,327
You gotta help me, Hap.
I want to tell Pop.

1612
01:34:56,328 --> 01:34:58,387
Are you crazy? What for?

1613
01:35:01,204 --> 01:35:05,582
He's gotta understand I'm not the man
somebody lends that kind of money to.

1614
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:08,415
He thinks I've been spiting him
all these years.

1615
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:11,625
Tell him something nice.
Say you got a date with Oliver tomorrow.

1616
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:14,794
- What do I do tomorrow?
- Dad is never so happy

1617
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:17,977
as when he's
looking forward to something.

1618
01:35:19,711 --> 01:35:22,170
Gee, I haven't been here in years!

1619
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:25,048
- Sit down. You want a drink?
- Sure, I don't mind.

1620
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,214
- You look worried.
- No.

1621
01:35:27,215 --> 01:35:29,547
Uh, Scotch all around.
Make it doubles.

1622
01:35:29,548 --> 01:35:33,008
You had a couple already, didn't you?
Did everything go all right?

1623
01:35:33,093 --> 01:35:36,343
- I had an experience today, Pop.
- That so? What happened?

1624
01:35:36,426 --> 01:35:39,176
I wanted to tell you everything
from first to last.

1625
01:35:39,177 --> 01:35:42,052
It's been a strange day.
I had to wait quite a while.

1626
01:35:42,053 --> 01:35:43,512
- Oliver?
- Yeah, Oliver.

1627
01:35:43,513 --> 01:35:45,553
All day, as a matter of cold fact.

1628
01:35:45,554 --> 01:35:50,598
And a lot of instances, Pop,
facts about my life came back to me.

1629
01:35:50,681 --> 01:35:54,141
Who was it, Pop, whoever said
I was a salesman with Oliver?

1630
01:35:54,266 --> 01:35:57,143
- Well, you were.
- No, I was a shipping clerk, Dad.

1631
01:35:57,226 --> 01:36:00,393
I don't know who said it first
but I was never a salesman for Oliver.

1632
01:36:00,477 --> 01:36:03,310
- What are you talking about?
- Hold onto the facts.

1633
01:36:03,311 --> 01:36:05,644
I was a shipping clerk.

1634
01:36:05,645 --> 01:36:07,687
- Listen to me...
- Dad, let me finish.

1635
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:10,313
I'm not interested in stories
about the past.

1636
01:36:10,314 --> 01:36:12,105
The woods are burning, boys.

1637
01:36:12,106 --> 01:36:14,815
There's a big blaze going on all around.

1638
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:16,399
I was fired today.

1639
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,149
How could you be?

1640
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:22,361
And I'm looking for a little good news
to tell your mother

1641
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:24,819
- because the woman has suffered.
- Dad!

1642
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,655
I haven't got a story left in my head
so don't give me a lecture about facts.

1643
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,864
I am not interested.
Now, what have you got to say to me?

1644
01:36:31,947 --> 01:36:35,215
Did you see Oliver, huh?

1645
01:36:35,448 --> 01:36:37,990
- Geez, Dad.
- You didn't go up there?

1646
01:36:37,991 --> 01:36:41,200
- Sure, he went up there.
- I saw him. How could they fire you?

1647
01:36:41,284 --> 01:36:44,910
- What kind of welcome did he give you?
- He won't let you work on commission?

1648
01:36:44,994 --> 01:36:47,702
- I'm out! He gave you a warm welcome?
- Sure, Pop.

1649
01:36:47,703 --> 01:36:51,330
I was wondering if he'd remember you.
A man doesn't see him in ten years,

1650
01:36:51,413 --> 01:36:54,247
he gives him a welcome.
You know why he remembered?

1651
01:36:54,248 --> 01:36:58,499
- You impressed him in those days.
- Dad, can we talk and get this down?

1652
01:36:58,582 --> 01:37:02,459
What happened? Did he take you in
his office or talk in the waiting room?

1653
01:37:02,543 --> 01:37:05,251
- He came in...
- I bet he threw his arms around you.

1654
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:08,419
- He's a fine man, a hard man to see.
- Oh, I know that.

1655
01:37:08,545 --> 01:37:10,795
- Is that where you had the drinks?
- Yeah.

1656
01:37:10,796 --> 01:37:13,420
- He told him my Florida idea.
- Don't interrupt.

1657
01:37:13,421 --> 01:37:16,673
- How'd he react to the Florida idea?
- Give me a minute to explain.

1658
01:37:16,757 --> 01:37:20,800
I've been waiting for you to explain
since I sat down here. What happened?

1659
01:37:20,882 --> 01:37:24,175
- I talked, he listened to me.
- Oh, the way he listens.

1660
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,676
- What was his answer?
- An... Answer...

1661
01:37:26,677 --> 01:37:29,594
You're not letting me tell you
what I want to tell you.

1662
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:31,302
- You didn't see him.
- I did.

1663
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:34,556
- You insult him or something?
- Dad! Will you let me out of it?

1664
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,263
- Will you just let me out of it?
- What happened?

1665
01:37:37,264 --> 01:37:39,139
- I can't talk to him.
- Tell him.

1666
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:42,724
- Shut up and leave me alone.
- No, no. You had to go and flunk math.

1667
01:37:42,849 --> 01:37:45,934
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- Math, math, math.

1668
01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:49,478
- Take it easy, Pop.
- If you hadrt of flunked you'd be set.

1669
01:37:49,561 --> 01:37:52,645
I'm gonna tell you what happened
and you're gonna listen to me.

1670
01:37:52,728 --> 01:37:56,729
I waited six hours and I kept sending
my name in but he wouldn't see me.

1671
01:37:56,813 --> 01:37:59,731
- Finally he came.
- Biff flunked mathl

1672
01:37:59,815 --> 01:38:02,481
- They won't graduate him.
- Where is he?

1673
01:38:02,482 --> 01:38:04,565
He ran off.
He went to Grand Central.

1674
01:38:04,566 --> 01:38:06,316
Is Uncle Willy in Boston?

1675
01:38:06,317 --> 01:38:09,818
See, so I'm washed up with Oliver,
Pop, do you understand that?

1676
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,776
- Are you listening?
- If you hadrt have flunked...

1677
01:38:12,777 --> 01:38:16,570
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- I didn't flunk math. What pen?

1678
01:38:16,655 --> 01:38:19,488
- That was dumb, Biff.
- You took Oliver's pen.

1679
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:22,782
- I just explained it.
- You stole Bill Oliver's fountain pen.

1680
01:38:22,864 --> 01:38:25,740
I didn't exactly steal it.
I was trying to tell you.

1681
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,743
He had it in his hand,
Oliver walked in, he got nervous.

1682
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:31,576
- My god, Biff.
- I never intended to do it...

1683
01:38:31,577 --> 01:38:35,037
- I'm not in my room. I'm not there.
- Ringing Mr Loman.

1684
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,370
- Now, stop it.
- Mr Loman does not answer.

1685
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:39,288
- I'm not there.
- Shall I page him?

1686
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:42,079
- You're no good, no good for anything.
- I am, Dad.

1687
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,664
I'll find something.
Don't worry about anything.

1688
01:38:44,665 --> 01:38:46,457
- Talk to me.
- Paging Mr Loman.

1689
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:49,040
- No! No!
- He'll strike something, Pop, please.

1690
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:51,667
- No!
- Dad, I'm telling you something good.

1691
01:38:51,668 --> 01:38:55,211
Oliver talked to his partner
about the Florida idea.

1692
01:38:55,336 --> 01:38:57,294
- You listening, Dad? Dad?
- Yeah.

1693
01:38:57,295 --> 01:39:01,547
He talked to his partner and he came
to me and I'm gonna be all right, Pop.

1694
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:03,879
He said it's just a question
of the amount.

1695
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,507
- Then you... Then you got it?
- It's gonna be terrific, Pop.

1696
01:39:07,632 --> 01:39:10,049
Aw, then you got it, haven't you?

1697
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,968
- You got it, haven't you? You got it!
- No.

1698
01:39:13,052 --> 01:39:15,634
I'm supposed to have lunch
with him tomorrow.

1699
01:39:15,635 --> 01:39:18,594
I'm telling you so you'll know
I can make an impression.

1700
01:39:18,678 --> 01:39:22,054
I'll make good somewheres,
but I can't go tomorrow.

1701
01:39:22,138 --> 01:39:24,263
- Why not? You simply...
- The pen, Pop.

1702
01:39:24,264 --> 01:39:27,014
You give him the pen,
tell him it was an oversight.

1703
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:28,557
- You have lunch.
- I can't.

1704
01:39:28,558 --> 01:39:31,306
You were doing a crossword puzzle,
you used his pen.

1705
01:39:31,307 --> 01:39:35,226
No, listen, kid,
I took those balls years ago, Pop,

1706
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:38,353
and now I walk in with this fountain pen
that clinches it.

1707
01:39:38,435 --> 01:39:41,562
Don't you understand? I can't face him.
I'll try elsewhere.

1708
01:39:41,645 --> 01:39:44,564
- Don't you want to be anything?
- How can I go back?

1709
01:39:44,647 --> 01:39:45,979
Pop!

1710
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,689
You don't want to be anything,
that what's behind it?

1711
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:52,316
Don't take it that way! You think
it was easy walking into that office?

1712
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:55,442
A team of horses couldn't
have dragged me to Oliver.

1713
01:39:55,526 --> 01:39:58,401
- Then why did you go?
- Why did I go?

1714
01:39:58,402 --> 01:40:02,236
Why did I go? Dad, look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

1715
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,196
- You're gonna go to that lunch.
- I can't. I've got no appointment.

1716
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,697
- Are you spiting me?
- Don't take it that way!

1717
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:11,574
You rotten little louse.
Are you spiting me?

1718
01:40:11,657 --> 01:40:15,117
Dad. I'm no good.
Can't you see what I am?

1719
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,284
You're in a restaurant.
Cut it out, both of you!

1720
01:40:18,368 --> 01:40:21,577
- Someone's at the door.
- Hello, girls. Sit down.

1721
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,869
Yes, we might as well.
This is Letta.

1722
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:26,705
- What do you drink?
- Letta might not be able to stay.

1723
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:30,954
I gotta get up very early
tomorrow. I've got jury duty.

1724
01:40:30,955 --> 01:40:34,040
I'm so excited.
Were you fellas ever on a jury?

1725
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:37,516
No, I've been in front of a jury.

1726
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:43,143
- This is my father.
- Isn't he cute. Sit down with us, Pops.

1727
01:40:43,269 --> 01:40:45,477
- Biff, sit him down.
- Come on, sit down.

1728
01:40:45,478 --> 01:40:48,937
- Drink us under the table.
- Willy, are you coming?

1729
01:40:49,021 --> 01:40:51,438
Willy, I'm waiting.

1730
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:53,647
- Where are you going?
- To open the door.

1731
01:40:53,648 --> 01:40:56,398
- What door?
- The washroom. Where is the door?

1732
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:59,333
Just go straight down.

1733
01:41:00,025 --> 01:41:03,443
Will you stop laughing. Stop. Shh.

1734
01:41:03,527 --> 01:41:06,193
Will you stop!

1735
01:41:06,194 --> 01:41:08,295
Shh!

1736
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,237
Will you stop!

1737
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:12,822
I think it's sweet you bring your daddy.

1738
01:41:12,823 --> 01:41:14,949
Oh, he isn't really your father.

1739
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:18,076
Miss Forsythe, you've just seen
a prince walk by.

1740
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:22,354
A fine troubled prince. A
hard-working, unappreciated prince.

1741
01:41:22,455 --> 01:41:24,956
A pal, do you understand,
a good companion.

1742
01:41:24,957 --> 01:41:27,808
Always for his boys.

1743
01:41:29,752 --> 01:41:32,921
- That's so sweet.
- Girls, we're wasting time here.

1744
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:35,589
What's the programme?
Biff, gather round now.

1745
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,382
Where would you like to go?

1746
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:40,027
- You do something for me?
- Me?

1747
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:43,929
- Don't you give a damn for him?
- What are you talking about?

1748
01:41:44,013 --> 01:41:46,763
- I'm the one...
- You don't give a damn about him.

1749
01:41:46,764 --> 01:41:49,867
Look what I found in the cellar, Hap.

1750
01:41:49,892 --> 01:41:53,563
- How can you bear to let that go on?
- Me? Who goes off? Who runs away?

1751
01:41:53,645 --> 01:41:56,982
He doesn't mean anything to you.
You could help him, I can't.

1752
01:41:57,065 --> 01:42:00,985
Don't you understand what he's gonna do?
He's gonna kill himself.

1753
01:42:01,068 --> 01:42:03,319
- Don't you know that?
- Don't yell at me.

1754
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,403
Hap, help him.

1755
01:42:05,404 --> 01:42:08,699
Help him!
Help me.

1756
01:42:08,823 --> 01:42:10,866
Help me!

1757
01:42:10,867 --> 01:42:14,093
I can't bear to look in his face.

1758
01:42:16,038 --> 01:42:17,747
Biff...

1759
01:42:17,748 --> 01:42:20,498
- Biff, where you going?
- What's he so mad about?

1760
01:42:20,499 --> 01:42:22,250
We're gonna catch up with him.

1761
01:42:22,251 --> 01:42:25,085
- I don't like that temper of his.
- He's overstrung.

1762
01:42:25,086 --> 01:42:28,379
- Do you want to tell your father?
- That's not my father, just a guy.

1763
01:42:28,464 --> 01:42:32,675
Come on, we're gonna catch up with Biff
and honey, we'll paint this town.

1764
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:36,220
I love those bedroom eyes.

1765
01:42:36,303 --> 01:42:41,766
- That's how I knew you were friends.
- Mr Loman! Mr Loman! Mr Loman!

1766
01:42:41,849 --> 01:42:44,852
Hey! Mr Loman!

1767
01:42:44,975 --> 01:42:47,144
- Willyl
- What?

1768
01:42:47,145 --> 01:42:49,353
Oh.

1769
01:42:49,354 --> 01:42:51,229
No.

1770
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:54,983
Willy, aren't you gonna answer the door?

1771
01:42:55,067 --> 01:42:57,126
Willy...

1772
01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:00,905
Willyl

1773
01:43:00,906 --> 01:43:04,006
- Arert you gonna answer the door?
- Sure.

1774
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:09,744
Oh.

1775
01:43:09,745 --> 01:43:14,073
Someone's at the door, Willy.
Are you gonna answer the door?

1776
01:43:14,457 --> 01:43:17,375
He's gonna wake up the whole hotell

1777
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,311
I'm not expecting anybody.

1778
01:43:21,711 --> 01:43:24,630
Why don't you have another drink, honey?

1779
01:43:24,714 --> 01:43:28,009
- Stop being so damn self-centred.
- I'm so Ionely.

1780
01:43:28,091 --> 01:43:31,752
You know you ruined me, Willy. From
now on, when you come to the office,

1781
01:43:31,854 --> 01:43:34,429
I'll see you
go right through the buyers.

1782
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:37,264
No waiting at my desk anymore.
Willy, you ruined me.

1783
01:43:37,265 --> 01:43:39,558
Oh, that's nice of you to say that.

1784
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:41,935
Oh, gee, you're self-centred.

1785
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:43,978
Why so sad?

1786
01:43:43,979 --> 01:43:47,524
You're the saddest, self-centredest soul
I ever did see-saw.

1787
01:43:47,649 --> 01:43:50,651
Oh, boy, huh? What?

1788
01:43:54,196 --> 01:43:56,672
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1789
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:01,299
Oh, to be dressing
in the middle of the night.

1790
01:44:04,953 --> 01:44:06,870
Arert you gonna answer the door?

1791
01:44:06,871 --> 01:44:09,790
They're knocking on the wrong door.

1792
01:44:09,873 --> 01:44:12,457
But they're knocking
and hear us talking.

1793
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:14,960
- Maybe the hotel's on fire.
- It's a mistake.

1794
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:17,586
- Tell them to go away.
- There's nobody there.

1795
01:44:17,587 --> 01:44:19,463
Willy!

1796
01:44:19,464 --> 01:44:24,009
There's somebody standing out there
and it's getting on my nerves.

1797
01:44:24,093 --> 01:44:27,263
All right. Stay in the bathroom
and don't come out.

1798
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,598
There's a law in Massachusetts,
so don't come out.

1799
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:34,685
It may be the new room clerk.
He looked mean. It's a mistake.

1800
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:37,853
There's no fire.

1801
01:44:37,936 --> 01:44:41,481
- Dad. Why didn't you answer?
- Biff.

1802
01:44:41,564 --> 01:44:44,483
- What are you doing in Boston?
- Why didn't you answer?

1803
01:44:44,608 --> 01:44:47,360
I was knocking for five minutes.
I called you.

1804
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:50,487
I just heard you. I was in the bathroom
and had the door shut.

1805
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:53,030
Did anything happen at home, huh?

1806
01:44:53,031 --> 01:44:55,615
- Dad, I let you down.
- Excuse me?

1807
01:44:55,616 --> 01:44:58,786
Biffo, what's this about?
Come on, let's go get you a malt.

1808
01:44:58,911 --> 01:45:01,746
Dad, I...

1809
01:45:01,831 --> 01:45:06,357
- I flunked math. - Not for the term? -
I haven't got enough credits to graduate.

1810
01:45:06,459 --> 01:45:10,462
- Bernard wouldn't give you the answers?
- He did. He tried. I only got a 61.

1811
01:45:10,544 --> 01:45:14,214
They wouldn't give you four points?
Birnbaum refused absolutely.

1812
01:45:14,298 --> 01:45:17,174
I begged him to give me those points
but he won't listen.

1813
01:45:17,258 --> 01:45:20,219
You gotta talk to him.
Dad, before they close the school.

1814
01:45:20,302 --> 01:45:24,096
'Cause if he saw the kind of man you are
and you talked to him in your way,

1815
01:45:24,222 --> 01:45:26,806
I'm sure he'd come through for me, Pop.

1816
01:45:26,807 --> 01:45:30,351
The class came right before practice,
so I didn't go enough.

1817
01:45:30,477 --> 01:45:33,645
Would you talk to him?
He'd like you, the way you can talk.

1818
01:45:33,729 --> 01:45:36,480
- I'm gonna drive right back.
- Dad, good work.

1819
01:45:36,481 --> 01:45:39,567
- I'm sure he'll change it.
- Tell the clerk I'm checking out.

1820
01:45:39,651 --> 01:45:42,401
Go right down.

1821
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:45,655
The reason he hates me
is one day he was late for class,

1822
01:45:45,738 --> 01:45:48,364
so I got up at the blackboard
and imitated him.

1823
01:45:48,365 --> 01:45:51,074
- Crossed my eyes, talked with a lisp.
- You did?

1824
01:45:51,075 --> 01:45:53,160
- Yeah.
- The kids like it?

1825
01:45:53,161 --> 01:45:56,329
- They nearly died laughing.
- Yeah, what did you do?

1826
01:45:56,413 --> 01:46:00,958
The square root of 63 is...

1827
01:46:01,042 --> 01:46:02,876
In the middle of it he walks in.

1828
01:46:02,877 --> 01:46:06,378
He walked in! All right.

1829
01:46:08,714 --> 01:46:11,131
- Is somebody in there?
- That was next door.

1830
01:46:11,132 --> 01:46:15,135
- Somebody got in your bathroom.
- In the next room there's a party.

1831
01:46:15,219 --> 01:46:17,969
Can I come in?

1832
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:21,389
There's something in the bathtub, Willy,
and it's moving.

1833
01:46:43,157 --> 01:46:46,326
Uh, you better go back to your room now.

1834
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:50,037
They must be finished painting by now.

1835
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:53,415
See, they're painting her room,
so I let her shower here.

1836
01:46:53,498 --> 01:46:55,749
- Go back.
- I gotta get dressed, Willy.

1837
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:59,336
You get out of here.
This is Miss Francis. She's a buyer.

1838
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:02,212
She lives down the hall
and they're painting her...

1839
01:47:02,213 --> 01:47:04,506
- Go back, go back!
- My clothes, Willy!

1840
01:47:04,507 --> 01:47:07,007
- I can't go naked.
- Will you get out of here.

1841
01:47:07,008 --> 01:47:09,885
Where's my stockings?
You promised me stockings.

1842
01:47:09,969 --> 01:47:13,347
- I have no stockings.
- You had 2 boxes of sheers. I want 'em.

1843
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:15,305
Yeah, here, here, here.

1844
01:47:15,306 --> 01:47:17,699
Here.

1845
01:47:18,017 --> 01:47:20,560
For God's sake, now get out of here.

1846
01:47:20,561 --> 01:47:24,145
I just hope there's nobody in the hall,
that's all I hope.

1847
01:47:28,858 --> 01:47:31,502
You, uh, football or baseball?

1848
01:47:32,528 --> 01:47:34,320
Football.

1849
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:36,796
That's me, too.

1850
01:47:37,031 --> 01:47:39,632
Good night.

1851
01:47:45,746 --> 01:47:47,913
Well, better get going.

1852
01:47:47,914 --> 01:47:50,832
I want to get to the school
first thing in the morning.

1853
01:47:50,917 --> 01:47:55,419
So, get my suits out of the closet
and I'll get my valise.

1854
01:48:00,382 --> 01:48:02,049
What's the matter?

1855
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:04,260
She's a buyer, Biff.
She buys for...

1856
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:07,053
She lives down the hall.

1857
01:48:07,054 --> 01:48:10,390
She buys for J.H. Simmons
and you know, they're painting...

1858
01:48:13,642 --> 01:48:16,660
Oh, now, you don't imagine that I...

1859
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:21,022
Now, look, pal, she's just a buyer!

1860
01:48:21,023 --> 01:48:25,277
She sees merchandise in her room and
they have to keep it looking just so.

1861
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,653
- Come on, now, get my suits.
- No.

1862
01:48:28,737 --> 01:48:33,324
You stop crying and do as I say.
I gave you an order, Biff.

1863
01:48:34,658 --> 01:48:37,427
Biff, I gave you an order.

1864
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,870
Is that what you do
when I give you an order?

1865
01:48:40,871 --> 01:48:43,013
Is it?

1866
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:46,057
Then how dare you cry!

1867
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,524
Oh, now.

1868
01:49:02,137 --> 01:49:05,682
Look, Biff, when you grow up
you'll understand about these things.

1869
01:49:05,765 --> 01:49:09,268
No, you mustrt overemphasise
a thing like this.

1870
01:49:09,351 --> 01:49:12,311
Come on, III see Birnbaum
first thing in the morning.

1871
01:49:12,437 --> 01:49:14,312
- Never mind.
- Never mind?

1872
01:49:14,313 --> 01:49:16,981
He's gonna give you those points.
I'll see to it.

1873
01:49:16,982 --> 01:49:19,525
- He won't listen to you.
- He certainly will!

1874
01:49:19,526 --> 01:49:21,359
You need those for the U of Virginia.

1875
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,762
- I'm not going there.
- What? - I'm not going there.

1876
01:49:24,863 --> 01:49:28,699
If I can't get him to change that mark
you'll make it up in summer school.

1877
01:49:28,782 --> 01:49:31,675
- You got all summer to...
- Dad.

1878
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:39,891
My... my boy.

1879
01:49:42,085 --> 01:49:46,755
She's nothing to me, Biff.
I was Ionely. I was terribly Ionely.

1880
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:49,172
Dad, you gave her Mama's stockings.

1881
01:49:49,173 --> 01:49:51,465
I gave you an order!

1882
01:49:51,466 --> 01:49:53,925
- I gave...
- Don't touch me, you liar!

1883
01:49:53,926 --> 01:49:56,887
- You apologise for that.
- You fake!

1884
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:59,931
I gave you an order!
I gave you an order!

1885
01:50:00,015 --> 01:50:03,142
- Now, you come back here.
- You phoney little fake.

1886
01:50:03,225 --> 01:50:04,892
- Come back here!
- You fake!

1887
01:50:04,893 --> 01:50:08,437
I gave you an order!
Come back or I'll beat you. I'II...

1888
01:50:08,521 --> 01:50:10,997
- Hey.
- I'll whip you.

1889
01:50:12,857 --> 01:50:14,524
I gave you...

1890
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,151
Pick it up, Mr Loman.

1891
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:18,987
Your boys just left with the chippies.

1892
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:21,988
They said they'd see you home.

1893
01:50:21,989 --> 01:50:24,490
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

1894
01:50:24,491 --> 01:50:27,751
- Can you make it?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, I'll make it.

1895
01:50:27,952 --> 01:50:30,929
- Mr Loman.
- OK.

1896
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:34,307
I'll make it.

1897
01:50:36,251 --> 01:50:40,812
- I look all right.
- Sure, you look all right.

1898
01:50:40,962 --> 01:50:43,881
Uh... Uh...

1899
01:50:44,757 --> 01:50:47,591
Here. Here. Here's a dollar.

1900
01:50:47,592 --> 01:50:50,469
- Your son paid. It's all right.
- You're a good boy.

1901
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:53,679
- You don't have to.
- Here's more. I don't need it anymore.

1902
01:50:53,764 --> 01:50:57,641
Tell me, is there a seed store
in the neighbourhood?

1903
01:50:57,724 --> 01:51:00,026
Seeds?

1904
01:51:00,394 --> 01:51:04,356
- You mean, like to plant?
- Yes, like carrots, peas.

1905
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:06,814
There's a hardware store
on Sixth Avenue.

1906
01:51:06,815 --> 01:51:09,733
- It may be too late now.
- I better hurry.

1907
01:51:09,817 --> 01:51:14,071
I gotta get some seeds.
Gotta get some seeds right away.

1908
01:51:14,296 --> 01:51:17,397
Well, what are you looking at?

1909
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,676
Nothing is planted right.

1910
01:51:22,677 --> 01:51:25,695
I don't have a thing
in the ground right now.

1911
01:51:48,072 --> 01:51:52,082
"Carrots.
Quarter inch apart,

1912
01:51:52,283 --> 01:51:55,051
one foot rows..."

1913
01:51:55,369 --> 01:51:57,594
One foot.

1914
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,097
Beets.

1915
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:04,400
Lettuce.
One foot.

1916
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,959
Oh, what a proposition.

1917
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,172
Terrific, terrific,
'cause she's suffered, man.

1918
01:52:10,297 --> 01:52:12,522
The woman has suffered.

1919
01:52:12,965 --> 01:52:15,091
A man can't go out the way he came in.

1920
01:52:15,092 --> 01:52:18,178
A man has got to add up to something.
You can't...

1921
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:20,512
You can't. You gotta consider now.

1922
01:52:20,513 --> 01:52:22,388
Don't answer so quick.

1923
01:52:22,389 --> 01:52:27,935
Remember, it's a guaranteed
$20,000 proposition, huh?

1924
01:52:27,976 --> 01:52:32,898
Now, look, Ben, I want you to go through
the ins and outs of this thing with me.

1925
01:52:33,022 --> 01:52:37,700
I got nobody to talk to. And the
woman has suffered, you hear me?

1926
01:52:37,901 --> 01:52:42,488
- What's the proposition? - It's $20,000
on the barrel head, guaranteed.

1927
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,279
Gilt edge, you understand?

1928
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,531
You don't want
to make a fool of yourself.

1929
01:52:46,532 --> 01:52:50,160
- They might not honour the policy.
- How can they refuse? I worked.

1930
01:52:50,244 --> 01:52:53,872
I met every premium on the nose
and now they don't pay off? Impossible.

1931
01:52:53,955 --> 01:52:55,788
It's called a cowardly thing.

1932
01:52:55,789 --> 01:52:59,876
Why does it take more guts to stand here
the rest of my life ringing up a zero?

1933
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,543
That's a point, William.

1934
01:53:01,544 --> 01:53:05,505
And 20,000. That is something
one can feel with their hands.

1935
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:08,006
That's the whole beauty of it, Ben.

1936
01:53:08,007 --> 01:53:10,968
I see it like a diamond
shining in the dark

1937
01:53:11,052 --> 01:53:13,802
that I can pick up and touch in my hand.

1938
01:53:13,803 --> 01:53:17,348
Not like an appointment.

1939
01:53:17,473 --> 01:53:21,434
This would not be another appointment
and it changes all the aspects.

1940
01:53:21,559 --> 01:53:24,686
Because he thinks I'm nothing,
so he spites me.

1941
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:29,815
But the funeral.
Oh, Ben, that funeral will be massive!

1942
01:53:29,898 --> 01:53:33,359
Oh, they'll come
from Maine, Massachusetts,

1943
01:53:33,443 --> 01:53:36,462
Vermont, New Hampshire.

1944
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:40,699
All the old-timers
with the strange licence plates.

1945
01:53:40,781 --> 01:53:43,117
That boy will be thunderstruck, Ben,

1946
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,036
because he never realised I am known.

1947
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,664
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
I am known, Ben!

1948
01:53:49,748 --> 01:53:52,456
He'll see it with his eyes!

1949
01:53:52,457 --> 01:53:55,794
Once and for all,
he'll see what I am, oh!

1950
01:53:57,044 --> 01:53:59,395
He's in for a shock, that boy.

1951
01:53:59,671 --> 01:54:03,007
He'll call you a coward, William.

1952
01:54:04,383 --> 01:54:07,010
Oh, no, no, that would be terrible.

1953
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:11,063
- Yes, and a damn fool.
- No, no!

1954
01:54:11,264 --> 01:54:13,989
He'll hate you, William.

1955
01:54:14,308 --> 01:54:17,491
He mustn't. Oh, I won't have that.

1956
01:54:41,495 --> 01:54:44,095
Mom, what are you doing up?

1957
01:54:45,247 --> 01:54:48,057
Where's Pop? Is he sleeping?

1958
01:54:50,335 --> 01:54:53,210
- Where were you?
- We met two girls, very fine types.

1959
01:54:53,211 --> 01:54:56,005
We brought you some flowers.
Put 'em in your room.

1960
01:54:56,006 --> 01:54:58,799
What did you do that for?
I want you to have flowers.

1961
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,718
Don't you care whether he lives or dies?

1962
01:55:01,719 --> 01:55:04,362
- Biff, let's go up.
- Go away from me.

1963
01:55:05,472 --> 01:55:09,058
What do you mean, lives or dies?
Nobody's dying around here, pal.

1964
01:55:09,141 --> 01:55:12,561
Get out of here!
Get out of my sight!

1965
01:55:12,644 --> 01:55:14,477
I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1966
01:55:14,478 --> 01:55:17,329
- You're not going near him.
- Where is he?

1967
01:55:17,981 --> 01:55:21,067
You invite him for dinner,
he looks forward to it all day.

1968
01:55:21,151 --> 01:55:24,069
- And then you desert him there?
- Dad?

1969
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:26,445
There's no stranger you'd do that to.

1970
01:55:26,446 --> 01:55:29,656
He had a swell time with us.
When I desert him I hope I do it...

1971
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:32,466
- Get out of here!
- Ma!

1972
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:38,037
- Mom?
- Did you have to go to women tonight?

1973
01:55:38,038 --> 01:55:41,123
You and your rotten, lousy whores!

1974
01:55:41,208 --> 01:55:44,793
Mom, all we did was follow Biff around
trying to cheer him up.

1975
01:55:44,876 --> 01:55:47,669
- Boy, what a night you gave me.
- Get out of here.

1976
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:50,880
Both of you, and don't come back.
I don't want you tormenting him anymore.

1977
01:55:50,964 --> 01:55:54,676
- Dad, are you down there?
- You can sleep in his apartment.

1978
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:02,348
And pick up this stuff!
I'm not your maid anymore.

1979
01:56:02,473 --> 01:56:05,351
Go on, pick it up, you bum, you!

1980
01:56:05,475 --> 01:56:07,643
You're a pair of animals.

1981
01:56:07,644 --> 01:56:11,063
There's not one, not a living soul,
who would have the cruelty

1982
01:56:11,146 --> 01:56:13,939
to walk out on that man
in a restaurant.

1983
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:16,942
- Is that what he said?
- He didn't have to say anything.

1984
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:21,195
He was so humiliated,
he nearly limped when he came in.

1985
01:56:21,278 --> 01:56:24,423
- Look, Mom, he had a great time.
- Shut up!

1986
01:56:27,659 --> 01:56:31,954
You! Didn't even go to
see if he was all right.

1987
01:56:31,955 --> 01:56:35,706
No, Mom, I didn't. I didn't do
a damn thing. How do you like that?

1988
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:38,682
I left him babbling in a toilet.

1989
01:56:38,835 --> 01:56:42,420
- You louse, you.
- You hit it on the nose.

1990
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:45,045
The scum of the earth.
You're looking at him.

1991
01:56:45,046 --> 01:56:48,799
- Get out of here.
- I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

1992
01:56:48,883 --> 01:56:50,926
You're not going near him. Get out.

1993
01:56:50,927 --> 01:56:53,804
We're gonna have
an abrupt conversation, him and me.

1994
01:56:53,887 --> 01:56:57,156
You're not talking to him.

1995
01:57:06,897 --> 01:57:10,108
Please, leave him alone.

1996
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:13,167
What is he doing out there?

1997
01:57:14,735 --> 01:57:17,822
He's planting the garden.

1998
01:57:18,822 --> 01:57:20,631
Now?

1999
01:57:22,241 --> 01:57:24,284
Oh, my god.

2000
01:57:24,285 --> 01:57:28,788
Never even let me carry
the valises in the house.

2001
01:57:28,913 --> 01:57:32,125
And simonising, simonising...

2002
01:57:32,791 --> 01:57:35,042
...that little red car.

2003
01:57:35,043 --> 01:57:37,186
Why?

2004
01:57:37,878 --> 01:57:42,965
Why can't I give him something
and not have him hate me, huh?

2005
01:57:43,049 --> 01:57:45,968
Let me think about it.
I still have a little time.

2006
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:48,511
A remarkable proposition.

2007
01:57:48,512 --> 01:57:49,886
Oh.

2008
01:57:49,887 --> 01:57:52,848
You gotta be sure
you're not making a fool of yourself.

2009
01:57:52,931 --> 01:57:55,158
Dad?

2010
01:58:01,605 --> 01:58:04,858
Where is that seed?
You can't see nothing here, boxed in.

2011
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:06,941
Dad, there are people all around.

2012
01:58:06,942 --> 01:58:09,669
- Don't you realise?
- Don't bother me.

2013
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:19,785
- I'm saying good-bye to you, Pop.
- Huh?

2014
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:22,370
I'm not coming back anymore.

2015
01:58:22,371 --> 01:58:25,790
- You're not gonna see Oliver?
- Dad, I've got no appointment.

2016
01:58:25,874 --> 01:58:28,458
- He put his arm around you.
- Dad, get this now.

2017
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:31,544
Every time I've left
it's been a fight that's sent me out.

2018
01:58:31,627 --> 01:58:36,489
Today I realise something about
myself. I tried to explain it to you.

2019
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:40,886
I think I'm just not smart enough
to make sense out of it for you.

2020
01:58:41,011 --> 01:58:43,929
To hell with whose fault it is
or anything like that.

2021
01:58:45,347 --> 01:58:47,597
Let's just wrap it up.

2022
01:58:47,598 --> 01:58:50,391
- Come in and we'll tell Mom.
- I don't want to see her.

2023
01:58:50,392 --> 01:58:52,225
- Come on.
- I don't want to see her.

2024
01:58:52,226 --> 01:58:54,770
Don't bother me, will ya?

2025
01:58:54,771 --> 01:58:57,396
Dad, what do you mean?
You don't want to see her?

2026
01:58:57,397 --> 01:59:01,026
Pop, you don't want them
calling you yellow, do you?

2027
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:05,235
Dad, it's not your fault.
It's me. I'm a bum.

2028
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,796
Now, come on inside.

2029
01:59:08,531 --> 01:59:11,883
Dad, did you hear what I said to you?

2030
01:59:18,371 --> 01:59:20,640
Did you plant, dear?

2031
01:59:22,083 --> 01:59:24,685
All right, Mom.

2032
01:59:25,835 --> 01:59:29,089
We had it out.
I'm going and I'm not writing anymore.

2033
01:59:29,172 --> 01:59:31,131
I think it's best, Willy.

2034
01:59:31,132 --> 01:59:34,218
There's no use drawing it out.
You two will never get along.

2035
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,261
If people ask where I am,
what I'm doing, you don't know or care.

2036
01:59:37,345 --> 01:59:41,473
That way it'll be off your mind
and you can start brightening up again.

2037
01:59:41,555 --> 01:59:44,116
All right?

2038
01:59:49,853 --> 01:59:52,664
That... That clears it, then, huh?

2039
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:12,704
- You gonna wish me luck, scout?
- Shake his hand, Willy.

2040
02:00:12,788 --> 02:00:15,038
What do you say?

2041
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,459
There's no necessity to mention...
He put his arm...!

2042
02:00:18,542 --> 02:00:22,254
Dad, you're never gonna see what I am,
so what's the use of arguing?

2043
02:00:22,338 --> 02:00:25,799
If I strike oil I'll send you a cheque.
Meantime, forget I'm alive.

2044
02:00:25,881 --> 02:00:27,882
Spite, see?

2045
02:00:27,883 --> 02:00:31,192
- Shake hands, Dad.
- Not my hand.

2046
02:00:35,848 --> 02:00:37,907
Dad?

2047
02:00:38,307 --> 02:00:42,304
- I was hoping not to go this way.
- This is the way you're going. Bye.

2048
02:00:46,088 --> 02:00:49,959
May you rot in hell
if you leave this house!

2049
02:00:50,044 --> 02:00:52,692
Exactly what is it
that you want from me?

2050
02:00:52,693 --> 02:00:56,562
I want you to know on the train,
in the mountains, in the valleys,

2051
02:00:56,647 --> 02:01:00,181
wherever you go,
that you cut down your life for spite!

2052
02:01:00,264 --> 02:01:03,435
- No, no!
- Spite!

2053
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:12,421
When you are rotting somewhere
beside a railroad track, remember.

2054
02:01:12,505 --> 02:01:15,363
- Don't you blame it on me.
- I'm not blaming you.

2055
02:01:15,364 --> 02:01:17,931
I'm not taking the rap for this, hear?

2056
02:01:17,932 --> 02:01:21,043
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You're putting a knife in me.

2057
02:01:21,127 --> 02:01:23,903
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

2058
02:01:23,904 --> 02:01:26,637
All right, phoney.
Leave it there. Don't move it.

2059
02:01:26,638 --> 02:01:28,867
- What is that?
- You know damn well.

2060
02:01:28,868 --> 02:01:31,222
- I never saw that.
- You saw it, all right.

2061
02:01:31,223 --> 02:01:35,051
Mice didn't bring it into the cellar.
Is that supposed to make you a hero?

2062
02:01:35,135 --> 02:01:38,626
That supposed to make me sorry for you?
There will be no pity for you.

2063
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:40,727
- Hear that? No pity.
- Hear the spite?

2064
02:01:40,728 --> 02:01:43,336
You're gonna get the truth,
what you are, what I am.

2065
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,060
- Spite!
- Cut it out!

2066
02:01:45,061 --> 02:01:48,048
The man don't know who we are.
The man is gonna know.

2067
02:01:48,932 --> 02:01:51,876
We never told the truth
for ten minutes in this house.

2068
02:01:51,961 --> 02:01:54,861
- We always told truth.
- Are you the assistant buyer?

2069
02:01:54,862 --> 02:01:57,594
You're one of
the two assistants to the assistant.

2070
02:01:57,595 --> 02:02:00,288
- I'm practically...
- You are practically full of it.

2071
02:01:59,789 --> 02:02:02,102
- We all are. I'm through with it.
- Yeah.

2072
02:02:02,103 --> 02:02:05,063
- Hear this, Willy. This is me.
- I know you.

2073
02:02:05,299 --> 02:02:08,200
Do you know why I had no
address for three months?

2074
02:02:08,201 --> 02:02:10,933
I stole a suit in Kansas City
and I was in gaol.

2075
02:02:10,934 --> 02:02:14,301
- I suppose it's my fault.
- Stop crying, I'm through with it!

2076
02:02:14,385 --> 02:02:17,539
I stole myself
out of every good job since high school.

2077
02:02:17,623 --> 02:02:19,052
Whose fault is that?

2078
02:02:19,053 --> 02:02:22,419
I could never get anywhere
'cause you blew me so full of hot air

2079
02:02:22,545 --> 02:02:25,404
that I could never stand
taking orders from anybody.

2080
02:02:25,405 --> 02:02:27,718
- I hear that.
- Stop it!

2081
02:02:27,719 --> 02:02:30,579
I had to be boss big shot
in two weeks and I'm through.

2082
02:02:30,663 --> 02:02:33,102
- Then hang yourself for spite!
- No! No!

2083
02:02:33,103 --> 02:02:36,930
No, nobody is hanging himself, Willy.

2084
02:02:40,085 --> 02:02:44,670
I ran down 11 flights with a pen
in my hand today.

2085
02:02:44,754 --> 02:02:47,109
And suddenly I stopped.
Do you hear me?

2086
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:50,474
In the middle of that office building...
Do you hear this?

2087
02:02:50,559 --> 02:02:52,704
I stopped...

2088
02:02:52,705 --> 02:02:56,784
...in the middle of the building
and I saw the sky!

2089
02:02:56,868 --> 02:03:02,800
And I... I... I saw the things
that I love in this world.

2090
02:03:02,926 --> 02:03:06,400
The work and the food

2091
02:03:06,586 --> 02:03:09,446
and the time to sit and smoke.

2092
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:13,904
I looked at that pen in my hand and
I said, "What am I grabbing this for?

2093
02:03:13,988 --> 02:03:16,721
Why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

2094
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:18,404
What am I doing in an office?

2095
02:03:18,405 --> 02:03:21,561
Making a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,

2096
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:24,420
when all that I want
is out there waiting for me?"

2097
02:03:24,421 --> 02:03:27,785
The minute I say it, I know who I am.
Why can't I say that, Willy?

2098
02:03:27,869 --> 02:03:29,886
The door to your life is wide open!

2099
02:03:29,887 --> 02:03:32,410
Pop, I am a dime a dozen and so are you.

2100
02:03:32,411 --> 02:03:35,061
I am not a dime a dozen!

2101
02:03:35,062 --> 02:03:38,048
I am Willy Loman and you are Biff Loman!

2102
02:03:38,133 --> 02:03:41,968
I am not the leader of men, Willy!
And neither are you!

2103
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:45,662
You were never anything
but a hard-working drummer

2104
02:03:45,788 --> 02:03:48,647
who landed in the ashcan
like all the rest of them.

2105
02:03:48,648 --> 02:03:51,298
I am one dollar an hour, Willy!

2106
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:55,042
I am not bringing home
any prizes anymore,

2107
02:03:55,126 --> 02:03:57,312
and you're gonna stop waiting for me!

2108
02:03:57,313 --> 02:04:01,184
- You vengeful, spiteful mutt!
- Yeah, Pop!

2109
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:04,254
Pop, I'm nothing.

2110
02:04:04,338 --> 02:04:07,450
I'm nothing, Pop.
Can't you understand that?

2111
02:04:07,536 --> 02:04:09,890
There's no spite in it anymore.

2112
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:12,809
I'm just what I am, that's all.

2113
02:04:14,476 --> 02:04:17,840
What are you doing?
Aw, what are you doing?

2114
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:26,001
- Why is he crying?
- Dad...

2115
02:04:27,221 --> 02:04:29,970
Will you let me go, for God's sake?

2116
02:04:30,922 --> 02:04:36,305
Will you take that phoney dream
and burn it before something happens?

2117
02:05:14,515 --> 02:05:17,433
I'll go in the morning.

2118
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,490
Put him to bed.

2119
02:05:30,624 --> 02:05:34,704
Isn't that...
Isn't that remarkable?

2120
02:05:35,797 --> 02:05:38,658
Biff, he...

2121
02:05:40,298 --> 02:05:43,217
He likes me.

2122
02:05:43,496 --> 02:05:47,197
- He loves you, Willy.
- Always did, Pop.

2123
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:49,972
Aw, Biff, he...

2124
02:05:49,973 --> 02:05:52,766
He cried. He cried to me.

2125
02:05:53,212 --> 02:05:56,872
Aw, that boy.
That boy, he's going to be magnificent.

2126
02:05:58,007 --> 02:06:00,825
Yes, outstanding,
with 20,000 behind him.

2127
02:06:00,826 --> 02:06:03,391
Come to bed, Willy.
It's all settled now.

2128
02:06:03,392 --> 02:06:06,841
Oh, yes, we'll sleep.
Come on, let's go to sleep.

2129
02:06:06,966 --> 02:06:09,574
It takes a great man
to crack thejungle.

2130
02:06:09,575 --> 02:06:12,940
I'm getting married.
Don't forget. I'm changing everything.

2131
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:16,011
I'm gonna run that department
before the year is up.

2132
02:06:16,095 --> 02:06:18,702
Thejungle is dark
but full of diamonds.

2133
02:06:18,703 --> 02:06:22,236
Be good. You're both good boys.
Just act that way, that's all.

2134
02:06:23,751 --> 02:06:26,282
- Night, Pop.
- Night, boy.

2135
02:06:27,157 --> 02:06:30,730
- Come, dear. -S hh. One must
go in to fetch a diamond out.

2136
02:06:30,731 --> 02:06:33,466
I just want to get settled down
for a little while.

2137
02:06:33,467 --> 02:06:36,622
- I want you upstairs.
- A few minutes. I couldn't sleep now.

2138
02:06:36,748 --> 02:06:39,650
- Go. You look awful tired.
- Not like an appointment.

2139
02:06:39,734 --> 02:06:42,805
- A diamond is rough and hard to touch.
- I'll be right up.

2140
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:45,791
- I think it's the only way.
- Sure, it's the best thing.

2141
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:50,781
Best thing. The only way.
Everything is gonna be...

2142
02:06:50,965 --> 02:06:53,967
Aw, go on, kid. Get to bed.

2143
02:06:54,953 --> 02:06:59,454
- You look so tired. - Now, you
come right up. - Two minutes.

2144
02:07:08,076 --> 02:07:11,189
Loves me. Always loved me.
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

2145
02:07:11,273 --> 02:07:15,647
- Ben, he'll worship me for it.
- It's dark there.

2146
02:07:15,732 --> 02:07:17,539
But full of diamonds, Willy.

2147
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:21,368
Can you imagine that magnificence
with $20,000 in his pocket?

2148
02:07:21,452 --> 02:07:23,596
Willy, come up.

2149
02:07:23,597 --> 02:07:26,373
Yes, yes, coming, coming!

2150
02:07:26,474 --> 02:07:29,460
It's very smart,
you realise, don't you, sweetheart?

2151
02:07:29,546 --> 02:07:31,353
Even Ben sees it.

2152
02:07:31,354 --> 02:07:33,895
I gotta go, baby.

2153
02:07:37,578 --> 02:07:39,783
Bye-bye.

2154
02:07:40,397 --> 02:07:43,259
When the mail comes
he'll be ahead of Bernard again.

2155
02:07:43,341 --> 02:07:47,926
- A perfect proposition all around.
- Did you see how he cried to me?

2156
02:07:47,927 --> 02:07:51,989
- Aw, I could kiss him, Ben.
- Time, William, time.

2157
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:56,213
Ben, I always knew one way or another
we were gonna make it, Biff and I.

2158
02:07:56,297 --> 02:07:59,620
Boat! We'll be late.

2159
02:08:01,093 --> 02:08:06,393
Now, when you kick off,
I want a 70 yard boot.

2160
02:08:06,477 --> 02:08:10,052
And get right down the field
under the ball.

2161
02:08:10,136 --> 02:08:13,502
And when you hit,
hit low and hit hard,

2162
02:08:13,627 --> 02:08:16,023
because it's important, boy.

2163
02:08:16,024 --> 02:08:20,189
There's all kinds of
important people in the stands.

2164
02:08:21,072 --> 02:08:23,822
The first thing that you know...

2165
02:08:24,186 --> 02:08:25,699
Willy?

2166
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:28,577
- Ben? Ben, where do I...?
- Willy?

2167
02:08:28,659 --> 02:08:32,689
- Ben! Ben!
- Willy!

2168
02:08:33,756 --> 02:08:35,441
Shh. Shh.

2169
02:08:35,442 --> 02:08:38,156
Shh! Shh!

2170
02:08:38,157 --> 02:08:41,173
- Willy, please come up.
- Oh.

2171
02:08:43,089 --> 02:08:45,283
- Willy!
- Shh!

2172
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:51,697
Willy?

2173
02:08:54,189 --> 02:08:57,641
- Pop?
- Willy, answer me!

2174
02:08:57,642 --> 02:09:00,905
Willy!

2175
02:09:02,345 --> 02:09:06,209
- Willy!
- Pop! No!

2176
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,720
- No!
- No!

2177
02:09:13,651 --> 02:09:17,762
It's getting dark, Linda.

2178
02:09:19,282 --> 02:09:23,517
How about it, Ma? Better get
some rest. They'll be closing the gates.

2179
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:26,642
He had no right to do that.
There was no necessity.

2180
02:09:26,723 --> 02:09:29,601
- We would have helped him.
- Come on.

2181
02:09:29,683 --> 02:09:33,833
- Why didn't anybody come?
- It was a very nice funeral.

2182
02:09:33,834 --> 02:09:37,000
Where were the people he knew?
Maybe they blame him.

2183
02:09:37,082 --> 02:09:40,413
It's a rough world, Linda.
They wouldn't blame him.

2184
02:09:40,495 --> 02:09:45,420
I can't understand it.
First time in just about 35 years

2185
02:09:45,798 --> 02:09:49,292
we were almost free and clear.

2186
02:09:50,525 --> 02:09:53,666
He only needed a little salary.

2187
02:09:53,731 --> 02:09:56,651
He was even finished with the dentist.

2188
02:09:56,733 --> 02:09:59,694
No man only needs a little salary.

2189
02:10:01,255 --> 02:10:03,187
I can't understand it.

2190
02:10:03,188 --> 02:10:08,573
There were a lot of nice days when he'd
come home from a trip or on Sundays,

2191
02:10:08,654 --> 02:10:11,985
making the stoop,
finishing the cellar

2192
02:10:12,066 --> 02:10:16,178
when he built the extra bathroom
and put up the garage.

2193
02:10:17,575 --> 02:10:21,111
You know, Charley, I think there was
more of him in that front stoop

2194
02:10:21,193 --> 02:10:23,495
than in all the sales he ever made.

2195
02:10:23,496 --> 02:10:27,730
Yep. He was a happy man
with a bunch of cement.

2196
02:10:27,811 --> 02:10:30,607
He was wonderful with his hands.

2197
02:10:30,608 --> 02:10:33,814
He had the wrong dreams.
AII, all wrong.

2198
02:10:33,897 --> 02:10:37,110
Don't say that.
The man didn't know who he was.

2199
02:10:37,309 --> 02:10:40,145
Nobody dast blame this man.

2200
02:10:40,146 --> 02:10:42,503
You don't understand.

2201
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:45,794
Willy was a salesman.

2202
02:10:46,353 --> 02:10:49,149
For a salesman,
there is no rock bottom to the life.

2203
02:10:49,230 --> 02:10:51,078
He don't put a bolt to a nut,

2204
02:10:51,079 --> 02:10:53,833
he don't tell you the law,
don't give you medicine.

2205
02:10:53,834 --> 02:10:56,631
He's a man way out there in the blue,

2206
02:10:57,905 --> 02:11:00,715
riding on a smile and a shoeshine.

2207
02:11:01,194 --> 02:11:05,804
When they start not smiling back,
that's an earthquake.

2208
02:11:06,002 --> 02:11:09,703
You get yourself a couple of spots
on your hat and you're finished.

2209
02:11:11,471 --> 02:11:14,487
Nobody dast blame this man.

2210
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:18,319
A salesman has got to dream, boy.
Comes with the territory.

2211
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:22,363
- The man didn't know who he was.
- Don't say that!

2212
02:11:22,364 --> 02:11:25,341
Why don't you come with me, Happy?

2213
02:11:25,942 --> 02:11:28,383
I'm not licked that easily.

2214
02:11:28,737 --> 02:11:31,943
I'm staying right in the city
and I'm gonna beat this racquet.

2215
02:11:33,669 --> 02:11:36,300
- Loman brothers.
- I know who I am, kid.

2216
02:11:36,301 --> 02:11:39,013
All right, boy,
I'm gonna show you and everybody

2217
02:11:39,014 --> 02:11:42,426
that Willy Loman did not die in vain.
He had a good dream.

2218
02:11:42,508 --> 02:11:45,756
It's the only dream you can have,
to come out number one man.

2219
02:11:45,839 --> 02:11:49,463
He fought it out here and this is where
I'm gonna win it for him.

2220
02:11:51,964 --> 02:11:54,651
Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute.

2221
02:11:54,965 --> 02:11:57,685
You go on, Charley.

2222
02:11:57,966 --> 02:12:00,571
Just... just a minute.

2223
02:12:04,873 --> 02:12:08,095
I never had a chance to say good-bye.

2224
02:12:17,165 --> 02:12:19,785
Help me, Willy.

2225
02:12:20,001 --> 02:12:22,442
I can't cry.

2226
02:12:23,043 --> 02:12:27,894
Seems to me you're just away on
another trip and I keep expecting you.

2227
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:32,892
Why did you do it?

2228
02:12:34,267 --> 02:12:37,103
I search and I search,

2229
02:12:38,213 --> 02:12:41,007
and I search,

2230
02:12:42,323 --> 02:12:47,215
and I can't understand it, Willy.

2231
02:12:50,381 --> 02:12:53,932
I made the last payment
on the house today.

2232
02:12:55,437 --> 02:12:57,796
Today!

2233
02:13:04,935 --> 02:13:08,124
And there'll be nobody home.

2234
02:13:10,237 --> 02:13:13,483
We're free and clear.

2235
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:19,905
We're free.

2236
02:13:20,679 --> 02:13:23,161
We're free.

2237
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:30,479
We're free.

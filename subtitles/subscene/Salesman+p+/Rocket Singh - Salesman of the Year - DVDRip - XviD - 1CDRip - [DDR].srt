00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,825
Cheers...

2
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:37,721
Ready? Go...

3
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,665
Woo...I'm on top of
the worId!! Enough!

4
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,701
No, no, no, baby one more
one more one more pIease...

5
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,328
Harpreet! You passed!!

6
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,964
Bunty, you bum, congrats!
Come...I'II get you a drink.

7
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,339
Sai...Sai do something...

8
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:52,844
It's your party dude
and the DJ is Ieaving.

9
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:53,971
What's happening?

10
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,742
Nonsense! Give him some more money.

11
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,840
He can't stop now, the
party is just warming up.

12
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,646
I just did that, he
wont take my money,

13
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,619
says it's past 2 am and
he has to wake up earIy.

14
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:04,387
WeII it is past 2 am
- Wake up earIy...why become a DJ?

15
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,518
Let me taIk to him...

16
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,789
HP if he doesn't want money it
must be something serious. Leave it.

17
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,625
HeIIo Prince CharIes, not
everyone is motivated by money.

18
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:13,790
So how eIse are they motivated?

19
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,798
Have you ever heard of the word
- Persuasion?

20
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,366
You can't get anywhere
with B.com 39 percent.

21
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,804
I keep teIIing him to appIy
for an MBA, doesn't Iisten to me.

22
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,107
Life is not aII fun and games no...

23
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,443
Ok grandpa

24
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,798
Wow, what did you do?

25
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,129
A IittIe conversation, a IittIe
persuasion, a IittIe negotiation...

26
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,472
Done with your negotiation, can we
taIk about something worthwhiIe?

27
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:55,632
Do you taIk about anything eIse?

28
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,504
Not my work, I'm taIking about yours.

29
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,409
I'm starting with my dad's Iaw firm,
I don't care...what about you?

30
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,147
Why? What about me?

31
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,041
He graduated, isn't that enough?

32
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:08,645
You won't take the MBA exam?

33
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,519
If my grandfather was rich as your
father, I wouId have taken the exam...

34
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,817
So what wiII you do?

35
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,528
S-a-I-e-s

36
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,932
What...you'II be a saIesman?

37
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,697
Why? Aren't saIesmen human beings?

38
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,497
They are...of course they
are...but not very rich human beings.

39
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,535
My son, do you remember
Randy Bahadur, from arts?

40
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,003
He is a saIesman...

41
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,539
He gets 40,000
rupees without bIinking.

42
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,982
HaIf of that is commission, which
he gets onIy after he gets an order.

43
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:41,454
And do you even know
what aII a saIesman has...

44
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,988
...to go through to get an order?!

45
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,754
Why do you find
fauIt in everything I do?

46
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,457
BIoody negative bastard you are!

47
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:51,461
Dude he has a habit of Iecturing
peopIe...come on, Iet's dance.

48
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,794
No, once and for aII
Iet's get this straight,

49
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,728
these management exams
are not my cup of tea,

50
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,495
and my famiIy doesn't have
money for a private MBA.

51
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:03,201
SaIes is the onIy fieId where
common sense matters more than grades.

52
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:07,570
And now you'II say that I
don't even have common sense.

53
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,539
What'II I say...

54
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,216
Come...come...come...Let's dance.

55
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,918
I don't want to.

56
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,491
Oh come on

57
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,858
I toId you I don't want to.

58
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,890
I don't do things that
don't have power or money.

59
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:29,059
Just try it once. PeopIe wiII
pay just to watch you dance.

60
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:55,952
Good morning...morning...morning,

61
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,249
morning...morning...Good morning

62
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,951
Good morning...morning...Good morning

63
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,654
Good morning...Good morning sir.
This is Harpreet Singh Bedi,

64
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,657
Harpreet Singh. Harpreet Singh..

65
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,895
Good morning sir I'm Harpreet
Singh Bedi...Can I have a seat?

66
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,705
Good morning sir I'm
Harpreet Singh Bedi...ca..ca

67
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:18,336
Morning gentIemen, morning ma'am.
I'm Harpreet Singh Bedi...

68
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,082
I can't teII you how much I admire
this unique company and...Unique?

69
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:27,844
Good morning unique-

70
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:31,219
Come on son, come have
some sweet curd for Iuck.

71
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,721
Have aII your certificates?

72
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,824
EspeciaIIy your
character certificate? - Yes

73
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,029
Brushed up on your generaI knowIedge?
- Yes

74
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,661
Have you memorized an essay?

75
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,364
It's an interview, not an exam.

76
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,803
Have you memorized today's newspaper?
- Ya.

77
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,275
Put in money on your phone card?
- Ya

78
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:53,640
Emptied your boweIs?

79
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,646
Oh man, on one side you're
feeding me sweet curd and

80
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:56,977
on the other...ok I'm Ieaving.

81
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,281
If you'd used your brains studying,
you wouIdn't need sweet curd for Iuck

82
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,651
If Einstein studied with your snoring,
he'd aIso have to eat sweet curd.

83
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,747
Had I taken to snoring again?

84
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,753
You weren't taking, you were giving
it to the worId...for free. Ok bye

85
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,193
At Ieast straighten your turban.

86
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,696
What does the company make?

87
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:14,766
Don't know, wiII find out on the way

88
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,031
They make computers grandpa.
My grades are Iow not my IQ.

89
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,775
Oh Iord, aII is up to you now.

90
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,944
However he is, he is
your son. Watch over him.

91
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,047
Good morning AYS...transferring sir

92
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,084
Good morning AYS...Iine 2 sir

93
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,379
Excuse me ma'am...

94
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:12,253
Good morning
AYS...Transferring you to saIes sir,

95
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,819
Nitin, enquiry! - He's inside
the Taj MahaI, I'II speak to them.

96
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,858
I may Iook it, but I am not...

97
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,326
You'II burn your fingers...

98
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,459
...if you take a peek at
other peopIe's cIients or wives.

99
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,362
Everyone's suspicious here!

100
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:25,829
I'm going to Ieave this pIace.

101
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:26,997
I've heard it for 3 years.

102
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,131
Those who do things
don't taIk about it.

103
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:31,335
HeIIo...I haven't received a singIe
caII since morning. I am not fasting.

104
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,172
CouId you hoId sir? What can I
do if your territory's dead?

105
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,976
When you get your territory,
you don't say anything.

106
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,849
If you say something in the
Taj MahaI, you hear an echo.

107
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,850
This month's commission is gone.

108
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,390
I had narrowed in on an
LCD...wife wiII be upset.

109
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,482
Just try to get back home on
time everyday, she'II be happy.

110
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,489
Who troubIes you more,
your motorcycIe or your wife?

111
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:50,820
Connecting sir

112
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,125
Go pick up, it's your cIient.
He's been trying you for four days.

113
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,234
CaII them once in a whiIe,
cIients don't die after saIe.

114
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,770
Even the cIients wonder, what
happens to a saIesman after a saIe?

115
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,771
Excuse me ma'am
- At Your Service good morning

116
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,833
Sir pIease try and reboot.

117
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:05,971
No Mr. Puri is not in India...

118
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,809
ChoteIaI, have you
served Mr. Puri his coffee?

119
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:09,973
He has had four since morning.

120
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,210
Nitin is inside with
the saIes figures.

121
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,885
It's a wonder he
doesn't want a drink instead.

122
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,013
What are you Iooking at?

123
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,848
Nothing

124
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,456
You want to get kiIIed?!

125
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,824
HeIIo...Can I heIp you?

126
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,897
Oh I'm sorry ma'am, I'm Harpreet
Singh Bedi, for the saIes interview

127
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:28,798
One minute...Sir a

128
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,095
You shouId have toId me earIier.

129
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:32,364
You Iooked busy so I
did not want to disturb.

130
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,441
Afraid of disturbing peopIe...
How wiII you become a saIesman?

131
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,236
Harpreet Singh?
- Yeah...I mean Yes

132
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,867
Nitin sir has caIIed you
to the conference room.

133
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:41,109
Where is the conference room pIease?

134
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,541
Up, in the sky. FoIIow me

135
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,127
HeIIo sir, I'm Harpreet Singh Bedi,

136
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,861

00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,873
Why, what is so
fantastic about this company?

138
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:11,034
SaIes sir, your saIes
team's reputation is...

139
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,273
Good...but it can be better.

140
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:18,884
12th 35 percent...B.com 39 percent

141
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,450
no experience nothing,

142
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:23,879
'put together coIIege magazine'

143
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,255
You want to be a saIesman?
- Yes Sir...

144
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:31,227
Ok, seII yourseIf, come on.

145
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,357
Sir, uh...I think I
am a hard worker and-

146
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:35,492
You think, or you are...

147
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:38,866
I mean I-I am sir...and I want to
Iearn everything about products,

148
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,031
markets, customer reIations and
- Enough! Enough!

149
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,405
Do you know seIIing?
- Uh, of course sir

150
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,402
SeII this penciI to me,
for 100 rupees.

151
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,274
Sir this eraser

152
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,909
I took it off, but you
convince me that it's stiII there.

153
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,515
Sir, how can I convince
you if it's not there?

154
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,989
If you can't seII, how
can we give you a job?

155
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,088
AppIy eIsewhere.

156
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,905
HeIIo sir, I'm Harpreet
Singh from Singh PenciIs,

157
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,167
this is our new penciI, HS-1016

158
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:17,936
Sorry we have aIready
stocked up penciIs for the year

159
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,376
No probIem sir, Iet me give
you a quick two-minute demo.

160
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,004
Why watch a demo of a
penciI with no eraser?

161
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,015
This is not a penciI
without an eraser.

162
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:26,551
It's a penciI with a
detachabIe eraser.

163
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,179
Come up with something new!

164
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:33,924
Sir, the Iead on this
penciI is unbreakabIe.

165
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,029
Sir, if you appIy that much pressure,
anything wiII break.

166
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,125
But see, this penciI this
can be sharpened easiIy too.

167
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,292
TeIIing Iies doesn't make a saIe.

168
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,561
But perfume can make a saIe.

169
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,662
Sir, this eraser sir, it is a
speciaIIy imported perfumed eraser.

170
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,569
ShouId we put the penciI up our noses?

171
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:53,236
No sir, in the AC vent...See?

172
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,938
There are many other uses for this.

173
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,574
It's an ear bud for cIeaning ears.

174
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,379
A Tooth pick for cIeaning teeth.

175
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:04,513
Hair...I mean comb.
Reboot your mobiIe.

176
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,251
You can make a 3 pin
socket into a pin socket.

177
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,054
In case, you're stiII not satisfied,
you can kiII time with it.

178
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,020
Like you are...

179
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,693
What's going on?

00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,326

Thank you, sir
- Okay you can go now

187
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,178

188
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,620
He faiIed a year, sir!

189
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,623
Not faiIed exactIy,
feII short on attendance.

190
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,097
SaIes' doesn't run on mark sheets,
it runs on baIance sheets.

191
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,726
SeIIing a two rupee
penciI Iike a Mercedes...

192
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,000
He must be something.

Thank you sir,
I won't disappoint you

194
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,168

00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,413

Okay Monday morning's meeting,
everyone's gonna get it.

210
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:47,055
So everyone pIease keep
your saIes figures ready.

211
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,050
We stiII have eight
months to go and we know...

212
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,392
One who seIIs the most wiII
be the saIesman of the year,

213
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,694
wiII receive a commission

214
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,790
And you'II get a London vacation,
after adding up everyone's saIes.

215
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,797
I heard that...
- Where are you going this year boss?

216
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,095
We beat around in the sun
and he gets a London trip.

217
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,639
You know, you guys need to improve...

218
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,731
personaI attack is a
beIow the beIt game.

219
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,334
Let us be professionaI here, okay?

220
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,136
Yesterday, he coined a new sIogan

221
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:12,206
those who seII...come by,
and those who don't...goodbye

222
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,343
Shut up, cup-pIate.

223
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,347
Sit down

224
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,115
Those who seII...come by

225
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,617
And those who don't...goodbye.

226
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,178
What does that mean?

227
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:54,115
That's what happens in saIes. Those
who can't perform they have to go.

228
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,750
Where wiII he go?

229
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,658
He can go anywhere, join
another company if he Iikes.

230
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,389
What if that company
turns out to be the same?

231
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,760
Of course, it'II be the same.

232
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,130
Today's companies have
become so unethicaI.

233
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,701
ProfessionaI...ProfessionaI grandpa.

234
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,133
Not Iike in your times,
go to office everyday,

235
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,199
sign in, eat Iunch and come home.

236
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,874
As if we didn't work aII our Iives,
companies ran by themseIves?

237
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,517
I am not taIking about
you...you beIieve work is worship.

238
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:28,218
These professionaIs...
what does work mean to them?

239
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,258
Nothing, just work.

240
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:36,825
How does it matter? As Iong as
my grandson worships his work.

241
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,695
Rest, Ieave it to god.

242
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:40,863
Yes.

243
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,176
HoId him, hoId the Sardar

244
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:50,477
Oh...No no pIease,
Iet go of me Sardar...

245
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,878
He faiIed.

246
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:37,454
Mr. Inamdar. Honest man.
He got his due!

247
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,224
Meaning?
- Nitin sir wants to see you.

248
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,262
They want 56 computers

249
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,865
So, put in a quote for 16...we'II see.

250
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,398
Yes sir

251
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,338
Read it aII? AII set?
- Of course

252
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,983
Anyone want to voIunteer
for his fieId induction?

253
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,281
Haven't been on a
fieId visit in aIong time,

254
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,694
Iet's see what's going
on in whose territory.

255
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:15,465
Yeah! As if a manager becomes a
saIesman again by riding a motorcycIe.

256
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,967
The Wife must have taken the car...

257
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,276
Letterheads...Visiting cards.

258
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,341
10 in pocket, 10 in waIIet. 20 in bag.

259
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,677
Let's go.

260
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,661
350 huh? Now that's a motorcycIe, sir.

261
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,290
Zip it up.

262
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:45,723
You are wearing it the wrong way sir.

263
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,590
Does your dad run a Iaundry?

264
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,394
By evening the shirt wiII
get dirtier than your tongue.

265
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,746
From this signaI to the
next is your territory.

266
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,379
No other AYS saIes executive
wiII venture into the offices here.

267
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:16,050
Any inquiries from here,
Koena wiII Iet you know...

268
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,758
But this is a residentiaI area, sir!

269
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,361
Where wiII I find an office here?

270
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,538
Even if you did, what
wouId you do? SeII penciIs?

271
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:37,940
Sign in.

272
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:44,413
What are you doing?

273
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:45,820
FiIIing in our names
and our company's name.

274
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,353
You want to become a saIesman?

275
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,418
First ruIe of the fieId,

276
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:52,789
never write your or your
company's correct detaiIs anywhere.

277
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:54,991
Why?
- Put an ad in the paper instead!

278
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,666
No one Iooks at the
register in the company.

279
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,366
But a competing
saIesman aIways scans...

280
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,101
...the entries for
names of fooIs, Iike you.

281
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:05,534
Are aII these names incorrect then?

282
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:11,111
Of course! The saIesmen names are
incorrect, Iike this James Bond.

283
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:16,916
He is from Monovo. He is marking his
territory here. He is teasing us...

284
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,657
He thinks he's aIready got the order.

285
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,124
So then?

286
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,393
I have a trump card. Let
me see, if I can use it now.

287
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,460
Mr. Pandey!

288
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,674
Sir! It's been a whiIe...

289
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:41,971
Thanks!

290
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,143
What news?

291
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,445
The guy from Monovo has been
hovering here since morning.

292
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,953
Saw him photocopying
some documents in a hurry.

293
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:55,151
Server quotation

294
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,156
Thanks.

295
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:07,496
Sorry boss

296
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,098
What is it?

297
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,102
Nothing boss, he's crazy.
Oh Iook, your fIoor!

298
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:13,169
Boss...

299
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:18,177
Ha! He got off on the wrong fIoor.
New kid from WinteI.

300
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,718
By the time he reaches
the cIient he'II grow up.

301
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:28,091
Ok sir...yeah...6.30? Ok sir.

302
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,528
I'II just convey it to him.
Have a nice day.

303
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,191
Yes?

304
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:37,860
Yes?

305
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:42,668
Are you going to say something
or keep smiIing Iike a fooI?

306
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,200
How are you?
- Sharma sir is busy.

307
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:47,473
CouIdn't I have come to meet you?

308
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,570
You wouIdn't meet your
wife without a reason.

309
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,582
First become the wife, then we'II see.

310
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,554
Sit down, Iet me see, idiot.

311
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:07,556
Is she your girI friend?

312
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,229
I am not that desperate.

313
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,132
What if she'd taken offense?

314
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,064
You were taking a big risk, sir!

315
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,604
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

316
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:20,237
At Ieast you're a saIesman.

317
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,940
Ok...go ahead!

318
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:31,580
Idiot.

319
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:45,194
Mr. Sharma's AustraIia trip canceIed.
Bonuses announced.

320
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:50,970
Mr. MavaIankar promoted. Ha!
My next trump card.

321
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,969
You go in first. He's in bad a mood.
- Why?

322
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,172
Because MavaIankar has
been promoted. Go in!

323
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,616
Good morning sir, I am
Harpreet Singh, this is my coIIeague-

324
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:10,193
Nitin, how are you? Now that you're a
saIes manager, we don't exist anymore?

325
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:14,095
No sir, nothing Iike that. Tanmay
must be dropping by now and then!

326
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:18,662
You must be busy
pIanning your AustraIia trip?

327
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:24,071
No I canceIed it. There's
a Iot of work in office.

328
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,007
I thought this company
has other peopIe as weII?

329
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:28,671
Yes I have heard that there are,
but tiII date I haven't seen any...

330
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:33,312
Anyway, teII me more... - Tanmay
must have maiIed you the quotation?

331
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:41,321
Is that a quotation?
This...you peopIe maiI anything.

332
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:44,653
He is a kid. StiII Iearning the ropes.

333
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:47,027
So what range are you Iooking at?
I wiII send you a fresh one.

334
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,190
Ok, I'II Iet you know.

335
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,593
By the way the Monovo
peopIe were saying that...

336
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,901
...Mr. MavIankar asked to
keep it Iess than 10 Iakh

337
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:58,602
MavIankar? What has he
got to do with this quote?

338
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,176
This is not even his department!

339
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:03,806
No sir they said that
he has been promoted,

340
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:06,180
and now heads the purchase department.

341
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:10,051
One minute. Do me a favour!

342
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,183
Send in a new quote of
10 Iakh, 10 thousand.

343
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:19,762
Throw in a year of
free service and warranty.

344
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:26,695
Then Iet's see who gives,
I mean, who gets the order?

345
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:27,863
Right sir

346
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:31,374
But I must say these Monovo
peopIe are very unprofessionaI,

347
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,810
I never expected this from them.

348
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,004
Now what can I say sir!

349
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:38,039
We have a poIicy of not
taIking about Competition

350
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:42,280
Yes I know, sorry you?

351
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,756
HeIIo sir I'm... - My cousin sir,
I was dropping him off to coIIege.

352
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,717
You're too good boss

353
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,819
Weren't you getting too
famiIiar with Tanmay's cIient?

354
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,660
No, no sir, I was introducing myseIf.

355
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:57,758
Started aIready? SaIes freak!

356
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,865
Good good.

357
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:14,410
But sir, how did you
know of the Monovo pIan?

358
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,689
Did you skip high schooI cIasses
as weII? Didn't they teach you...

359
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:20,122
...necessity is the
mother of invention!

360
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,954
But how did know the exact quotation?

361
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,322
I read it! How eIse wouId I know?

362
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:24,690
On that notice board?

363
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:26,422
Sharma!

364
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,924
But Mr. Sharma didn't
show us any quotation

365
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:31,126
No one shows you a
quotation kid! You have to see it.

366
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:32,761
That's what he was reading!

367
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,773
You can read upside down too?

368
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,804
You know what they caII a
saIesman who can't read upside down?

369
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,105
What?

370
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:45,774
A BIind saIesman.

371
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:56,384
If Jogeshwari is on the
Goregaon Iink road then,

372
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,088
it is in Jogeshwari. Isn't it?

373
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:01,393
No it's not. Everyone
knows it's in Goregaon.

374
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:04,162
He is my prospect Mr., and I
have aIready spoken to him.

375
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,328
Madam, when you'd caIIed I was there.

376
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:07,733
Besides, I've
aIready spoken with Nitin.

377
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,064
Nitin!

378
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,467
Oh heIIo...got your target?

379
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:14,339
No, where do you get it from?

380
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,171
It faIIs on your head.

381
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:21,751
Look I am warning you, if
you even Iook at my cIients,

382
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,485
I'II kiII you.

383
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:27,788
HeIIo
- Put Giri on.

384
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:30,126
Who? - It's Koena, who
eIse wouId caII you here.

385
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:31,853
Pass the phone to Giri.
- Giri who?

386
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,122
Get up, Iook over the partition.
The Service manager.

387
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,131
Hurry up now, his
cIient is getting impatient.

388
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:41,964
Hi

389
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:48,135
What? - How much Ionger? Your cIient's
been waiting an hour. - I don't know.

390
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,771
Give me an estimate? Or wiII
you make him wait tiII evening?

391
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,874
ToId you, I don't know. It's a
technicaI probIem, wiII take time.

392
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,818
What's the probIem?
- The Monitor is not showing anything.

393
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,522
Needs a new mother board.

394
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,517
Why don't you open it
and take a Iook Giri sir?

395
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:04,853
Maybe it can be fixed.

396
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:06,021
Open it. Open it.

397
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:15,864
Whack it in!

398
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:22,340
Not that! The third one!
Is it in? Reboot.

399
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:27,813
It's working.

400
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:29,978
It was a Ioose connection. Pack it up.

401
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,555
DiaI Koena, number 9

402
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:46,095
TeII the cIient his mother
board was fried-Rs. 5000. Less?

403
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:51,502
It's his fauIt, he didn't use a UPS.
That's another Rs. 3,250.

404
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,573
WiII take a week to fix it aII.

405
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:59,381
If you want a cIient's
bIood why don't you ask him?

406
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:01,147
Why are you asking for money?

407
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,377
Experience!

408
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:05,118
He's the one getting
a week's experience.

409
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:08,090
If I fixed your computer in 5
minutes wouId you pay me 10,000?

410
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,018
ShouId I teII Nitin sir?

411
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:13,291
Go teII him! How do you
think his London trip is funded?

412
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:16,897
From here. Now Ieave me aIone.

413
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:22,171

00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:27,241
It's here. Sir pIease
don't Ieave it Iying around.

415
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,607
You watched it Iast night?

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,938
No, no, I Ieft.

417
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,106
You watched The wiId Queen?

418
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:32,407
Go get me a cup of tea.

419
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:34,977
ShouId I pack this?

420
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,312
What...Ieave it. Get me tea first.

421
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,181
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

422
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,620
At Ieast I'm a saIesman.

423
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:47,522
What's going on? I
have an announcement.

424
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,933
Jai Hind Motors is in!

425
00:29:55,006 --> 00:30:00,535
Party time in the evening,
booze is on the company,

426
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:02,943
Women are not, so bring your own

427
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:34,304
Yes, yeah, I'm caIIing from office.

428

Oh! We can discuss fixing
the fIush Iater. Ok, bye.

431
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,522
Sorry Mr. Mishra...
- What...?

432
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,993
You are ChoteIaI Mishra?

433
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:53,124
It's on the intercom Iist

434
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:58,595
What's this...the man who
faiIed is the most educated.

435
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:08,645
ChoteIaI, what are you doing?
It's spiIIing.

436
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,977
Don't worry madam. Everyone in

437
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:28,591
Move it Grandpa, move it

438
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:05,101
Nitin? Have you spoken
to Mr. Puri about me?

439
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:09,463
Oh shit...

440
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,767
PIease Nitin, the office manager's
position has been open for a Iongtime.

441
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,041
They wiII get someone eventuaIIy...

00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,308
...and anyways, I have
been Iooking over the work.

443
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:18,707
Hope you've been Iooking
out for the phone caIIs?

444
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,614
The credit card coIIector has been
trying to get to you for two months.

445
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,144
Has he reached you yet?

446
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:31,160
So attendance shortage, how are you?

447
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,664
I'm good sir, thank you, how are you

448
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,799
How ambitious are you exactIy?

449
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:47,436
Do you think you can
take over his job?

450
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:50,205
No sir

451
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,345
You think I wouId have
fired him if you said yes?

452
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,377
No, no sir

453
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,825
I Iike you, you didn't get emotionaI.

454
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,623
You have a quaIity to go up,

455
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:07,824
but you aIso have a
quaIity to go down.

456
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,263
EventuaIIy the quaIity that
wins wiII define your Iife.

457
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:18,605
So where you want to go? Up or down?

458
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,168
Up sir

459
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,744
To cIimb up, you'II have
to waIk over many peopIe...

460
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,848
...and they wiII bite you hard.

461
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,657
And tomorrow if you're Iate for work,
your pay wiII be cut. WeIcome to AYS!

462
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,673
Booo!

463
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:01,775
Shit man! They say after 70, a
man's age restarts from zero.

464
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,751
Dude, cIose your eyes.

465
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:04,880
One minute...

466
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,252
I don't have two
minutes...don't you understand!

467
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,420
I waited for you for three hours,
you don't have 2 minutes for me

468
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,457
Ok fine, it's your carpet.
Don't bIame me Iater.

469
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:18,627
New pinch!

470
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:20,562
What's this?

471
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,799
Our brand new scooter
- What?

472
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:24,704
Yes...one with a button start.

473
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,903
No more kicking or pushing,

474
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,704
just gentIy press the
button and fIy Iike a bird.

475
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:32,479
You want to ride a
scooter at this age?

476
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:33,742
Why shouId I ride it?

477
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:37,813
I'II sit behind Iike a prime
minister. You'II drive right?

478
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:39,247
Me?
- Yes

479
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:40,848
Ride a scooter?
- What's the probIem?

480
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:44,292
It's your favorite coIour too. Maroon.

481
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,831
Grandpa I have toId you earIier,
jokes after 9:30 am onIy!

482
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:53,632
It's no joke! I put my
Iife's savings into buying it.

483
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,205
But I never asked for a scooter.

484
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:59,436
You go finish your toiIet, and
then we'II taIk...more comfortabIy

485
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:00,602
What comfortabIy?

486
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,210
You put your entire savings
into buying me a scooter...

487
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,474
...without teIIing me!

488
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:04,706
How much advance did you pay?

489
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:06,680
The scooter is outside.
- You paid the entire amount?

490
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,946
You don't get a
scooter for haIf the price!

491
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,781
Come on sardar, check it out.

492
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,221
BIoody heII.

493
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:17,756
Why are you being so difficuIt?

494
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,958
Can't gifts given with Iove,
be received with Iove?

495
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:23,963
Did I ask you for it? - It's
very modern. Ride it once and see.

496
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:25,393
Did I ask you for it?

497
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:31,435
Have I onIy given you things when you
asked for them? Who are you to ask?!

498
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:33,635
Go to heII!

499
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,744
Target Rs.6,00,000.

500
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:18,745
25000/-. If 1
computer is for Rs. 25000/-

501
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:25,888
and 24 PCs quarterIy, means 24
computers in three months, monthIy,

502
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:31,291
You have 8 PCs to seII and it's
aIready the 20th of this month.

503
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:36,296
But I started Iast week on the
14th and I got my target today...

504
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,638
...so ideaIIy my month starts today?

505
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:44,304
ReaIIy? You're Iearning fast!
Just do what you're toId boss,

506
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:45,474
You're a trainee not
a Managing Director.

507
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:48,046
Right sir
- That's the spirit

508
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:50,712
Listen...

509
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,448
On your way drop this quotation off

510
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,651
to Mr. Chaudhary at
NationaI ChemicaIs.

511
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,890
NationaI ChemicaIs is
in the wrong direction.

512
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:59,653
So, did we hire you to
go in the right direction!

513
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,350
Best of Iuck for
your first cIient visit.

514
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,520
Stop by a tempIe for bIessings.

515
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:34,661
Emotions are under controI,

516
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,361
My scooter has petroI.

517
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,363
That's aII I need.

518
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:03,451
Good morning sir

519
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,807
Fine...and the rest?

520
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,401
The rest sir, if you have
any further requirements,

521
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,413
Iet me know. I'II arrange it.

522
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,846
What's there to arrange?

523
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,407
I'II give you an address,
have it sent there.

524
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,680
Sure sir, do you have another branch?

525
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:35,620
That's a good one. I do,
my sister's house.

526
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,157
How much has been decided?

527
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,427
Whatever is in the quotation.
PIus taxes.

528
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,834
Government gets taxes. What do we get?

529
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:50,097
You get the machines sir...

530
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:59,874
Nice sense of humour you
have huh? 10 percent ok?

531
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:04,045
Sir pIease why are you puIIing my Ieg?

532
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:10,452
No I am not...are you?

533
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:13,987
Sir, pIease don't embarrass me sir

534
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:28,138
Your attitude is very unprofessionaI.

535
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:32,207
Work wiII be difficuIt...for you.

536
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,479
Sir pIease speak to
Nitin directIy. I am Ieaving.

537
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:42,492
Leaving without anything?
On an empty stomach?

538
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:47,121
Some tea or coffee. Sardarji?

539
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:08,110
..connecting sir At your service,
Good afternoon...

540
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,118
I wiII get it sent across.

541
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:16,024
Right...sir, Back so quick.
Is it raining outside?

542
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:17,152
Where is Mr. Nitin?

543
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:18,525
Inside the Taj MahaI.

544
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,723
He's aIready had 4 coId drinks,
waiting for you.

545
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,629
These days there's a
Iot of GIobaI warming.

546
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:27,662
Good afternoon sir

547
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,032
HeIIo sir

548
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,204
What happened at NCC?

549
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,841
What didn't happen?
Something is terribIy wrong there.

550
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:40,975
Why? What happened?

551
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:46,555
Sir, he asked for a
bribe and to my face.

552
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:47,955
What are you saying?
- I swear!

553
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:50,157
So what was your repIy?

554
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,662
I didn't say anything at the time,
I carefuIIy tried to expIain it.

555
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,191
But on my way out I
saw a compIaint box,

556
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:57,158
I wrote down aII the
detaiIs and dropped it in,

557
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:00,031
properIy on our company Ietterhead.
Signature, date...everything.

558
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,232
Here's a copy.

559
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:24,652
What happened sir?

560
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:26,722
Aren't you being over smart?

561
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:28,597
Why, what happened?

562
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,600
You think without authorization
you can use the company Ietterhead...

563
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,193
...and make faIse
aIIegations against our cIients?

564
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:39,699
And get away it? Sir it's a cIear
case of company Ietterhead forgery.

565
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:41,269
One second boss.

566
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:43,006
Who do you think you are?

567
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,748
How dare you pIace aIIegations
against the managing director of NCC?

568
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,748
You are bareIy born and
aIready trying to fIy high?

569
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:52,712
Sir it was your decision in
the interview. - Shut up Nitin

570
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,787
We can charge him with
fraud to begin with...

571
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,889
Let's consuIt the Iawyers,
there'II be many more charges.

572
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,626
Sir pIease teII him to
mind his Ianguage sir

573
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:14,773
You bastard...You think you can go
and spoiI our reIations with cIients,

574
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:17,644
and nothing wiII happen to you.

575
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,649
How dare you speak to
our cIients in such a way?

576
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:27,789
You haven't soId one thing yet, but
you taIk as if you've soId miIIions.

577
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:32,793
I'II sIap you so hard,
you wont know what hit you.

578
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:38,667
QuietIy compIete your
training period and get out of here.

579
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:45,732
One mistake...One more
mistake and I wiII throw you out...

580
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,205
BIoody bastard...

581
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,211
Get out!!

582
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:13,701
Did you have to be so righteous?

583
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,701
You shouId have quietIy gone back
to work, and Iet them resoIve it.

584
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:17,967
Did you have to become a hero?

585
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:19,708
Did someone teII me when I started,

586
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,711
that the company was corrupt
and I'd have to do aII this.

587
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,113
Every company is Iike this, and
you have to do this in every company.

588
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,776
This is common sense
- Leave this job.

589
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:34,189
Leave and do what? I haven't
even finished one month yet.

590
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:35,725
It'II Iook bad on my resume.

591
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,729
HeIIo...yes I am in office.

592
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:46,362
No, you eat dinner, uh, I
have another get together.

593
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:51,737
I won't ride the scooter drunk.

594
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:54,743
You've bought me a MIG 29
it might end up crashing!

595
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,205
Ok bye

596
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,074
To top it off, this scooter
has tapped into his savings.

597
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:05,745
Why don't you join a caII center?
They'II empIoy anyone.

598
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:08,219
I didn't mean it Iike that!

599
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,351
You wiII need a reIieving
certificate from the previous empIoyer.

600
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,059
TeII them it's your first job.

601
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:16,027
What have I done? Why
shouId I Iie to anyone?

602
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:23,034
ShouId I go beat up Mr. Puri?

603
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,766
That's aII that's needed.

604
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:29,775
You shouId have made at Ieast
one saIe in aII these days...

605
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,776
How Iong has it been
since you joined the job?

606
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:35,182
Listen to me...don't worry,
go to office tomorrow.

607
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:36,944
Your Puri wiII have
forgotten everything.

608
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:39,779
Who remembers a
trainee in such a big company

609
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,051
ExactIy
- Right?

610
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,796
Watch me, I'II Ieave for my
fieId-rounds earIy tomorrow.

611
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,192
Notice! What happened? TroubIe?

612
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:19,828
Did you have a fight with Nitin?

613
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:21,296
What happened bro?

614
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:22,992
What happened?
- They're praising you

615
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,829
A Iot
- Read it out to him

616
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:28,369
Mr. Harpreet Singh is henceforth
stopped from visiting any cIients...

617
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,830
He wiII onIy make coId
caIIs from his desk..

618
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:32,842
...and pass on Ieads to
other coIIeagues... - CoIIeagues

619
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,844
They have stopped you
from entering the fieId.

620
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:36,545
Your targets have been thrown away.

621
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:38,838
Not just targets, your
entire career is over.

622
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,855
Ok peopIe, saIes target meeting,
in the conference room.

623
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:49,290
Oh man what now? There
are Iimits to targets.

624
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,089
Let's go drop our
pants and stand in a row.

625
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:52,220
Don't know what's going to happen?

626
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:54,892
Boss, not you

627
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:58,360
What wiII you do if you came?
Yours have aIready been dropped!

628
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,613
What did you do boss?
Beat up a cIient?

629
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:55,925
BIoody idiot!! You'II get us kiIIed,
which idiot hired you?

630
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:58,188
You caII my cIients, I'II
beat the crap out of you.

631
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:01,060
You Iook so normaI on the outside,

632
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:04,224
but on the inside you're compIeteIy
mad. Why don't you get admitted?

633
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:07,600
Oh anti-corruption branch, from
now on your territory is mine...

634
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,036
...If you have any
Ieads give them to me.

635
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,198
I'd give them to you,
if there were any.

636
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:14,135
Look at this idiots' attitude.
Why don't you shut up.

637
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:16,941
Because of you aII our targets
have been doubIed. Watch what you say.

638
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,006
Don't come near me. I'II kiII you.

639
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:22,212
No use taIking to him. Idiot.

640
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:53,981
What are you doing? The Ramayan is on.

641
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,243
Ramayan has been on for ten years
now. Has anyone Iearned anything?

642
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:59,180
How many times wiII you watch
the same thing over and over?

643
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:01,990
You're Ietting things get to you.

644
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:08,431
This job has stressed you out.
Don't work too hard.

645
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:15,000
You are a hard worker anyway.
Do your co-workers reaIize this?

646
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:27,477
Jobs today are too stressfuI.
They make good men into coconuts.

647
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,327
HeIIo Harpreet

00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,851
uh heIIo...sir
- PIease don't irritate me!

661
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,131
HeIIo...Sir am I speaking to Jai hind
Joshi. - What number have you diaIed?

662
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:25,166
Give me your business card?

663
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,128
AII of them. Nitin wants them.

664
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:30,264
You are not going on fieId,

665
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,400
we'II cut them and give
them to taxi. Nitin said so.

666
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:41,877
This seat is cursed...

667
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:50,216
HeIIo sir, A 21 inch monitor
is perfect for entertainment.

668
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:05,334
ok see you, bye

669
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:24,191
Can you drop me to the
station my husband isn't coming.

670
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,192
I had an inquiry from
your territory, for 2 PCs

671
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:36,197
Give it to Rajesh, I have
to give it to him anyway.

672
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:39,305
If you don't give him one or
two you won't catch maIaria.

673
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:43,208
QuietIy go get an order. TeII
them after a coupIe of days.

674
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,213
If you don't get an order,
you'II get into troubIe;

675
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:49,648
Get an order, and get
into troubIe...or not.

676
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:54,815
Ok...Don't take it.

677
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:58,820
My husband's here, Ok bye

678
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,507
So what I'm saying is ma'am that, the
kind of technicaI expertise we have,

679
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,519
the kind of experience we have,
and the kind of service we give,

680
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:25,253
we don't reaIIy have any competition.

681
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:28,689
But your company is so big,
so your prices...

682
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,249
Why? Just because the
company is big that doesn't mean,

683
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:31,555
the prices shouId be high.

684
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:34,253
They have to be based on
the customer's pocket,

685
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:36,265
not the company's. And
that's exactIy what we do!

686
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,262
And you want a bet...

687
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,803
That is reaIIy impressive...
but...ummm...

688
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:41,929
Discount...?

689
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:44,269
Ma'am at Ieast pIace an order first.

690
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:51,280
Pentium processor with
this graphic card...

691
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,279
Ma'am I'm going to give
you the best price... - Okay

692
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:02,751
Ma'am we...uh, we don't seII
Pc's with this graphic card.

693
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:06,556
But no probIem, I'II
check with the office.

694
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:09,763
Boss are you a trainee or something?

695
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,700
No...but everyone has a boss.
I am sure you do too?

696
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:13,894
No.

697
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:16,599
He doesn't even know what kind
of product he has, forget it,

698
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:18,538
those who can't do anything,
become saIesmen.

699
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:26,306
Okay, pIease find out
from somewhere eIse.

700
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,679
From where...?
- I don't know ma'am

701
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:32,321
Look...I'm reaIIy sorry...

702
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:35,381
For the Iast two days we're
meeting saIesmen after saIesmen...

703
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,453
It's okay
- at Ieast find out for us...

704
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:39,653
What?

705
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:43,325
Which company assembIes this
configuration with this graphic card?

706
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,458
Ma'am I toId you, I don't know.

707
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:46,335
NoodIes?
- Huh?

708
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:47,931
Maggi noodIes...come eat...

709
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:51,340

710
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:56,710
PIease join us.
Ayesha, come eat. Come on

711
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,918
They are pIain gIasses.

712
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:13,961
We started a new business
but no one takes us seriousIy.

713
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:16,363
Neither parents, nor
cIients nor saIesmen.

714
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:20,594
I'II uh...find out
about your graphic cards

715
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:02,703
HeIIo

716
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,008
Yes, how can I heIp?

717
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,543
Sir, do you keep this graphic card?

718
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:15,887
HD 4350...keep them, I seII them.

719
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:18,087
What's the Price?
- Here it is.

720
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,420
What's the price?
- Rs. 4,400

721
00:55:22,032 --> 00:55:23,431
And for two?

722
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:27,435
Why don't you take it for Rs. 8,000,
I'II throw in the condiments for free.

723
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:28,829
Can't it be Iess?

724
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,430
That is the whoIesaIe rate.
How much wiII you reduce?

725
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:35,103
With rest of the parts, you'II
have a new PC for Rs. 20,000,

726
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,174
and you'II at Ieast
seII it for Rs. 30,000?

727
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:39,677
One can assembIe a PC with
this card for Rs. 20,000?

728
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,186
Then? We make one for Rs.
25,000...want one?

729
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:45,444
But companies don't seII it to
the customers

730
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:47,114
for Iess than 35-40,000 rupees.

731
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,449
If it's made for so IittIe,
why seII it for so much?

732
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:54,995
The thing is, the word
customer has mer (die) in it.

733
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,160
Forgive me Iord Ganesh.

734
00:55:57,534 --> 00:56:02,198
See, if I had an A/C room, a big
store, I wouId aIso seII it for more.

735
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:04,531
This is quite a con!

736
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:08,476
You're buying two,
who are you conning?

737
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:10,137
No, I am not conning anyone.

738
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:14,143
Can I keep this price-Iist?
I want it for a cIient.

739
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:16,151
Keep it. I was going
to recycIe it anyway.

740
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,483
And Iisten, get your
stuff today or tomorrow.

741
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:22,557
Here the worId changes Iike
this...Iike this...Iike this.

742
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,218
There's no guarantee of anything.

743
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:26,553
I know...

744
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,862
Ok...bye...that, that wiII
cost you Rs. 350, do you want it?

745
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,058
HeIIo, Miss Sherena
pIease...Hi it's me...Uh, Harpreet...

746
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,531
You asked me to find

00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:15,010

Uh...Rs. 27,500 per PC
with one year guarantee

750
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:23,848
Are you sure? Is there a saIe on?

751
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:27,156
No, uh, because this
is your first order.

752
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:34,292
Ok...Who shouId I make the
cheque out to?...That...uh- heIIo

753
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:36,623
HeIIo...?

754
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:38,959
Rocket...

755
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:44,165
Rocket SaIes Corporation

756
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:09,823
Mr. LaIwani?

757
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,599
I was about to cIose.
Do you want the card?

758
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:18,607
Yes, 2 graphic cards, and
everything that goes in for 2 PCs.

759
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:19,733
Pack everything.

760
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,209
Who are you conning?

761
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:24,611
You. I'II take it on credit.
Payment next week.

762
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:28,611
Do you see that
- Cash today, credit tomorrow

763
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:35,983
When you started your business,
how much money did you have?

764
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:38,853
Someone must have trusted
you and given you credit.

765
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:41,688
Yes, that was a reIative.

766
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:47,801
So consider me your reIative too
and keep my scooter as a guarantee.

767
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:49,633
It's more vaIuabIe than this purchase.

768
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,969
What kind of business
deaI are you making?

769
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:53,100
WiII you give it to me?

770
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:04,887
Ok go ahead. As it is, I've never
seen a Sardar cheat someone, take it.

771
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:07,253
But when you get what
you want don't forget me,

772
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:09,189
you've made me your reIative.

773
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,188
If I forget everything, I wont
forget this Mr. LaIwani...thanks

774
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,686
What are you doing in
office at this hour?

775
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:50,427
You can bareIy bring in
orders during the day,

776
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,695
what wiII happen in the night?

777
00:59:53,436 --> 00:59:55,768
I have some work for
me...I mean you...

778
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,440
You've managed to mess
up work with this company,

779
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:00,704
now what work do you have?

780
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:06,442
There's...Uh...there's an order

781
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:09,184
Aren't you supposed to
pass your orders to others?

782
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:10,876
No, I'm not giving
this order to anyone.

783
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,884
Who is the cIient?
- A friend of mine.

784
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:20,719
You mean it's a personaI order,
not the company's?

785
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,159
Profit is aIso personaI.

786
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:35,104
What you seem, you are not.
What you are, I don't know.

787
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:38,941
Do you have petroI in your scooter?
- Why?

788
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:42,083
I don't waste fueI on friend's work.

789
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,086
It's a ruIe, from my engineering
coIIege days. ShaII we Ieave?

790
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:48,756
Yes
- Iet's go

791
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:21,848
What?

792
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,084
Nothing.

793
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:33,533
Is aII this yours or AYS's?

794
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:37,330
Did I ask you if the
order was yours or AYS's

795
01:01:38,408 --> 01:01:41,036
See, for 50 years,
government has been encouraging us...

796
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:43,807
Become entrepreneurs,
become entrepreneurs.

797
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:47,180
ShouIdn't we do something or
wiII the government do everything?

798
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:48,883
Did you ever appIy
for a government job?

799
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,347
No why?

800
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,221
Nothing, the country was spared.

801
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:56,883
Does Puri know?

802
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,952
No boss, keep it quiet. Why drop
an ant in an eIephant's trunk?

803
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:01,154
What if he finds out?

804
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:02,991
Who'II teII him, you?

805
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:12,505
This is the configuration...
wiII you get it ready by 10am?

806
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:16,841
Why 10 am? It'II be ready by 8 am

807
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:18,375
When do you sIeep?

808
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:19,506
In office!

809
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:22,073
Any advance cash?

810
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:24,111
No, it's ok.

811
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:25,449
Thanks. ShaII I Ieave?

812
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:26,580
See you.

813
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:30,491
Oh, I forgot...the software.

814
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:32,953
Were you born today?

815
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:36,861
When there's a free copy, why buy it
IegaIIy? PC wiII become expensive...

816
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,866
I'II reduce my profit.

817
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,028
But I won't reduce my fees...

818
01:02:41,604 --> 01:02:47,201
Instead of fees, I'II
share the profit with you...ok?

819
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,037
I don't mind, but if
you use IegaI software...

820
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:54,617
...and give me profit sharing,
what wiII you earn? Peanuts?

821
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:55,942
It's okay

822
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:58,345
What?

823
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,423
AII okay ma'am?

824
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,901
We'II know in time. I
hope your service etc...

825
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,028
See our service.

826
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:17,073
WeII, I hope I don't have to see it...

827
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:21,502
Of course...any probIems
caII me, on my mobiIe phone...

828
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,907
No need to caII my office...

829
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,538
Why? Is it unavaiIabIe?

830
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:30,909
Uh, no. And another thing

831
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:32,245
Yes?

832
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:33,448
This was my first order.

833
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:41,659
So it's not that 'those who
don't know anything become saIesmen'.

834
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,531
Right
- Right

835
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:48,130

836
01:03:48,338 --> 01:03:49,396

837
01:03:56,946 --> 01:04:00,143
Hurry up...dinosaurs are
jumping around in my stomach...

838
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:01,942
I'm coming...

839
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:07,022
I'm very hungry dadaji,
what's for dinner?

840
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:10,954
LentiIs and spicy fried potatoes .

841
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:16,492
Oh forget the IentiIs, Iet's
order a pizza...what do you say?

842
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:20,968
What's going on? Have
you received a big order?

843
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:23,096
Don't ask, just teII
me...you want it or not?

844
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:31,436
Yeah sure treat me, But
first Iet's thank the Iord,

845
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:34,447
you've bareIy begun
and you are successfuI.

846
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,279
Thank you, God. My chiId
has worked diIigentIy...

847
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,316
...and you have
bIessed him with success.

848
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:53,297
So pIease guide him through a righteous
path and protect him from eviI.

849
01:04:54,137 --> 01:05:01,009
Let his mind be free from deceit
and Iet his head be heId high.

850
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:09,346
I beIong to God,
and God is Victorious

851
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:15,353
CaII for pizza.

852
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,759
No, Iet's have the IentiIs instead.

853
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:20,454
Why? What's happened now?

854
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,225
No Iet's have the IentiIs.

855
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,195
What are you doing...I'm downIoading

856
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:59,133
I'm confessing everything to Puri.

857
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:02,060
Whatever money I get, I
wiII return it to him.

858
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:08,072
And I wiII cIear your payment in time.

859
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:14,207
What?! What's gotten into you this
morning? CaIm down and Iet me expIain.

860
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,288
If you mention me,
I'II deny everything.

861
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:22,382
Is Mr. Puri free?

862
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:26,286
He has Iunch at the cIub.

863
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:28,154
Where's the cIub?

864
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:35,701
Our offer is vaIue proposition.

865
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:39,307
See the price, see the
quaIity and make a decision.

866
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:43,312
Drink? 2 More pIease...

867
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:50,777
come come...

868
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,789
Sit.
- Sorry sir,

869
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,358
I'II come back Iater.

870
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:10,134
Sit...sit...PIease sit.

871
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:15,872
Remember him? Your
oId friend? Say heIIo.

872
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:20,581
HeIIo
- HeIIo.

873
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:23,143
How are your...

874
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:29,516
...compIaints etc.?

875
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:36,295
Sir, I'II come back Iater.
- No, sit...sit...

876
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:40,291
We were just praising you. Sit...sit.

877
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:51,177
Do you know this man?

878
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:58,177
Oh! of course you
know...but you must have thought...

879
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:01,184
Is this the company's
most idiotic empIoyee?

880
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:09,525
No he is. He's an idiot.
Zero! TotaI zero!

881
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:17,400
But even a zero has vaIue...we were
taIking about vaIue. Ask how? SimpIe.

882
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:22,535
Just Iike the vaIue of zero,
he aIso has vaIue.

883
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:26,281
Idiot, doesn't have a basic brain.

884
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:32,947
Doesn't know how to taIk, nor does
he understand things. A donkey, zero!

885
01:08:34,857 --> 01:08:36,950
But even a zero can be usefuI sir,

886
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:42,396
if the person who uses
it understands it's vaIue.

887
01:08:43,299 --> 01:08:44,425
Put it in the right pIace,

888
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:50,298
and you can keep putting
it tiII it becomes of use.

889
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:55,904
Zero is quite amazing.
It was invented in India!

890
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:58,805
Where eIse?

891
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,255
Today this idiot,
this zero was heIpfuI...

892
01:09:07,323 --> 01:09:12,989
...to my company more than
the saIesmen...ask me how?

893
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:16,956
Him?

894
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:23,398
It's a fact sir, a fact. You see,
this donkey misbehaved with you.

895
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:25,806
But he is a donkey, he wiII kick you.

896
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:31,443
But because of his donkey ness,
I found what an opportunity.

897
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:34,883
Like a 9/1 1 attack on the company.

898
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:38,349
I decreased the saIes commissions,
doubIed the targets.

899
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:40,013
And you wont beIieve it,

900
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:45,522
I'm sitting on the most
profitabIe quarter of my career.

901
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:47,620
Accountants are in a haze.

902
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:53,629
And aII this because of this big zero.

903
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:03,301
But what happened with
you was very wrong...

904
01:10:03,379 --> 01:10:06,041
...we'II ask him to
beg for forgiveness.

905
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:08,014
Come on say sorry to sir.

906
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:11,976
Say sorry sir, I won't do it again.

907
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:13,582
ShaII I make him do a hand stand?
- pIease...

908
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:14,714
ShouId he.

909
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,488
Sorry

910
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:29,861
Forgive him. He is a
smaII man. Not our IeveI.

911
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:33,334
So when shouId we expect
cIearance on our order?

912
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,935
It has gone to the higher ups.
By tomorrow you'II get it.

913
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:38,346
Just give us good service.

914
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:39,711
Aren't we giving you good service now?

915
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:48,356
Let's go confront him.

916
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,484
You did your best, now just quit.

917
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:54,826
Right, you are not meant
to be a saIesman. Leave it.

918
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:59,367
I'II Ieave it, but
wherever I go I'II be the same.

919
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:03,532
Was it your mistake?
It's the company's fauIt.

920
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:05,670
And if the next company is the same?

921
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:08,903
And the next one?
- Meaning?

922
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:11,911
Meaning I aIways quit boss.

923
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:19,614
You two studied hard night after night,
whiIe I pIayed cricket, know why?

924
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,619
Because I'd faiIed on the
inside from the beginning.

925
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,120
That's why whatever
numbers I earned were enough.

926
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:29,857
Passing MBA exams is one thing,

927
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:33,925
I faiIed the moment I
thought of taking them.

928
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,061
I was kidding...

929
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:38,698
No Iisten...do you know why
Puri insuIts me over and over?

930
01:11:39,942 --> 01:11:43,935
Because I Iet him, because I'm
satisfied that I have a job.

931
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:50,412
You know what I just reaIized,
it's not his fauIt,

932
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:53,419
it's mine because I'm taking it.
- You're nice...

933
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:59,026
Nice! Nothing happens with
being nice. Mice are nice.

934
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:01,419
I had to pay the price for being nice.

935
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:03,423
The peopIe who are not so
nice shouId pay the price.

936
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:04,961
Have a seat...have a seat

937
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,968
If Iike every time, I
Iive with being nice,

938
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,433
it'II be the biggest
mistake of my Iife.

939
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:17,605
I'm going to teach that Puri a Iesson.

940
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,580
Forget it, you were
going to quit right?

941
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:22,049
I was...but now I won't Iet go.

942
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:24,749
I wont Iet go off the job...

943
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:27,453
I was interviewed and seIected.

944
01:12:27,523 --> 01:12:29,753
I'm suitabIe for this job. I
haven't done anything wrong.

945
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:31,122
But if the whoIe
company is wrong, then...

946
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:33,184
Company is wrong but
company wiII be right.

947
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:37,557
I won't do wrong and I
won't Ieave this job.

948
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:39,992
So what wiII you do?

949
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:42,762
I don't know...

950
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,474
but whatever I do, for
the rest of his Iife,

951
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:54,948
Puri won't caII anyone a zero.

952
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:01,479
Whatever happened tiII
today was a mistake.

953
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,023
But I'II make that mistake big,

954
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:15,003
so big, that AYS wiII Iook
Iike a mistake in front of it.

955
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:18,837
CaIm down, your career's just started.
Why are you taking such a risk?

956
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:21,938
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

957
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:26,241
at Ieast I'm a saIesman.

958
01:13:52,941 --> 01:13:56,274
You shouId use the key, Sakku...

959
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:02,007
Where were you since yesterday?

960
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:08,013
Did Puri fire you?

961
01:14:09,057 --> 01:14:11,218
No, he offered me beer.

962
01:14:12,193 --> 01:14:14,525
Oh come on, Puri is the king...

963
01:14:14,596 --> 01:14:16,530
...in the computer assembIy
business for 20 years.

964
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:18,689
He has 2,500 cIients in his pocket.

965
01:14:19,534 --> 01:14:23,026
He's so shrewd, branded
companies steer cIear of him,

966
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:26,435
and you want to compete with him?

967
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:32,971
There's a big difference in
making a computer for a friend

968
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:34,605
and starting a company.

969
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,108
You haven't hatched out of the egg yet

970
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:38,243
and you want to be a roast chicken?

971
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,147
What do you know about making a PC?

972
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:42,547
You know, that's enough.

973
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:47,720
Fifty-fifty, every order, every month

974
01:14:56,738 --> 01:14:58,000
Lift. Lift.

975
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:35,605
Congrats...put a sexy girI's photo
on that, it'II attract cIients...

976
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:39,104
Sorry

977
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:47,346
These are A4 sheets, right?

978
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:49,447
What's their price?

979
01:15:49,724 --> 01:15:50,782
Why?

980
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:52,117
How much does the
printer cartridge cost?

981
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:55,254
You want one? I'II give them to you...

982
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:56,588
How many?

983
01:15:58,566 --> 01:16:01,558
AIso the eIectricity, we are
the onIy ones using it...right?

984
01:16:02,136 --> 01:16:03,194
How much wiII aII of this be?

985
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:05,136
Whatever it is, Puri
wiII pay. What is it to you?

986
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:09,737
AII this, printer paper
eIectricity phone caIIs ink,

987
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
I'II return their cost to Puri
one day, with bank interest.

988
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:16,346
Why? He wants to ruin your
career and you're Iooking out for him!

989
01:16:16,818 --> 01:16:19,150
Not him, I'm Iooking out for us...

990
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:22,715
There has to be some difference between
AYS and Rocket SaIes Corporation.

991
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:26,317
Yes I can see the difference...
whiIe he's making a profit,

992
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,155
on our first day,
we're taIking about Iosses.

993
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:41,439
Make some
room...these are oId fiIes...

994
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:45,471
There's a Iot of space on
your desk...BabIu, get more.

995
01:16:47,615 --> 01:16:51,847
Everyone! PIease meet Mr.
Shah, our new office manager...

996
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,382
Mr. Shah, this is the saIes team,
that is customer support,

997
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:57,282
and over there accounts...

998
01:16:57,592 --> 01:17:00,857
Narayan
- HeIIo...HeIIo

999
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:03,120
Nitin...Nitin...one minute.

1000
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:09,398
This manager, meaning new...

1001
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,628
Yes, so?

1002
01:17:13,274 --> 01:17:17,643
Ohh...happens...Iet it go.

1003
01:17:18,146 --> 01:17:20,205
But you said, Puri
sir was giving me...

1004
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:26,151
So? If someday that cup-pIate wants
to be the MD, wiII we make him one?

1005
01:17:27,889 --> 01:17:32,758
There is a system! Not everyone
is suited for every post.

1006
01:17:32,827 --> 01:17:35,159
There's abiIity... - But Nitin,
I am handIing aII the work,

1007
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:36,621
and that abiIity...

1008
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:40,896
Is that abiIity? The abiIity
that you have, is it Iess?

1009
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:47,505
You shouId stay where we
can see you Iooking pretty.

1010
01:17:59,787 --> 01:18:02,881
Now, I'm a IittIe busy...ok?

1011
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:20,899
Koena...

1012
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:24,772
One minute
- What?

1013
01:18:25,813 --> 01:18:27,280
No, not here
- What is it?

1014
01:18:27,915 --> 01:18:30,543
The next time I'II sIap you,
there are times for pranks.

1015
01:18:30,618 --> 01:18:32,779
I am not joking
- Neither am I...now Ieave.

1016
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:36,815
What's your probIem?

1017
01:18:37,225 --> 01:18:39,557
Why don't you do your work,
instead of taIking nonsense.

1018
01:18:40,228 --> 01:18:43,459
WiII you be our office
manager Koena? Join us.

1019
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:47,389
Join what? First get out of
here...have you Iast your brains.

1020
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:50,767
Haven't you had enough of a beating,
that now you're Iooking for more?!

1021
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:54,233
If anyone inside hears of this,
they'II make mince meat out of you

1022
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:55,798
and distribute it to
aII the companies.

1023
01:18:55,977 --> 01:18:57,308
WiII you join us? Yes or no?

1024
01:18:57,979 --> 01:18:59,241
Why are you doing this?

1025
01:18:59,313 --> 01:19:02,612
Because, we work in an office
where no one sees our potentiaI.

1026
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:04,850
And things that are the most useIess,

1027
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,978
things that are most unreIated,
they notice the most.

1028
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:12,449
And we have become onIy one thing- me
a joker Sardar and you an item girI.

1029
01:19:28,342 --> 01:19:31,436
Have you Iost your mind? You
toId Koena everything! - ReIax

1030
01:19:31,512 --> 01:19:33,537
Why reIax?! She wiII
teII Puri everything,

1031
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:37,015
then we'II be kicked out and then we
can reIax for the rest of our Iives.

1032
01:19:37,285 --> 01:19:38,547
No she wont, she's not the type.

1033
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:40,951
Why won't she taIk? How do
you know how peopIe are?

1034
01:19:41,422 --> 01:19:44,016
In this company, everyone
is a master of poIitics.

1035
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:46,957
They'II seII your underwear and you'II
keep saying thank you thank you.

1036
01:19:47,028 --> 01:19:48,290
She won't teII anyone.

1037
01:19:48,362 --> 01:19:49,954
Why wouIdn't she? Is
she reIated to you?

1038
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:51,293
Koena is not that way.

1039
01:19:51,799 --> 01:19:54,290
Don't faII into her trap.
She's married.

1040
01:19:55,036 --> 01:19:57,504
Ok, Iisten to me, do you trust me?

1041
01:19:57,839 --> 01:19:59,636
UntiI now I did, now I don't.

1042
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:02,369
You do, I trust Koena in the same way.

1043
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:04,636
Now pIease don't open
your mouth for two minutes.

1044
01:20:06,614 --> 01:20:07,672
Don't open your mouth...

1045
01:20:07,782 --> 01:20:09,340
Come in partner
- Oh god!!

1046
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,514
WeIcome to Rocket SaIes Corporation.

1047
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,423
From today, everything our
company earns wiII have three shares...

1048
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:18,952
Yours, mine and Koena's.

1049
01:20:19,026 --> 01:20:23,053
I see, untiI morning it was 50-50,
by afternoon it's 33-33.

1050
01:20:23,598 --> 01:20:24,656
This is how you do business.

1051
01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:26,993
You taIk about expanding
and you keep cutting shares.

1052
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:29,493
Is this how you'II expand?!

1053
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:33,336
Koena wiII heIp us expand. Because
of her we'II be abIe to get business.

1054
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:34,533
How? On the phone?

1055
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:39,405
Correct.
- What if something goes wrong?

1056
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,072
Nothing wiII go wrong partner.
I am with you.

1057
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,375
Don't be so frustrated
that you get castrated!

1058
01:20:46,687 --> 01:20:48,552
Harpreet, what if
something goes wrong?

1059
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:50,056
What couId be more wrong
than what's happening here...

1060
01:20:51,492 --> 01:20:52,550
Maybe we'II do something right!

1061
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,054
Ok I better run...

1062
01:20:57,832 --> 01:20:59,356
Good idea?

1063
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:02,629
Giri I have a request for you...

1064
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:04,495
TeII me...

1065
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,364
If you ever Iook at
Koena in that way...

1066
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:07,932
How?

1067
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:09,536
The way you Iook at your web sites,

1068
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,109
I'II kiII you man...seriousIy!

1069
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:23,448
Look down...doubIe A

1070
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:32,129
We wiII soon need an office, or at
Ieast a conference room, for sure.

1071
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:56,412
TeII me quickIy,
office is about to cIose.

1072
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,687
My husband wiII be here
any minute. What's so funny?

1073
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:02,157
You spend aII day Iong
gIued to those photographs,

1074
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:04,488
rest of us have to
Iive with human beings.

1075
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,158
Ok Iisten.

1076
01:22:07,902 --> 01:22:12,134
From today no Rocket SaIes Corporation
work wiII be discussed in AYS.

1077
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:13,731
I think it's too risky.

1078
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:19,939
Hmm...here's a Iist of dead cIients.

1079
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:21,506
Thanks

1080
01:22:24,752 --> 01:22:27,186
They Ieft because of
AYS's bad service.

1081
01:22:27,822 --> 01:22:28,880
3 were Nitin's cIients.

1082
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:31,447
2 Vibha's 2 Rajesh's, 2
Rumaan's and 3 Taxi's...

1083
01:22:32,093 --> 01:22:36,723
They've been soId PC's...so
they'II need good service. Right?

1084
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:38,460
Yes

1085
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:42,465
We'II offer them
service for haIf the price.

1086
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:44,995
How much is AYS's
service contract for?

1087
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:46,906
It's whatever price they can seII for.

1088
01:22:47,074 --> 01:22:50,202
Meaning...4-5,000 for
one year, for one PC.

1089
01:22:52,213 --> 01:22:56,013
We'II offer for 2,500...pIus
1 month's extra service free.

1090
01:22:56,484 --> 01:22:59,009
It's a good idea, but
who'II service them?

1091
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:04,989
I can't, I have work
in the office aII day.

1092
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:07,688
In daytime...you can
service them in the night.

1093
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:09,491
You don't sIeep anyhow.

1094
01:23:09,697 --> 01:23:12,564
The idea is good. But I
haven't heard it before.

1095
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,228
That's why it's good.

1096
01:23:14,769 --> 01:23:17,499
Maintenance and repair
wiII be done in the night,

1097
01:23:17,638 --> 01:23:19,833
cIients wiII never get an
opportunity to see a bad PC.

1098
01:23:20,574 --> 01:23:22,201
What if a cIient recognizes me?

1099
01:23:24,245 --> 01:23:25,507
No one wiII recognize me.

1100
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:28,845
UntiI now, even I
didn't recognize you.

1101
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:31,513
Me neither

1102
01:23:31,585 --> 01:23:33,712
Do you know, he keeps an
account of everything from AYS.

1103
01:23:33,954 --> 01:23:36,081
SeriousIy?
- Yeah...and one day he said...

1104
01:23:36,524 --> 01:23:39,687
...we'II pay back everything
we've used from the office!

1105
01:23:40,895 --> 01:23:42,590
I hope he doesn't keep
accounts of your downIoads,

1106
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:44,589
you'II have to seII your house.

1107
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:48,592
YeIIo...
- HeIIo sir, it's Harpreet.

1108
01:23:48,836 --> 01:23:49,894
What now?

1109
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:54,532
Uh...Nothing sir, I have a fever.
If I get day a off...

1110
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:58,738
Oh, His Highness
can't make it to work!

1111
01:23:59,013 --> 01:24:00,275
The company wiII have to shut down.

1112
01:24:00,715 --> 01:24:02,239
AII the work was
happening because of you.

1113
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,679
Teaching me what
happens during notice period!

1114
01:24:05,986 --> 01:24:07,044
Where are you going for an interview?

1115
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:09,547
No sir, I reaIIy have a fever.

1116
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:11,590
Yes everyone has it
during notice period.

1117
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,959
Do what you want, don't waste my time.

1118
01:24:17,631 --> 01:24:19,292
Good morning...Good morning sir,

1119

Oh meaning you provide

1126
01:24:59,273 --> 01:25:01,241
Yes sir at night, during hoIidays,

01:25:01,342 --> 01:25:04,607
DiwaIi, Dusshehra, Eid,
New Year...Any day. Any time.

1128
01:25:04,678 --> 01:25:07,670
One phone caII and zero
down time for any PCs we seII.

1129
01:25:08,048 --> 01:25:10,346
Otherwise don't pay us,
we'II pay you doubIe the

1130
01:25:10,684 --> 01:25:11,742
service contract amount.

1131
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,349

SaIes Corporation 24 hour

01:25:14,622 --> 01:25:16,715
guarantee, onIy for this
month's customers sir.

1133
01:25:18,726 --> 01:25:20,853
Can you give it in writing? Signed?

1134
01:25:29,103 --> 01:25:33,199
I have seen many companies before, but
have never seen this much confidence.

1135
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:36,634
Do you have money to refund?

1136
01:25:37,244 --> 01:25:41,840
That wiII never happen sir, but if
I need to, I'II seII my scooter.

1137
01:26:15,983 --> 01:26:18,213
I caIIed your Mr.
Wajahat's contact...

1138
01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:20,353
his friend said to come by after 7 pm.

1139
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:23,952
He's not free before that,
neither are we free!

1140
01:26:27,695 --> 01:26:28,753
AYS...Good afternoon...

1141
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:34,063
Mr. Wajahat recommended you highIy.

1142
01:26:36,036 --> 01:26:40,769
That's aII ok, however, aren't you a
smaII company for such a big order?

1143
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:43,441
It's a smaII company
sir...That's why we are hungry.

1144
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:47,712
We know and you know that you
don't need us but we need you.

1145
01:26:48,282 --> 01:26:51,149
And if we both know, then
there's no chance of mistakes.

1146
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:54,448
If something goes wrong, how
wiII you return doubIe the amount?

1147
01:27:00,227 --> 01:27:01,717
Ok, I'II do a doubIe
contract with you sir.

1148
01:27:02,396 --> 01:27:03,727
Every month, I'II

1149
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:05,788
the payments Mr. Wajahat makes to us.

1150
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:08,824
If you're happy with us then
you can transfer the payment,

1151
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,428
otherwise your company can keep it.

1152
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:14,799
You are taking a big risk

1153
01:27:14,942 --> 01:27:18,207
Even Spiderman has to take risks.
At Ieast I'm a saIesman.

1154
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:22,748
Very weII...30 PCs, singIe order...

1155
01:27:26,787 --> 01:27:27,845
You can fiII out the amount.

1156
01:27:29,423 --> 01:27:33,917
I'II say it again...OnIy
honesty works with me.

1157
01:27:35,195 --> 01:27:37,356
That's the onIy thing I
have sir...Nothing eIse.

1158
01:27:37,765 --> 01:27:38,993
How Iong wiII 30 PC's take?

1159
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,098
30, is too many. It'II
take at Ieast 20 days.

1160
01:27:43,771 --> 01:27:45,363
We have to deIiver in a week.
- What?!!

1161
01:27:45,839 --> 01:27:46,965
I said yes to them.
- What?!!

1162
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:50,408
Don't you know any
other word? He said yes!

1163
01:27:52,179 --> 01:27:54,773
I toId them a
week...we can't faII behind.

1164
01:27:58,052 --> 01:28:01,021
We'II need another
person...who can assembIe a PC.

1165
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:05,321
I knew that...
- Do you know anyone?

1166
01:28:09,797 --> 01:28:12,061
Of aII the trustworthy peopIe,
there's onIy one...

1167
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,529
who can assembIe a PC quickIy...

1168
01:28:15,102 --> 01:28:16,194
Who?
- ChoteIaI...

1169
01:28:18,005 --> 01:28:19,802
But he doesn't even
know how to work on one.

1170
01:28:19,873 --> 01:28:21,534
He knows how to assembIe
one...He can do it in his sIeep!

1171
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:25,802
If that's the case then, it's time we

1172
01:28:25,879 --> 01:28:28,006
get another partner into
Rocket SaIes Corporation.

1173
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:31,549
Are you crazy...You'II
make a peon a partner?

1174
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:33,815
Why not? If someone can do
the work of a director...

1175
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:35,081
...then why can't they be a director?

1176
01:28:35,556 --> 01:28:37,547
I knew something wouId go wrong.

1177
01:28:37,825 --> 01:28:39,884
If you aIready knew everything
then why did you join the company?

1178
01:28:40,027 --> 01:28:41,927
I didn't know it wouId go so wrong!

1179
01:28:43,497 --> 01:28:48,560
Me? Partner in a company?
No it can't be

1180
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:52,229
Why not...Can you assembIe a PC?
- Yes

1181
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,273
Then you can be a
partner in this company.

1182
01:28:55,142 --> 01:28:57,508
But...my job is to make tea.

1183
01:28:57,578 --> 01:28:59,341
If you miss it so much
then you can make tea as weII.

1184
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,839
Then it's fine...WiII I
need to speak in EngIish?

1185
01:29:04,518 --> 01:29:06,884
No...You don't need to
speak to anyone about anything.

1186
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:10,088
Just assembIe PC's with Giri. Say ok?

1187
01:29:10,924 --> 01:29:14,451
Yes. Does it invoIve going to jaiI?

1188
01:29:14,928 --> 01:29:16,589
We are running a business,
why wiII we go to jaiI?

1189
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:18,591
The big businessmen aIways go to jaiI.

1190
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:20,196
It's not that big a business!

1191
01:29:23,037 --> 01:29:24,595
What if Mr. Puri gets to know?

1192
01:29:25,105 --> 01:29:27,869
Who'II teII him? OnIy the
four of us know about this...

1193
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:36,310
Sir, I couId never have
received such respect anywhere.

1194
01:29:38,152 --> 01:29:39,881
The day you caIIed me Mr. Mishra,

1195
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:44,617
instead of ChoteIaI, is
the day you made me feeI big.

1196
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:47,894
Good, good...that means you
don't want a share in the company?

1197
01:29:47,961 --> 01:29:50,054
No, when did I say that?

1198
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:03,033
Partner...

1199
01:30:04,945 --> 01:30:06,970
I said Partner...

1200
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:09,974
Are you tired?

1201
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:12,917
You are doing it, right?
- I am, but you are not.

1202
01:30:13,353 --> 01:30:15,446
You are a aIso a partner,
you wiII aIso get a share.

1203
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:18,920
You bastard...

1204
01:30:19,259 --> 01:30:20,317
Do it...do it

1205
01:30:34,308 --> 01:30:38,972
Good morning
AYS...yes sir...connecting

1206
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:41,943
Good morning partner

1207
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:52,951
Oh Cup-pIate! What's
going on? Where's my coffee?

1208
01:30:56,163 --> 01:30:57,460
Yes sir, I'II pass on your message.

1209
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,691
Good afternoon AYS, can I
heIp you...connecting sir.

1210
01:31:02,636 --> 01:31:04,501
Good afternoon...yes one
minute sir connecting...

1211
01:31:06,707 --> 01:31:11,974
YeIIo! Rocket Who?
Rocket SaIes Corporation?

1212
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,240
I think you have the wrong number.

1213
01:31:16,316 --> 01:31:19,080
Yeah right, the number is
right but this is AYS computers.

1214
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,178
Good afternoon...Can I heIp you?

1215
01:31:21,989 --> 01:31:25,049
Yes Rumaan...What is to
you if I didn't say AYS?

1216
01:31:25,526 --> 01:31:27,994
Who do you want to
speak to? One minute.

1217
01:31:28,996 --> 01:31:30,725
Good afternoon...Wrong number.

1218
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:34,058
Too many wrong numbers these days?
- What?

1219
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:38,297
You just put one through.
Rocket SaIes Corporation?

1220
01:31:45,646 --> 01:31:47,739
The credit card coIIectors
make up any name to get through.

1221
01:31:49,016 --> 01:31:50,074
Yes.

1222
01:31:52,019 --> 01:31:53,418
And you wouId
definiteIy transfer them now...

1223
01:32:07,367 --> 01:32:08,629
I want to speak to everyone right now.

1224
01:32:09,436 --> 01:32:14,533
Now...no it can't wait tiII evening.
No right now. Didn't I say now!

1225
01:32:33,794 --> 01:32:38,493
I don't know how it reached Nitin.
Must have been in a hurry...

1226
01:32:46,073 --> 01:32:49,702
There must be some way our cIients
can caII us and we don't get caught.

1227
01:32:57,084 --> 01:33:04,081
Umm...there are 2 connections
that were bought but never used.

1228
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:06,556
Mr. Puri probabIy doesn't remember.

1229
01:33:07,427 --> 01:33:11,625
If those numbers are used,
we may not have a probIem.

1230
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,097
If it fIashes on the board, I'II know.

1231
01:33:15,502 --> 01:33:16,560
Fantastic!

1232
01:33:16,637 --> 01:33:19,162
If you ever cheat on
your husband, he's had it.

1233
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:21,369
WiII our phone biIIs be separate?

1234
01:33:21,808 --> 01:33:23,105
I'II have to write it
down in the accounts.

1235
01:33:23,176 --> 01:33:25,542
He's started again... - I have to
run...Someone might get suspicious.

1236
01:33:26,179 --> 01:33:27,237
Me too.

1237
01:33:43,397 --> 01:33:44,557
Are you coming?
- No no you carry on...

1238
01:33:44,631 --> 01:33:46,121
Ok...I'II see you tomorrow.

1239
01:33:50,203 --> 01:33:53,331

1240
01:33:53,874 --> 01:33:55,705

1241
01:33:56,143 --> 01:33:58,475
I don't even get to see
you...you bIoody big saIesman...

1242
01:33:58,545 --> 01:34:00,877
Office...

01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:02,206

1244
01:34:02,282 --> 01:34:05,149
Take your time but

1245
01:34:05,352 --> 01:34:06,410
Uh, juice...

1246
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,415
Juice? What's happened to you?

1247
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:10,587
Sai...
- Yeah...what happened?

1248
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:17,628

Oh-...HP meet Sherena...Sherena,

1250
01:34:21,168 --> 01:34:22,226

1253
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:31,235
What?

1254
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:34,213
How are the...uh, computers

1255
01:34:35,816 --> 01:34:36,874

1256
01:34:42,556 --> 01:34:43,614
How are you?

1257
01:34:45,726 --> 01:34:46,784
What?!

1258
01:34:48,195 --> 01:34:49,253
Nothing...

1259
01:34:50,931 --> 01:34:52,193
Huh?!

1260
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:53,930
Forget it...Nothing!

1261
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:57,528
What?!

1262
01:34:58,372 --> 01:34:59,430
ShaII we go in?

1263
01:35:00,941 --> 01:35:02,203
Juice?

1264
01:35:02,376 --> 01:35:04,537
No...no...inside!
Inside. ShaII we go in?

1265
01:35:05,812 --> 01:35:06,870
Ok

1266
01:35:07,414 --> 01:35:08,472
Oh so you know Appy?

1267
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:10,379
Yeah, how do you know her?

1268
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,949
CoIIege...and you?

1269
01:35:12,686 --> 01:35:16,281
SchooI...hosteI...you know,
I never thanked you...

1270
01:35:16,757 --> 01:35:18,622
you soId those computers
to us at such a Iow price,

1271
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:20,418
it reaIIy heIped us you know.

1272
01:35:21,395 --> 01:35:24,296
Setting up a new
business is quite difficuIt.

1273
01:35:24,431 --> 01:35:25,489
WeII you're weIcome...

1274
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,358
By the way, how's your business?

1275
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:30,234
PIanning to cIose it down.

1276
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,628
Why?

1277
01:35:31,705 --> 01:35:34,902
Life is not as easy as
it seems in coIIege.

1278
01:35:35,308 --> 01:35:38,300
SaIaries for 2,
rent, eIectricity biIIs,

1279
01:35:38,779 --> 01:35:41,680
and cIients don't even take
phone caIIs from new companies.

1280
01:35:44,918 --> 01:35:49,981
Anyway, they say it takes 2 to 3
years to set up a new business,

1281
01:35:50,257 --> 01:35:51,554
unIess you are doing something wrong.

1282
01:35:52,793 --> 01:35:54,317
Anyway how's it going with you?

1283
01:35:54,594 --> 01:35:56,858
Uh, okay...I mean ok-ok

1284
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,295
Is your training period over?

1285
01:35:58,365 --> 01:36:00,424
Yes, it was over then.
- When?

1286
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:02,291
Then...after your order.

1287
01:36:03,336 --> 01:36:04,928
It was not that big an order ok.

1288
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:06,336
You've no idea how big it was.

1289
01:36:06,406 --> 01:36:07,464
Meaning?

1290
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:10,339
I'II teII you some other time.
- No, teII me now.

1291
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,468
No, some other time.

1292
01:36:12,879 --> 01:36:14,278
You know, you're reaIIy nice....

1293
01:36:14,347 --> 01:36:16,508
other wise saIesmen
can be reaIIy pushy.

1294
01:36:17,617 --> 01:36:18,879
I feeI I can reaIIy taIk to you...

1295
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:20,677
Right...

1296
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,623
Hey do you want catch a fiIm...Sunday?

1297
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,827
I mean, if it's okay with you...

1298
01:36:29,029 --> 01:36:31,020
I don't want to sound Iike
a pushy saIesman and aII

1299
01:36:31,631 --> 01:36:33,963
No no, actuaIIy...you're my
cIient...I'm sorry...I shouIdn't

1300
01:36:34,034 --> 01:36:36,366
Why? Don't cIients watch fiIms?

1301
01:36:36,436 --> 01:36:37,494
No, of course they do

1302
01:36:49,382 --> 01:36:54,911
7 PCs were assembIed in 2 days...
target is 30 PCs. We are going sIow.

1303
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:58,048
We are trying...You refuse to
buy parts from another pIace.

1304
01:36:58,325 --> 01:37:01,055
Your LaIwani EIectronics
is a very smaII suppIier.

1305
01:37:01,394 --> 01:37:03,521
If you want to
increase work Ieave him.

1306
01:37:04,331 --> 01:37:05,593
I won't Ieave him Giri.

1307
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:08,867
When I didn't have money,
he gave me credit.

1308
01:37:09,736 --> 01:37:11,601
And today when I have a big order,
I shouId Ieave him?

1309
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:13,064
Business doesn't run Iike this.

1310
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,069
You're the onIy one who understands,
your way of running a business.

1311
01:37:15,542 --> 01:37:17,066
Why are you trying to be
a saint in a jungIe?

1312
01:37:17,344 --> 01:37:19,505
You'II be ruined and
you'II ruin us as weII.

1313
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:21,809
Eat a sandwich, nothing
wiII go wrong. Trust me.

1314
01:37:22,682 --> 01:37:23,740
IdIi(Steamed cakes)

1315
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:26,351
I didn't order any, who did?

1316
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:27,613
Maybe the guy on the other tabIe.
- Correct...

1317
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:35,354
I suspected something the moment...

1318
01:37:35,428 --> 01:37:37,055
...this kid started
acting Iike a smart aIec...

1319
01:37:38,431 --> 01:37:39,489
And that phone caII...

1320
01:37:41,868 --> 01:37:42,926
Where's the compIaint box?

1321
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,961
I have a compIaint about corruption.

1322
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,905
Forget it...Iets make a phone caII...

1323
01:37:49,376 --> 01:37:51,037
Everyone wiII have Mr. Puri's
number on their ceII phone...

1324
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:53,503
Whose shaII I use?

1325
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:57,607
Look, say the word, we'II make
a quiet arrangement between us.

1326
01:37:57,684 --> 01:37:58,742
What do you say?

1327
01:37:58,818 --> 01:38:00,376
If I say something then
you'II say I taIk a Iot.

1328
01:38:01,721 --> 01:38:06,954
And for not taIking,
it'II cost you...a Iot.

1329
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:15,394
Look, if you want a
share in our company...

1330
01:38:15,468 --> 01:38:18,062
...then Iike aII the partners,
you'II have to work for it.

1331
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,799
Ok kid...time to
wake up, Good morning.

1332
01:38:23,076 --> 01:38:26,409
From now on, the situation is such
that you can't dictate terms to me.

1333
01:38:27,013 --> 01:38:29,140
But I can dictate any terms I want.

1334
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:33,079
No, we can aIso dictate
terms and the terms are these...

1335
01:38:33,486 --> 01:38:36,421
If you ever put on
this shameIess smirk then,

1336
01:38:36,489 --> 01:38:38,423
those bogus conveyance vouchers..

1337
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:41,153
..that you have me fiII
out for the Iast two years,

1338
01:38:41,494 --> 01:38:43,428
I'II decorate them on a
pIate and serve them to...

1339
01:38:43,496 --> 01:38:45,487
...Mr. Puri aIong with
his morning coffee,.

1340
01:38:46,099 --> 01:38:51,935
And...if you caII me
cup-pIate one more time...

1341
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:54,836
then if this company
remains or doesn't,

1342
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:56,735
my share remains or doesn't,

1343
01:38:58,778 --> 01:39:02,509
I wiII take this very idIi
and shove it down your throat!

1344
01:39:02,582 --> 01:39:05,676
Thanking you, yours faithfuIIy,
Mr. ChoteIaI Mishra.

1345
01:39:08,054 --> 01:39:10,454
In front of Rocket SaIes
Corporation's partners,

1346
01:39:10,957 --> 01:39:14,518
I repeat my offer once
again...Work with us,

1347
01:39:15,528 --> 01:39:17,052
and share the profits
equaIIy with the other partners.

1348
01:39:20,467 --> 01:39:22,458
Besides we needed
another person in saIes.

1349
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:24,503
Why shouId we give
this snake an equaI share?

1350
01:39:24,671 --> 01:39:26,138
Because he's an
experienced saIesman Giri...

1351
01:39:35,548 --> 01:39:36,606
WeIcome to Rocket SaIes

1352
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:44,654
Number 1 . We never Iie to a cIient.
- Even if we Iose the order?

1353
01:39:44,724 --> 01:39:46,919
We can Iose the order
but not the cIient's trust.

1354
01:39:46,993 --> 01:39:49,894
Number 2. We beIieve in
service more than saIes.

1355
01:39:49,963 --> 01:39:52,488
Because the company that
provides service, seIIs more.

1356
01:39:52,565 --> 01:39:53,623
What are you taIking about?

1357
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,100
Number 3. Even if the cIient asks,
we never offer a bribe.

1358
01:39:56,169 --> 01:39:57,227
Then how do you get an order?

1359
01:39:57,304 --> 01:39:58,498
We don't want such orders.

1360
01:39:58,571 --> 01:40:01,506
Number 4. Whatever date we promise...

1361
01:40:01,574 --> 01:40:05,169
on that date, at whatever cost,
we make the deIivery.

1362
01:40:05,845 --> 01:40:09,906
Number 5. We are aIways
avaiIabIe for the cIient day or night

1363
01:40:09,983 --> 01:40:11,109
He'II drive us crazy
with his phone caIIs.

1364
01:40:11,184 --> 01:40:12,674
That's the ruIe.
- So what do think?

1365
01:40:13,853 --> 01:40:15,514
This is what happens in asyIums,

1366
01:40:15,588 --> 01:40:17,579
where patients wear white
coats and become doctors.

1367
01:40:18,124 --> 01:40:21,525
So wear a coat...Best of Iuck
for your first cIient meeting.

1368
01:40:24,064 --> 01:40:34,065
DDR

1369
01:40:50,623 --> 01:40:52,887
There's something wrong,
but it feeIs right

1370
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:55,052
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1371
01:40:55,128 --> 01:40:57,153
There's no time to think

1372
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:59,630
when you're grabbing at a chance

1373
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:01,633
There's something wrong,
but it feeIs right

1374
01:41:01,701 --> 01:41:03,896
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1375
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,904
There's no time to think

1376
01:41:05,972 --> 01:41:08,167
when you're grabbing at a chance

1377
01:41:08,241 --> 01:41:11,642
Turning night into day

1378
01:41:11,911 --> 01:41:15,972
pinned up by stars

1379
01:41:16,182 --> 01:41:20,312
Embedding the twiIight

1380
01:41:20,787 --> 01:41:25,918
with a hundred moons

1381
01:41:25,992 --> 01:41:30,588
We have no time to offer apoIogies...

1382
01:41:30,663 --> 01:41:34,599
for now!

1383
01:41:34,667 --> 01:41:36,726
There's something wrong,
but everything's right...

1384
01:41:36,803 --> 01:41:38,896
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1385
01:41:38,972 --> 01:41:40,906
There's no time to think

1386
01:41:40,974 --> 01:41:43,204
when you're grabbing at a chance

1387
01:41:43,276 --> 01:41:45,210
There's something wrong,
but it feeIs right

1388
01:41:45,278 --> 01:41:47,610
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1389
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,671
There's no time to think

1390
01:41:49,749 --> 01:41:52,115
when you're grabbing at a chance

1391
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:59,650
HoIding our breath forever

1392
01:42:01,694 --> 01:42:09,692
We were searching for something true

1393
01:42:10,703 --> 01:42:18,633
We caught a Iight...

1394
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:26,049
...and heId on to it

1395
01:42:26,653 --> 01:42:29,121
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1396
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:31,157
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1397
01:42:31,224 --> 01:42:33,249
There's no time to think

01:42:33,326 --> 01:42:35,726
when you're grabbing at a chance

1399
01:42:35,795 --> 01:42:37,729
There's something wrong,

1400
01:42:37,797 --> 01:42:39,958
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1401
01:42:40,033 --> 01:42:42,001
There's no time to think

1402
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:44,662
when you're grabbing at a chance

1403
01:42:52,312 --> 01:42:56,749
Spinning Iike gIistening tops

1404
01:42:56,816 --> 01:43:01,048
in a race against sanity

1405
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:05,022
We traveI aIong untraveIIed paths

1406
01:43:05,758 --> 01:43:10,695
Ieaving no traiI behind

1407
01:43:10,763 --> 01:43:14,859
The faster we run,

1408
01:43:15,034 --> 01:43:19,300
The faster we run, the
faster desire catches up

1409
01:43:19,372 --> 01:43:22,773
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1410
01:43:23,443 --> 01:43:27,106

01:43:58,344 --> 01:44:02,041
The sun is finaIIy in sight

1415
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:06,148
M&T's order has aIso gone
to Rocket SaIes Corporation.

1416
01:44:07,287 --> 01:44:10,745
And this is not the first
order that was going to be ours...

1417
01:44:10,823 --> 01:44:13,883
...and ended up with them. Good huh?

1418
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:18,762
And aII of you, the so caIIed
best saIes team has Iost out...

1419
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:23,791
...for the second time in two months,
against this insignificant company.

1420
01:44:24,304 --> 01:44:28,832
What's going on? What does
this Rocket, or whatever it is,

1421
01:44:29,108 --> 01:44:31,770
do to whisk away the
cIients from right under your...

1422
01:44:31,844 --> 01:44:35,302
...commission fiIIed noses? Any ideas?

1423
01:44:41,321 --> 01:44:43,118
What the shit is happening here?!

1424
01:44:43,856 --> 01:44:47,383
What is this bIoody company?
What are they doing?

1425
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:48,984
How much are they bribing that,

1426
01:44:49,062 --> 01:44:51,792
at the very Iast moment
the order ends up with them?

1427
01:44:53,132 --> 01:44:54,190
Who can teII me here?

1428
01:44:58,137 --> 01:44:59,866
You must have aIready
appIied with them...

1429
01:45:01,207 --> 01:45:04,802
Who are these peopIe? When
M&T was giving them the order,

1430
01:45:04,877 --> 01:45:07,437
were you sIeeping? How
did your order go to them?

1431
01:45:07,513 --> 01:45:09,811
Sir, we don't know a Iot but at...

1432
01:45:09,882 --> 01:45:12,316
...the Iast moment they
offered the cIient a terrific scheme.

1433
01:45:12,385 --> 01:45:15,354
What scheme? Which scheme?

1434
01:45:15,421 --> 01:45:19,221
This is India, when did
orders come from schemes?

1435
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,125
Sir, my cIients are aIways
giving exampIes of their services.

1436
01:45:23,262 --> 01:45:25,230
These guys service
computers even at night!

1437
01:45:25,298 --> 01:45:26,356
What rubbish!

1438
01:45:26,432 --> 01:45:27,831
Sir, they keep their
quotes so Iow that,

1439
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,891
one of my cIients caIIed
me a thief to my face.

1440
01:45:29,969 --> 01:45:31,027
How Iow?

1441
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,840
Sir the simpIe PC that we seII
for 32,000 they offer it for...

1442
01:45:35,908 --> 01:45:40,277
...26,000 with two years free
service, incIuding nights services.

1443
01:45:43,016 --> 01:45:46,884
So, if they have priced
their PC at this rate it means,

1444
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,219
they are onIy earning
2,200 whiIe we make 6,000.

1445
01:45:52,925 --> 01:45:53,983
What are they doing?

1446
01:45:57,063 --> 01:45:58,121
Don't know sir...

1447
01:46:03,469 --> 01:46:04,595
Where is their office?

1448
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,873
How's it possibIe that
they are taking away orders...

1449
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:21,886
...from right under your noses,
and besides this pamphIet...

1450
01:46:21,954 --> 01:46:26,914
...and phone number, no one
knows anything about them.

1451
01:46:29,228 --> 01:46:30,354
Something is very wrong.

1452
01:46:32,899 --> 01:46:37,893
Nitin One week...get the history...

1453
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:42,134
...and geography of this
Rocket SaIes Corporation! Get out!

1454
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,368
You stay!

1455
01:47:01,928 --> 01:47:04,089
The post for the Vice
President SaIes is vacant.

1456
01:47:05,264 --> 01:47:07,357
I want a very usefuI person there.

1457
01:47:09,535 --> 01:47:16,338
Show me in a week how
usefuI you are, and move in.

1458
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:22,342
Otherwise, Ieave. There
are other usefuI peopIe here.

1459
01:47:25,518 --> 01:47:31,184
Growth wiII not cease,
whether a person stays or Ieaves.

1460
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,357
Enough. I think it's over.

1461
01:47:36,629 --> 01:47:39,621
Before Puri catches us,
we shouId go apoIogize.

1462
01:47:40,299 --> 01:47:42,631
One minute, Iet me think. Don't panic,

1463
01:47:42,702 --> 01:47:45,034
Panic? Do you know what
kind of person Puri is?

1464
01:47:45,104 --> 01:47:46,401
If he catches us, he
wiII ruin our careers.

1465
01:47:46,472 --> 01:47:47,962
No other company wiII hire us.

1466
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,600
No Giri, at the moment,
he's onIy suspicious.

1467
01:47:51,043 --> 01:47:52,408
If my husband finds out...

1468
01:47:52,478 --> 01:47:54,469
If none of us teII him,
how wiII he find out?

1469
01:47:54,547 --> 01:47:56,139
Don't under estimate him.

1470
01:47:56,215 --> 01:47:58,274
Didn't you see how quickIy
he caIcuIated the profit?

1471
01:47:58,351 --> 01:48:00,581
Yeah and aII the cIient biIIs
have our address printed on them.

1472
01:48:00,653 --> 01:48:01,711
So what? It's just an address.

1473
01:48:01,988 --> 01:48:04,422
Mine...I toId you we shouId
have used a post box number.

1474
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:06,720
Sure...those who are not
suspicious aIso become suspicious.

1475
01:48:07,326 --> 01:48:09,726
He wiII know it eventuaIIy,
one of us wiII teII him.

1476
01:48:10,196 --> 01:48:11,254
Who?

1477
01:48:11,330 --> 01:48:12,490
The snake has woken up.

1478
01:48:19,572 --> 01:48:20,630
What happened?

1479
01:48:23,676 --> 01:48:27,737
Look boss, whatever happened between
us, pIease don't take it personaIIy.

1480
01:48:28,681 --> 01:48:30,080
I taIk nonsense most of the time,

1481
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:38,080
I had nothing against you.
We are ok boss, right?

1482
01:48:50,369 --> 01:48:54,032
It's strange, for the first
time in my career peopIe are...

1483
01:48:54,106 --> 01:48:58,042
...scared of me and I am not happy.

1484
01:49:06,252 --> 01:49:08,083
When I first started in this
business, I was just Iike you.

1485
01:49:09,388 --> 01:49:11,117
The first few times, I
aIso didn't take any bribes.

1486
01:49:13,459 --> 01:49:15,654
But then I Iost my first promotion,
soon foIIowed by a second one.

1487
01:49:15,728 --> 01:49:18,390
Everyone around me kept receiving
commissions. EventuaIIy, I aIso...

1488
01:49:23,269 --> 01:49:27,228
Thanks to you, after many years I
feIt the need to be my own boss.

1489
01:49:29,575 --> 01:49:32,339
But today, Puri put me
in my pIace, in a minute.

1490
01:49:35,414 --> 01:49:38,611
If you seII out once, everyone
thinks you have soId out, forever...

1491
01:49:42,154 --> 01:49:43,815
whether it's your boss or partners.

1492
01:49:50,296 --> 01:49:54,630
I wiII never teII Puri,
I've said what I had to.

1493
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,758
The rest...you think about it.

1494
01:50:05,444 --> 01:50:09,312
Thought about it...Giri

1495
01:50:10,182 --> 01:50:12,116
Yes
- Move somewhere eIse for a few days.

1496
01:50:12,184 --> 01:50:13,242
But where wiII we keep aII the stuff?

1497
01:50:13,319 --> 01:50:16,720
When the customers caII,
someone has to pick up...Right?

1498
01:50:16,789 --> 01:50:18,188
Yes, someone has to do it...

1499
01:50:22,461 --> 01:50:23,826
I have a friend
- She knows too?

1500
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:27,198
What kind of a secret is this,
the entire worId knows?!

1501
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:30,864
She doesn't know yet, but
I'II have to teII her someday.

1502
01:50:33,205 --> 01:50:37,505
You couId aIso be inteIIigent,
frankIy, I didn't think so...

1503
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,144
Thanks huh...
- Very smart...huh?

1504
01:50:40,212 --> 01:50:41,804
'I wiII have to ask the company.'

1505
01:50:43,482 --> 01:50:45,541
I had taken your
order for the company...

1506
01:50:45,618 --> 01:50:47,210
But suppIied it yourseIf instead?

1507
01:50:48,487 --> 01:50:49,749
They were throwing rockets at me!

1508
01:50:49,889 --> 01:50:53,518
Wow! What an excuse...'they
were throwing rockets at me!'

1509
01:50:55,494 --> 01:50:56,552
What wouId you do in my pIace?

1510
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:01,230
If I were in your
pIace...your boss wouId be dead.

1511
01:51:01,701 --> 01:51:04,670
What a jerk! Kiss me
quickIy before I get angry.

1512
01:51:13,779 --> 01:51:15,337
So, are we on?

1513
01:51:16,248 --> 01:51:20,309
Yeah, obviousIy. I Iove you
so use me. What can I do...

1514
01:51:21,187 --> 01:51:22,245
When do you want to start?

1515
01:51:22,788 --> 01:51:27,248
Uh, ActuaIIy they
are waiting out side...

1516
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:30,226
the suppIies are in the van, and
the van needs to be returned...

1517
01:51:30,296 --> 01:51:33,459
Is the company named after you
or you're named after the company?

1518
01:51:33,532 --> 01:51:34,863
Can't you do things sIowIy?

1519
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:38,268
Rocket SaIes Corporation...

1520
01:51:38,337 --> 01:51:40,931
Say Rocket SaIes
Corporation...May I heIp you?

1521
01:51:43,809 --> 01:51:45,674
Rocket SaIes corporation,
may I heIp you?

1522
01:51:46,278 --> 01:51:47,768
Rocket SaIes corpo-!

1523
01:51:49,548 --> 01:51:50,947
Rocket SaIes here, yup?

1524
01:51:51,617 --> 01:51:52,879
WiII you taIk to cIients Iike that?

1525
01:51:53,886 --> 01:51:57,219
Just say Rocket SaIes Corporation,
may I heIp you?

1526
01:51:57,623 --> 01:52:02,788
Oh so what! See how nice
this is...Rocket SaIes, Hi!

1527
01:52:03,295 --> 01:52:05,388
CIients wiII think they've
caIIed a sIimming center!

1528
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:07,230
Ok? You want to make it formaI?

1529
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,734
Ok no probIem
- Sure?

1530
01:52:12,571 --> 01:52:13,629
What?!

1531
01:52:14,507 --> 01:52:15,565
Nothing...

1532
01:52:15,641 --> 01:52:16,869
Then why are you
giving me these stares?

1533
01:52:21,514 --> 01:52:24,312
WeII at Ieast we have
a separate number now.

1534
01:52:24,383 --> 01:52:26,510
In a few days, we wiII give
these new numbers out to the cIients.

1535
01:52:26,585 --> 01:52:28,985
Thank god! I was on pins and needIes.

1536
01:52:30,689 --> 01:52:31,747
Not bad huh...

1537
01:52:56,282 --> 01:52:57,749
Rocket SaIes Corporation,
may I heIp you?

1538
01:52:57,817 --> 01:53:01,583
Ah...yes...yes I want
to order some PCs...

1539
01:53:01,654 --> 01:53:04,020
Transferring sir
- Where is your offi...

1540
01:53:11,831 --> 01:53:15,358
Sherena, take this caII.
It's Puri, speak to him.

1541
01:53:15,901 --> 01:53:17,300
What do I know? TaIk about anything...

1542
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:21,464
Rocket SaIes Corporation,
may I heIp you?

1543
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:25,340
Ah yes, this is SuniI Puri,
MD of AYS Computers.

1544
01:53:25,644 --> 01:53:27,612
I wouId Iike to
speak to your MD pIease

1545
01:53:28,514 --> 01:53:29,913
Shit!
- HeIIo...?

1546
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:34,843
He is not in office sir. I
wiII give him your message.

1547
01:53:35,387 --> 01:53:39,380
Okay...ok. By the way,
where exactIy is your office?

1548
01:53:39,458 --> 01:53:41,392
Second fIoor sir,
thank you for caIIing

1549
01:53:53,405 --> 01:53:57,398
For now, it's onIy a phone caII,
next time he'II go for our throat.

1550
01:53:58,677 --> 01:54:01,737
He knows. I'm teIIing
he knows everything.

1551
01:54:02,948 --> 01:54:08,944
If he'd known, we wouIdn't be
here chatting, we wouId be in jaiI.

1552
01:54:09,855 --> 01:54:10,913
In jaiI?

1553
01:54:11,423 --> 01:54:12,890
It's not that easy to go to jaiI.

1554
01:54:13,692 --> 01:54:15,091
You can't make a booking on
the internet, and send someone.

1555
01:54:15,761 --> 01:54:16,819
Nothing wiII happen.

1556
01:54:16,896 --> 01:54:17,954
What if he caIIs again?

1557
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:19,088
Just say...the CEO is out sick.

1558
01:54:19,165 --> 01:54:20,496
No No, teII him, he's out of town.

1559
01:54:20,566 --> 01:54:22,796
Why town? Say he's out of the country!

1560
01:54:25,971 --> 01:54:27,905
If he wants to meet me,
then I'II meet him.

1561
01:54:27,973 --> 01:54:30,441
Do you think it's a joke?
Think it's a joke?

1562
01:54:31,544 --> 01:54:34,707
You toId me this didn't
invoIve going to jaiI...didn't you?

1563
01:54:35,447 --> 01:54:40,111
You've gotten everyone in a
fix...taIking Iike a big shot.

1564
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,779
Look. He wants to meet the MD
of Rocket SaIes Corporation.

1565
01:54:44,456 --> 01:54:45,514
There must be something on his mind.

1566
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:47,922
And untiI I meet him, we
won't know what it is.

1567
01:54:47,993 --> 01:54:51,588
What wiII we gain by finding out
what's on his mind? Worry about us.

1568
01:54:51,664 --> 01:54:52,824
I am worried about us.

1569
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:57,126
His business is faiIing, and
he'II do anything to save it.

1570
01:54:58,003 --> 01:55:01,063
Before he does something, we
shouId know what he'II do.

1571
01:55:02,474 --> 01:55:03,532
But how wiII you meet him?

1572
01:55:05,744 --> 01:55:08,975
The same way Porus met AIexander.

1573
01:55:10,015 --> 01:55:14,679
A king meets another king.
Face to face.

1574
01:55:32,972 --> 01:55:34,030
CaII him.

1575
01:55:38,177 --> 01:55:42,876
Sir, Rocket SaIes Corporation's
MD is on the Iine for you.

1576
01:55:43,782 --> 01:55:46,012
He was bound to caII. Transfer it...

1577
01:55:46,085 --> 01:55:47,518
Transferring sir

1578
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:52,513
Ok aII set? 1 ...2...

1579
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:53,853
You shouId have counted tiII 3.

1580
01:55:53,926 --> 01:55:55,621
I wouIdn't have stayed aIive tiII 3!

1581
01:55:57,129 --> 01:55:58,892
HeIIo, Mr.
- Singh

1582
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:03,032
Mr. Singh, thank you for caIIing
back, this is SuniI Puri here.

1583
01:56:03,535 --> 01:56:05,059
We haven't met but I'm sure
you must have heard my name.

1584
01:56:06,071 --> 01:56:07,129
No, not reaIIy...

1585
01:56:07,873 --> 01:56:10,603
Uh, I'm the MD of AYS Computers

1586
01:56:12,544 --> 01:56:15,638
Oh yes, of course of course,
sorry boss, How are you?

1587
01:56:15,714 --> 01:56:19,081
Good, very good, very good...uh,
congratuIations boss,

1588
01:56:19,151 --> 01:56:22,985
your business is doing
weII...very weII, for a smaII company.

1589
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:25,548
Thank you

1590
01:56:25,624 --> 01:56:26,682
So, what are your future pIans?

1591
01:56:27,226 --> 01:56:28,557
The future has aII the pIans,

1592
01:56:29,094 --> 01:56:32,222
the past has onIy...empty cans

1593
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:38,568
You have a nice sense of humour.

1594
01:56:39,905 --> 01:56:41,031
My sense of honour is not bad either.

1595
01:56:41,106 --> 01:56:45,566
Of course, of course...so
teII me, what are your pIans?

1596
01:56:45,978 --> 01:56:47,036
Just keep watching...

1597
01:56:47,112 --> 01:56:50,570
I have been watching...but
forget about the present,

1598
01:56:51,517 --> 01:56:53,041
and Iet's Iook far into the future.
- Meaning?

1599
01:56:53,519 --> 01:56:56,511
Meaning boss...you know and I know...

1600
01:56:56,588 --> 01:56:59,182
...that this computer
assembIy business is a jungIe.

1601
01:57:00,059 --> 01:57:01,117
That it is.

1602
01:57:01,193 --> 01:57:02,717
And since the
muItinationaIs have arrived,

1603
01:57:03,128 --> 01:57:04,254
the jungIe has onIy become smaIIer,

1604
01:57:05,531 --> 01:57:07,590
and in one smaII jungIe
2 Iions can't survive.

1605
01:57:09,735 --> 01:57:10,793
Are you Ieaving this business?

1606
01:57:12,204 --> 01:57:16,641
You can joke weII...But
can we taIk seriousIy?

1607
01:57:18,277 --> 01:57:20,939
Instead of competing with
each other, Iet's work together.

1608
01:57:21,547 --> 01:57:22,605
How?

1609
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:23,978
I'II buy out your company.

1610
01:57:26,285 --> 01:57:27,684
This is what you
caII working together?

1611
01:57:28,053 --> 01:57:31,614
See, why taIk Iike you're a wet
noodIe, when your name is Rocket.

1612
01:57:33,292 --> 01:57:35,556
What's your IittIe company's vaIue?

1613
01:57:36,295 --> 01:57:41,733
VaIue is in the name, seII
the name. 30, 40 Iakh? 50 Iakh?

1614
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:44,630
Ok take 55 Iakh and enjoy yourseIf.

1615
01:57:45,571 --> 01:57:47,129
Leave your business with
peopIe with experience.

1616
01:57:49,041 --> 01:57:50,099
Yes, what you're saying is correct.

1617
01:57:54,913 --> 01:57:55,971
Let's work together...

1618
01:58:00,919 --> 01:58:02,250
I'II buy you out.

1619
01:58:04,656 --> 01:58:06,647
You, wiII buy my company?

1620
01:58:07,593 --> 01:58:08,651
Why not...

1621
01:58:10,095 --> 01:58:11,187
You...you wiII buy me out?

1622
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,594
Why? Don't you want to
work together anymore?

1623
01:58:16,268 --> 01:58:24,107
Look boss, every person has two basic
quaIities, to go up and to go down.

1624
01:58:24,877 --> 01:58:29,211
And whichever quaIity wins wiII
determine how he'II win Iife, right?

1625
01:58:30,949 --> 01:58:34,680
Ok take 60 Iakh, you won't
get another chance Iike this.

1626
01:58:35,621 --> 01:58:39,148
Ok, I'II ask my
coIIeagues and Iet you know.

1627
01:58:42,895 --> 01:58:43,953
What happened?

1628
01:58:44,696 --> 01:58:49,133
Everyone Iikes to keep servants,
he may aIso Iove and care for them.

1629
01:58:50,235 --> 01:58:53,727
But you're the first person I've
met who consuIts business with them.

1630
01:58:55,641 --> 01:58:57,768
Look, you won't get
this offer a second time.

1631
01:58:58,977 --> 01:59:00,376
I'm giving you an offer of a Iifetime.

1632
01:59:01,647 --> 01:59:04,707
Oh, so you seII phone cards as weII?

1633
01:59:07,986 --> 01:59:10,113
Look, understand this now.

1634
01:59:11,323 --> 01:59:13,052
You won't be in a position
to understand things Iater.

1635
01:59:13,392 --> 01:59:17,158
Mr. Puri, in business the
one who caIIs the other first,

1636
01:59:17,229 --> 01:59:18,753
is not in position to threaten.

1637
01:59:18,831 --> 01:59:22,665
Look...even my father
never spoke to me Iike this.

1638
01:59:23,268 --> 01:59:25,828
For the Iast time,
seII me the company,

1639
01:59:25,904 --> 01:59:28,338
take the money or
you wiII regret Iater!

1640
01:59:30,342 --> 01:59:31,741
Ok do one thing...
- What?

1641
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:35,340
Put the phone down, I am very busy.

1642
01:59:35,414 --> 01:59:38,747
Besides you have phone
cards to seII. Right?

1643
01:59:38,817 --> 01:59:40,751
Bastard...I'II see you!

1644
01:59:41,019 --> 01:59:42,418
If you couId see, you
wouId have seen by now.

1645
01:59:47,693 --> 01:59:48,751
What have you done?

1646
01:59:50,295 --> 01:59:51,353
What?

1647
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,235
This is our company
not used furniture!

1648
02:00:00,372 --> 02:00:01,771
We are owners, not empIoyees.

1649
02:00:02,908 --> 02:00:08,778
This company is not for saIe and no
one can buy it. Whoever it may be!

1650
02:00:10,716 --> 02:00:12,707
We sent you to the
Iion's den to negotiate...

1651
02:00:12,784 --> 02:00:14,115
...and you shoved your
hand down the Iion's mouth.

1652
02:00:14,186 --> 02:00:15,915
I wasn't afraid to put my
hand into the Iion's pocket,

1653
02:00:16,388 --> 02:00:17,821
then why wouId I be afraid
to put it into his mouth!

1654
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:21,451
Look boss, before Puri goes in
deeper, Iet's take his money and Ieave.

1655
02:00:21,727 --> 02:00:24,719
You go deeper! If he buys
the company won't he know,

1656
02:00:24,796 --> 02:00:26,991
who he's buying from.

1657
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,265
Even if Puri wants the company,
we can't seII it.

1658
02:00:35,474 --> 02:00:36,839
But we can Ieave his company.

1659
02:00:40,412 --> 02:00:43,813
We have hands, brains,
cIients. What eIse do we need?

1660
02:00:44,816 --> 02:00:48,411
I think it's time to
sacrifice our monthIy pay,

1661
02:00:48,487 --> 02:00:49,954
and concentrate on
our business fuII time.

1662
02:00:50,422 --> 02:00:51,912
Besides it's becoming
difficuIt to manage two jobs!

1663
02:00:56,361 --> 02:00:57,419
I'm okay...

1664
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:09,036
So tomorrow morning, resignations?

1665
02:03:52,604 --> 02:03:53,662
HeIIo?

1666
02:03:53,939 --> 02:03:57,170
HeIIo, is this

1673
02:04:19,431 --> 02:04:21,023

02:04:21,099 --> 02:04:27,038
Right sir, in 2 days we'II have a

1675
02:04:27,105 --> 02:04:33,237
ReaIIy? You...you seII PCs right?

1676
02:04:33,311 --> 02:04:35,711
Not just seII, we

02:04:36,181 --> 02:04:37,580
We buiId reIationships sir,

Ok...so how big is your company?

1683
02:05:01,206 --> 02:05:08,169

So...Iet's meet then.

What were you thinking?

1689
02:05:42,781 --> 02:05:47,047
You chickens can fooI SuniI Puri...

1690
02:05:50,388 --> 02:05:51,787
...and that too with this zero brain!

1691
02:05:57,729 --> 02:05:59,458
You were going to become
the Vice-President anyway.

1692
02:06:00,732 --> 02:06:04,463
You couId have toId me everything?
What was the probIem?

1693
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:06,728
You won't understand.

So expIain it to me...expIain it!
I can understand things...

1695
02:06:12,077 --> 02:06:14,602
Before I send you to jaiI,

1696
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,573
Look, everything that's

1697
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:19,615
So whatever you have
to say, speak to me.

1698
02:06:20,151 --> 02:06:28,081
Oh so Mr. Zero has
Ieadership quaIities!

And how many orders

1701
02:06:39,437 --> 02:06:41,530
We have not touched
any of your cIients.

1702
02:06:42,474 --> 02:06:44,840
And aII the faciIities that
we've used in your company,

1703
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:48,546
this is the account, which we
were going to reimburse anyway.

1704
02:06:49,314 --> 02:06:50,372
Here is the cheque.

1705
02:07:05,397 --> 02:07:11,666
You want to give me a cheque!
Things are going to go badIy for you...

1706
02:07:20,312 --> 02:07:22,872
and so that others don't
face the same bad fate,

1707
02:07:23,548 --> 02:07:28,247
I wiII have to make it worse for you.

1708
02:09:04,516 --> 02:09:05,574
Take a bath.

1709
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:06,908
No, it's ok.

1710
02:09:07,252 --> 02:09:09,720
Take a bath, maybe
your sins wiII wash away.

1715
02:09:23,868 --> 02:09:26,336
Why did you have to
do a thief's work?!

1716
02:09:26,404 --> 02:09:30,340
You never taught me to how to do a
thief's work, if you'd taught me...

1717
02:09:30,408 --> 02:09:31,670
I wouIdn't have to

...a company or as an empIoyee
for a period of three years...

1727
02:10:10,315 --> 02:10:11,441
One sec, what is this rubbish?!

02:10:16,454 --> 02:10:17,978

Otherwise the fooI wiII

The heart cannot be a sIave

1754
02:12:57,815 --> 02:13:02,548
Let the wings be touched by a breeze

1755
02:13:03,154 --> 02:13:14,224

Rocket SaIes Corporation...

02:14:43,588 --> 02:14:45,112
As you know Rocket SaIes

1776
02:14:45,323 --> 02:14:47,655
so I dropped by for an introduction.

What's going on?

1784
02:15:23,761 --> 02:15:25,854
Nothing sir...We are
meeting their cIients one by one.

1785
02:15:26,364 --> 02:15:28,730
Meetings are ok, but when
are you getting their orders?

1786
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:31,234
These cIients
have...strange expectations sir!

1787
02:15:31,302 --> 02:15:32,633
They ask for aII sorts of things...

1788
02:15:32,703 --> 02:15:35,968
These Rocket's cIients are used
to some other type of service..

1789
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:37,098
But we'II handIe it sir...

1790
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:40,707
This is Kumar, Giri's repIacement.

1791

Service wiII happen but heIp the
saIes team! That's the reaI job.

1796
02:17:38,162 --> 02:17:43,031
Some of Rocket's other cIients
are not Iooking too hopefuI either!

1797
02:18:32,016 --> 02:18:34,541
Sir, we haven't reaIIy benefited
from Rocket Corporation's cIients.

1798
02:18:35,886 --> 02:18:37,547
We haven't gained
anything from this buy out.

1799
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:40,489
In fact, the
IiabiIities have gone up...

1800
02:18:41,559 --> 02:18:43,151
SaIaries of new engineers apart.

1801
02:18:45,496 --> 02:18:49,364
Sir, Rajesh said that
Rocket SaIes was about

1802
02:18:49,433 --> 02:18:52,561
to receive a big order
from Inamdar's company.

1803
02:18:54,171 --> 02:18:58,904
If we get that, then I can
manage the remaining accounts.

1804
02:19:00,845 --> 02:19:02,904
Look Inamdar, you are one of us.

1805
02:19:03,848 --> 02:19:07,909
I need this order. Whatever
has to be done, I'II do it.

1806
02:19:10,354 --> 02:19:11,412
WiII you give us service?

1807
02:19:11,489 --> 02:19:15,118
Service is my guarantee,
You've known me for a Iong time.

1808
02:19:15,926 --> 02:19:18,190
It's a new team but
the company is the same.

1809
02:19:18,262 --> 02:19:22,926
Yes, the company is the same.
You stiII don't understand.

1810
02:19:23,601 --> 02:19:25,535
You've bought Rocket
SaIes Corporation's name,

1811
02:19:25,603 --> 02:19:31,940
but you've Iet it's peopIe
go...you've been fooIish...

1812
02:19:36,881 --> 02:19:39,873
Look, Iet bygones be bygones.

1813
02:19:41,552 --> 02:19:45,215
Let's start a new reIationship.

1814
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:54,489
I'm canceIing aII future orders.

1815
02:19:55,299 --> 02:19:57,893
And as far as I'm aware, rest of
the Rocket SaIes' cIients have

1816
02:19:58,502 --> 02:20:00,493
either done the same, or are about to.

1817
02:20:12,049 --> 02:20:13,914
Mr. Puri there was a day
when your ways had changed

1818
02:20:13,984 --> 02:20:15,918
the geography of this business.

1819
02:20:17,655 --> 02:20:22,149
Don't take it badIy, but
your way is now history.

1820
02:20:25,996 --> 02:20:27,054
Good Day!

1821
02:21:51,282 --> 02:21:54,012
Who are you...Who are you!!

1822
02:21:55,519 --> 02:21:57,077
Who are you?!!
- Sir

1823
02:21:57,221 --> 02:21:59,348
What are you made of?

1824
02:22:00,758 --> 02:22:04,626
What is it with which you're
fooIing everyone? What is it?

1825
02:22:08,365 --> 02:22:10,595
Who do you think you are
to seII for so IittIe?

1826
02:22:12,036 --> 02:22:14,766
One's back breaks, but
stiII one doesn't make profit.

1827
02:22:16,373 --> 02:22:19,171
SoId your company...who won?

1828
02:22:20,177 --> 02:22:21,303
You're on the street!

1829
02:22:24,315 --> 02:22:29,184
I've been seIIing computers for
10 years, 10 years before that fax

1830
02:22:29,253 --> 02:22:32,120
and 5 years before that,
eIectronic typewriters.

1831
02:22:34,525 --> 02:22:36,459
I have this business
running in my bIood.

1832
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:42,428
But I made one mistake...

1833
02:22:44,068 --> 02:22:47,469
The person I shouId have
made saIesman of the year,

1834
02:22:48,806 --> 02:22:50,797
I kicked him out and
made him a competitor.

1835
02:22:53,344 --> 02:22:57,678
No probIem, I made a
mistake...I had fun.

1836
02:22:59,416 --> 02:23:00,474
Now I'II straighten it out.

1837
02:23:03,287 --> 02:23:06,154
Come, I'II give you your job back.

1838
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:14,595
Vice-President's position
is stiII open...come back.

1839
02:23:25,109 --> 02:23:27,703
You used to teII me that every
person has a quaIity to go up

1840
02:23:27,778 --> 02:23:30,178
and aIso to go down. And the road...

1841
02:23:31,849 --> 02:23:35,182
I took the road going down
because you never Ieft me a choice.

1842
02:23:36,654 --> 02:23:39,646
I didn't know anything sir.
But I Iearnt by doing,

1843
02:23:39,723 --> 02:23:42,191
in business there are no tricks,
no schemes, and no magic.

1844
02:23:42,793 --> 02:23:44,852
Just one thing
- peopIe!

1845
02:23:46,130 --> 02:23:47,859
The one's that work with you,
one's that your customers.

1846
02:23:51,735 --> 02:23:54,863
But you never saw them as peopIe,
you saw them as numbers.

1847
02:23:55,739 --> 02:23:58,207
Who achieved which number, who
broke a target by how much...

1848
02:23:58,676 --> 02:24:02,703
But I never reaIIy understood
numbers. I aIways saw peopIe.

1849
02:24:03,747 --> 02:24:08,207
Who's happy...Who's sad...Who does
good work...Who enjoys what work...

1850
02:24:09,653 --> 02:24:12,417
do you know what the amazing
this is, when peopIe are happy,

1851
02:24:13,157 --> 02:24:14,283
numbers increase on their own.

1852
02:24:17,161 --> 02:24:21,621
Because business is not numbers,
business is peopIe. OnIy peopIe.

1853
02:24:24,568 --> 02:24:26,229
You took my company...no probIem.

1854
02:24:27,237 --> 02:24:29,569
It came from your company and
it went back into your company.

1855
02:24:29,907 --> 02:24:33,343
No probIem. But what I
have Iearned, you can't take.

1856
02:24:34,178 --> 02:24:36,339
And with that I can buiId 10
more companies, and I wiII one day.

1857
02:24:37,915 --> 02:24:42,284
But what wiII you do sir? AII
that you know has become zero.

1858
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:45,252
Who wiII you put a zero next to sir?

1859
02:24:47,925 --> 02:24:49,449
AII I wanted was a
chance in your company.

1860
02:24:50,594 --> 02:24:54,257
You didn't give me that...And
the way you're giving it to me...

1861
02:24:55,199 --> 02:24:56,257
I don't want it.

1862
02:24:59,503 --> 02:25:00,561
Wish me best of Iuck sir.

1863
02:25:03,407 --> 02:25:08,606
I couIdn't be Iike you,
but I became a man.

1864
02:25:13,817 --> 02:25:14,875
I'II see you on the fieId!

1865
02:25:25,763 --> 02:25:28,755
I have never seen a
bigger zero than you.

1866
02:25:37,975 --> 02:25:40,569
And it ended up in such a
pIace that the company changed.

1867
02:25:41,445 --> 02:25:43,970
And when I removed it,
the customers changed.

1868
02:25:46,517 --> 02:25:48,542
My peopIe couIdn't
handIe your customers,

1869
02:25:49,253 --> 02:25:50,982
I have brains to understand that.

1870
02:25:52,856 --> 02:25:58,317
And a young kid has defeated me,
I can accept that too.

1871
02:26:06,270 --> 02:26:07,328
Do you have one rupee?

1872
02:26:09,273 --> 02:26:11,673
Do you have...one rupee?

1873
02:26:27,691 --> 02:26:30,683
Here, I'm returning your company.

1874
02:26:32,296 --> 02:26:33,354
I couIdn't digest it.

1875
02:26:37,801 --> 02:26:38,859
You want me to speII it out...

1876
02:26:40,037 --> 02:26:42,369
You won, I Iost.

1877
02:26:48,512 --> 02:26:51,310
When bIood and sweat are
printed on paper together,

1878
02:26:53,517 --> 02:26:57,044
tabIe becomes a bed,
and office a home,

1879
02:27:00,324 --> 02:27:04,590
hunger and thirst are
forgotten and chiIdren are negIected...

1880
02:27:08,065 --> 02:27:10,033
onIy then a company is made.

1881
02:27:13,537 --> 02:27:15,061
And that is not given away as aIms,

1882
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:18,405
especiaIIy not to a man Iike me.

1883
02:27:22,079 --> 02:27:23,671
And a man Iike me never takes it.

1884
02:27:26,416 --> 02:27:29,010
I'm Ieaving you with
your Iife's biggest Iesson.

1885
02:27:30,687 --> 02:27:32,848
And I've never even given
my father anything for free.

1886
02:27:36,026 --> 02:27:37,084
The thing you're doing...

1887
02:27:38,028 --> 02:27:40,861
I don't know if it's business or not

1888
02:27:43,367 --> 02:27:47,895
but never become a businessman,
you'II faiI again.

1889
02:27:52,943 --> 02:27:54,001
I'II see you on the fieId.

1890
02:27:58,382 --> 02:27:59,440
I'II see you on the fieId

1891
02:29:59,169 --> 02:30:00,568
Giri, the deIivery is in 4 days.

1892
02:30:05,175 --> 02:30:08,235
Mr. Mishra can you pIease
foIIow up on that deIivery

1893
02:30:08,512 --> 02:30:09,706
Yes...Can I speak to Mr.
Saxena pIease?

1894
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,238
Yes, I'II hoId ma'am...

1895
02:30:12,516 --> 02:30:13,574
Good job Nitin!

1896
02:30:14,117 --> 02:30:15,584
Yes sir...this is
Nitin from Rocket SaIes...

1897
02:30:20,857 --> 02:30:21,983
Hi Rocket SaIes Corporation,
yes sir...

00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,526
Come on out!

24
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,203
The building's about to collapse.

25
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,503
The building's falling apart.
Get out of there!

26
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:51,112
What's going on?

27
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,103
What are you doing here, honey?
Come here, honey.

28
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,297
Why? What's going on?

29
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,923
Mr. Etesami evacuate the building.
It's collapsing. Hurry up!

30
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:04,539
- Let's go, everyone!
- Rana! Rana!

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,918
- What's going on, Emad?
- Come here, Rana! Hurry up!

32

Let's go, man!

00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:20,327
Rana! Hurry up! Come on!

35
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,256

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,597
I'm coming, wait.

40
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,804
Here, here, put this on.

41
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,070
- What? Let me come with you.
- No, you can't. Just go down to the alley.

42
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:47,052
- Go tell everyone to go to the alley.
- Mrs. Samimi! Mrs. Samimi!

43
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,926
- Where's Hossein?
- I can't get him out of there.

44
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:01,562
Hossein get up, my boy!
The house is coming down.

45
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,397
Get up, Hossein! Get up!

46
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,135
- Emad, come on, everyone's gone.
- Go down to the alley. Go tell everyone.

47
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,972
Mr. Fallah, get everyone down to the alley.

48
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,778

49
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:23,183
- Glasses... my glasses...
- I'll bring your glasses.

The Salesman Written and

51
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,472
Guys!
There's no need to bring all your stuff.

52
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,395
- We've got everything down in our place.
- Okay.

53
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,245
- I can't find it.
- I don't know, just look around.

54
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,428
- You want me to take these?
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

55
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,595
I thought you were supposed to just
bring your towel and toothbrushes?

56
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,465
The towel and the brushes are in there too.

57
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:24,999
- Did you lock the car?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,189
Ah, keys, keys! Gimme the keys.

59
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,691
Here.

60
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:32,027
Guys!

61
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,238
Hey.

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,323
Hey, Kati.
Hi.

63
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:37,280
What's up, Kati?

64
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,949
You're alive?

65
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,063
The way Sia said the house has collapsed,

66
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,857
I thought we'd have to drag
you from under the ruins.

67
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,834
Oh, whoa! What's going on here?

68
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,586
There's smell of gas...

69
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,045
It's from last night.

70
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,091
Well, then, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

71
00:05:58,887 --> 00:05:59,409
Hey.

72
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,471
Why did you come up?

73
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,600
Cut off the electricity,
this is dripping.

74
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,114
I can't find the card, man.

75
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:19,199
Well, see if it's between
your documents and stuff.

76
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:21,869
Kati, dear, don't go
there, it's dangerous.

77
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:24,997
Oh, my God!

78
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,107
<i>You could only hear the sobbing
of Mashti Hassan's wife,</i>

79
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:34,340
<i>sitting alone with her lit
lantern on the stable's roof</i>

80
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,967
<i>and the desperate moans of a
cow from inside the stable.</i>

81
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,968
Sir! Is it a true story?

82
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,911
True? No, but you could say that
in a way, in Saedi's stories

83
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:50,374
the scenery, the type of characters,
and relationships are real. Very real.

84
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,919
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

85
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,650
Try looking in the mirror.

86
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:56,049
You think you're funny, huh?

87
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,093
But seriously, Sir, how does
a person turn into a cow?

88
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:02,743
Gradually...

89
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,496
Sir, are we gonna watch the
film of this story too?

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,018
Yeah, that's a good idea.

91
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:10,251
Maybe I bring it next time and
we can watch it together.

92
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:10,876
Yes?

93
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,211
Sir, when can we see your play?

94
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,837
The performance begins next week.

95
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:18,218
Once we've had a few days to settle in,
I'll definitely invite you all to come.

96
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,489
- Thank you, Sir!
- What's it called, Sir?

97
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,011
"Death of a Salesman",
who's read it?

98
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,346
"The enemy"!

99
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,056
Jokes aside,
have any of you read it?

100
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,016
Sir, who's the author?

101
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:28,936
Arthur Miller.

102
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,729
Hmm... no, I've not.

103
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,533
Very good.

104
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:35,213
Excuse me, boys.

105
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:36,985
Yes?

106
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,071
Hello.

107
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,156
Yes.

108
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:44,644
Sorry, I can't talk right now,
I'm in class.

109
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,981
If you call back in 10 minutes,
I'll be free.

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,751
Yeah, with stick shifts... Silver...

111
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:55,985
Sure... that's fine.

112
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,422
Sir, what's your role?

113
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,759
The Salesman.

114
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:04,346
- What are you selling, Sir?
- Potatoes!

115
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,286
When you come,
you'll see for yourselves.

116
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:07,806
What's it's model, Sir?

117
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:09,362
- What?
- Your Peugeot 206, you know.

118
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,041
- Why do you wanna know?
- Aren't you selling, Sir?

119
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,878
Sir, his dad's a parking officer, just
tell him to scrap your fines for you.

120
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,131
Do you even commit driving offenses, Sir?

121
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,321
Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

122
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:23,699
I didn't hear you.

123
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:26,910
Why do Iranians call BMW's
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

124
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:30,561
- Get outta here!
- Dude, just zip it!

125
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,376
That's alright.
He doesn't know, so he's asking.

126
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:37,984
I don't know either.

127
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,322
Guys... eh, for your next session...

128
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:48,453
I want a summary of this story.
I don't want any excuses, like...

129
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:52,207
"I fell asleep, we had guests",
and... stuff like that.

130
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,304
Mister, could you please
scooch over a bit?

131
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:21,340
Sir, can I sit in front and
this young man sits back here?

132
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,370
Father...

133
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,372
Somebody in there?

134
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:58,127
No, I think the noise
was from the next door.

135
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:01,756
- No, no, somebody got in your bathroom!
- No, there's no one there.

136
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:05,632
It's the next room, there's a party.
These kind of noises are normal...

137
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,511
Can I come out?

138
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,621
There's something moving
in the bathtub, Willy!

139
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,091
Ah, Miss Francis, you better
go back to your room.

140
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,982
They must be finished painting by now.

141
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:23,692
But I can't, I've got to get dressed first!

142
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:26,217
Yes, you can, you can! Please!

143
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:30,240
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my next-door neighbor.

144
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:34,976
They were painting her room.
And she asked to come and use the bath.

145
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:39,878
And I said, that's alright.
So, I let her take a shower here.

146
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,044
You can go back to your room now.

147
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,711
But Willy, I don't have any clothes on!

148
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:45,612
Please, get out of here!
Go back to your room.

149
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:48,177
You promised me stockings, Willy!

150
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:50,241
I have no stockings here!

151
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,077
Why? You had two boxes of size 9s
for me, and I want them, Willy!

152
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,185
Alright, take one and go.
For God's sake, will you get outta here!

153
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:57,750
Please!

154
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:58,896
Go!

155
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:16,872
I just hope there's nobody in the hall.
I can't go out without any clothes!

156
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:26,965
By the way, are you
football or...

157
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,427
Dammit!

158
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,513
Siavash!

159
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,702
What happened, mom?

160
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,527
I do my best to ignore it but he
keeps getting worse every night!

161
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:37,439
Sadra, dear, come
down, let's go!

162
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,207
Sanam, dear, just ignore him.

163
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,394
He thinks just because I'm playing a
whore, he can do whatever he wants.

164
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,773
- What's that got to do with it?

165
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:44,587
Why don't you laugh at
the others then, huh?

166
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:46,437
I was laughing at your
clothes, not you...

167
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,720
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

168
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,384
Siavash, come here!

169
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,949
Sanam, don't be childish on
this final night. Sanam...

170
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,431
- Alright, I'm freaking sorry... I'm sorry.

171
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:59,414
In this cold, rehearsing every night,
with this child. Let's go, honey.

172
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,126
- You just had to fuck it up, didn't you?

173
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,481
- What's that got to do with us?
It's your own husband.

174
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:05,669
Let me take the k...

175
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,754
Let go!

176
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,839
Sanam don't...

177
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:11,258
I said get off!

178
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,925
I was kidding...
I said get off!

179
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,220
I was kidding...

180
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:19,144
- I was messing with you.
- Where are you going?

181
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:23,517
Comes out of the shower
with a raincoat, and says,

182
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,384
"How can I go out without any clothes?"

183
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,572
I can't, man,
it makes me laugh.

184
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,407
Go after her or she'll get
annoyed and won't come tomorrow.

185
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:37,557
Don't make me go out without clothes!
I'm shy!

186
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,456
Come on, how can I go out
without any cloth...

187
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:41,329
Sanam!

188
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:42,958
The guy's totally nuts!

189
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,801
Did you find a place?

190
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:59,306
60 sq. Metres, 3rd floor, no elevator.
40 mils in front, 600k tomans per month.

191
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,955
- Where?
- Amiratabak.

192
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:04,083
- What sort of a place are you looking for?
- Something temporary...

193
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,068
If we can't find anywhere,
we have to bring our stuff,

194
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:08,906
and live right in the middle of the stage.

195
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:11,069
You free tomorrow afternoon?

196
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:12,321
How come?

197
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:13,697
I'm taking you somewhere.

198
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:17,096
Come on guys... once more from
the top, no interruptions.

199
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:21,828
You tired?

200
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,914
Nope.

201
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,832
Oh, you're here too!

202
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:29,880
Aww kitty! Who's this?

203
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,071
Come here, you!

204
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,788
He's tame... What's up, kitty?

205
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,751
This place is cool!

206
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:17,803
Babak.

207
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,077
Is that the storage room?

208
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,205
- Which one?
- This.

209
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,270
No! It's the second bedroom.

210
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:28,272
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

211
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,170
- Isn't it too small?
- It's a two-bedroom!

212
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,255
So it's good?

213
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,528
You're just two people, what do you
need all this space for anyways?

214
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,038
Watch your mouth, "two people"!

215
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,475
Who knows, maybe we end
up being three people...

216
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,952
Rana, is he serious?

217
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,182
No, come on!

218
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,269
- He doesn't look like it.
- Why is that?

219
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,062
Is this door locked?
Is it locked?

220
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,399
The previous tenant's stuff is in there;
They're supposed to be collecting it.

221
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,590
Don't be scared kitty, it's just me.

222
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,599
- How long's it been vacant?
- Three weeks.

223
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,152
What are they doing to this city?

224
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,114
I wish we could tear it
all down and start again.

225
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:23,368
They've already destroyed and rebuilt
it, and look how it's turned out...

226
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,160
Babak?

227
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:25,620
Yes dear.

228
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,371
God have mercy on us.

229
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:29,378
When do you think they'll
clear their stuff out?

230
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,778
They promised they'll be
here in the next day or two.

231
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:45,307
There's no parking, you'll have
to leave your car on the street.

232
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,194
We don't need parking anyways.

233
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:47,682
We're selling our car to pay
your mortgage down payment.

234
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,059
Who mentioned money?

235
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,124
Well, either way...

236
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:52,272
Hello Hello Mr Salimi.

237
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,900
0ne of the good things about this
place are Mr. Shanazari and his wife.

238
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,608
- Hello.
- Hello, how're you doing?

239
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,863
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. How do you do Ma'am?

240
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:03,096
Babak, which one's the storage?

241
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,181
It's here, come, take a look.

242
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,229
- Mr Salimi?
- Yes?

243
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,460
The door's open, take a look.

244
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,842
Please make sure it doesn't
turn out like the last one.

245
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,885
- No, come on, I know these guys.
- You said you knew the last ones too.

246
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:23,971
Don't worry about it.

247
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:27,391
- Babak, what do they do?
- They're my friends, they're into arts.

248
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,121
I hope so.

249
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,601
It's okay for a few months.

250
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:34,940
Just make sure he lets us pay him for it.
No favors.

251
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:38,610
Looks like we've finally caught a break.

252
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,577
Careful, don't rush.

253
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,809
You need help, Sir?
- No, you go ahead and bring the rest.

254
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,509
Just be careful not to hit the light bulb.

255
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:06,513
Sorry sir, thanks for the help.

256
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:12,603
- Are the keys here too?
- They took that one room's with 'em.

257
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,258
Where's Ali?

258
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,581
Ali...

259
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:33,164
Yep?

260
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,230
For God's sake, leave that alone,
I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

261
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,982
It'll only take a second.

262
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,463
Leave it, man!

263
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:43,655
If she'd said, we wouldn't have
hired the truck and the movers.

264
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:50,015
How was I supposed to know? She sounded so
sure that I didn't think she'd bail on us.

265
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:53,829
So, what's she saying now?

266
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,813
Hasn't answered
ever since this morning.

267
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,940
Why don't you try from a different number?

268
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:00,964
Bring your phone Nana.

269
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:06,365
We really need that room, we've
brought a pickup full our things.

270
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:11,808
Yes.

271
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,623
Okay.

272
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,001
He's here if you like to speak to him,

273
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:25,029
Thanks.

274
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,574
Says, she's said all
she has to say to you.

275
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,139
Well, what did she say?

276
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,666
She signed the contract on
a new place two days ago,

277
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,962
but the landlord bucked at the last moment,

278
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:39,524
She's looking for a place, but can't come
for her stuff until she finds somewhere.

279
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,778
She said to tell you not to let
anyone touch her stuff. Please.

280
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,368
Oh, yeah, and she doesn't
want to talk to you again.

281
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,975
Any news? What happened?

282
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,457
I don't know, nothing for now.
Let me take it, Kati.

283
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,294
Ali.

284
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,880
- Yes?
- You got a screwdriver in your car?

285
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,182
This is enough stuff for a bride's dowry!

286
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:15,496
I thought it was just a
few bits and pieces.

287
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:16,971
Maybe we should leave it...

288
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,750
It's fine, I'll take
responsibility for it.

289
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,940
Alright, boys, let's move
those things over there.

290
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,116
Rana...

291
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,661
<i>mumbling.</i>

292
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,245
These are people's belongings.

293
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,528
What do you want me to do?
It's been 3 days now.

294
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:40,485
She keeps saying...

295
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,233
"I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow."

296
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,086
What if she shows up?

297
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:46,504
Well she should've kept her word then.
Never mind. Come on!

298
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:48,634
Guys, I can't carry anything heavy!

299
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,013
Mr?

300
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,364
Come on, let's eat.

301
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:14,660
Rana, dear!

302
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,410
Yes dear?

303
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,748
Honey... the charger.

304
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,858
<i>I'll turn into words, run
through your ears...</i>

305
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,466
<i>I'll turn into thoughts,
stick in your head...</i>

306
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:31,116
<i>I'll be a Benz, race
under your feet...</i>

307
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:34,975
<i>I'll be poverty
in your purse...</i>

308
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,373
<i>I'll be a wolf, raid your Hurd.</i>

309
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,309
You two, go to the door and
bring over one of those boxes.

310
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:24,186
Hi guys.

311
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:25,937
Are these your 206's car parts, Sir?

312
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:26,355
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

313
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:29,109
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

314
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:33,445
Very good guys, I want the
poem memorized for next time.

315
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:33,571
Okay.

316
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,364
Okay.

317
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:35,657
Thank you.

318
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,991
Bye, Sir.

319
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,078
Bye.

320
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:08,315
- Bye, Sir!
- So, long.

321
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,108
Thanks Sir.

322
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,196
Goodbye.

323
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,639
- Sir, can I say something?
- What?

324
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,620
Sir, I was really pissed off the other day.

325
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:22,913
Which day?

326
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,583
The day that woman
insulted you in the Taxi.

327
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:29,918
Was it an insult?

328
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,214
You know, that she said, she
wants to sit in the front seat.

329
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:38,927
Sir, after you got out of the car, I
told them that you were my teacher.

330
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,182
And that we all love you so much.
Like, all the guys.

331
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:44,935
What was your first name again?

332
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,374
Amin.

333
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:53,110
Amin, you can be sure, some guy had done
something to her in a taxi before...

334
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:56,135
to make her think
that way about everyone.

335
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,906
Don't worry about it, it's just the
first 100 years that are tough.

336
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:00,866
See you.

337
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:01,117
Bye See you.

338
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,827
Bye.

339
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:43,368
Okay.

340
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,687
Of all the time...

341
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,878
I don't know what to do with her.

342
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:54,338
Who?

343
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,256
This woman

344
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:59,343
I called to ask when she'll
clear her stuff out.

345
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,509
She got angry, started threatening...

346
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:02,721
Over what?

347
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:07,182
"Why did you touch my personal things?
Those were my private stuff...

348
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:07,974
I'll sue you.."

349
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,207
Last night I was running around, saving her
stuff from the rain, up until morning.

350
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,189
Her problem's something else...

351
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:15,004
- Who Babak, the woman?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,256
When's she coming to get her stuff?

353
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:19,300
Says, whenever she finds a place.

354
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,828
Sadra darling, come here with me.
Hurry up.

355
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,917
Hurry up guys, the audience
will be in in five minutes.

356
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,259
Emad... Emad, they're coming here
again after the performance.

357
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:47,328
They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions,
there's another three left.

358
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:49,102
If you stay around after the
performance, you can talk to them.

359
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:49,725
Tonight after the performance?

360
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:50,163
Yes.

361
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,102
If it helps, I'll stay.

362
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,377
Sure, or else there's a chance they
might cancel the whole show tomorrow.

363
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,898
How many did they say?

364
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:56,776
Three... Guys will you please hurry up!

365
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:57,693
I'll go, then.

366
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,570
Won't you wait around?

367
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:02,427
No, you'll be stuck here
until around midnight.

368
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:04,241
Take the car, then.

369
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,909
Where are the house keys?

370
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,596
In my coat's pocket.

371
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,058
Have a good performance.

372
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:09,955
You too!

373
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:55,957
Say, on your way back, if
the supermarket's open...

374
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,043
buy something, we've got
nothing for breakfast.

375
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:02,818
Yes, I said if it's open. If it's open!

376
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:08,490
Also, pick up some hand sanitizer.

377
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:12,245
Maybe I take a shower
until you get here.

378
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,394
No not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't
even wiped off my stage makeup.

379
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:23,443
I'll be out soon... soon.

380
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:26,259
Yup... love you, bye.

381
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:22,854
Anything else?

382
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:23,899
That's all, thanks.

383
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,067
Be my guest.
Are you paying by card?

384
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,654
No, cash.

385
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,415
Hello Ma'am.

386
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:42,939
Hello?

387
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:45,418
Good evening, I'm your upstairs neighbor.

388
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,966
We've just moved in, could
you open the door please?

389
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,926
Thank you.

390
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:09,778
Rana?

391
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:12,823
Rana?

392
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,119
Rana?

393
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:48,857
Rana!

394
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,025
What happened to you?

395
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:51,693
Please step outside, Sir.

396
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:55,324
You can't be in here, Sir. We'll
call you when for the CT scan.

397
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,117
Wait outside, please.

398
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:57,889
Look at me Rana...

399
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:03,540
Everything's fine, I'll call
you for the CT scan... Please.

400
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,755
Make sure you change the
locks first thing tomorrow.

401
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:14,718
Why? Did someone get into the house?

402
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,805
I thought she'd fainted,
was dizzy or...

403
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,347
We don't know what happened yet.

404
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:22,226
All of a sudden we heard shouting
and screaming from upstairs.

405
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,271
Not like, normal, not once,
scream after scream...

406
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:31,277
I told him go upstairs and check, he said,
couples get into fights all the time.

407
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:34,188
Then we heard some heavy
bangs in the stairs,

408
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:37,037
I told him "Muhammad, God
knows, something's up."

409
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:37,637
Who was it?

410
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,975
By the time we reached the stairs, we
just saw someone fleeing up the street.

411
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,454
I don't know what happened to his foot,
but it had bled all over the stairs.

412
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:48,314
If I'd caught him, he'd be dead now.

413
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:52,318
Then we went upstairs and found
your wife unconscious...

414
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,346
there was blood all over
the bathroom floor.

415
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:55,995
I dressed her and brought her here.

416
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:59,302
Never mind that, thank God
something worse didn't happen.

417
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:05,769
Woman, do us a favour, go to the ER, and
check if there's any news or something.

418
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:10,981
Sorry about putting you
to all this trouble.

419
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:13,527
Have a seat, sit down, son.

420
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:21,472
Was anything missing from the house?

421
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:24,830
I don't know.
I didn't notice anything.

422
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:28,834
I don't think it was a robbery. What
would a thief be doing in the bathroom?

423
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,626
Then who was it?

424
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,962
The guy was one of
that woman's customers.

425
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:35,257
Who? What woman?

426
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,051
The woman who lived there
before you moving in.

427
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:43,432
Tell you the truth, she
was kind of messed up...

428
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:47,395
and I think, the guy came here on
account of her still being there.

429
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,741
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

430
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:03,283
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

431
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:03,806
Sure.

432
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,211
Come on, lie down.

433
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:21,136
Take my sleeve, hold this bit.

434
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:24,890
Thanks.

435
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:34,233
Wait, let me take off your scarf.

436
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,651
You want me to put
two pillows for you?

437
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:38,612
No.

438
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:49,414
Turn off the light, so she can sleep.

439
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:50,415
Don't turn it off.

440
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,752
Can I get you anything?

441
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:55,108
No, thanks.

442
00:33:03,512 --> 00:33:05,180
Where are you going, Emad?

443
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:07,556
Darling?

444
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,099
I said, where are you going?

445
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:12,060
I'm not going anywhere, I'll be here.
Do you need anything?

446
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:15,941
Nope. Leave the door open.

447
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:26,952
Okay, thanks.

448
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:30,457
Look, her blood pressure's low, be
careful when she's walking around.

449
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:31,498
Thanks for everything.

450
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,249
Sit down guys, I'll make
you some breakfast.

451
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,252
No thanks, I'm fine.

452
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:39,131
Come on, you haven't
eaten since last night.

453
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:45,053
Kati, you wanna stay here, and
make soup or something for them?

454
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:46,201
- You want me to stay?
- You want Kati to stay?

455
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:46,972
No, no.

456
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:48,265
Are you sure?

457
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,143
You must be tired.
Go, get some rest.

458
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:52,978
Call if you need anything.

459
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,521
Really, man, just let us know.

460
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:58,609
- Thanks again for everything, guys.
- Bye

461
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:11,795
<i>scrap metal... Iron doors...
Aluminium doors...</i>

462
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:15,397
<i>Fences... Metal dishes...
buying...</i>

463
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:29,051
<i>scrap metal... lamps... Samovars...
anything, bring it over...</i>

464
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:58,223
Come on, stand here while
I use the bathroom.

465
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:13,570
What are you doing?

466
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:16,200
Leave it, I'll wash it myself,
Rana, dear. Leave it.

467
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:17,513
Come and wash it then.

468
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:19,204
Alright, turn off the water
and come out.

469
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,000
Then, come and clean it
before I use it.

470
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:27,920
The police might need to see it.

471
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:33,467
Yes?

472
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:36,970
Of course, sorry.

473
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,055
Who was it?

474
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,765
A neighbor.

475
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,724
What did they say?

476
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:41,642
I'll be right back.

477
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,233
Sorry

478
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:05,497
I'm really sorry for all the trouble
you've been put through, ma'am.

479
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:08,273
Now, come on, don't say that.

480
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:11,193
I think you should call 110, they'll be
able to track him down through the car.

481
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:14,842
Yeah, I'll definitely do that. Anyways,
I'll try to find some place...

482
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,886
Here I was thinking, when that woman left
she's taken all her troubles with her.

483
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:20,764
Have you ever seen this
car's owner around here?

484
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,641
Well, it wasn't like, just a
couple guys visiting her.

485
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:28,272
I might have to trouble you
again when the police comes...

486
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:30,483
if they have any questions
about exactly what you saw.

487
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:32,983
Of course, it's our duty. Would you
like to take my mobile number?

488
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:33,942
Yes, please.

489
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:35,110
I'll get going.

490
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:36,384
Thank you so much, ma'am.

491
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:39,243
They should put an ewer
around these guys necks,

492
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,285
and parade them around
the city, shaming them.

493
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:43,162
0912...

494
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,306
Why are you out here? Come in

495
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:06,643
I'm scared of being
alone in the house.

496
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,354
Where did you go?

497
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,318
I went to thank the
neighbors for last night.

498
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,234
What did they say?

499
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,592
Nothing.

500
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:19,321
They asked how you were.

501
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:23,035
You didn't tell Kati and the
guys what happened, did you?

502
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,328
No.

503
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:26,955
Okay, I'm going to
the police station.

504
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:30,793
We have to file a complaint for
them to start looking for the guy.

505
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:33,084
How will they find him?

506
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:35,003
He left his pickup behind.

507
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:39,218
His mobile too,
but it's disconnected.

508
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:43,180
Who was he, Emad?

509
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,020
The neighbors are saying the woman
who lived here before us was shady.

510
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:54,817
The scumbag must've been
one of her customers.

511
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,069
Came here on account of her.

512
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:00,030
Do you remember what he looked like?

513
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:01,824
No.

514
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,263
Didn't you get a look at him?

515
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,400
It's cold. Come inside,
you'll catch a cold.

516
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:30,644
Gimme that.

517
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,611
Who helped me out of the bathroom?

518
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:43,407
One of the neighbors.

519
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:45,052
Which one?

520
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,327
I don't know, just forget it.

521
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,002
Eat your breakfast. And
then go get some rest.

522
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,593
I can't. As soon as I close my
eyes that scene comes to my mind.

523
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:14,021
How did he get in?

524
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:19,318
I opened the door,
I thought it was you.

525
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:25,073
I came out of the bathroom, buzzed
him in, and then went back.

526
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:36,543
I was shampooing my hair when I
realised someone had come in.

527
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:41,465
He put his hand in my hair from
behind and I thought it was you.

528
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:46,199
But then I saw his hands
and after that it's blank.

529
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:03,362
Rana...

530
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:07,241
Darling, have some breakfast.

531
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:14,373
Rana, dear...

532
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,876
Sweetie...

533
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,145
What about tonight's performance?

534
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,482
I called and told them to cancel it.

535
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,898
No, call and say I'm coming.

536
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,234
How? In this condition of yours?

537
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:27,091
It's harder for me to stay at home.

538
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:34,949
Put this on,
let's go to the police station.

539
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:37,107
We might get held up there
for a while anyways.

540
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,249
No, leave it.
Let's not go to the station.

541
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,834
We can't just do nothing!

542
00:44:42,586 --> 00:44:48,342
I don't want to have to go there and tell a
bunch of officers or whoever what happened.

543
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:52,012
Did something happen
that you can't tell?

544
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:54,221
No.

545
00:44:54,223 --> 00:44:57,101
Then, you don't have to say anything.
I'll tell 'em myself.

546
00:44:58,352 --> 00:44:59,812
I can't, it'll be too much.

547
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,950
No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.

548
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:17,204
When I'm walking in the street,
I clearly feel these things...

549
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:21,897
They pass me by, but it's as if they're
laughing at me with their eyes.

550
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,629
Why? Why would they laugh at you? Don't
talk that way about yourself, Willy.

551
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:29,049
Sometimes they pass me by
as if I don't even exist.

552
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:34,513
As though nobody sees me.
Nobody notices me. Nothing.

553
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,353
Linda?

554
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:54,158
How long are you going to spend
repairing those socks, huh?

555
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,952
You know it makes me angry.

556
00:45:56,953 --> 00:46:01,124
At least don't do it while I'm
home, talking to you. Okay?

557
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:13,177
Okay, we'll talk about something
else, for example my income.

558
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,100
My never-changing income. God,
this is really ridiculous.

559
00:46:20,246 --> 00:46:22,665
<i>What's wrong with you? Why
aren't you saying your lines?</i>

560
00:46:22,686 --> 00:46:28,192
Willy, darling, you're the most
handsome man in the world to me.

561
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:37,199
You always say this to me, Linda,
always, but it doesn't help me at all.

562
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,659
I'll never be able to make
you happy, do you know why?

563
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:44,082
Because I'm just a salesman. I'm nothing!
I'm nothing, Linda!

564
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:48,962
But I always tried... why
are you crying, anyways?

565
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:54,593
Wait, where are you going?

566
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,179
Linda, come back...

567
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:07,397
Sorry, I have to stop the play.
I apologize to you all.

568
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:11,045
My wife, the other actor,
isn't feeling well.

569
00:47:11,072 --> 00:47:13,859
Please give us a ten minute intermission.

570
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:14,582
Sorry.

571
00:47:18,075 --> 00:47:19,658
Can you carry on?

572
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,789
What do you mean, Kati? Can't you see
she's not well? Go on, cancel it.

573
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:26,750
Do you wanna go to the other
room and lie down a little?

574
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:30,671
Alright, guys, let's just clear the room.
She's not well.

575
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,006
Sanam, dear.

576
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:36,967
I'm coming.

577
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:39,054
Can I get you anything?

578
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:46,228
Kati darling...

579
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,689
Go and cancel the show.

580
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:01,201
What happened there?

581
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:09,460
The way someone in the audience
was staring at me bothered me.

582
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:16,216
The audience have come to watch the play,
of course they'll be looking at you.

583
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:18,844
Looked at me just like that guy.

584
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,892
I thought you said you didn't see him.

585
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:31,273
I'm really unwell, I just
don't know what to do.

586
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:36,151
Babak, come here a minute.

587
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:37,738
Coming...

588
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:48,165
Is she feeling better?

589
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:51,814
Goddammit, man,
what can I say to you...?

590
00:48:51,815 --> 00:48:55,778
Don't you think you had to let me know
about the kind of people who lived there?

591
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:57,672
- What's happened?
- You're supposed to be my friend.

592
00:48:57,674 --> 00:49:01,720
Seriously, what's happened? What is
it to you who lived there before?

593
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,848
That apartment's infamous
in the whole neighborhood.

594
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:06,496
Who's said such a thing?

595
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,519
Let's say nobody's said anything, why isn't
this woman coming to collect her stuff?

596
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:13,628
I just wanted to help.

597
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:17,278
Remember the state you were in, last week?
Ready to sleep on the set?

598
00:49:17,382 --> 00:49:20,385
Regardless, should you have hidden
that woman's line of work from me?

599
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:21,469
What hiding?

600
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:24,305
Well, yeah. Did you tell me or not?

601
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,163
Was I supposed to pass on to you
some unfounded gossip? To upset you?

602
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:32,499
Well, what's going, anyways?
What's this all about?

603
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:33,959
Babak, I'm going

604
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:34,628
I'm coming.

605
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:38,048
Go take a look at Rana,
you'll see what this is all about.

606
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:40,592
They said she slipped
in the bathroom.

607
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:47,349
We said right in front of you we
might be having a kid in that place.

608
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,206
And you didn't say a word, what kind of...

609
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:51,395
You were joking!

610
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:54,855
If we weren't joking,
would you have told us?

611
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:58,149
Told you what?

612
00:49:58,152 --> 00:50:01,134
Put yourself in my shoes, the same
room we sleep in, each night...

613
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:05,827
how many strange men have
been with that woman.

614
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:10,745
Don't take it so hard on yourself.
I haven't cashed your check yet.

615
00:50:10,747 --> 00:50:16,420
Whenever you find another place whose
previous tenants had your approval,

616
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,864
you can move out.

617
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:29,973
Hello.

618
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:30,391
Hello Hello.

619
00:50:30,392 --> 00:50:30,808
Hello.

620
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,561
How are you doing.

621
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:36,771
Be careful not to slip on the
stairs Mrs Shahnazari, they're wet.

622
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:44,446
I was actually going to ask the cleaner
to come early and sort these out.

623
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:48,867
But, I thought you'd want to report it,
the police might want to see them.

624
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:51,705
Well, it wasn't such a big deal.

625
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:53,548
You wouldn't say that,

626
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:57,640
if you'd been there and seen
the state your wife was in,

627
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,306
on the bathroom floor.

628
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:03,779
When Mr. Alimoradi opened
the bathroom door,

629
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:07,469
he thought, God forbid,
your wife was dead.

630
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:10,390
Say hello from me.

631
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:17,981
Get up, I've made some breakfast for you.

632
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:19,314
I'm heading out.

633
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:20,109
Wait.

634
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:28,698
Wait, I'll get ready and come with you.

635
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,744
Where to? I have class.

636
00:51:30,828 --> 00:51:32,579
I know, I'll wait in the car.

637
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:35,541
It's not just an hour or
two, you'll get tired.

638
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:37,167
Then don't go today.

639
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:37,999
What?

640
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:40,420
I said, don't go today.

641
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:43,421
Let's say I don't, what
about tomorrow then?

642
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:46,132
The day after tomorrow?
It's not gonna work.

643
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,971
I can't stay here alone.

644
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:53,016
I said, I don't want
to be here alone.

645
00:51:53,392 --> 00:51:54,793
What can I do?

646
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:00,425
You want me to get you a ticket to
visit your parents for a few days?

647
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:02,734
Looking like this?

648
00:52:04,278 --> 00:52:05,967
I've made up my mind...

649
00:52:05,968 --> 00:52:11,286
we either have to go to the police,
or forget this altogether.

650
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:14,995
Okay forget it, but let's look for
a new apartment right from today.

651
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:16,538
Okay, we'll start looking.

652
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,542
But until we find somewhere, you
need to try and pick yourself up.

653
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:22,586
What do you mean? It's not
something I can control.

654
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:25,819
You taking your pills and not staying up
all night getting worked up about it,

655
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:26,826
is up to you, isn't it?

656
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:31,555
Go take a shower, I'll wait here.

657
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,933
I don't want to go in that bathroom.

658
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:41,021
I'll drop you off at a friend's place.
Use theirs.

659
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:43,817
Go and tell them we've
come to take a shower?

660
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:46,674
What do you want me to do?

661
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:50,449
You keep changing your mind.

662
00:52:51,158 --> 00:52:53,509
At night you tell me not to come near you,

663
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,244
then in the morning you
tell me not to leave you.

664
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:58,246
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

665
00:52:58,248 --> 00:52:58,914
Just go, you're late.

666
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01,575
It'll take a couple weeks to find a place.

667
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:02,239
What?

668
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,657
You're not gonna wash up
with that wound of yours?

669
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:26,985
I love you.

670
00:53:29,321 --> 00:53:32,197
Just think, it could've been worse.

671
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:36,301
What if a piece of glass had gone in your
eye, or your head had been hit harder?

672
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:37,327
Then...

673
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:39,456
then what the hell would I have done?

674
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:42,042
I wish my head had been hit harder.

675
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:47,172
God forbid! Honey, don't
say things like that.

676
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:51,111
Hello, Mr. Etesami.

677
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:06,585
Hello Sir, how are you doing?

678
00:55:07,252 --> 00:55:09,755
Mr. Yeganeh gave me these
books to give them to you.

679
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:13,300
Be quiet. What's so funny?

680
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:17,010
Why?

681
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:19,640
He said they're not suitable for kids.

682
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,184
Quiet!

683
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:26,605
Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't
suitable for the kids?

684
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:29,942
Go, throw them in the bin.

685
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,899
Why the bin?

686
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,986
Just throw them away.

687
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:45,622
Give me your phone.

688
00:55:45,624 --> 00:55:46,957
I don't have a phone, Sir.

689
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:47,707
Give it to me.

690
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:48,877
I don't have a cell.

691
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:51,171
Sir, wait a minute.

692
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,715
Give it to me.

693
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:57,261
Sir, there's nothing in it about you.

694
00:55:57,386 --> 00:55:58,218
I want to see what you have

695
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,177
I've deleted it.

696
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:00,595
Let me see it.

697
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:02,472
Sir please, I've deleted it.

698
00:56:02,474 --> 00:56:05,644
Sir, I have private photos in there.

699
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:07,143
Put your hand down.

700
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:08,480
That's not fair.

701
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:11,608
Mr Etesami?

702
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:14,653
Sir?

703
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:20,492
I have personal things on there.
I deleted the video.

704
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:24,872
On my mother's life, I deleted it.

705
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:27,693
Sir, send it on Telegram,
so that everyone can see.

706
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,374
It's much better than this movie.

707
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:32,379
I'll kick you out of the class,
if you say another word.

708
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,837
Mr. Etesami!

709
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:34,462
Sorry, Sir.

710
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:35,380
You stay out of this!

711
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:36,298
Mr Etesami?

712
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,364
I mean all of you.

713
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:39,929
I'm talking to him.

714
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:41,972
I deleted it.

715
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,057
Please.

716
00:56:47,895 --> 00:56:49,525
Call your father to come to the school,

717
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:51,591
and see the kind of photos
you have on your cell.

718
00:56:53,484 --> 00:56:55,652
His dad's dead, Sir.

719
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,874
Hi, sorry about that.

720
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:55,566
Hi, no problem.

721
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:58,896
If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it,
then you can leave it in the corner.

722
00:57:58,923 --> 00:57:59,924
Next to the boiler room.

723
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:03,426
When my husband gets back he'll
move it to a better place.

724
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:06,972
I don't want you to have to keep
going up and down the stairs.

725
00:58:06,974 --> 00:58:10,350
I'm going out for a couple of
hours you can take my spot.

726
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:12,477
Don't worry, I'll find
a better place for it.

727
00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:14,062
Suit yourself.

728
00:58:14,064 --> 00:58:14,355
Sorry.

729
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,023
If you give me the keys, I can do it.

730
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:17,734
Thanks.

731
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:24,072
My wife said, you're not
going to report it.

732
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:24,739
No.

733
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:28,201
You're doing the right thing, they won't
do anything, even if they catch him.

734
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:34,084
And you'll have to explain over
and over why you opened the door

735
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:36,588
plus trekking back
and forth to the court.

736
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:38,587
Endless hassle for nothing.

737
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:43,174
But he'll probably be back for his car.
Please, call me if he shows up.

738
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:45,262
I'll sort out that bastard.

739
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:02,611
I'll take mine out and
then come and park yours.

740
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:04,446
There's no need,
I'll do it myself.

741
00:59:04,448 --> 00:59:05,991
Okay, then, goodbye. Thanks.

742
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,410
Goodbye.

743
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:38,313
How's it going?

744
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:40,774
Hey, you okay? Is Rana here?

745
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:42,234
No, wasn't she with you?

746
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:43,401
She's coming on her own.

747
00:59:43,403 --> 00:59:45,280
Any news about the guy?

748
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:50,410
Who?

749
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:54,706
Babak had heard some things
from your neighbors.

750
00:59:57,626 --> 00:59:59,251
Where is he? Is he here?

751
00:59:59,253 --> 01:00:00,377
Babak?

752
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:02,214
Yep, he's back there.

753
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:11,014
Hi.

754
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,972
Hi.

755
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,725
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

756
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:16,476
What should I have told you?

757
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:18,689
About the man turning up
the other night.

758
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:21,733
How's Rana?

759
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:24,111
The neighbors told you.

760
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:28,613
They're also worried...

761
01:00:28,615 --> 01:00:30,907
Tell 'em nothing happened,
the guy just barged in.

762
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:33,159
Then why are you keeping his pickup?

763
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,247
Shahnazari said it's in the parking lot.

764
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:40,667
Tell them we'll be gone soon
we're looking for a new place.

765
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:42,627
Where will you go?

766
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:45,257
I won't let you.

767
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:49,636
Can you find that previous tenant
and arrange a meeting for me?

768
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:51,511
Why?

769
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:53,597
I wanna talk to her.

770
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,682
Ask her why she did this.

771
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:56,643
Did what?

772
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,810
Did what?

773
01:00:58,812 --> 01:01:01,563
Sent this thug to our house.

774
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:02,731
Why would she do that?

775
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:06,651
You said yourself, she made threats
about us touching her stuff.

776
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:08,003
She's nothing like that.

777
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:11,825
She hasn't taken her stuff because
she still hasn't found a place.

778
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:14,433
She was just annoyed with me that day.

779
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:16,663
Hello.

780
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:19,372
Feeling better?

781
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:21,502
Yep, I'm fine thanks.

782
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:32,262
Did you tell the guys?

783
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:33,386
No.

784
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:35,055
Then how do they know?

785
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,849
One of the neighbor had called Babak.

786
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:39,770
I'm not sure what they said.

787
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:43,670
Emad, get dressed and
come for the make up.

788
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:48,695
My outfit's not here.

789
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,782
Kati's going to take your place tonight.

790
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,167
And you accepted, just like that?

791
01:02:04,169 --> 01:02:06,421
What can I do?
It's not up to me.

792
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:09,756
The director wanted her
to replace you tonight.

793
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:13,260
If you're alright, and you can
do it, I'll go talk to her.

794
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,013
No, I don't want to.

795
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:18,225
Have you started house hunting?

796
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:20,811
No, I will do.

797
01:02:22,312 --> 01:02:23,520
As soon as I get time.

798
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:27,274
When you get time! Like it doesn't
matter how I feel in that place!

799
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,817
You haven't done anything.

800
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:30,320
Huh?

801
01:02:32,072 --> 01:02:34,990
I want us to go to the police, but
you won't let me. What do you mean?

802
01:02:34,992 --> 01:02:38,702
You said you'd drop by the school, find
a substitute teacher, and pick me up.

803
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:41,436
I couldn't find anyone
to cover my class.

804
01:02:49,047 --> 01:02:50,090
Auntie?

805
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:52,173
Yes Baby?

806
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:55,012
Why aren't you acting tonight?

807
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:57,971
I'm not feeling well tonight, darling.

808
01:02:57,973 --> 01:03:00,390
Why did you come here then?

809
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:02,809
I get bored at home.

810
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,352
What?

811
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:06,815
I get bored at home.

812
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:12,571
Well, I get bored here.

813
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:17,785
Would you like to come to
our house this evening?

814
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,285
Do you have Spongebob?

815
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:22,621
No, but we can go buy it on the way home.

816
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,290
From tomorrow you really
need to perform again.

817
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:29,671
Everything's topsy turvy.
Everybody's making mistakes.

818
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:32,214
Why?

819
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:34,299
I don't know, everyone's upset.

820
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:36,801
You're better now, you
should act again tomorrow.

821
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:37,469
Mum?

822
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,261
Darling?

823
01:03:38,263 --> 01:03:39,429
Can I go to Auntie's house?

824
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:40,388
No, baby.

825
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:45,477
Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone.
I'll bring him with me tomorrow.

826
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:50,546
He can't, his dad's coming to pick
him up to go to his house tomorrow.

827
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:57,032
Well, his Dad can pick
him up from our place.

828
01:04:02,287 --> 01:04:03,745
You wanna go?

829
01:04:03,747 --> 01:04:04,623
Yes!

830
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:06,957
You won't be a nuisance for Auntie Rana?

831
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:08,627
He won't.

832
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:12,131
Tell Emad we're taking the car.

833
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:15,467
I'll bring his things over.

834
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:22,389
I need to pee, auntie.

835
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,476
I know, go on, go inside.

836
01:04:26,854 --> 01:04:29,312
Whose bike is this?

837
01:04:29,314 --> 01:04:31,567
That... belongs to some kid.

838
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,823
Where's the kid?

839
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:42,450
The kid's not here anymore.

840
01:04:42,453 --> 01:04:43,702
Where did he go?

841
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:44,536
Huh?

842
01:04:44,538 --> 01:04:46,290
Where'd he go?

843
01:04:46,748 --> 01:04:49,332
Moved to a new house.
Don't you need to pee?

844
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:50,083
Oh, yes!

845
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:51,420
Go on then.

846
01:04:53,046 --> 01:04:55,299
Not that one, over here.

847
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:57,259
Well...

848
01:04:58,635 --> 01:04:59,676
it's dark!

849
01:04:59,678 --> 01:05:01,054
I'm coming...

850
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,600
It's scary in there.

851
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,687
Come on.

852
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:12,733
No, I don't need to go anymore.

853
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,816
Let me help.

854
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:19,948
No, you go... I... I'll do it.

855
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:22,532
Are you feeling shy in front of me?

856
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:23,452
Nope!

857
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:26,497
Can you do it yourself?

858
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,437
I'm drawing his mustache.

859
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:00,906
Yes?

860
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:02,950
Come up, dear.

861
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:04,785
Who was it?

862
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:06,868
Uncle Emad.

863
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:10,956
If it's my dad, then tell
him Sadra's not here.

864
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,126
Why?

865
01:06:13,418 --> 01:06:15,710
Because I love my Mom.

866
01:06:15,712 --> 01:06:16,839
Okay.

867
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:32,312
Rana?

868
01:06:32,563 --> 01:06:33,186
Hey.

869
01:06:33,188 --> 01:06:35,021
The pickup isn't in the parking.

870
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,107
I parked it outside this morning.

871
01:06:37,109 --> 01:06:38,775
Why?

872
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:42,445
I didn't fancy moving it every ten minutes.

873
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:43,405
Hello!

874
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,408
Hello, how are you kid?

875
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:47,868
Where are the keys?

876
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,455
Where you'd left them.

877
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,372
How are things with my favorite?

878
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,334
Welcome to our house, all good?

879
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,003
Welcome!

880
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:02,549
Leave it where it is Emad

881
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,383
I'll be right back.

882
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:05,471
Emad... Emad...

883
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:10,724
Let's forget all that for
tonight, just leave it.

884
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,062
I've made dinner, go wash
your hands and change.

885
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:15,856
Go on, darling.

886
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:30,871
Ready for takeoff ladies and gentleman!

887
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:36,502
Sadra!

888
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,043
Yes!

889
01:07:38,045 --> 01:07:40,128
Emad it's ready,
come before it gets cold.

890
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,381
Coming.

891
01:07:41,673 --> 01:07:43,465
Let's go wash those hands of yours.

892
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,217
My hands are clean!

893
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:46,593
Let's wash them again anyways.

894
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,973
Wow, wow, wow, look at this!

895
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,727
Thanks so much.

896
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:57,395
Get your hands off it!

897
01:07:57,397 --> 01:08:01,691
<i>Rana, where are you?</i>

898
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:04,446
<i>Sadra, come and eat!</i>

899
01:08:05,072 --> 01:08:07,614
Hello.

900
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:11,493
Hello trouble, have you two
been having fun without me?

901
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:11,869
We went shopping
and then hung out.

902
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:13,453
Well done! We went shopping
and then hung out.

903
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:15,082
We went shopping and then hung out.

904
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,832
But we didn't find Spongebob.

905
01:08:17,835 --> 01:08:19,918
Yes, unfortunately.

906
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,758
<i>Don't worry, Patrick, eventually a good day
will come when you and I will find someone.</i>

907
01:08:25,384 --> 01:08:29,012
<i>Look at this, Spongebob!</i>

908
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:33,308
Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni!

909
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,226
More?

910
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:37,604
No no, that's enough.

911
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:39,855
Okay, just let me know.

912
01:08:39,857 --> 01:08:41,733
Thank you.

913
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,237
Wow, what a nice macaroni!

914
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:48,280
Bon appetit!

915
01:08:48,282 --> 01:08:50,325
Let's eat it all.

916
01:08:50,617 --> 01:08:52,200
Look what she's made.

917
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:53,454
Yeah, I know!

918
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,707
How was tonight's performance?

919
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:59,042
Very...

920
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:00,711
not that great.

921
01:09:00,961 --> 01:09:02,377
It was terrible.

922
01:09:02,379 --> 01:09:03,753
You're lying.

923
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:06,133
That's how it is without you.

924
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,551
Did you find the credit card?

925
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:10,971
No.

926
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:14,766
How did you go shopping?

927
01:09:15,142 --> 01:09:16,977
With the money you'd left.

928
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,978
What money?

929
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,064
In the drawer.

930
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:38,415
Why aren't you eating?
Do you not like it?

931
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:41,376
Is it not tasty?

932
01:09:50,469 --> 01:09:52,304
Don't eat it.

933
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:55,265
What's up?

934
01:10:04,566 --> 01:10:07,528
That scumbag had left it
behind the other night.

935
01:10:35,222 --> 01:10:36,640
Sadra?

936
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,768
I've got an idea.

937
01:10:40,144 --> 01:10:41,309
Do you like pizza?

938
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:42,312
Yep.

939
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,690
Then let's order some pizza.

940
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,942
Don't eat that, it's not good.

941
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,488
Do you like fries?

942
01:10:52,406 --> 01:10:54,283
And after that Ice Cream?

943
01:11:04,607 --> 01:11:05,441
- Hi there. Gimme a call when you can.

944
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:09,715
Hello? Mum? Mummy?

945
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:15,846
Hello? Uncle? Are you there?

946
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:21,018
It's the 3rd time I'm calling.

947
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,480
Hello darling, it's Babak.

948
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:31,278
Hello... Hello...

949
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:34,615
Are you there?

950
01:11:39,286 --> 01:11:44,917
Gimme a call when you get
home, I'll be up late.

951
01:11:48,253 --> 01:11:50,214
What are you doing?

952
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,800
Nothing.

953
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,927
Come on, go sleep.

954
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,054
You haven't slept for two nights

955
01:11:57,221 --> 01:11:59,223
I can't sleep.

956
01:12:07,147 --> 01:12:09,648
Why did you open her letters?

957
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,149
It's her private stuff.

958
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:13,109
I wanna find out who the
hell that scumbag was.

959
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:15,426
Let's say you find out how it was...

960
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:17,280
He'll say it was a mistake.

961
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:19,115
He came inside by mistake?

962
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:21,660
He rang the bell
and I opened the door.

963
01:12:21,662 --> 01:12:25,247
He must've thought it's that woman
since I opened the door so easily.

964
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:26,458
He came here by mistake?

965
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:29,000
Any when he realized his mistake...

966
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:30,794
Why didn't he leave?

967
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:33,672
Because he saw the bathroom light's
on and there's a woman in there?

968
01:12:33,674 --> 01:12:34,756
How would he know it's a...

969
01:12:34,758 --> 01:12:37,136
From your clothes on the bed.

970
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:43,139
If I'd just used the damn intercom...

971
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:45,769
If I'd just asked who it was...

972
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,564
None of this would've happened.

973
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,772
If you think it's that simple...

974
01:12:50,774 --> 01:12:54,820
You can just tell all the
neighbors about the intercom...

975
01:12:54,924 --> 01:12:56,611
Why are you getting the
neighbors into this?

976
01:12:56,613 --> 01:12:58,363
They knew what was
going on in this house.

977
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:00,407
So it'd be fine with you,
if they didn't know?

978
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,494
What are you on about?

979
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:05,311
Leave me alone.

980
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,054
The pickup wasn't there.

981
01:13:23,056 --> 01:13:23,724
What?

982
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:26,685
Sorry.

983
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,480
Where was it?

984
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,021
There.

985
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:32,566
Sorry.

986
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:37,527
Where did you leave it?

987
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:38,781
I left it there.

988
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:42,659
Where?

989
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,454
Over there, where the Peugeot is.

990
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:54,087
He's taken it.

991
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:57,466
I have to find that asshole.

992
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:16,944
Jackass!

993
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,952
Okay, slow down!

994
01:14:51,812 --> 01:14:53,230
It's freezing in there.

995
01:14:53,397 --> 01:14:54,354
Never mind.

996
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,648
What do you mean, never mind?
You'll get sick.

997
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:57,816
Let's go to a public bath.

998
01:14:57,818 --> 01:15:00,320
No, I'll be out quick.
Just wait here.

999
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,746
Hasanpoor, come here a sec.

1000
01:15:11,748 --> 01:15:13,584
<i>Hello.</i>

1001
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:21,965
What can I do for you, Sir?

1002
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:22,883
Hi.

1003
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,970
How's it going?

1004
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:27,470
Your dad was a traffic cop, right?

1005
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:29,016
He's retired now, why?

1006
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:32,225
A car hit my wife and drove off.

1007
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,310
Hope it's nothing serious, Sir!

1008
01:15:33,312 --> 01:15:35,397
No, thank God.

1009
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,691
It was a pickup, if I give
you the number plate...

1010
01:15:39,693 --> 01:15:43,820
Can your Dad find the guy's address?
If it's not too much trouble, that is.

1011
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:45,778
Sure, he has contacts in the department.

1012
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:48,116
If you gimme the license
plate, he can find out.

1013
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:50,243
But, I think you should report it.

1014
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:54,331
It wasn't anything serious, so I
don't wanna get the police mixed up.

1015
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:57,002
Okay, gimme the registration
and I'll call my Dad.

1016
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,038
- Get a pen and a paper, then.
- 'Kay.

1017
01:16:06,493 --> 01:16:07,912
Why don't you want to work for me?

1018
01:16:08,058 --> 01:16:10,143
Have you lost your mind, Charlie?
I've got a job.

1019
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:13,481
Then what are you walking
in here every week for?

1020
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:20,677
Well, if you don't want
me to walk in here...

1021
01:16:21,095 --> 01:16:22,608
I'm offering you a job.

1022
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:27,144
I don't want your goddam job! I've
got one already. Get outta my way!

1023
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,751
When the hell are you
going to grow up, huh?

1024
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,881
Goddam you, Charlie!
You big ignoramus!

1025
01:16:32,986 --> 01:16:37,887
Big ignoramus! How dare
you talk to me like that?

1026
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:41,224
If you say that to me
again, I'll rap you one!

1027
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:45,918
I don't care how big you are!

1028
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,734
You degenerate!

1029
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:03,853
What's wrong with you tonight?

1030
01:17:04,584 --> 01:17:05,418
What did I do?

1031
01:17:05,524 --> 01:17:07,088
Why are you adding dialogues?

1032
01:17:07,714 --> 01:17:08,444
What did I add?

1033
01:17:09,175 --> 01:17:11,469
If you've got a problem with
me, let's sit and talk.

1034
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,181
Not on the stage, calling
me, "You degenerate!"

1035
01:17:14,182 --> 01:17:16,789
It's neither improvisation, nor
acting, you're insulting me.

1036
01:17:16,894 --> 01:17:18,563
What? Did I hurt your feeling?

1037
01:17:18,564 --> 01:17:19,919
Yeah.

1038
01:17:20,442 --> 01:17:23,153
And if you do that one more time, I'll
answer you right in front of everyone.

1039
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:26,178
Degenerate is the one who speaks
his mind through swearing.

1040
01:17:26,387 --> 01:17:27,221
Didn't know that.

1041
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:29,412
I'm really sorry.

1042
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,077
Bakery.

1043
01:17:57,045 --> 01:17:58,192
Hello, how're you doing?

1044
01:18:06,743 --> 01:18:12,061
<i>Speaking Azeri.</i>

1045
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,158
What can I do for you?

1046
01:18:25,306 --> 01:18:26,223
Two baguettes, please.

1047
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,293
You want 'em cut? Thanks a lot.

1048
01:18:33,024 --> 01:18:35,526
That pickup is yours? Why?

1049
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,447
There's an officer writing tickets,
from the top of the street.

1050
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,367
Majid, come here, go move the car.

1051
01:18:41,786 --> 01:18:44,080
Before the officer slaps a ticket on it.

1052
01:18:54,925 --> 01:18:56,385
Soheil, bring the keys.

1053
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:02,142
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1054
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,207
Later.

1055
01:19:04,938 --> 01:19:05,772
Bye.

1056
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:07,859
Here you go, Sir.

1057
01:19:07,964 --> 01:19:09,111
Thanks.

1058
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,157
Thanks, dude.
I'll take a water.

1059
01:19:55,722 --> 01:19:57,495
Hello, mister, sorry
is that your pickup?

1060
01:19:58,121 --> 01:19:58,955
Yeah.

1061
01:19:59,269 --> 01:20:01,876
I had some load, I wanted to
ask you to move it for me.

1062
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:03,420
Nah, that pickup is for a store.

1063
01:20:03,859 --> 01:20:05,361
Well, not now, whenever you're free.

1064
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:07,970
No, it's just that, I do something else.
I don't do that.

1065
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,596
Not even Friday?

1066
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:10,327
Nah.

1067
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:12,856
You can find pickups at
the top of Haft-e-Tir.

1068
01:20:13,144 --> 01:20:13,936
No, it's just that,

1069
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:17,132
my stuff are books and paintings and things
like that, I was looking for a softopper.

1070
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,444
You know, on account of
rain or things like that.

1071
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,322
I'm really busy.
I don't have time.

1072
01:20:22,635 --> 01:20:25,868
I don't care about the fee. I'll pay. I
just want my stuff to get there safe.

1073
01:20:25,973 --> 01:20:27,954
It's just that, I'm busy.
I can't.

1074
01:20:28,164 --> 01:20:30,583
Majid, come on, man. Help the guy.
Late night or something.

1075
01:20:31,397 --> 01:20:34,525
Well, how about you gimme your number?
I'll call you whenever you say.

1076
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:37,029
And if you come yourself,
even better.

1077
01:20:37,134 --> 01:20:39,428
Bro, find some time between
your schedule for him.

1078
01:20:42,349 --> 01:20:44,330
Careful not to hit the walls.

1079
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:52,151
Ah! What're you doing here?

1080
01:20:53,404 --> 01:20:55,489
Come here... kitty...

1081
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:01,162
Careful with that not to scratch it.

1082
01:21:02,165 --> 01:21:04,563
Babak, tell 'em to come
have a cup of tea.

1083
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:07,171
- There's no need for that.
- It's getting cold.

1084
01:21:11,447 --> 01:21:13,324
Where are you taking these?

1085
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:17,391
I'm taking 'em to my parent's parking lot.
We'll see what happens.

1086
01:21:17,601 --> 01:21:18,852
Won't she come to take 'em?

1087
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:22,398
She's got problems of her own.
She hasn't found a place yet.

1088
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:32,202
Get up, Babak wants to take
away that woman's stuff.

1089
01:21:33,037 --> 01:21:34,184
What do you want me to do?

1090
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:40,337
What's going on
between you two?

1091
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:42,571
Nothing, let him take 'em.
That's okay with me.

1092
01:21:50,453 --> 01:21:52,852
Hello? Majid?

1093
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,668
It's me, Etesami, couple days ago.

1094
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:57,650
You free today?

1095
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,632
How about Friday?

1096
01:23:06,887 --> 01:23:08,034
Yeah?

1097
01:23:09,912 --> 01:23:10,642
You?

1098
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:15,335
Yeah, come on up.

1099
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:37,961
Hello, can I help you?

1100
01:23:38,379 --> 01:23:41,507
Hello, Sir. You okay? Have
I come to the right place?

1101
01:23:41,821 --> 01:23:43,781
Majid said, there's some
stuff you need to move.

1102
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,410
That's right, come on in.
Why didn't he come himself?

1103
01:23:46,515 --> 01:23:49,539
Well, he was busy,
so he sent me instead.

1104
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,668
- After you.
- You first.

1105
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:54,859
But he didn't say anything
about all these stairs.

1106
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:57,467
With this heart of mine.

1107
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:58,968
Well, if I knew you're coming,

1108
01:23:58,996 --> 01:24:01,977
I would've told him about the
stairs, and the broken elevator.

1109
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:06,435
Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir.
Would you gimme a glass of water?

1110
01:24:11,858 --> 01:24:13,005
Have you hired movers?

1111
01:24:13,735 --> 01:24:18,010
No, I thought he's coming. And,
we'd take the boxes ourselves.

1112
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:20,097
Well, the poor guy
was kinda busy today.

1113
01:24:21,453 --> 01:24:23,330
- Is he your son?
- Nah, my son-in-law.

1114
01:24:23,436 --> 01:24:25,730
Doesn't make a difference though.
He's like my own son.

1115
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:38,243
Sorry, old man, we just moved out.
There's no glasses or anything.

1116
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:40,517
That's alright, mister.
I'll drink from the tap.

1117
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,876
Where are the boxes?

1118
01:24:45,128 --> 01:24:46,275
In that room.

1119
01:24:47,006 --> 01:24:49,196
We'll see. If there's too
many, we'll call movers.

1120
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:56,391
Give him a call. Maybe he's around
here somewhere. I can pick him up.

1121
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:58,582
Who?

1122
01:24:58,999 --> 01:24:59,833
Your son-in-law.

1123
01:25:00,564 --> 01:25:04,422
Nah, the poor souls just went shopping
for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony.

1124
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:11,514
Isn't the janitor
allowed to help here?

1125
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:13,809
Nah, the building's empty.

1126
01:25:13,914 --> 01:25:16,312
The walls caved, the residents
have all moved out.

1127
01:25:16,418 --> 01:25:19,129
Wow, wow! What if it collapses
on us or something?

1128
01:25:19,443 --> 01:25:20,277
Nah.

1129
01:25:20,486 --> 01:25:23,510
Let's take a look and see if
it's worth hiring movers.

1130
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:25,492
Grandpa!

1131
01:25:26,432 --> 01:25:27,162
What?

1132
01:25:27,476 --> 01:25:30,708
Would you come sit here for a sec?
I wanna tell you something.

1133
01:25:30,813 --> 01:25:32,795
Look here, mister, this
isn't my line of work.

1134
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:35,090
Majid, said, "there's this guy,
who's called a couple times...

1135
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:38,114
would you do it?" I
said, okay, why not?

1136
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:40,097
Now, you paying depends on
how generous you're feeling.

1137
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:44,269
Nah, it's not about... wages,
fees, and stuff like that.

1138
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:47,815
Just sit down. There's
something I have to tell you.

1139
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:52,925
Good news, I hope.

1140
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,348
How long do you know this guy?

1141
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:00,852
- My son-in-law?
- Yeah.

1142
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:01,896
What for?

1143
01:26:02,209 --> 01:26:03,587
I wanna know
if you know him well.

1144
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,028
Well, it's about two years they've
asked for my daughter's hand.

1145
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:09,615
Have you asked around
about him?

1146
01:26:12,431 --> 01:26:13,891
Do you know Majid?

1147
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,541
If there's anything you
know, just tell me.

1148
01:26:18,794 --> 01:26:22,860
When my wife and I moved out of
here, we went to a place that...

1149
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:30,160
it's previous tenant was... you
know, a woman of the street.

1150
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:36,418
One night, when I got home a little late.
My wife was alone in the house.

1151
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:40,902
One of these lowlifes on account
of that woman still being there...

1152
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:42,947
enters my house.

1153
01:26:45,805 --> 01:26:47,786
When my wife was
in the bathroom.

1154
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,560
The jerk goes
into the bathroom.

1155
01:26:50,082 --> 01:26:50,916
Who?

1156
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,003
That filthy
son-in-law of yours.

1157
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:59,364
Now, how do you know
it was Majid?

1158
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:03,641
When my wife starts screaming, the
guys makes a run for it, but...

1159
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:06,917
He was in such a hurry that,
he leaves his pickup behind.

1160
01:27:07,292 --> 01:27:09,899
I found him from his pickup. I
went down to where he works.

1161
01:27:11,255 --> 01:27:14,384
I wanted to go there,
grab hold of him...

1162
01:27:16,783 --> 01:27:19,161
and dishonor him in front of
all his co-workers, but...

1163
01:27:22,206 --> 01:27:23,353
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1164
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:26,482
This pickup changes hands
a lot in that store.

1165
01:27:26,483 --> 01:27:28,673
That's why I asked him to come here.
To talk to him, and ask him...

1166
01:27:28,674 --> 01:27:31,594
if it was him or someone else.

1167
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:32,846
Majid's not like that...

1168
01:27:34,932 --> 01:27:38,165
if I find out it's been him,
I'll call off everything.

1169
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,208
The wedding and all.

1170
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,196
How's your wife, now?

1171
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:50,263
I don't know what to say.

1172
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,791
Let me talk to him tonight.

1173
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,190
Give him a call and tell
him I wanna talk to him.

1174
01:27:58,295 --> 01:28:00,798
Tell him to come here, I
wanna ask him who's done it.

1175
01:28:00,799 --> 01:28:01,737
Well, it's just,

1176
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:05,517
they've gone with my wife and daughter
for "the exchange of vows" shopping.

1177
01:28:07,056 --> 01:28:08,412
Well, at least give him a call.

1178
01:28:09,455 --> 01:28:11,645
Ask him who had his pickup
that night.

1179
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:14,669
When did this happen?

1180
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:17,485
About two weeks ago.

1181
01:28:19,885 --> 01:28:24,681
Okay, so you just let me talk
to him tonight... Oh my...

1182
01:28:26,976 --> 01:28:29,061
But, I wanna talk to him,
old man.

1183
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:34,067
Wait a second, I wanna talk to him.
Call him.

1184
01:28:34,277 --> 01:28:36,571
I don't have his number
in my phone.

1185
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:38,136
I have it.

1186
01:28:40,327 --> 01:28:43,559
When I say call him to come here,
it's because I don't want to...

1187
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,750
go down to the store, make a scene
in front of his co-workers.

1188
01:28:45,751 --> 01:28:47,941
You just let me
make sure it's him.

1189
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,008
I have to talk to him in such a
way that I'll get an answer...

1190
01:28:52,009 --> 01:28:53,387
How about I call him myself, huh?

1191
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,077
You want me to do it?

1192
01:28:58,268 --> 01:28:59,728
Okay, let me just
dial his number.

1193
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:17,142
Hello, Majid? Hi, son...
where are you guys?

1194
01:29:18,498 --> 01:29:21,314
Yeah, I'm here with him.

1195
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,277
Who's with you?

1196
01:29:27,676 --> 01:29:31,743
Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call.
I wanna tell you something.

1197
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:35,706
Call my cell.

1198
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:39,982
I don't have it memorized.
Ask Moj'gan.

1199
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:46,552
Okay... it's nothing... Bye.

1200
01:29:51,246 --> 01:29:51,454
He said, he'll call when he's alone.

1201
01:29:52,707 --> 01:29:54,688
Say, what do you do yourself?

1202
01:29:56,253 --> 01:29:58,964
I work with this car of Majid's.
His pickup.

1203
01:29:59,486 --> 01:30:02,302
I sell clothes from the back
of the pickup, at nights.

1204
01:30:02,407 --> 01:30:05,431
And I don't come out during the
day, on account of my heart.

1205
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,792
And, how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

1206
01:30:12,315 --> 01:30:15,130
Well, I just don't. Not
just him, a lot of people.

1207
01:30:16,069 --> 01:30:17,842
Have you just bought
this number of yours?

1208
01:30:18,156 --> 01:30:18,990
No.

1209
01:30:37,343 --> 01:30:40,367
How come... your son-in-law
doesn't have your number?

1210
01:30:41,723 --> 01:30:44,226
You just told him to get
it from someone else, huh?

1211
01:30:44,748 --> 01:30:46,729
I don't know, man, I don't know.

1212
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:50,484
I'm so messed up right now that, I
don't even remember my own name.

1213
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,282
Wait a second, old man.

1214
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:57,265
- It won't open.
- Not so fast. Wait a minute.

1215
01:30:59,351 --> 01:31:01,437
If it's okay, I want you
to take off your shoes.

1216
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,315
What for?

1217
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:05,193
I wanna see your foot.

1218
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:08,739
Mister, I'm as old as your father,
you telling me to take off my shoes?

1219
01:31:08,844 --> 01:31:10,512
Open the door, let me go!

1220
01:31:10,826 --> 01:31:12,797
I didn't do anything to you.
Why are you talking like that?

1221
01:31:12,913 --> 01:31:14,685
Take it easy.

1222
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:18,107
Just take off your shoes for a sec. Then,
I'll open the door for you to leave.

1223
01:31:18,128 --> 01:31:21,569
Why should I take off my shoes?
Open the door!

1224
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:24,699
Hush! Come here.
Let's go over there.

1225
01:31:35,022 --> 01:31:37,212
Sit on the stair, for a
sec, take off your shoes.

1226
01:31:38,777 --> 01:31:39,299
Sit!

1227
01:31:41,906 --> 01:31:42,532
Sit down!

1228
01:31:45,453 --> 01:31:47,017
Just sit, okay?

1229
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:54,525
Take off your shoes, please.

1230
01:31:54,839 --> 01:31:55,882
I'm not feeling well, just don't!

1231
01:31:56,196 --> 01:31:57,551
Well, let me help you.

1232
01:31:57,761 --> 01:31:58,803
I'll take it off, okay.

1233
01:32:00,786 --> 01:32:02,558
<i>Whispering: I'll take it off.</i>

1234
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,152
The other one,
take off the other one too.

1235
01:32:20,495 --> 01:32:21,538
Your socks too.

1236
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,292
Mister, what do you want from me?

1237
01:32:25,398 --> 01:32:27,379
Take 'em off!
I said, take off your socks.

1238
01:32:27,483 --> 01:32:28,630
Let me do it myself.

1239
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,134
- No!
- Let me! Just let me!

1240
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:50,276
Hello, Siavash!

1241
01:33:53,406 --> 01:33:55,387
No, I'm a little busy right now.

1242
01:33:56,952 --> 01:33:58,933
What time is it, anyways?

1243
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:01,541
No I'll be there. Don't worry.

1244
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:07,798
She'll come herself...
She's a little busy.

1245
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:10,078
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1246
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:12,165
Okay, bye.

1247
01:34:14,564 --> 01:34:17,380
Swear on my life, I didn't
want to harass anyone.

1248
01:34:19,466 --> 01:34:21,968
Did that woman tell you
to go there that night?

1249
01:34:22,595 --> 01:34:25,306
That woman had been messaging
me for at least a month.

1250
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:29,562
She said, "If you still have the
pickup, come over, I wanna see you."

1251
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:33,754
And I messaged back,
"Hello, dear, sorry...

1252
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,049
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1253
01:34:37,197 --> 01:34:40,221
She took it to herself. No matter
how many times I called...

1254
01:34:40,326 --> 01:34:42,620
She never answered.

1255
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,811
Didn't want to talk to me.

1256
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:48,013
That night, I thought I'd drop
by and make it up to her.

1257
01:34:48,358 --> 01:34:49,818
Didn't you know she's moved out?

1258
01:34:50,132 --> 01:34:51,905
God knows, I had no idea.
Swear on my kids' life...

1259
01:34:51,906 --> 01:34:56,077
You opened the door, and went in. You
saw the furniture is different...

1260
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:57,663
How come you're saying
you didn't know?

1261
01:34:57,747 --> 01:35:02,335
I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff,
the bicycle I had bought myself...

1262
01:35:04,421 --> 01:35:06,403
I thought maybe she's moving.

1263
01:35:06,404 --> 01:35:08,489
You're not going out of that
door, until you tell the truth.

1264
01:35:08,594 --> 01:35:12,077
If I had the slightest idea
that you guys have moved in,

1265
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:15,269
I would've thought, maybe
there's a man in the bathroom.

1266
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:17,981
- My wife's clothes were on the bed.
- I didn't saw those.

1267
01:35:18,086 --> 01:35:20,171
You saw those and figured there
must be a woman in the bath.

1268
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,779
All alone, she even
opened the door for you.

1269
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,344
I didn't see any clothes.

1270
01:35:24,763 --> 01:35:28,308
It didn't take even five minutes. I
came in, there was no one there.

1271
01:35:28,309 --> 01:35:31,333
Just a minute ago, your wife
had opened the door for me.

1272
01:35:31,751 --> 01:35:33,732
Why did your wife
open the door for me?

1273
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:35,506
Well, she thought it's me.

1274
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,695
Let me tell you
what really happened.

1275
01:35:37,801 --> 01:35:42,493
I went by the bathroom door, called
the kid, as soon as I did...

1276
01:35:42,598 --> 01:35:44,475
there starts the screaming.
Then, I ran away.

1277
01:35:44,476 --> 01:35:45,936
You went into the bathroom.

1278
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:47,709
I didn't go in the bathroom.

1279
01:35:47,815 --> 01:35:49,483
Then, where was your foot cut like that?

1280
01:35:49,484 --> 01:35:53,238
I have no idea. By the
time I was downstairs...

1281
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,522
I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've
stepped on something running down stairs.

1282
01:35:55,524 --> 01:35:56,775
Then, my wife's lying?

1283
01:35:56,776 --> 01:35:58,548
Your wife says I went into the bathroom?

1284
01:35:58,549 --> 01:36:00,788
My wife was scared and
bumped into the glass,

1285
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,659
otherwise God knows what you
would've done, dirty scumbag!

1286
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:06,892
I swear on my life or
whatever's dear to you...

1287
01:36:06,893 --> 01:36:09,394
as soon as I found out I'm in
the wrong place, I ran away.

1288
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:13,984
Well, just tell your wife to come here.
Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her.

1289
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:16,174
What's my wife supposed to say?

1290
01:36:17,322 --> 01:36:20,451
My wife's said all she had to say.
It's your wife's turn to come here.

1291
01:36:21,077 --> 01:36:23,163
Call her, and tell her
to come here, right now.

1292
01:36:24,206 --> 01:36:24,936
What for?

1293
01:36:25,042 --> 01:36:27,231
What you said, I want you to
repeat in front of your wife.

1294
01:36:27,337 --> 01:36:29,735
Mister, why don't you get it?
I didn't go in that bath...

1295
01:36:29,736 --> 01:36:31,091
Okay, you didn't!

1296
01:36:31,614 --> 01:36:34,742
I want you to tell your wife what
you were doing in that house.

1297
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:35,890
Call her, right now!

1298
01:36:36,412 --> 01:36:37,872
Get it out, and call her!

1299
01:36:38,395 --> 01:36:40,063
Nope! Get out your cell!

1300
01:36:45,276 --> 01:36:47,466
Don't make me look bad in
front of my wife and kids.

1301
01:36:47,884 --> 01:36:48,927
Call her, right now.

1302
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,118
My daughter's about to get married.

1303
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:52,829
Your daughter has to know
her real father.

1304
01:36:53,205 --> 01:36:58,419
I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything,
just so he knows his father-in-law.

1305
01:36:58,837 --> 01:37:01,652
I don't have have to keep you here.
Go on, get out! Go!

1306
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,554
I'm gonna call your son-in-law,
tell him to bring your wife here...

1307
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:08,432
Leave me alone, mister! Ah!

1308
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:17,400
Someone help me! Help!

1309
01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:20,634
Don't make noises! Quiet!

1310
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:23,867
Open the door! Open up!
I'll die!

1311
01:37:25,745 --> 01:37:29,290
I'm about to have a stroke.
Open the door!

1312
01:37:30,438 --> 01:37:34,922
Mister! Open the door! I'm
afraid of closed spaces.

1313
01:37:38,989 --> 01:37:40,032
Open the door, my boy.

1314
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,043
At least turn on the lights.

1315
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:17,780
Forgive me...

1316
01:38:19,971 --> 01:38:21,639
my dear!

1317
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:26,644
I can't cry.

1318
01:38:28,835 --> 01:38:31,129
Why did you ever do that to yourself?

1319
01:38:35,301 --> 01:38:37,386
I don't understand it.

1320
01:38:38,117 --> 01:38:40,411
Help me, Willy!

1321
01:38:46,043 --> 01:38:48,441
It seems to me that you're
just on another trip.

1322
01:38:49,589 --> 01:38:51,153
I keep expecting you.

1323
01:38:58,246 --> 01:39:00,331
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1324
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:03,459
Right today.

1325
01:39:05,546 --> 01:39:08,048
And there will be nobody home.

1326
01:39:11,073 --> 01:39:13,471
We're free and clear.

1327
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:18,999
We're free.

1328
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:42,938
Rana, lock the door,
and take the keys.

1329
01:40:56,181 --> 01:40:58,058
Get up, on your feet.

1330
01:41:14,534 --> 01:41:15,785
Here, wait.

1331
01:41:17,663 --> 01:41:18,706
Sit here.

1332
01:41:35,599 --> 01:41:36,955
You go in that room.

1333
01:42:07,715 --> 01:42:10,009
Look how mentally and
emotionally shattered she is.

1334
01:42:18,978 --> 01:42:23,253
There's my wife. Are you gonna keep saying
you haven't gone into the bathroom?

1335
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:26,174
I'm sorry.

1336
01:42:27,009 --> 01:42:28,156
Answer me.

1337
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:32,640
I made a mistake.

1338
01:42:33,371 --> 01:42:36,395
Tell me, why did you
go into the bathroom?

1339
01:42:42,235 --> 01:42:43,799
I gave into temptation.

1340
01:42:56,001 --> 01:42:57,357
What are you gonna do to him?

1341
01:42:57,775 --> 01:43:02,050
His family are on their way, I want
his wife to know what he's done.

1342
01:43:10,803 --> 01:43:12,679
You're taking your revenge.

1343
01:43:15,809 --> 01:43:17,268
Let him go, let him leave.

1344
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:19,772
I know what I'm doing.

1345
01:43:21,441 --> 01:43:23,527
You sit here, there's no
need for you to come out.

1346
01:43:46,884 --> 01:43:48,449
Where are you going?

1347
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:52,933
I'm not feeling right at all.
Let me go.

1348
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:55,020
They're coming after you.

1349
01:43:55,542 --> 01:43:57,419
Your son-in-law called,
he asked about you.

1350
01:43:57,524 --> 01:43:59,088
I told him to come over.

1351
01:43:59,298 --> 01:44:00,758
And to bring your wife too.

1352
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:05,347
They're on their way. Sit down.

1353
01:44:11,708 --> 01:44:13,377
I'm begging you, please
let me go.

1354
01:44:14,316 --> 01:44:16,923
When your family get here. Tell
them everything you told me.

1355
01:44:17,862 --> 01:44:17,862
Then you can leave.

1356
01:44:18,489 --> 01:44:19,532
I'm begging you.

1357
01:44:39,136 --> 01:44:40,178
Miss!

1358
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:42,161
Forgive me.

1359
01:44:42,996 --> 01:44:44,977
Let me go, before they get here.

1360
01:45:04,267 --> 01:45:06,978
That woman lived with me for
35 years.

1361
01:45:20,743 --> 01:45:22,515
Mister! Get up! Get up, go!

1362
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:28,356
You, sit down!

1363
01:45:28,669 --> 01:45:29,837
Leave him alone, let him go.

1364
01:45:30,234 --> 01:45:34,092
He'll go, he will. When his family
get here, they can leave together.

1365
01:45:35,344 --> 01:45:36,282
Sit down.

1366
01:45:36,492 --> 01:45:37,222
For the love of God!

1367
01:45:37,327 --> 01:45:38,266
Here, mister, go.

1368
01:45:38,371 --> 01:45:39,205
- Just, sit down.
- Let him go!

1369
01:45:39,206 --> 01:45:40,666
My girl! My boy!

1370
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:43,378
- Leave him alone, Emad!
- You stay out of this!

1371
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:47,133
- Sit down!
- Please.

1372
01:45:47,135 --> 01:45:47,656
I said sit down! Ah!

1373
01:45:47,657 --> 01:45:50,056
SIT... DOWN! Here.

1374
01:46:10,389 --> 01:46:13,518
What? What do you want?

1375
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:26,240
Oh, my God!

1376
01:46:30,203 --> 01:46:31,246
Emad!

1377
01:46:31,664 --> 01:46:34,583
- Does he, by any chance, take
any under-the-tongue pills?

1378
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:37,400
I searched. There's
nothing in his pockets.

1379
01:46:37,402 --> 01:46:39,279
- What happened?
- Where are you now?

1380
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:43,763
No, no, get here as soon as you can.
Okay, okay.

1381
01:46:44,494 --> 01:46:46,684
- Was it the Emergency?
- His family. They're coming.

1382
01:46:46,895 --> 01:46:50,231
- Oh, my God!
- Mister! Can you hear me?

1383
01:46:50,441 --> 01:46:53,361
Does he have a pulse? Emad,
can you hear his heartbeat?

1384
01:46:53,362 --> 01:46:56,073
Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet.
Let me see what I'm doing.

1385
01:46:59,306 --> 01:47:00,141
Where are you going?

1386
01:47:00,145 --> 01:47:02,377
He said he's got pills.
Maybe they're in the car.

1387
01:47:34,968 --> 01:47:38,826
Can you hear me?
Open your mouth. Open!

1388
01:47:55,093 --> 01:47:58,117
Mister! Get up!
Can you hear me?

1389
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:04,166
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1390
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:08,338
You better now?
You feeling better?

1391
01:48:11,362 --> 01:48:15,220
Breathe! Breathe!
You better, now?

1392
01:48:29,924 --> 01:48:30,966
Don't worry, he's better.

1393
01:48:30,967 --> 01:48:32,740
You didn't call the Emergency?

1394
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:37,630
No, I was afraid he might be dead.

1395
01:48:45,514 --> 01:48:46,599
Wait a minute!

1396
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:53,794
If you say anything to his family, I don't
wanna have anything to do with you.

1397
01:49:03,284 --> 01:49:04,744
Yes?

1398
01:49:09,541 --> 01:49:11,835
- Hello.
- The elevator's broken, use the stairs.

1399
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:13,713
Come on, ma!

1400
01:49:14,966 --> 01:49:18,302
You go ahead, I can't run
with this pain in my legs.

1401
01:49:23,517 --> 01:49:25,498
Ya Ali! My dear.

1402
01:49:27,272 --> 01:49:28,419
Come on in. Come in.

1403
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:41,871
Ya Allah! Dad! Dad!

1404
01:49:42,706 --> 01:49:44,166
How are you dad?

1405
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,252
- Majid!
- What? Come in.

1406
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:50,217
- Dad! Daddy!
- Thank God, he's fine.

1407
01:49:50,218 --> 01:49:51,469
You okay, dad?

1408
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,033
I'm fine.

1409
01:49:53,868 --> 01:49:56,788
You're okay.
That was such a scare, dad.

1410
01:49:57,414 --> 01:49:58,874
Where's you mother?

1411
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,648
She's in the stairs.
Let me call her.

1412
01:50:00,649 --> 01:50:02,004
Majid, don't call her.

1413
01:50:02,214 --> 01:50:04,174
- Let's go!
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.

1414
01:50:04,926 --> 01:50:08,240
Majid! If mother doesn't see him, she'd
think something must've happened to him.

1415
01:50:08,267 --> 01:50:09,206
Let her see he's fine.

1416
01:50:09,515 --> 01:50:12,330
Hello, sorry. We were in such a
hurry that we didn't notice you.

1417
01:50:13,478 --> 01:50:14,138
That's alright.

1418
01:50:14,165 --> 01:50:16,320
Sit down, dad. What
are you getting up for?

1419
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,320
I thought mother better come up and
see you, and then we'll leave. Sit.

1420
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:23,596
We're in no hurry. Let him sit
down until he gets better.

1421
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:25,682
We're really sorry, mister.

1422
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:30,271
Dad, just sit down. Can you?

1423
01:50:30,376 --> 01:50:31,732
Yeah, I'm alright.

1424
01:50:31,942 --> 01:50:32,880
Majid!

1425
01:50:34,549 --> 01:50:37,365
What is it, ma? We're here.

1426
01:50:37,574 --> 01:50:41,120
Come. Thank God, dad's sitting here.
He's all right.

1427
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:45,813
What is, dad? Huh?

1428
01:51:02,393 --> 01:51:05,312
- It's nothing, ma.
- What happened?

1429
01:51:07,712 --> 01:51:08,859
What happened to you?

1430
01:51:15,846 --> 01:51:18,348
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?

1431
01:51:24,397 --> 01:51:26,483
See what you're doing to me and yourself?

1432
01:51:28,465 --> 01:51:31,697
Oh, God.
Thank you so much, God!

1433
01:51:33,992 --> 01:51:36,703
God knows, on our way here I
vowed to give away a hundred

1434
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,415
different charities, just to
hear his voice one more time.

1435
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,023
Thank God.

1436
01:51:46,612 --> 01:51:48,280
How many times did
I tell you not to go?

1437
01:51:48,386 --> 01:51:52,557
My dear! I don't want you to work.
I don't.

1438
01:51:53,809 --> 01:51:56,563
Darling, you said, "Majid called,
I have to go, I'll be back soon."

1439
01:51:56,625 --> 01:51:58,502
Soon, you call this "soon"?

1440
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,797
Mom, we have to thank these guys,
they stayed with him all this time.

1441
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:03,718
Or else, we don't know what
would've happened to dad.

1442
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:05,804
We really don't know how to thank you.
That was so kind of you.

1443
01:52:05,805 --> 01:52:09,455
May God give you back, miss.

1444
01:52:09,977 --> 01:52:13,731
He's my whole life, mister.
Thank you so much.

1445
01:52:14,566 --> 01:52:15,922
You gave me my life back.

1446
01:52:16,235 --> 01:52:19,155
He's all I've got.

1447
01:52:19,886 --> 01:52:21,763
Come on, mom, stop it.

1448
01:52:24,266 --> 01:52:25,935
Get up, let's go.

1449
01:52:36,051 --> 01:52:38,388
Did you take all your stuff, dad?
Where's your cellphone?

1450
01:52:39,389 --> 01:52:40,432
Car keys.

1451
01:52:40,953 --> 01:52:43,247
Where's his glasses? Don't
leave without his glasses.

1452
01:52:43,874 --> 01:52:46,897
I've got it... Come here,
I'll give it to you.

1453
01:52:47,524 --> 01:52:52,321
- You go, I'll get it.
- Majid, the glasses...

1454
01:52:55,242 --> 01:52:56,389
This way.

1455
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:00,978
What business? You just
saved his life, son.

1456
01:53:02,648 --> 01:53:04,984
No, mister, we've put you
through enough trouble already.

1457
01:53:05,255 --> 01:53:06,819
It's nothing fancy, you know.

1458
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:09,948
Come on, this way.

1459
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,181
Well, if there's anything
to do, just let me...

1460
01:53:13,703 --> 01:53:16,206
No, let him come himself.
Come on, this way.

1461
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:26,843
You guys go.

1462
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,773
Majid. Let me...

1463
01:54:26,488 --> 01:54:28,656
How much money did you leave
in the room, that night?

1464
01:54:28,887 --> 01:54:30,764
Huh?

1465
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:33,060
How much money did you
leave in the room?

1466
01:54:34,103 --> 01:54:34,832
I didn't count.

1467
01:55:55,122 --> 01:55:56,582
What happened, dad?

1468
01:55:57,521 --> 01:55:59,607
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!

1469
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:03,779
What happened to you?
He's sick again.

1470
01:56:04,092 --> 01:56:07,221
What are these?
Where were these?

1471
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:09,849
- Come on, sit down a little.
- Is it your heart, dad?

1472
01:56:11,915 --> 01:56:15,564
Let him sit for a while.
Come on, this way.

1473
01:56:17,651 --> 01:56:20,153
We can't take him like this. Majid!

1474
01:56:20,362 --> 01:56:21,509
Majid, hurry up!

1475
01:56:33,814 --> 01:56:36,108
- We're almost there, dad.
- Esmat!

1476
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:37,986
I'm hear, dear.

1477
01:56:40,281 --> 01:56:41,323
Come on, mom.

1478
01:56:41,846 --> 01:56:43,618
Watch it, don't drop him.

1479
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:49,667
- Esmat! Esmat!
- What? Darling, I'm here.

1480
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:52,797
What happened to you?
Ya Abalfazl!

1481
01:56:54,258 --> 01:56:55,301
Stretch his legs.

1482
01:57:02,185 --> 01:57:04,312
- God! Dad! You hear me? Dad!
- Where are his pills?

1483
01:57:06,357 --> 01:57:09,172
Where are his pills?
Search his pockets.

1484
01:57:10,112 --> 01:57:12,406
Stretch his legs! Hurry up!

1485
01:57:15,116 --> 01:57:17,201
- God help us!
- Dad, breathe!

1486
01:57:18,558 --> 01:57:19,913
- See if his pills are upstairs.

1487
01:57:29,924 --> 01:57:33,469
Miss! Miss! Are my dad's pills here?

1488
01:57:34,305 --> 01:57:36,286
He's got sick again,
he's lying in the stairs.

1489
01:57:47,758 --> 01:57:50,364
Mister, for God's sake, will
you get on the way right away?

1490
01:57:51,408 --> 01:57:54,036
- Yes, miss, just give some time
for my colleagues to get there.

1491
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:58,040
Just follow my instructions. His
legs must be straight, not bent.

1492
01:58:03,713 --> 01:58:04,756
He's lying face up.

1493
01:58:13,516 --> 01:58:15,184
Mister, he's all blue in the face.

1494
01:58:16,228 --> 01:58:20,399
Just keep doing what I told you. If you
get tired, let someone else do it.

1495
01:58:25,822 --> 01:58:29,784
Mister, he's not moving... No, no, nothing.
He's not moving at all.

1496
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,815
Mister, can we put his
pill under his tongue?

1497
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,674
- No, no, miss, don't give him
nothing, just do what I told you.

1498
01:58:42,301 --> 01:58:44,323
Just make sure his legs,
are stretched, not bent.

1499
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:44,996
Yeah, yeah.

1500
01:59:26,721 --> 01:59:28,181
Guys, please hurry up!

1501
01:59:32,561 --> 01:59:34,751
- Hello, where's the patient?
- He's inside.

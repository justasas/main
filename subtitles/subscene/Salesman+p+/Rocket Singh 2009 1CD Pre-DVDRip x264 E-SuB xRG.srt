I told him to apply for CAT,
but he is not listening to me

13
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,432

14

24
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,335
But they're not more rich people

25
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,677

He earns 40 thousands a month.

28
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,613
And for having commision, have
to get a order, and for getting order

67
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,655

00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,078
If you push it hardly so it'll broke

71
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,049

Sir the salesmans's interview...

79
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,077
Sales works by balance sheet not

80
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,816
He was selling the 2 rupee's
pencil like 20 lacs mercedes.

81
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,311

00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,051
He was making a new slogan

Whoever sales can come...

What's that mean

90
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,697
It happens in sales

91
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,358

00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,827

95
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,192

96

what the professionals thinks
about that work

97
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,430

just thinks its a work

98
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,574
just do your work like veneration

99
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,541
And leave it all to God.

100
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,694
He was honest

101
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,313
Adjust his fee...

102
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,523

103
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,362

If it would be so what will you do

108
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,756
What're you doing...
writting the company's name

109
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,289
Sales first rule...
never write correct name of your and compnay's

110
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,566
no one sees the register of company.
But competitor will scan it.

111
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,113
Is that a name?

112
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,819

You'll grew up when
you'll reach to client

119
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,799
Will you say something
or smile like a fool?

120
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,034
Sharma is busy!
Why?

121
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,407
Can't you come to meet you... without
any reason you dont meet with your wife

122
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,109

123
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,386

129
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,482

00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,893
Is there a training going on with you.
I've canceled the trip

131

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,295

He's my cousin

146
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,785

You can read it upside down?

153

The salesman cant read upside down,

154
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,463

00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,200

but if its your big company so
your prices is high too

301
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,009
If company is big so its

302
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,350
price should not be accordint
to company but clients pocket

303
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,952
just give order first

304
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:24,906
We dont sale the pc on debit card

305
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,550

320
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,161
you'll sale it on 30000 atleast?

321
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,457
The full pc could assemble in 20000
thousand with graphic card

322
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,032
We can make it in 25000

323
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,460
But company dont give clients
less than 35-40...

324
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,901
If its worths so cheap so why
do you sold out it on high rates?

325
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,207
Because cutomers meant be fool

00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,910
If I'd have big show room,
so I'd sale it on high rates

327
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,682
To whom will you rob?

389
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,115

391
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,381
Just always feed us food

393
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:52,430
so we can runs with honor

394
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,090
As zero has its value...
so he has own value

395
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,158
neither manners for talking...
nor wit for understand the world

396
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,837
But zero is very usefull sir...

397
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,972
If a user knows its value

398
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,148
You reached at right place

399
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:32,618
at many times you'll put it...
you'll gain by it...

400
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,481
zero is very amazing thing

401
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:53,064
Today that zero gave me profit
more than entire salesman

402
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:54,567
ask how?

403
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,377
That fool was mis behaving with you...

404
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,646
But he's a fooll...
he was shocked

405
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,393
But by his fool act...
I got a chance

406
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,324
It had attacked like 9/11 on company

407
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,825
Salesman's commisons got removed...
and targets reached double

408
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:26,535
Now I'm on the top portal
of my life

409
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:33,442
and lts all beacause of this zero

410
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:41,012
But he did very bad with you sir.

411
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,588
We'll make him apolozise to you

412
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,324
speak up...

413
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,997
I'll not do it again

414
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,379
okay forgive him

415
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:08,309
He's minor man...
he's not on our level

416
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,028
shall we go

417
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,372
leave all this about salesman

418
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,203
I will leave it

419
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,141
But wherever I'll go...
will be salesman

420
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,073
What is your fault in it...
its company's fault

421
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,479
If next company will be like that so?

422
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,512
Means?

423
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,585
You used to do preparing for exame
whole night...

424
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,162
And I used to play cricket...
do you know why?

425
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,027
Because I was failed inside

426
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,730
So whatever Numbers used to got...

427
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,543
I just was...
no listen...

428
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:16,207
Do you know why Puri is continously
insulting me, because I'm letting him do,

429
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,186
But I am happy with that I
got ajob,

430
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,554
I just realise that it's not his
mistake but mine,

431
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,934
I have to pay the price to being nice,

432
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,676
If I would be sitting as a nice, then
it would be the biggest mistake of my life,

433
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,287
You supposed to quit this job,
I was...

434
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,154
but now I won't quit,

435
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,386
I won't quit this job,

436
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,588
I gave my interview,
and I have been selected,

437
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,163
I'm suitable for this job,
I ain't do nothing wrong,

438
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,193
When entire company is wrong...

439
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,557
If company is wrong then
it will be right.

440
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,537
I won't be wrong,

441
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,596
neither I will quit this job,

442
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:12,498
What will you do?

443
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,411
Whatever I will do...

444
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,380
after that puri will never said to
any employee that he is zero.

445
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:31,783
Whatever happened till today,

446
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,123
it happened by mistake,

447
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,265
but if mistake has been commited,

448
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,965
Now I will grow up that mistake,

449
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,372
You have just started your carrier,
why you are taking a big risk,

450
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,008
Even Spiderman have to take
the risk,

451
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,413
and I am just a salesman,

452
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,291
Will you be our office manager?

453
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:09,187
Join us,

454
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,088
First you leave this job,

455
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:12,793
Have you lost your mind,

456
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,628
You are already doomed,
now what are you doing?

457
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:17,635
If somebody will know about that,

458
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,634
they will chop your carrier and
distribute to entire staff,

459
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:21,734
Will you join us or not?

460
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:23,736
Why you are doing this?

461
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,445
We work in some office where nobody
cares our efficiencies,

462
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,115
and what is really not important,

463
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,643
everyone cares about that,

464
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:33,684
and we are just become that,

465
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,057
I was just ajoker,
and you are some item girl.

466
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,707
Have you gone mad?
You told her everything,

467
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,906
What relax?
She will tell puri everything,

468
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,303
then we both will lose ourjobs,

469
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,946
She won't tell him,
She is not like that,

470
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,216
Why she won't tell him, how
do you know about everyone,

471
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,712
Everyone in this company is
politician master,

472
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,891
They will sold you and you
will keep saying them thanks,

473
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,553
She won't tell anyone,
Why?

474
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,825
Is she belongs to your village,
She is not like that,

475
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,558
Don't interact with her,

476
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:19,966
Listen to me,
Do you trust me?

477
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,959
It was yet but not anymore,

478
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:22,861
Do you?

479
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:24,566
Like I trust Koena,

480
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,802
and please you shut your mouth,

481
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,010
From today whatever our company will
earn that will be divided in 3 shares,

482
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,715
Yours, Mine and Koena,

483
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,588
You're talking about to rise up the
business, and no profit,

484
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,790
How would you rise up your business?

485
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,298
We will get large business because
of her, How?

486
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:02,073
If something will happen wrong?
Nothing will happen, I am here.

487
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,482
If something will happen wrong,
What more will happen wrong,

488
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:25,923
If you will look over koena like...

489
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,027
How?

490
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,998
Like you look at your web sites.

491
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,849
We need our own office,

492
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:50,923
At least we will be needed our
own conference room,

493
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,907
Tell me what happened,
My husband has suppose to come,

494
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,552
You are busy with your photos
all day long,

495
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,821
We have to deal the people.

496
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:25,955
After today...

497
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,261
We won't discuss anything regarding
Rocket Singh Corporation in this office,

498
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,597
Take these dead client's list.

499
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,901
They all quit our company to
fed up from our bad services.

500
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:52,609
And I hope they all needed
a good service.

501
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,189
Let's offer them
services in half rates.

502
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,526
I mean it will cost 4-5 thousand
per computer,

503
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:08,696
We will offer them 2500.

504
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,034
And who will provide services.

505
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,903
I am busy in office all day long,

506
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,583
but we can service in nights,

507
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,078
idea is good,
but I never heard before.

508
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,922
He will ask about his computer's
services and maintenance,

509
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,091
client will never have a chance
to see the broken computer.

510
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,161
Nobody will recognize me,

511
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:44,102
What?
Nobody will recognize me either.

512
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,871
You don't know air voice company
keeps the record of everything.

513
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,411
Whatever office equipments you used,

514
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,310
you have to repay for all of them,

515
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,353
Hello! It's me.
Now what?

516
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:05,850
Nothing, I am suffering from viral.

517
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,325
If I got holiday today then...

518
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,198
You can't come on job,

519
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,734
then our company will be closed,
In fact you handle the entire jobs,

520
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:21,809
No,
It's just a fever,

521
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,146
Do what do you want?
Don't waste my time,

522
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,252
You mean you provide services
in nights and holidays,

523
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,955
Yes, in nights, holiday, eid,
new year.

524
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,353
Anytime, any day,
just a phone call away.

525
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:30,238
Would you give me in written
with your signature,

526
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,552
I have seen many companies before,

527
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:42,017
but never seen confidence like you,

528
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:46,861
You won't need it,

529
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,431
and if it will be any,
then I will sell my bike.

530
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,257
I have called to Mr. Wajahat
on his UAN number,

531
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,066
He called us in office after 7.

532
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:28,593
Client is not free before that,

533
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,030
We are also not free,

534
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,371
Mr. Wajahat has recommended you.

535
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:42,941
It's all fine,

536
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,218
but don't you think you are small
company for this huge order,

537
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,149
We are small but our hunger
is bigger,

538
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:52,358
We both know that we both
need each other,

539
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,691
and when we both know then we
don't have chance for mistake.

540
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,027
If there will be something wrong then
how would you pay double from contract,

541
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,739
It will be your right on first cheque
what will come from Mr. Wajahat.

542
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,745
If you will be happy from us, then
you will transfer that money to us,

543
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:15,114
otherwise your company can keep it,

544
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,917
You're taking a big risk,
Even Spiderman have to take risk,

545
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,586
and I am just a salesman,

546
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,759
I am telling you one more time,

547
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,900
Only honesty will work with me,

548
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,235
that's the only thing I have,

549
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,166
what else?

550
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,234
How many days it will take
for 30 computers.

551
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,875
30 are enough it will take 20 days.

552
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,613
We have to deliver in one week,
What?

553
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,481
And I said them yes,
don't you know another word,

554
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,750
You didn't hear that,
He said yes to them,

555
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,624
Now I have said one week,
Now I can't take my words back.

556
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:03,926
Who could assemble computer.

557
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,900
I knew that,
Do you know someone,

558
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,264
There is only trustable man,

559
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:15,834
who can quickly assemble computers.

560
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,244
Who?
Shukla!

561
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,482
He doesn't know how to run it,
But he know how to assemble it.

562
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:26,616
If it's like that then...

563
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,682
I think we can bring one more
partner in our company,

564
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,759
Have you gone mad, you will make
a peon your partner,

565
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,558
Why not? If he know the job of
director then why he can't be one,

566
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,995
I knew that something will
happen wrong,

567
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,025
If you already knew that why did
you join us,

568
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:42,766
I didn't know that it will happen
much wrong,

569
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,372
Me?
A partner in company,

570
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,400
No!
It's not possible.

571
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:52,311
Why?
You can assemble the computer.

572
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,648
Yes!
Then you can become a partner,

573
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,849
but my job is to make tea,

574
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,709
if you're missing alot then
you can make tea too.

575
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:03,850
May I have to talk in english.

576
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,790
You don't have to talk to anyone,

577
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,786
All you have to assemble computers
with Giri.

578
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,159
I hope there will be no issue ofjail,

579
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:16,192
We are doing business,
Why we will go to jail.

580
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,471
Many big businessman goes to jail,
We're not doing a big business,

581
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,108
If Mr. Puri will knew about that,
who will tell him,

582
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,080
Only we four knew about that.

583
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:34,919
I can only get this respect in
your company,

584
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:41,255
Which day first time you called me
Mr. Mishra instead of Chotay Lal.

585
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:46,291
If you don't need a partner share
in our company,

586
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,363
No!
I didn't said it.

587
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:10,118
He won't do it,
but why you are not working,

588
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,617
You are also a partner,
you will also get your share,

589
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,927
We are getting many wrong numbers,

590
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,767
What?
You just gave me,

591
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,138
Rocket Sales Corporations.

592
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,371
Credit card companies change their
names to call us,

593
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,058
I have to talk all of you.

594
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:02,527
Right now,

595
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:26,882
How do I know how nitin get it.

596
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:30,120
It must be gone in urgent,

597
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,103
There must be a solution,

598
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,498
with who our clients can call us,
and we did not get caught.

599
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,715
We have two numbers.

600
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,287
What we got but didn't used,

601
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,186
and puri might be doesn't remember,

602
01:29:57,592 --> 01:30:01,688
If someone call us on that number,
then we won't have problem,

603
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,794
If some day you will cheat your
husband, he will be doomed,

604
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:12,602
Our phone bills will be submitted,
We have to write down in accounts,

605
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:13,838
He is started again,

606
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:14,970
somebody will be doubt on us.

607
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:19,263
You gave us computers in cheap prices,
Really impressive.

608
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,666
It's hard to setup in new office,

609
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,775
By the way how is your office,
I'm thinking to close it,

610
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:29,768
Why?

611
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,111
Life is not so easy what we
assume in college,

612
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,773
Salaries, Utility bills, Rent,

613
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,678
And for new companies client
doesn't come on phone,

614
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:48,092
Everyone says that you need few
years to start your new business,

615
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,029
Anyway how's your going?

616
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:56,929
Training period is over,
It was over that time,

617
01:32:57,438 --> 01:32:59,303
When?
After your order,

618
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:03,369
It wasn't a big order,
How do you know how bigger it was,

619
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:05,311
what do you mean?
I will tell you later.

620
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,170
Tell me right now,

621
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,972
Clients doesn't watch movies,
Ofcouse they watch,

622
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,218
Seven computers in 2 days,

623
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,418
We are going too slow,

624
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:53,156
You are not taking parts from
other shop,

625
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,995
Your lalwani electronics is just
a small part supplier,

626
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,455
If you want to do big job
then leave him,

627
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:00,091
I won't leave lalwani,

628
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,365
When I didn't have money so
he gave me credit,

629
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:06,131
Now when I got big order
so we should leave him,

630
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,407
Business doesn't happen like this,
Which kind of business you're doing,

631
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,576
You will get loss and give us too.

632
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:30,692
I was doubted from that day when
this child was behaving like elders,

633
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,693
and that phone call.

634
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,942
Let's call him directly,

635
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:43,809
I hope you all have Mr. Puri's number,

636
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:52,719
If I will speak then you will
say that I speak much,

637
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:55,983
and if I won't speak...

638
01:34:57,258 --> 01:34:59,488
it will cost big amount
for not to speak,

639
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:00,792
How much?
10 percent,

640
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,561
on your every sale.

641
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,297
If you need share in our company,

642
01:35:07,902 --> 01:35:09,870
so you have to work like all partners,

643
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,132
Come in senses,
Good Morning,

644
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,806
Situation is like that you can't
put me on any condition,

645
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:20,645
but I can put any condition,

646
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:23,880
We can also put condition,
and we are putting,

647
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:28,151
If you will misbehave with us
one more time,

648
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:31,887
then since past 2 years what
counterfiet conveyance vouchers you

649
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:36,127
are making from me, I will give all
of them to Mr. Puri with morning tea.

650
01:35:58,018 --> 01:36:01,954
I am giving you the same offer on
the front of all partners,

651
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:03,913
Join us,

652
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:07,655
and take your share like others,
Now we are five people.

653
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,967
Why should we give him equal share.
Because he is experienced.

654
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,696
He will bring many orders...

655
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,613
We never lied to clients,
No matter you lost your order,

656
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,410
Let the order go but never lose
the client's faith.

657
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:37,546
We believe in services more
than sales.

658
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,252
Because which company offers services,
he got the big sales.

659
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,726
We don't give bribe if client
ask for it,

660
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,894
then how do you get order,
We don't get such orders.

661
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,495
We don't promise in false delivery.

662
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:52,395
And what date we promised,
we deliver on the same date.

663
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:57,037
We are always available for client,
days and nights.

664
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,945
He will drive us crazy to call us,
that's the rule.

665
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,715
When patients become doctor
to wear doctor's coat.

666
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:04,175
Same thing happened there.

667
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:45,837
And it's not the first order.

668
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:49,308
What goes to them besided
it was coming to us,

669
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:53,478
and you...

670
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:00,281
You lost twice from this company,

671
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:05,082
What happened? What this so
called rocket company does,

672
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:08,455
that he takes clients under your noses,

673
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:24,634
How much they are giving bribes,

674
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:27,139
that every order goes to
them on last moment,

675
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,179
You must have applied there yet,

676
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:37,422
who are they people?

677
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:40,358
When Amenti was giving them order,
you were sleeping,

678
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:42,223
How order goes to them,

679
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:47,098
Sir, I don't know much they offered a
nice sheme on last phone call,

680
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:51,360
What scheme?
This is India,

681
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,905
Since when people are getting
orders on service scheme,

682
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:59,536
Sir, they reached to service in night,
Rubbish!

683
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:03,906
Sir, their quotations are cheap like
one client called me thief,

684
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:04,843
How cheap?

685
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:10,782
Which computer we are selling on
32000, they are offering on 26000.

686
01:42:11,091 --> 01:42:12,991
And they are also offering
2 years free service.

687
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:21,025
If he is selling computers in this
rates it means...

688
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:24,268
on which computer we were earning
6000, he is earning 2200.

689
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:26,664
What are they doing?

690
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:30,532
I don't know sir,

691
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,182
Where is the office?

692
01:42:49,096 --> 01:42:52,532
They are taking orders under your nose,

693
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:58,268
and nobody knows anything
except phone number,

694
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:01,732
There is something fishy.

695
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:11,341
Find out every detail of Rocket
Singh within a week,

696
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:34,404
Vice President Sale's post is empty.

697
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:37,343
I need an efficient man for it,

698
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:42,277
Show me in a week that
how efficient you're.

699
01:43:42,816 --> 01:43:44,113
And next week,

700
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:46,482
shift on it or find anotherjob,

701
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,045
We have many efficient people here.

702
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:13,235
Do you know which kind of
human puri is,

703
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,874
He is just getting doubt...

704
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:22,451
If he will know...
If we won't tell then how do he know,

705
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:23,916
don't under estimate him,

706
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:26,053
You didn't see how did he
calculate the profit.

707
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,394
And our address is printed
on all client's bills.

708
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:32,495
I told you let's have post box number.

709
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,357
Really?
Then everyone will doubt on us.

710
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:35,867
He will must know.

711
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:47,235
What happen?

712
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:54,516
Whatever happened between us,
don't take is personal.

713
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,990
I was never against you.

714
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:21,174
First time in my carrier many people
are scared from me,

715
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:24,550
what do you think?
I am not feeling happy.

716
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,225
When I came to this business,
I was like you.

717
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:36,122
I didn't take bribe in begininng.

718
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:40,161
But when I start losing my promotions,

719
01:45:41,735 --> 01:45:43,168
and others get promoted on my
front then I also...

720
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:51,042
Because of you after many years I felt
to become owner of myself,

721
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,506
but Puri showed my limits today.

722
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,655
If you sold yourself once, then others
always thinks you're for sale.

723
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,385
No matter what he is his boss
or his partners,

724
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,468
I won't tell anything to puri.

725
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,495
Now you decide what to do.

726
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:35,516
You shift the place for few days,
but where we will keep the material.

727
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:38,958
If customers will call then we
will need it,

728
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:41,020
Yes,
someone must have to do it.

729
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:44,989
I have a friend,

730
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:06,342
I took your order for company,

731
01:47:06,853 --> 01:47:07,683
but you supplied by your self.

732
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:16,961
If you would be on my place,
then what would you do.

733
01:47:18,165 --> 01:47:21,293
If I would be on your place then
your boss will be in grave.

734
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:46,290
They are waiting outside,

735
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,420
They have stuff in tempo,

736
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:11,039
Rocket Sales here,
Will you speak to client like this,

737
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:22,988
Client will think he called up
in slimming centre,

738
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:41,178
Finally we got our seperate number,

739
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:43,072
and within few days we will give this
number to our all clients.

740
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,726
Take this call.

741
01:49:29,129 --> 01:49:32,895
It's Puri on phone,
Talk to him,

742
01:49:46,513 --> 01:49:48,811
He is not in office,
I'll give your message to him,

743
01:49:51,918 --> 01:49:53,317
Where is your office?

744
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,144
On Second floor.
Thankyou for calling,

745
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,060
This time he just called,

746
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:10,401
Next time he will catch our throats.

747
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:14,604
He know everything,
I am telling you,

748
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,942
If he would know then we won't
keep talking here,

749
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:21,446
we would be in jail...

750
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:25,649
Jail?
Jail is not a concern,

751
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:28,786
that book on internet and send people,
Nothing will happen,

752
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:31,247
What if he will call again,
tell him that boss is sick,

753
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,785
No!
He is out of station,

754
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:34,726
tell him he is out of country,

755
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:40,760
If he wants to meet me then I'll
meet him, Are you kidding?

756
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:45,370
You told me there will no
issue ofjail.

757
01:50:53,446 --> 01:50:55,038
He wants to meet the M.D.
Of Rocket Sales.

758
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:56,742
Something is running in his mind,

759
01:50:57,751 --> 01:50:59,616
and until I won't meet him,
We will never figure it out,

760
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:02,148
but what we have to do what's
running in his mind,

761
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:03,547
Just look after your self,

762
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:05,648
His business is going down,

763
01:51:06,059 --> 01:51:07,890
and he can do anything to save
his business,

764
01:51:08,528 --> 01:51:11,622
Before he do something we should
know what he will do.

765
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:13,697
But how would you meet him,

766
01:51:16,436 --> 01:51:17,528
Like...

767
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:19,505
A king met another king,

768
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:51,633
Sir, there is phone call for you from
Rocket Singh's MD.

769
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:53,385
I have to purchase few computers.

770
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,154
I hope I didn't call late,
No, no!

771
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:05,260
Is it your office where I called up,

772
02:00:06,632 --> 02:00:08,224
Is it your office number,
Right sir,

773
02:00:10,136 --> 02:00:12,764
and within we will get
24 hours helpline.

774
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:23,805
You people sell computers,
Notjust sell we also provide services,

775
02:00:29,755 --> 02:00:31,347
then how bigger company you have,

776
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:37,391
how many people,
It's such a small team,

777
02:00:37,964 --> 02:00:39,955
Sir, meet some day personally,

778
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:45,965
Who is the owner of your company,

779
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:49,640
We all are owners,

780
02:00:58,117 --> 02:01:00,915
when you will meet personally
to our executive.

781
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:24,369
What did you think?

782
02:01:27,913 --> 02:01:31,041
You junior people will fool
around Sunil Puri.

783
02:01:32,018 --> 02:01:35,647
And with this zero mind,

784
02:01:41,694 --> 02:01:43,355
You were already become Vice President,

785
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:45,893
you should have tell me everything,

786
02:01:46,332 --> 02:01:47,856
What was wrong with you?

787
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,662
You will never understand?
Then explain me,

788
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:54,998
I am an intelligent man,

789
02:01:55,508 --> 02:01:57,635
before jail just try to
explain me once,

790
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:00,545
Look!
Whatever happened, I have started,

791
02:02:00,946 --> 02:02:02,379
so you better talk to me,

792
02:02:05,951 --> 02:02:08,078
Leadership qualities come out
from Mr. Zero.

793
02:02:13,959 --> 02:02:15,517
I'll talk to you.

794
02:02:17,063 --> 02:02:18,052
Since when it's running,

795
02:02:19,131 --> 02:02:20,860
and how many orders you took
from here.

796
02:02:21,434 --> 02:02:23,994
We didn't touched single client
of this company.

797
02:02:24,437 --> 02:02:27,804
And what facilities of your company
we have used here is the account,

798
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:30,309
and it's payment we are already
going to pay you.

799
02:02:47,126 --> 02:02:47,649
You will give me a cheque,

800
02:02:50,396 --> 02:02:52,557
You are supposed to be
in bad condition.

801
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,137
And others shouldn't follow you,

802
02:03:04,076 --> 02:03:06,340
that's why...

803
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,937
Go and take bath,
It might be wash your sins,

804
02:04:48,514 --> 02:04:49,503
I will see whatever it will take,

805
02:04:50,516 --> 02:04:52,006
You don't need to worry.

806
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:56,178
I have nurtured you many years,

807
02:04:57,089 --> 02:04:58,351
I can nuture more years,

808
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:00,989
what was the need to become thief,

809
02:05:01,527 --> 02:05:03,085
You didn't teach me stealing,

810
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:06,357
If you would have teach me stealing,
then I shouldn't become a thief,

811
02:06:09,094 --> 02:06:10,391
At least they can start their
carrier again,

812
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:26,975
from 04:00 your Rocket Singh Corp
has become mine,

813
02:06:28,113 --> 02:06:29,546
and your all customers are
become mine,

814
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:32,016
Congratulation,

815
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:41,286
Every man have qualities to rise up,

816
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:43,221
and rise down,

817
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:47,957
Before I was requesting you for
the same job,

818
02:06:48,867 --> 02:06:50,835
but today...

819
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:54,898
...you are giving me the
same brand name.

820
02:06:56,575 --> 02:06:57,337
What did you learn?

821
02:07:01,547 --> 02:07:03,276
That man should be stay in his limits.

822
02:07:11,256 --> 02:07:13,554
You don't have those guts.
After all you are a zero.

823
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,529
At least take your full and
final compensation,

824
02:07:38,484 --> 02:07:39,951
Never become a business man,

825
02:07:40,853 --> 02:07:41,547
You will be sold,

826
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:49,286
we didn't get profit to buy it,

827
02:13:50,555 --> 02:13:52,045
In fact our liabilities are increased,

828
02:13:56,928 --> 02:13:58,691
Sir, Rajesh was saying that...

829
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:03,497
...Rocket company is going to get a
huge order from Inamdar,

830
02:14:04,669 --> 02:14:06,068
If we get that order,

831
02:14:07,506 --> 02:14:09,406
then I will handle other accounts,

832
02:14:11,676 --> 02:14:13,303
Look!
You are my own man,

833
02:14:14,012 --> 02:14:15,775
I need this order,

834
02:14:16,548 --> 02:14:18,072
I will take care of rest.

835
02:14:20,619 --> 02:14:23,179
Would you service,
Service is my guarantee.

836
02:14:23,855 --> 02:14:25,152
Since when you know me,

837
02:14:25,624 --> 02:14:28,115
Team is new but company is same,

838
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:32,594
You didn't understand yet,

839
02:14:33,432 --> 02:14:35,366
You have bought
rocket corporation's name...

840
02:14:35,734 --> 02:14:37,861
...but you lose it's men,

841
02:14:40,372 --> 02:14:41,270
You have become fool.

842
02:14:52,617 --> 02:14:53,879
Let's start new relationship.

843
02:15:01,059 --> 02:15:02,959
I am cancelling all future orders,

844
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:05,897
and as well I know all other
rocket clients have...

845
02:15:06,698 --> 02:15:08,791
...either cancelled or
they're going to cancel.

846
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:29,342
Don't mind your business ways
are become history now,

847
02:16:57,142 --> 02:16:57,540
Who you are?

848
02:17:04,282 --> 02:17:05,977
With what you fooled everyone,

849
02:17:11,423 --> 02:17:13,414
What was your limit to sell stuff
in cheap rates.

850
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,520
You lost your life but
never get profit,

851
02:17:19,397 --> 02:17:19,954
your company is sold,

852
02:17:20,632 --> 02:17:21,792
Who won?

853
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,767
Now you are on streets,

854
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:28,472
I am selling computers since 10 years.

855
02:17:29,107 --> 02:17:31,166
Before that fax,

856
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:33,874
and before that electronic typewriter.

857
02:17:36,448 --> 02:17:38,678
I am old business man,

858
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,985
But I made a mistake.

859
02:17:45,991 --> 02:17:48,858
Who I have to keep in company and to
pronounce salesman of the year.

860
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:51,921
I though him out and made him
competetor.

861
02:17:54,332 --> 02:17:55,731
No problem,

862
02:17:56,835 --> 02:17:58,632
I made a mistake,
I had fun,

863
02:17:59,237 --> 02:18:01,171
Now I will correct it.

864
02:18:05,377 --> 02:18:06,344
I am giving you yourjob back.

865
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:11,906
Vice President post is empty.

866
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:28,232
Every man have qualities to rise
up and down,

867
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,336
I chose the way to go down,
but you didn't left any way for me,

868
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:36,933
I didn't know anything,

869
02:18:37,475 --> 02:18:41,036
but to keep doing that I know
there is no scheme in business,

870
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:43,912
there is only one thing,
People!

871
02:18:50,655 --> 02:18:51,485
Did you ever see people.

872
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:53,680
And you just saw numbers.

873
02:18:54,225 --> 02:18:55,522
Who achieved how many numbers.

874
02:18:57,429 --> 02:18:58,657
But I never understand score numbers.

875
02:19:00,065 --> 02:19:00,895
I always seen people.

876
02:19:01,633 --> 02:19:03,624
Who is happy and who is sad?

877
02:19:04,235 --> 02:19:06,203
Who can do what,
and who enjoyed what?

878
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,132
When people become happy numbers
are getting increased by itself.

879
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:23,551
You snatched my company,
I don't care.

880
02:19:24,189 --> 02:19:26,623
It came out from your company,
and it went back to your company,

881
02:19:28,259 --> 02:19:30,352
but what I learned,
you can snatch it.

882
02:19:30,995 --> 02:19:33,156
And with that I can build
ten more companies.

883
02:19:33,765 --> 02:19:35,699
But what will you do?

884
02:19:38,136 --> 02:19:39,569
Everything is become zero
whatever you knew,

885
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:50,374
like you are giving me today...

886
02:19:51,249 --> 02:19:51,908
...I don't need it,

887
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:00,316
I couldn't become like you.

888
02:20:03,027 --> 02:20:04,255
But I have become a man,

889
02:20:21,813 --> 02:20:22,609
I have never seen such a
big zero like him,

890
02:20:32,791 --> 02:20:34,850
He just changed my company,

891
02:20:35,794 --> 02:20:38,092
and when I remove it,
my customers are changed,

892
02:20:40,932 --> 02:20:42,456
Your customers won't be handle
from my people.

893
02:20:43,334 --> 02:20:44,926
And I have mind to understand it.

894
02:20:46,871 --> 02:20:48,463
And such a new comer defeat me,

895
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:51,771
I have a limit to accept it.

896
02:21:00,218 --> 02:21:04,655
Do you have a rupee.

897
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,034
I am giving your company back.

898
02:21:24,242 --> 02:21:25,231
I couldn't handle it.

899
02:21:31,049 --> 02:21:33,882
You won,
I lose.

900
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:42,520
When blood and sweat printed on paper.

901
02:21:43,695 --> 02:21:46,095
Then table become bed,

902
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:48,328
and office become home,

903
02:21:51,836 --> 02:21:52,666
People forget hunger and thirst,

904
02:21:58,276 --> 02:22:00,642
then a company build up.

905
02:22:12,457 --> 02:22:13,924
A man like me you will never found,

906
02:22:15,093 --> 02:22:18,927
I am giving you the biggest lesson
of your life.

907
02:22:20,465 --> 02:22:22,296
And I didn't give anything free
to my own father.

908
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:26,801
What you do?

909
02:22:27,672 --> 02:22:29,196
Either that's business or not,
I don't know,

910
02:22:32,844 --> 02:22:34,573
but never become a businessman.

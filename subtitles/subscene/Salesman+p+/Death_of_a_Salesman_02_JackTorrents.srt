1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,564
but I was with the firm when
your father used to carry you in here.

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,440
- I know.
- Your father came to me

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,069
the day you were born and asked me
what I thought of the name Howard.

4
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:13,115
I appreciate that, Willy,
but there just is no spot here for you.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,286
If I had a spot I would slam you
right in there, but I just don't.

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,290
- All I need is 50 dollars a week.
- Where am I gonna put you, kid?

7
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,958
It's not a question
of whether I can sell, huh?

8
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:27,880
No, but it's a business and
everybody's gotta pull his own weight.

9
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:30,590
- Let me tell you a story.
- Business is business.

10
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:34,677
This is definitely business.
Listen. You don't understand this.

11
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:38,766
When I was a boy, 18, 19,
I was already on the road.

12
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,394
There was a question in my mind
whether selling had a future for me.

13
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,773
In those days
I had a yearning to go to Alaska.

14
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:48,776
There were three gold strikes
in one month in Alaska.

15
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,820
I felt like going out,
just for the ride, you might say.

16
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:55,574
- You don't say?
- My father lived many years in Alaska.

17
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,909
He was an adventurous man.

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,996
We got quite a streak of self-reliance
in our family.

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,333
I thought I'd go out with
my older brother, try to locate him,

20
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,000
maybe settle in the North.

21
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,270
I was almost decided to go...

22
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:13,216
...when I met a salesman
in the Parker House.

23
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,301
His name was Dave Singleman.

24
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:19,765
He was 84 years old and
he'd drummed merchandise in 31 states.

25
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:23,602
Old Dave would go up to his room,
put on his green velvet slippers,

26
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,854
pick up the phone and call the buyers.

27
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:30,526
Without ever leaving his room
at the age of 84,

28
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,836
he made his living.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,741
When I saw that, I realised that selling
was the greatest career a man could want

30
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:42,120
because what could be more satisfying
than to be able to go at the age of 84

31
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,121
into 20 or 30 different cities

32
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:46,666
and pick up a phone
and be remembered and loved

33
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,477
and helped by many different people.

34
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,256
You know, when he died...

35
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,925
And by the way, he died
the death of a salesman,

36
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:59,379
in his green velvet slippers
in the smoker of the New York,

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,014
New Haven and Hartford
going into Boston.

38
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,902
When he died, hundreds of salesmen
and buyers were at his funeral.

39
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:11,525
Things were sad on a lot of trains
for months after that.

40
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,247
You see, in those days there was
personality in it, Howard.

41
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,077
There was respect and comradeship and...

42
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,464
...and gratitude.
Today it's all cut and dry.

43
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:30,460
And there's no chance for bringing
friendship to bear or personality.

44
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:32,503
You see what I mean.

45
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:35,674
- They don't know me anymore.
- That's just the thing, Willy.

46
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,217
If I had 40 dollars a week,
that's all I need.

47
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:40,970
- I can't take blood from a stone.
- Howard!

48
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,932
The year Al Smith was nominated
your father came to me...

49
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:46,852
I'm talking about your father!

50
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,395
There were promises made
across this desk!

51
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:52,582
You mustnt tell me
that you got people to see!

52
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:58,054
I put 34 years into this firm,
Howard! Now I can't pay my insurance!

53
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,823
You can't eat the orange
and throw the peel away!

54
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:03,509
A man is not a piece of fruit!

55
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,514
Pay attention.

56
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,685
No, your father...

57
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,629
Howard...

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,134
In 1928 I had a big year.

59
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,154
I averaged 170 dollars a week.

60
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:26,366
- You never averaged 170 dollars a week.
- No, no, no!

61
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:31,913
I averaged 170 dollars a week
in the year 1928!

62
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,331
And your father came to me, Howard,

63
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:37,252
right across this desk,
put his hand on my shoulder...

64
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:41,222
You have to excuse me, Willy!
I have got to see some people.

65
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:44,867
Pull yourself together.
I'll be back in a little while.

66
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:51,307
Ah, pull myself together!

67
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,451
What did I say to him?

68
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:59,415
Oh, my god.

69
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,835
I was yelling at him.

70
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:08,658
Frank, Frank, don't you remember
what you told me that time?

71
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:10,784
You put your hand on my shoulder...

72
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,704
The capital of Delaware...

73
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:16,807
Oh, Howard!

74
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,293
Howard!

75
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:22,255
Howard, Howard, shut it off!

76
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,089
Shut it off!

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,052
- Look, Willy...
- I gotta get myself some coffee.

78
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,303
- I'll get coffee.
- Willy, look...

79
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:34,017
Look, Willy,
you can't go to Boston for us.

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,397
- Why can't I go?
- I don't want you to represent us.

81
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:45,169
I've been meaning to tell you
for a long time now.

82
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:51,534
- Howard, are you firing me?
- I think you need a good long rest.

83
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:55,747
When you feel better come back
and we'll try to work something out.

84
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,498
I gotta earn money, Howard.

85
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:00,502
Where are your sons?
Wort your sons give you a hand?

86
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,295
Oh, they're working on a very big deal.

87
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,089
This is no time for false pride.

88
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,549
Go to your sons
and tell them you're tired.

89
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,510
You got two great boys there.

90
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,804
- No question.
- That's that, huh?

91
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,806
In the meantime. All right.

92
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:16,600
I'll go to...
I'll go to Boston tomorrow.

93
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,435
No!

94
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,454
No.

95
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,566
I can't throw myself on my kids.
I'm not a freeloader.

96
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,319
- Kid, I am busy this morning.
- Let me go to Boston.

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,673
I have got a line
of people to see this morning.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,290
- Sit down. Sit.
- What?

99
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,226
Oh.

100
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:52,720
Take five minutes
and pull yourself together.

101
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:56,433
And then go home, will you?

102
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,784
I need the office.

103
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,690
Whenever you can this week,
drop off the samples.

104
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:08,570
You'll feel better, Willy,
and then come back. We'll talk.

105
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:14,659
Pull yourself together, kid.
There's people outside.

106
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,967
Oh, Ben!

107
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,821
How did you do it, huh?

108
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,099
What's the answer?

109
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,643
Did you wind up the Alaska deal already?

110
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:46,024
Doesrt take much time if you know what
you're doing. I wanted to say good-bye.

111
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,483
- I gotta talk to you.
- I haven't the time.

112
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:51,028
Nothing's working out.
I don't know what to do.

113
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,991
I bought timberland in Alaska. I need
a man to look after things for me.

114
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:56,658
God, timberland!

115
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,161
Me and my boys and those grand outdoors!

116
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,038
A new continent on your doorstep.

117
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,210
Get out of these cities. They're full of
talk, time payments and courts of law.

118
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,630
- You can fight for a fortune up there.
- Linda! Linda!

119
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,589
- Linda.
- You're back.

120
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,215
- I haven't much time.
- Wait.

121
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:14,426
He's got a proposition for me in Alaska.

122
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,513
- But you've got a job here.
- But in Alaska, kid, I could...

123
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:20,516
- You are doing well enough.
- Enough for what, dear?

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,646
Don't say things like that to him.
Enough to be happy right here, now.

125
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,858
Why must everyone conquer the world?
You're well-liked, the boys love you.

126
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,570
The other day old man Wagner told him
he'll be a member of the firm.

127
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:36,032
- Didn't he, Willy?
- I'm building something with this firm.

128
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,993
If a man is building
he must be on the right track.

129
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:43,331
- What are you building? Where is it?
- That's true, Linda, there's nothing.

130
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:46,501
Why, there's a man 84 years old, Willy.

131
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,543
That's right, Ben, that's right!

132
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:51,547
When I look at that man
I say what's there to worry about?

133
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,842
All he has to do is go into any city,
pick up a phone

134
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,969
and he's making his living. Know why?

135
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,137
- I gotta go.
- Oh, look at this boy.

136
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:03,101
Without a penny to his name, three
great universities are begging for him.

137
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:07,838
From there the sky's the limit! It's
not what you do, Ben, it's who you know!

138
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,234
And a smile on your face.
It's contacts, Ben, contacts!

139
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:15,655
The whole wealth of Alaska passing over
the lunch table of the Commodore Hotel.

140
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,615
And that's the wonder,
the wonder of this country,

141
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:23,037
that a man can end with diamonds
on the basis of being liked.

142
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:26,332
That's why, when you get
on that field today, it's important,

143
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,002
'cause thousands of people
will be rooting for you, loving you.

144
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:34,173
When he walks into a business office,
his name will sound out like a bell,

145
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:37,134
and all the doors will open to him.
I seen it, Ben.

146
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:41,180
I seen it a thousand times. You can't
feel it in your hands, but it's there.

147
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:43,515
- Good-bye.
- Don't you think I'm right?

148
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:47,144
- I value your advice.
- A new continent at your doorstep.

149
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:50,171
You could walk out rich.

150
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,173
Rich!

151
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:56,053
We're gonna do a hit, Ben, you hear me?
We're gonna do a hit!

152
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,137
Gee, I was afraid you left already.

153
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,973
- What time is it?
- Ten past one.

154
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:03,269
Oh, come on everybody,
Ebbets Field, next stop.

155
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,397
- Where's the pennants?
- Did you pack fresh underwear?

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,732
- I want to go. - I'm
carrying your helmet. - I am.

157
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,610
You promised me.
How am I gonna get in the locker room?

158
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,529
Let him carry the shoulder guards.

159
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,491
Can I? I told everybody
I was gonna be in the locker room.

160
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:20,369
- It's the Clubhouse.
- I meant the Clubhouse.

161
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,124
- Let him carry the shoulder guards.
- Stay close to us.

162
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:29,177
- Wave when Biff comes out on the
field! You set, boy? - Ready to go, Pop.

163
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:32,213
- Every muscle is ready.
- You realise what this means.

164
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:34,173
You're coming home this afternoon

165
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,010
captain of the All-Scholastic
Championship Team

166
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:40,681
- of the city of New York.
- That's right, Pop, and remember,

167
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:43,976
when I take off my helmet,
that touchdowrs for you.

168
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:51,734
Let's go over.
I got no room for you, Charley.

169
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,484
- Room for what?
- In the car.

170
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:56,070
Going for a ride?
I want to shoot some casino.

171
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,114
Don't you realise what today is?

172
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,660
Oh, he knows, Willy.
He's just kidding you.

173
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:05,772
That's nothing to kid about. I'm
not kidding, Linda. What's going on?

174
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,374
He is playing at Ebbets Field today.

175
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,920
- Baseball in this weather?
- Don't talk to him. We're late.

176
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,963
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What?

177
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:17,051
Don't you listen to the radio?
Ebbets Field just blew up.

178
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,260
You go to hell! Everybody in?

179
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,179
Knock a homer, Biff.
Knock a homer!

180
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,431
I don't think that was funny, Charley.

181
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:26,685
Did you hear me, huh?
This is the greatest day in his life.

182
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,227
When are you gonna grow up?

183
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,813
When this game is over
you won't be laughing anymore.

184
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:33,734
They'll be calling him
another Red Grange, 25,000 a year.

185
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,193
- That so?
- Yeah!

186
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:37,570
- Wait a minute, Willy. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

187
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,741
But tell me something.
Who is Red Grange?

188
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,451
Put up your hands.
Put up your hands, come on.

189
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:46,997
Put up your hands. Who do you think
you are, better than everybody?

190
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,958
Put up your hands! Put up your hands!

191
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,878
Put up your hands.
Who the hell do you think you are?

192
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:56,799
You don't know everything,
you big ignorant stupid...

193
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:59,760
Put up your hands.
What are you walking away for?

194
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:03,514
Don't walk away. You gonna say
something to me, say it to my face.

195
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,881
I know you laugh at me behind my back.

196
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:09,303
You'll be laughing out of the other
side of your face after this game.

197
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:12,347
The woods are burning.
Touchdown! Touchdown!

198
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:16,685
Eighty thousand people!
Right between the goal posts.

199
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,938
Touchdown! Touchdown!

200
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,191
Hello, baby! Touchdown!

201
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,526
Touchdown! Ah, Jenny.

202
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,713
Jenny, good to see you.
How are you?

203
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:32,200
- Working? Or still honest?
- Fine.

204
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:35,162
- How you been feeling?
- Not much any more.

205
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,640
- Oh!
- Hello, Uncle Willy.

206
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,353
Bernard.

207
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,547
- Look who's here.
- How are you?

208
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,509
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by to see Pop.

209
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:53,096
To get off my feet till my train leaves.
I'm going to Washington.

210
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,556
- Is he in?
- He's with the accountant.

211
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:59,193
Sit down. What are you
gonna do in Washington?

212
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:03,614
- Just a case I've got there.
- That so? You gonna play tennis there?

213
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:06,275
I'm staying with a friend
who's got a court.

214
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:09,153
You don't say.
Their own tennis court?

215
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:11,990
- Those are fine people, I bet.
- They're very nice.

216
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,158
- Dad tells me Biff's in town.
- Yeah.

217
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,579
Biff's in. He's working
on a very big deal, Bernard.

218
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:21,857
- What's Biff doing? - He's been
doing very big things in the West,

219
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,668
but he decided
to establish himself here.

220
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,605
Very big. We're having dinner.

221
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,834
Did I hear your wife had a boy?

222
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,545
That's right. Our second.

223
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,689
Two boys.

224
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,260
- What do you know?
- You still with the old firm, Willy?

225
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:46,725
I'm overjoyed to see how
you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed.

226
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,143
It's an encouraging thing to see.

227
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:54,533
A young man really... really...

228
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:59,103
Ah, it looks very good for Biff.
Very good.

229
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,033
- Bernard. - What is it, Willy?
- What... What's the secret?

230
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,260
- What secret?
- How did you...?

231
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,347
- Why didn't he ever catch on?
- Willy, I wouldn't know that.

232
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,182
Oh, you were his friend,
his boyhood friend.

233
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,268
It's something I don't understand.

234
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,895
His life ended
after that Ebbets Field game.

235
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,773
From the age of 17
nothing good ever happened to him.

236
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:32,279
- He never trained himself for anything.
- He took correspondence courses.

237
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,074
Radio mechanics, television...
He never made the slightest mark.

238
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,659
- Do you want to talk candidly?
- Bernard.

239
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,873
I regard you as a very brilliant man.
Bernard, I value your advice.

240
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,541
The hell with advice.
I couldn't advise you.

241
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,335
There's one thing
I have always wanted to ask you.

242
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:51,673
When he was supposed to graduate
and the teacher flunked him...

243
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,173
Ruined his life.

244
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:56,428
All he had to do was go
to summer school, make up that subject.

245
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:59,681
- That's right. That's right!
- Did you tell him not to go?

246
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:02,600
Me? I begged him to go.
I ordered him to go.

247
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:05,227
- Why wouldn't he go?
- Why? Why, Bernard!

248
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:08,481
That questiors been trailing me
like a ghost for 15 years.

249
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:13,253
He flunked the subject and he laid down
and died like a hammer hit him.

250
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,330
Let me talk to you, Bernard.
I got nobody to talk to.

251
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:20,610
It wasn't my fault. It keeps going
around in my head, maybe I did something.

252
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,253
I got nothing to give him.

253
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,671
Don't take it so hard.

254
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:26,149
Why did he lay down?

255
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,552
- What is the story there?
- Willy...

256
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,554
You're his friend. Come on.

257
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:35,642
Willy, I remember it was June.
Our grades came out. He'd flunked math.

258
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:38,102
That son of a bitch ruined his life.

259
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:42,190
Then Biff just got very angry and
he was ready to enrol in summer school.

260
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:44,650
- He was?
- He wasn't beaten by it at all.

261
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,486
But then, Willy, see...

262
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,113
What?

263
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:51,907
He disappeared from the block
for almost a month.

264
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:55,328
I got the idea that he'd gone
up to New England to see you.

265
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,415
Did he ever talk with you then?

266
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,208
- Willy?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,686
Yeah.

268
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,131
He came to Boston.
What about it?

269
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,677
Well, it's just
that when he came back...

270
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,598
I'll never forget this.

271
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,977
It always mystifies me
because I thought so well of Biff.

272
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,621
I loved him, Willy, you know.

273
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,732
He came back after that month
and took his sneakers.

274
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:29,279
Remember those sneakers with the
University of Virginia on them?

275
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,590
He was so proud of them.
Wore them every day.

276
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:36,661
He took them down into the cellar,
burned them up in the furnace.

277
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:39,263
We had a fistfight.

278
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:42,333
It lasted at least half an hour,
just the two of us,

279
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:46,504
punching each other down in the cellar,
crying right through it.

280
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:50,300
I often thought how strange it was
that I knew he'd given up his life.

281
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:57,365
What happened in Boston, Willy?

282
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,186
I just bring it up because you asked me.

283
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,354
What's that got to do with it?

284
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:06,858
- Don't get sore.
- What are you trying to do, blame me?

285
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:09,568
If a boy lays down is that my fault?

286
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,697
- Don't take it...
- Don't you talk to me that way.

287
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:15,199
What does that mean,
huh, what happened?

288
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,361
Hey!

289
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,143
- You're gonna miss that train.
- Yeah, I'm going.

290
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,108
Good-bye, Willy.

291
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:37,864
- Don't worry about it. If at first you
don't succeed... - Yes, I believe in that.

292
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:41,242
Sometimes, Willy, it's better for a man
just to walk away.

293
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,744
- Walk away?
- That's right.

294
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,555
What if you can't walk away?

295
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:50,400
I guess that's when it's tough.

296
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,479
Good-bye, Willy.

297
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,259
Good-bye, boy.

298
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,097
How do you like this kid?
Gonna argue a case in the Supreme Court.

299
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,033
- Pop!
- No.

300
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,977
- The Supreme Court?
- I gotta run.

301
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,747
- Bye, Dad.
- Knock 'em dead, Bernard.

302
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,529
The Supreme Court.

303
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,572
And he didn't even mention it?

304
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,634
He don't have to.
He's gonna do it.

305
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:28,456
And you never told him what to do.
You never took any interest in him.

306
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,751
My salvation is that I never
took any interest in anything.

307
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:36,781
Here's some money, 50 dollars.
I got an accountant inside.

308
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,109
Uh, Charley, look, uh...

309
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:45,265
I got my insurance to pay.
If you could manage it, I...

310
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,643
I need 110 dollars.

311
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,730
- I'd draw from my bank, but...
- Sit down, Willy.

312
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,357
I'm keeping an account of everything.

313
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,943
- Listen to me.
- I'll pay every penny back.

314
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,781
- I want you to know I appreciate...
- What's going on inside your head?

315
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,491
- Why? I'm simply...
- I offered you a job.

316
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,870
You can make 50 dollars a week
and I won't send you on the road.

317
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,306
- I got a job.
- Without pay?

318
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,310
What kind of a job is a job without pay?

319
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,339
Now, look, kid. Enough is enough.

320
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,176
I'm no genius, but I know
when I'm being insulted.

321
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,803
- Insulted?
- Why don't you want to work for me?

322
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,014
What does it matter with you?
I got a job.

323
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:30,242
What do you walk in here every week for?

324
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,693
Well, if... if you don't
want me to walk in here...

325
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,946
- I am offering you a job.
- I don't want your job.

326
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,115
When the hell are you gonna grow up?

327
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:49,161
You big ignoramus! If you say
that to me again I'll rap you one.

328
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,440
I don't care how big...
...how big you are.

329
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:06,846
- How much do you need, Willy?
- Ah, Charley, I'm strapped.

330
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,883
I'm strapped. I don't know
what to do. I was just fired.

331
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,912
- Howard fired you?
- That's not no...

332
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:20,642
Imagine that. I named him Howard.
I named him! I named him Howard!

333
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:24,947
Willy, when are you gonna realise
that them things don't mean anything?

334
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,092
You named him Howard
but you can't sell that.

335
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,245
The only thing you got in this
world is what you can sell.

336
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,124
The funny thing is, you're a salesman
and you don't know that.

337
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,711
I always try to think otherwise,
I guess. I always felt...

338
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:44,008
...if a man was impressive
and well-liked then nothing...

339
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:46,969
Why must everybody like you?
Who liked JP Morgan?

340
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,515
Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath
he looked like a butcher.

341
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:54,894
With his pockets on
he was very well-liked.

342
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:05,112
Now, listen, Willy,
I know you don't like me.

343
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:08,366
And nobody can say I'm in love with you.

344
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,538
But I'll give you a job
just for the hell of it.

345
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:18,743
- What do you say?
- No. No, I just...

346
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,503
No, I just can't work for you, Charley.

347
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:23,505
- What are you, jealous of me?
- No!

348
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,258
I can't work for you, that's all.
Don't ask me why.

349
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,903
You've been jealous of me
all your life, you damn fool.

350
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,241
Here.

351
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,688
- Pay your insurance.
- I'm keeping strict accounts.

352
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:43,742
I got some work to do. Take care
of yourself. And pay your insurance!

353
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:55,296
It's funny, after all the highways
and the trains and the appointments

354
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,773
and the years...

355
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,903
...you end up worth
more dead than alive.

356
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,268
Willy, nobody's worth nothing dead.

357
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,750
You hear what I said?

358
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,963
Willy!

359
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,852
Oh, apologise to Bernard for me
when you see him.

360
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,912
I didn't mean to argue with him.
He's a fine boy.

361
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:34,794
They're all fine boys. And they'll
end up big, all of them someday.

362
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,879
They'll all play tennis together.

363
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,967
Wish me luck, Charley.
He saw Bill Oliver today.

364
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,870
Good luck.

365
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,506
Oh, Charley,
you're the only friend I got.

366
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:58,066
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

367
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,585
Jesus.

368
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:16,459
In the front
you're in the middle of noise.

369
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,156
Whenever you've got a party, Mr. Loman,
tell me, I'll put you back here.

370
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,300
You look French.
How's it coming, Stanley?

371
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:27,597
It's a dog's life. I only wish that
during the war they took me in the Army.

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,641
- I could have been dead.
- You got lobsters?

373
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:34,986
- A hundred percent big. - With the claws.
- Don't worry, I don't give you no mice.

374
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,731
How about some wine?
Put a hat on the meal.

375
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,444
No, the recipe I brought you from
overseas with the champagne in it

376
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:45,239
I still got that in the kitchen,
but it'll cost you a buck a piece.

377
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,699
- That's all right.
- You hit a number?

378
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,201
My brother, I think
he pulled off a deal today.

379
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,998
- I think we're going into business.
- That's the best, family business.

380
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,333
- That's the best.
- That's what I think.

381
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,712
What's the difference?
Somebody steals, it's in the family.

382
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,648
Shh. Strudel.

383
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,303
- Ma'am?
- I'm expecting someone.

384
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,018
Oh, look at that mouth. Oh, God,
and the binoculars. Wait on her.

385
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,979
- Would you like a menu?
- I'd like a...

386
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,273
Why don't you bring her...
Do you mind?

387
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:24,111
I sell champagne and I'd like her
to try my brand. Bring her a champagne.

388
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,406
- That's awfully nice of you.
- It's all company money.

389
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,325
That's a charming product
to be selling, isn't it?

390
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,827
Like everything else,
selling is selling.

391
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,715
- I suppose? - You don't happen
to sell? - No, I don't sell.

392
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,294
Would you object to a compliment?
You ought to be on a magazine cover.

393
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:44,990
- I have been. -W hat did I say before?
See, Stanley, she's a cover girl.

394
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,884
- Oh, I could see, I could see.
- What magazine?

395
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,844
A lot of them.
Thank you.

396
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,930
You know what they say in France?

397
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,265
Champagne is the drink
of the complexion.

398
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,269
- Hiya, Biffo.
- Sorry I'm late.

399
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,630
- No. No, no, I just got here.
Miss, um...? - Forsythe.

400
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,483
Miss Forsythe, this is my brother.

401
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:05,844
Is Dad here?

402
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,290
You might have heard of him.
He's a great football player.

403
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:13,335
- Really? What team?
- You're familiar with football?

404
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,296
- I'm afraid I'm not.
- Biff's with the New York Giants.

405
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,673
- Well, it is nice, isn't it?
- Good health.

406
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,633
- Happy to meet you.
- That's my name.

407
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,386
It's Harold, but at West Point
they called me Happy.

408
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:24,971
I see. How do you do?

409
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:27,615
- Isn't Dad coming?
- You want her?

410
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,812
- What? - You want her?
- I could never make that.

411
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:36,442
I remember the time that idea
would never come into your head.

412
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:40,245
- I just saw... - Wait, please. I've
got to see the old confidence.

413
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,824
If you want her she's on call.
I'm telling you, watch this.

414
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,062
Honey, are you busy?

415
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:50,897
Well, I am
but I could make a phone call.

416
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,234
Go and do that, will you, honey,
and see if you can get a friend.

417
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,113
We'll be here for awhile. Biff,
one of the greatest football players.

418
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:01,075
- I'm certainly happy to meet you.
- Come back soon.

419
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:05,579
- I'll try.
- Don't try, honey. Try hard.

420
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:10,876
Isn't that a shame?
Beautiful girl like that.

421
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,795
- That's why I can't get married.
- Hap, look...

422
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,880
- I told you she's on call.
- Cut it out.

423
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,257
I want to say something.

424
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:20,635
- Did you see Oliver?
- I saw him, all right.

425
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:23,555
I want to tell Dad a couple of things.
I want you to help.

426
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,767
- Is he gonna back you?
- Are you crazy?

427
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,268
You're out of your head,
do you know that?

428
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,645
Why, what happened?

429
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,106
I did a terrible thing today, Hap.

430
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:36,652
It's been the strangest day
I ever went through.

431
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,320
- I'm a little numb.
- What, he wouldn't see you?

432
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:43,374
I waited six hours for him, see.
All day I kept sending my name in.

433
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,329
Even tried to date his secretary
so she got me through. Not so.

434
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:50,791
You're not showing the confidence.
But he remembered you?

435
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:55,504
Finally at 5:00 he comes out,
didn't remember who I was or anything.

436
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,339
Biff, did you tell him my Florida idea?

437
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,050
Hap, he walked away.

438
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:04,930
I saw him and for one minute I got
so mad I could have torn the walls down.

439
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:08,851
How the hell did I ever get the idea
that I was a salesman there?

440
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,727
I believed myself
that I'd been a salesman for him.

441
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:16,441
Then he gave me one look and I realised
what a ridiculous lie my life's been.

442
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:19,836
We have been talking in a dream
for 15 years.

443
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:23,164
- I was a shipping clerk.
- What did you do?

444
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:26,493
Well, he... he left, see.

445
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:30,372
His secretary went out
and I was alone in the waiting room.

446
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,210
And next thing I know,
I was in his office.

447
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:39,089
Panel walls and everything.

448
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:43,677
I can't explain it, Hap.
I took his fountain pen.

449
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,845
Geez. Did he catch you?

450
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:50,058
I ran out. I ran down all 11 flights.
I ran and ran and ran.

451
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,852
Boy, that was dumb, Biff.
Why did you do that?

452
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:54,645
I don't know.

453
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,499
I just wanted to take something.

454
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,862
You gotta help me, Hap.
I want to tell Pop.

455
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:04,923
Are you crazy? What for?

456
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:12,122
He's gotta understand I'm not the man
somebody lends that kind of money to.

457
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,957
He thinks I've been spiting him
all these years.

458
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,170
Tell him something nice.
Say you got a date with Oliver tomorrow.

459
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:21,340
- What do I do tomorrow?
- Dad is never so happy

460
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:24,526
as when he's
looking forward to something.

461
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,721
Gee, I haven't been here in years!

462
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:31,600
- Sit down. You want a drink?
- Sure, I don't mind.

463
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,768
- You look worried.
- No.

464
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:36,103
Uh, Scotch all around.
Make it doubles.

465
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:39,566
You had a couple already, didn't you?
Did everything go all right?

466
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,903
- I had an experience today, Pop.
- That so? What happened?

467
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:45,738
I wanted to tell you everything
from first to last.

468
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,616
It's been a strange day.
I had to wait quite a while.

469
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,076
- Oliver?
- Yeah, Oliver.

470
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:52,119
All day, as a matter of cold fact.

471
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,167
And a lot of instances, Pop,
facts about my life came back to me.

472
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,712
Who was it, Pop, whoever said
I was a salesman with Oliver?

473
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:03,715
- Well, you were.
- No, I was a shipping clerk, Dad.

474
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,968
I don't know who said it first
but I was never a salesman for Oliver.

475
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,887
- What are you talking about?
- Hold onto the facts.

476
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,223
I was a shipping clerk.

477
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,266
- Listen to me...
- Dad, let me finish.

478
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,894
I'm not interested in stories
about the past.

479
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,687
The woods are burning, boys.

480
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:21,399
There's a big blaze going on all around.

481
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,983
I was fired today.

482
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:24,735
How could you be?

483
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:28,949
And I'm looking for a little good news
to tell your mother

484
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,409
- because the woman has suffered.
- Dad!

485
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,247
I haven't got a story left in my head
so don't give me a lecture about facts.

486
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:38,458
I am not interested.
Now, what have you got to say to me?

487
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,811
Did you see Oliver, huh?

488
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:44,588
- Geez, Dad.
- You didn't go up there?

489
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,801
- Sure, he went up there.
- I saw him. How could they fire you?

490
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:51,513
- What kind of welcome did he give you?
- He won't let you work on commission?

491
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,306
- I'm out! He gave you a warm welcome?
- Sure, Pop.

492
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,936
I was wondering if he'd remember you.
A man doesn't see him in ten years,

493
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,855
he gives him a welcome.
You know why he remembered?

494
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:05,110
- You impressed him in those days.
- Dad, can we talk and get this down?

495
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:09,072
What happened? Did he take you in
his office or talk in the waiting room?

496
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:11,866
- He came in...
- I bet he threw his arms around you.

497
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:15,036
- He's a fine man, a hard man to see.
- Oh, I know that.

498
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,413
- Is that where you had the drinks?
- Yeah.

499
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:20,040
- He told him my Florida idea.
- Don't interrupt.

500
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,295
- How'd he react to the Florida idea?
- Give me a minute to explain.

501
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:27,424
I've been waiting for you to explain
since I sat down here. What happened?

502
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:30,802
- I talked, he listened to me.
- Oh, the way he listens.

503
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:33,304
- What was his answer?
- An... Answer...

504
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,224
You're not letting me tell you
what I want to tell you.

505
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,933
- You didn't see him.
- I did.

506
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:41,188
- You insult him or something?
- Dad! Will you let me out of it?

507
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,898
- Will you just let me out of it?
- What happened?

508
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:45,774
- I can't talk to him.
- Tell him.

509
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:49,362
- Shut up and leave me alone.
- No, no. You had to go and flunk math.

510
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,574
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- Math, math, math.

511
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,119
- Take it easy, Pop.
- If you hadrt of flunked you'd be set.

512
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:59,289
I'm gonna tell you what happened
and you're gonna listen to me.

513
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:03,376
I waited six hours and I kept sending
my name in but he wouldn't see me.

514
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,379
- Finally he came.
- Biff flunked mathl

515
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:09,131
- They won't graduate him.
- Where is he?

516
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:11,216
He ran off.
He went to Grand Central.

517
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,968
Is Uncle Willy in Boston?

518
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:16,473
See, so I'm washed up with Oliver,
Pop, do you understand that?

519
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:19,433
- Are you listening?
- If you hadrt have flunked...

520
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:23,229
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- I didn't flunk math. What pen?

521
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:26,148
- That was dumb, Biff.
- You took Oliver's pen.

522
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:29,444
- I just explained it.
- You stole Bill Oliver's fountain pen.

523
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,404
I didn't exactly steal it.
I was trying to tell you.

524
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:35,408
He had it in his hand,
Oliver walked in, he got nervous.

525
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:38,243
- My god, Biff.
- I never intended to do it...

526
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:41,706
- I'm not in my room. I'm not there.
- Ringing Mr Loman.

527
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,041
- Now, stop it.
- Mr Loman does not answer.

528
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,960
- I'm not there.
- Shall I page him?

529
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,754
- You're no good, no good for anything.
- I am, Dad.

530
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:51,340
I'll find something.
Don't worry about anything.

531
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,133
- Talk to me.
- Paging Mr Loman.

532
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:55,719
- No! No!
- He'll strike something, Pop, please.

533
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,347
- No!
- Dad, I'm telling you something good.

534
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:01,893
Oliver talked to his partner
about the Florida idea.

535
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,977
- You listening, Dad? Dad?
- Yeah.

536
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:08,233
He talked to his partner and he came
to me and I'm gonna be all right, Pop.

537
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:10,567
He said it's just a question
of the amount.

538
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,197
- Then you... Then you got it?
- It's gonna be terrific, Pop.

539
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,740
Aw, then you got it, haven't you?

540
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,661
- You got it, haven't you? You got it!
- No.

541
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,329
I'm supposed to have lunch
with him tomorrow.

542
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,291
I'm telling you so you'll know
I can make an impression.

543
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,753
I'll make good somewheres,
but I can't go tomorrow.

544
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,963
- Why not? You simply...
- The pen, Pop.

545
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:33,716
You give him the pen,
tell him it was an oversight.

546
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,259
- You have lunch.
- I can't.

547
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,011
You were doing a crossword puzzle,
you used his pen.

548
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:41,933
No, listen, kid,
I took those balls years ago, Pop,

549
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:45,061
and now I walk in with this fountain pen
that clinches it.

550
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:48,273
Don't you understand? I can't face him.
I'll try elsewhere.

551
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:51,276
- Don't you want to be anything?
- How can I go back?

552
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,693
Pop!

553
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:55,404
You don't want to be anything,
that what's behind it?

554
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:59,033
Don't take it that way! You think
it was easy walking into that office?

555
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,162
A team of horses couldn't
have dragged me to Oliver.

556
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:05,122
- Then why did you go?
- Why did I go?

557
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,960
Why did I go? Dad, look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

558
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:12,922
- You're gonna go to that lunch.
- I can't. I've got no appointment.

559
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:15,424
- Are you spiting me?
- Don't take it that way!

560
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:18,303
You rotten little louse.
Are you spiting me?

561
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:21,848
Dad. I'm no good.
Can't you see what I am?

562
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:25,018
You're in a restaurant.
Cut it out, both of you!

563
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:28,313
- Someone's at the door.
- Hello, girls. Sit down.

564
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,606
Yes, we might as well.
This is Letta.

565
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,443
- What do you drink?
- Letta might not be able to stay.

566
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:37,696
I gotta get up very early
tomorrow. I've got jury duty.

567
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:40,783
I'm so excited.
Were you fellas ever on a jury?

568
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:44,261
No, I've been in front of a jury.

569
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,892
- This is my father.
- Isn't he cute. Sit down with us, Pops.

570
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,227
- Biff, sit him down.
- Come on, sit down.

571
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:55,690
- Drink us under the table.
- Willy, are you coming?

572
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,191
Willy, I'm waiting.

573
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:00,402
- Where are you going?
- To open the door.

574
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:03,155
- What door?
- The washroom. Where is the door?

575
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:06,091
Just go straight down.

576
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,204
Will you stop laughing. Stop. Shh.

577
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,956
Will you stop!

578
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,059
Shh!

579
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:17,002
Will you stop!

580
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:19,588
I think it's sweet you bring your daddy.

581
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,715
Oh, he isn't really your father.

582
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,844
Miss Forsythe, you've just seen
a prince walk by.

583
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:29,122
A fine troubled prince. A
hard-working, unappreciated prince.

584
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,725
A pal, do you understand,
a good companion.

585
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,578
Always for his boys.

586
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:39,692
- That's so sweet.
- Girls, we're wasting time here.

587
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:42,360
What's the programme?
Biff, gather round now.

588
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,154
Where would you like to go?

589
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,799
- You do something for me?
- Me?

590
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,703
- Don't you give a damn for him?
- What are you talking about?

591
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:53,538
- I'm the one...
- You don't give a damn about him.

592
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,642
Look what I found in the cellar, Hap.

593
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,338
- How can you bear to let that go on?
- Me? Who goes off? Who runs away?

594
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,758
He doesn't mean anything to you.
You could help him, I can't.

595
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,762
Don't you understand what he's gonna do?
He's gonna kill himself.

596
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,097
- Don't you know that?
- Don't yell at me.

597
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,182
Hap, help him.

598
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,478
Help him!
Help me.

599
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,646
Help me!

600
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,874
I can't bear to look in his face.

601
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,528
Biff...

602
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,280
- Biff, where you going?
- What's he so mad about?

603
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,032
We're gonna catch up with him.

604
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,868
- I don't like that temper of his.
- He's overstrung.

605
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,164
- Do you want to tell your father?
- That's not my father, just a guy.

606
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:39,460
Come on, we're gonna catch up with Biff
and honey, we'll paint this town.

607
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:43,005
I love those bedroom eyes.

608
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:48,553
- That's how I knew you were friends.
- Mr Loman! Mr Loman! Mr Loman!

609
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:51,639
Hey! Mr Loman!

610
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,932
- Willyl
- What?

611
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,142
Oh.

612
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:58,019
No.

613
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,774
Willy, aren't you gonna answer the door?

614
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:03,917
Willy...

615
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,696
Willyl

616
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,799
- Arert you gonna answer the door?
- Sure.

617
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,538
Oh.

618
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:20,868
Someone's at the door, Willy.
Are you gonna answer the door?

619
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,171
He's gonna wake up the whole hotell

620
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:28,108
I'm not expecting anybody.

621
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,429
Why don't you have another drink, honey?

622
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,807
- Stop being so damn self-centred.
- I'm so Ionely.

623
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,552
You know you ruined me, Willy. From
now on, when you come to the office,

624
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:41,229
I'll see you
go right through the buyers.

625
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,065
No waiting at my desk anymore.
Willy, you ruined me.

626
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,359
Oh, that's nice of you to say that.

627
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,737
Oh, gee, you're self-centred.

628
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:50,780
Why so sad?

629
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,327
You're the saddest, self-centredest soul
I ever did see-saw.

630
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,455
Oh, boy, huh? What?

631
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,477
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

632
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:08,106
Oh, to be dressing
in the middle of the night.

633
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,678
Arert you gonna answer the door?

634
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,599
They're knocking on the wrong door.

635
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:19,267
But they're knocking
and hear us talking.

636
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,770
- Maybe the hotel's on fire.
- It's a mistake.

637
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:24,397
- Tell them to go away.
- There's nobody there.

638
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:26,274
Willy!

639
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:30,821
There's somebody standing out there
and it's getting on my nerves.

640
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:34,075
All right. Stay in the bathroom
and don't come out.

641
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,411
There's a law in Massachusetts,
so don't come out.

642
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,499
It may be the new room clerk.
He looked mean. It's a mistake.

643
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:44,668
There's no fire.

644
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:48,297
- Dad. Why didn't you answer?
- Biff.

645
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,300
- What are you doing in Boston?
- Why didn't you answer?

646
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:54,177
I was knocking for five minutes.
I called you.

647
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,306
I just heard you. I was in the bathroom
and had the door shut.

648
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,849
Did anything happen at home, huh?

649
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,435
- Dad, I let you down.
- Excuse me?

650
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:05,606
Biffo, what's this about?
Come on, let's go get you a malt.

651
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:08,567
Dad, I...

652
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:13,179
- I flunked math. - Not for the term? -
I haven't got enough credits to graduate.

653
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,284
- Bernard wouldn't give you the answers?
- He did. He tried. I only got a 61.

654
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:21,038
They wouldn't give you four points?
Birnbaum refused absolutely.

655
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,999
I begged him to give me those points
but he won't listen.

656
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,044
You gotta talk to him.
Dad, before they close the school.

657
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,923
'Cause if he saw the kind of man you are
and you talked to him in your way,

658
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,633
I'm sure he'd come through for me, Pop.

659
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:37,179
The class came right before practice,
so I didn't go enough.

660
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:40,474
Would you talk to him?
He'd like you, the way you can talk.

661
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,309
- I'm gonna drive right back.
- Dad, good work.

662
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,397
- I'm sure he'll change it.
- Tell the clerk I'm checking out.

663
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,232
Go right down.

664
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,486
The reason he hates me
is one day he was late for class,

665
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,196
so I got up at the blackboard
and imitated him.

666
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:57,907
- Crossed my eyes, talked with a lisp.
- You did?

667
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,993
- Yeah.
- The kids like it?

668
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:03,163
- They nearly died laughing.
- Yeah, what did you do?

669
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,793
The square root of 63 is...

670
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:09,711
In the middle of it he walks in.

671
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:13,215
He walked in! All right.

672
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,969
- Is somebody in there?
- That was next door.

673
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,974
- Somebody got in your bathroom.
- In the next room there's a party.

674
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:24,809
Can I come in?

675
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,230
There's something in the bathtub, Willy,
and it's moving.

676
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:53,172
Uh, you better go back to your room now.

677
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:56,884
They must be finished painting by now.

678
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,262
See, they're painting her room,
so I let her shower here.

679
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:02,597
- Go back.
- I gotta get dressed, Willy.

680
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:06,185
You get out of here.
This is Miss Francis. She's a buyer.

681
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:09,062
She lives down the hall
and they're painting her...

682
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,356
- Go back, go back!
- My clothes, Willy!

683
00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,858
- I can't go naked.
- Will you get out of here.

684
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,737
Where's my stockings?
You promised me stockings.

685
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,199
- I have no stockings.
- You had 2 boxes of sheers. I want 'em.

686
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,158
Yeah, here, here, here.

687
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,552
Here.

688
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,413
For God's sake, now get out of here.

689
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:31,001
I just hope there's nobody in the hall,
that's all I hope.

690
00:39:35,714 --> 00:39:38,358
You, uh, football or baseball?

691
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:41,177
Football.

692
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,655
That's me, too.

693
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:46,491
Good night.

694
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:54,774
Well, better get going.

695
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,694
I want to get to the school
first thing in the morning.

696
00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:02,282
So, get my suits out of the closet
and I'll get my valise.

697
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:08,913
What's the matter?

698
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:11,124
She's a buyer, Biff.
She buys for...

699
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,918
She lives down the hall.

700
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:17,256
She buys for J.H. Simmons
and you know, they're painting...

701
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:23,528
Oh, now, you don't imagine that I...

702
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:27,890
Now, look, pal, she's just a buyer!

703
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:32,146
She sees merchandise in her room and
they have to keep it looking just so.

704
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,524
- Come on, now, get my suits.
- No.

705
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:40,195
You stop crying and do as I say.
I gave you an order, Biff.

706
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,299
Biff, I gave you an order.

707
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,743
Is that what you do
when I give you an order?

708
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,888
Is it?

709
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:52,932
Then how dare you cry!

710
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:03,401
Oh, now.

711
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:12,561
Look, Biff, when you grow up
you'll understand about these things.

712
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,148
No, you mustrt overemphasise
a thing like this.

713
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:19,192
Come on, III see Birnbaum
first thing in the morning.

714
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:21,193
- Never mind.
- Never mind?

715
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:23,863
He's gonna give you those points.
I'll see to it.

716
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:26,407
- He won't listen to you.
- He certainly will!

717
00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:28,242
You need those for the U of Virginia.

718
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:31,646
- I'm not going there.
- What? - I'm not going there.

719
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:35,584
If I can't get him to change that mark
you'll make it up in summer school.

720
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,561
- You got all summer to...
- Dad.

721
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:46,778
My... my boy.

722
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:53,644
She's nothing to me, Biff.
I was Ionely. I was terribly Ionely.

723
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,062
Dad, you gave her Mama's stockings.

724
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:58,356
I gave you an order!

725
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,816
- I gave...
- Don't touch me, you liar!

726
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:03,779
- You apologise for that.
- You fake!

727
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:06,823
I gave you an order!
I gave you an order!

728
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:10,035
- Now, you come back here.
- You phoney little fake.

729
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:11,786
- Come back here!
- You fake!

730
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:15,332
I gave you an order!
Come back or I'll beat you. I'II...

731
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,892
- Hey.
- I'll whip you.

732
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,420
I gave you...

733
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:23,047
Pick it up, Mr Loman.

734
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,884
Your boys just left with the chippies.

735
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:28,886
They said they'd see you home.

736
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:31,389
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

737
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,650
- Can you make it?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, I'll make it.

738
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,829
- Mr Loman.
- OK.

739
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,207
I'll make it.

740
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:47,714
- I look all right.
- Sure, you look all right.

741
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:50,784
Uh... Uh...

742
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,495
Here. Here. Here's a dollar.

743
00:42:54,496 --> 00:42:57,373
- Your son paid. It's all right.
- You're a good boy.

744
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,585
- You don't have to.
- Here's more. I don't need it anymore.

745
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:04,548
Tell me, is there a seed store
in the neighbourhood?

746
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:06,933
Seeds?

747
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,263
- You mean, like to plant?
- Yes, like carrots, peas.

748
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:13,722
There's a hardware store
on Sixth Avenue.

749
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,643
- It may be too late now.
- I better hurry.

750
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:20,981
I gotta get some seeds.
Gotta get some seeds right away.

751
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:24,308
Well, what are you looking at?

752
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:29,588
Nothing is planted right.

753
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:32,608
I don't have a thing
in the ground right now.

754
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,001
"Carrots.
Quarter inch apart,

755
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,971
one foot rows..."

756
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,515
One foot.

757
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,018
Beets.

758
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:11,322
Lettuce.
One foot.

759
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:13,882
Oh, what a proposition.

760
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:17,095
Terrific, terrific,
'cause she's suffered, man.

761
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,447
The woman has suffered.

762
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:22,016
A man can't go out the way he came in.

763
00:44:22,017 --> 00:44:25,103
A man has got to add up to something.
You can't...

764
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:27,438
You can't. You gotta consider now.

765
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,314
Don't answer so quick.

766
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:34,863
Remember, it's a guaranteed
$20,000 proposition, huh?

767
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:39,826
Now, look, Ben, I want you to go through
the ins and outs of this thing with me.

768
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:44,630
I got nobody to talk to. And the
woman has suffered, you hear me?

769
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:49,419
- What's the proposition? - It's $20,000
on the barrel head, guaranteed.

770
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:51,211
Gilt edge, you understand?

771
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:53,464
You don't want
to make a fool of yourself.

772
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:57,093
- They might not honour the policy.
- How can they refuse? I worked.

773
00:44:57,177 --> 00:45:00,805
I met every premium on the nose
and now they don't pay off? Impossible.

774
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:02,723
It's called a cowardly thing.

775
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:06,811
Why does it take more guts to stand here
the rest of my life ringing up a zero?

776
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:08,479
That's a point, William.

777
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,442
And 20,000. That is something
one can feel with their hands.

778
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:14,943
That's the whole beauty of it, Ben.

779
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:17,906
I see it like a diamond
shining in the dark

780
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,741
that I can pick up and touch in my hand.

781
00:45:20,742 --> 00:45:24,287
Not like an appointment.

782
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:28,374
This would not be another appointment
and it changes all the aspects.

783
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,628
Because he thinks I'm nothing,
so he spites me.

784
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:36,758
But the funeral.
Oh, Ben, that funeral will be massive!

785
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:40,303
Oh, they'll come
from Maine, Massachusetts,

786
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:43,406
Vermont, New Hampshire.

787
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:47,644
All the old-timers
with the strange licence plates.

788
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,062
That boy will be thunderstruck, Ben,

789
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,982
because he never realised I am known.

790
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:56,611
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
I am known, Ben!

791
00:45:56,694 --> 00:45:59,404
He'll see it with his eyes!

792
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:02,742
Once and for all,
he'll see what I am, oh!

793
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:06,345
He's in for a shock, that boy.

794
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:09,958
He'll call you a coward, William.

795
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:13,961
Oh, no, no, that would be terrible.

796
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:18,015
- Yes, and a damn fool.
- No, no!

797
00:46:18,216 --> 00:46:20,943
He'll hate you, William.

798
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:24,446
He mustn't. Oh, I won't have that.

799
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:51,056
Mom, what are you doing up?

800
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:55,019
Where's Pop? Is he sleeping?

801
00:46:57,297 --> 00:47:00,173
- Where were you?
- We met two girls, very fine types.

802
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:02,968
We brought you some flowers.
Put 'em in your room.

803
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:05,762
What did you do that for?
I want you to have flowers.

804
00:47:05,763 --> 00:47:08,682
Don't you care whether he lives or dies?

805
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:11,327
- Biff, let's go up.
- Go away from me.

806
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:16,024
What do you mean, lives or dies?
Nobody's dying around here, pal.

807
00:47:16,107 --> 00:47:19,527
Get out of here!
Get out of my sight!

808
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,445
I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

809
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,298
- You're not going near him.
- Where is he?

810
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:28,036
You invite him for dinner,
he looks forward to it all day.

811
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,038
- And then you desert him there?
- Dad?

812
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,415
There's no stranger you'd do that to.

813
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:36,627
He had a swell time with us.
When I desert him I hope I do it...

814
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:39,438
- Get out of here!
- Ma!

815
00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:45,010
- Mom?
- Did you have to go to women tonight?

816
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:48,097
You and your rotten, lousy whores!

817
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:51,768
Mom, all we did was follow Biff around
trying to cheer him up.

818
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:54,644
- Boy, what a night you gave me.
- Get out of here.

819
00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:57,857
Both of you, and don't come back.
I don't want you tormenting him anymore.

820
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,652
- Dad, are you down there?
- You can sleep in his apartment.

821
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:09,327
And pick up this stuff!
I'm not your maid anymore.

822
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:12,330
Go on, pick it up, you bum, you!

823
00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:14,623
You're a pair of animals.

824
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:18,044
There's not one, not a living soul,
who would have the cruelty

825
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:20,921
to walk out on that man
in a restaurant.

826
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:23,925
- Is that what he said?
- He didn't have to say anything.

827
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:28,179
He was so humiliated,
he nearly limped when he came in.

828
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:31,407
- Look, Mom, he had a great time.
- Shut up!

829
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:38,939
You! Didn't even go to
see if he was all right.

830
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,693
No, Mom, I didn't. I didn't do
a damn thing. How do you like that?

831
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:45,670
I left him babbling in a toilet.

832
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:49,408
- You louse, you.
- You hit it on the nose.

833
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:52,035
The scum of the earth.
You're looking at him.

834
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:55,790
- Get out of here.
- I want to talk to the boss, Mom.

835
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,916
You're not going near him. Get out.

836
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,795
We're gonna have
an abrupt conversation, him and me.

837
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:04,148
You're not talking to him.

838
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:17,103
Please, leave him alone.

839
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:20,164
What is he doing out there?

840
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:24,819
He's planting the garden.

841
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,629
Now?

842
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,283
Oh, my god.

843
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:35,788
Never even let me carry
the valises in the house.

844
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:39,125
And simonising, simonising...

845
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:42,043
...that little red car.

846
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,188
Why?

847
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,969
Why can't I give him something
and not have him hate me, huh?

848
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:52,972
Let me think about it.
I still have a little time.

849
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:55,515
A remarkable proposition.

850
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:56,891
Oh.

851
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:59,854
You gotta be sure
you're not making a fool of yourself.

852
00:49:59,937 --> 00:50:02,164
Dad?

853
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:11,866
Where is that seed?
You can't see nothing here, boxed in.

854
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,950
Dad, there are people all around.

855
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:16,678
- Don't you realise?
- Don't bother me.

856
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:26,797
- I'm saying good-bye to you, Pop.
- Huh?

857
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:29,382
I'm not coming back anymore.

858
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:32,803
- You're not gonna see Oliver?
- Dad, I've got no appointment.

859
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:35,472
- He put his arm around you.
- Dad, get this now.

860
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:38,559
Every time I've left
it's been a fight that's sent me out.

861
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:43,505
Today I realise something about
myself. I tried to explain it to you.

862
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:47,902
I think I'm just not smart enough
to make sense out of it for you.

863
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:50,946
To hell with whose fault it is
or anything like that.

864
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:54,616
Let's just wrap it up.

865
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:57,410
- Come in and we'll tell Mom.
- I don't want to see her.

866
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,245
- Come on.
- I don't want to see her.

867
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:01,790
Don't bother me, will ya?

868
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,417
Dad, what do you mean?
You don't want to see her?

869
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:08,047
Pop, you don't want them
calling you yellow, do you?

870
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,259
Dad, it's not your fault.
It's me. I'm a bum.

871
00:51:12,343 --> 00:51:14,820
Now, come on inside.

872
00:51:15,554 --> 00:51:18,907
Dad, did you hear what I said to you?

873
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,666
Did you plant, dear?

874
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,712
All right, Mom.

875
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:36,117
We had it out.
I'm going and I'm not writing anymore.

876
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,159
I think it's best, Willy.

877
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,247
There's no use drawing it out.
You two will never get along.

878
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,291
If people ask where I am,
what I'm doing, you don't know or care.

879
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:48,504
That way it'll be off your mind
and you can start brightening up again.

880
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:51,148
All right?

881
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:59,698
That... That clears it, then, huh?

882
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:19,743
- You gonna wish me luck, scout?
- Shake his hand, Willy.

883
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:22,078
What do you say?

884
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,499
There's no necessity to mention...
He put his arm...!

885
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,295
Dad, you're never gonna see what I am,
so what's the use of arguing?

886
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:32,840
If I strike oil I'll send you a cheque.
Meantime, forget I'm alive.

887
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:34,924
Spite, see?

888
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:38,236
- Shake hands, Dad.
- Not my hand.

889
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,951
Dad?

890
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:49,315
- I was hoping not to go this way.
- This is the way you're going. Bye.

891
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:56,905
May you rot in hell
if you leave this house!

892
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:59,616
Exactly what is it
that you want from me?

893
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:03,454
I want you to know on the train,
in the mountains, in the valleys,

894
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:07,041
wherever you go,
that you cut down your life for spite!

895
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:10,268
- No, no!
- Spite!

896
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:19,178
When you are rotting somewhere
beside a railroad track, remember.

897
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:22,096
- Don't you blame it on me.
- I'm not blaming you.

898
00:53:22,097 --> 00:53:24,641
I'm not taking the rap for this, hear?

899
00:53:24,642 --> 00:53:27,728
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You're putting a knife in me.

900
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:30,563
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

901
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:33,274
All right, phoney.
Leave it there. Don't move it.

902
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:35,485
- What is that?
- You know damn well.

903
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:37,820
- I never saw that.
- You saw it, all right.

904
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:41,617
Mice didn't bring it into the cellar.
Is that supposed to make you a hero?

905
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,162
That supposed to make me sorry for you?
There will be no pity for you.

906
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:47,246
- Hear that? No pity.
- Hear the spite?

907
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:49,832
You're gonna get the truth,
what you are, what I am.

908
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,542
- Spite!
- Cut it out!

909
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:54,505
The man don't know who we are.
The man is gonna know.

910
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:58,300
We never told the truth
for ten minutes in this house.

911
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:01,260
- We always told truth.
- Are you the assistant buyer?

912
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,971
You're one of
the two assistants to the assistant.

913
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,641
- I'm practically...
- You are practically full of it.

914
00:54:06,642 --> 00:54:08,935
- We all are. I'm through with it.
- Yeah.

915
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:11,871
- Hear this, Willy. This is me.
- I know you.

916
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:14,982
Do you know why I had no
address for three months?

917
00:54:14,983 --> 00:54:17,693
I stole a suit in Kansas City
and I was in gaol.

918
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:21,031
- I suppose it's my fault.
- Stop crying, I'm through with it!

919
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:24,243
I stole myself
out of every good job since high school.

920
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:25,743
Whose fault is that?

921
00:54:25,744 --> 00:54:29,081
I could never get anywhere
'cause you blew me so full of hot air

922
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:32,041
that I could never stand
taking orders from anybody.

923
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:34,335
- I hear that.
- Stop it!

924
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:37,172
I had to be boss big shot
in two weeks and I'm through.

925
00:54:37,256 --> 00:54:39,674
- Then hang yourself for spite!
- No! No!

926
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:43,470
No, nobody is hanging himself, Willy.

927
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:51,145
I ran down 11 flights with a pen
in my hand today.

928
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:53,563
And suddenly I stopped.
Do you hear me?

929
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:56,900
In the middle of that office building...
Do you hear this?

930
00:54:56,984 --> 00:54:59,110
I stopped...

931
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:03,157
...in the middle of the building
and I saw the sky!

932
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,121
And I... I... I saw the things
that I love in this world.

933
00:55:09,246 --> 00:55:12,691
The work and the food

934
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,711
and the time to sit and smoke.

935
00:55:15,794 --> 00:55:20,132
I looked at that pen in my hand and
I said, "What am I grabbing this for?

936
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,925
Why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

937
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:24,594
What am I doing in an office?

938
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:27,723
Making a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,

939
00:55:27,806 --> 00:55:30,558
when all that I want
is out there waiting for me?"

940
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,896
The minute I say it, I know who I am.
Why can't I say that, Willy?

941
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:35,980
The door to your life is wide open!

942
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:38,482
Pop, I am a dime a dozen and so are you.

943
00:55:38,483 --> 00:55:41,110
I am not a dime a dozen!

944
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:44,072
I am Willy Loman and you are Biff Loman!

945
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:47,959
I am not the leader of men, Willy!
And neither are you!

946
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,622
You were never anything
but a hard-working drummer

947
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,582
who landed in the ashcan
like all the rest of them.

948
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,209
I am one dollar an hour, Willy!

949
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,923
I am not bringing home
any prizes anymore,

950
00:56:01,006 --> 00:56:03,174
and you're gonna stop waiting for me!

951
00:56:03,175 --> 00:56:07,012
- You vengeful, spiteful mutt!
- Yeah, Pop!

952
00:56:07,095 --> 00:56:10,057
Pop, I'm nothing.

953
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,226
I'm nothing, Pop.
Can't you understand that?

954
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,645
There's no spite in it anymore.

955
00:56:15,646 --> 00:56:18,539
I'm just what I am, that's all.

956
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:23,528
What are you doing?
Aw, what are you doing?

957
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:31,620
- Why is he crying?
- Dad...

958
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:35,556
Will you let me go, for God's sake?

959
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,838
Will you take that phoney dream
and burn it before something happens?

960
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:24,105
I'll go in the morning.

961
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:30,111
Put him to bed.

962
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:41,231
Isn't that...
Isn't that remarkable?

963
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:45,152
Biff, he...

964
00:57:46,778 --> 00:57:49,672
He likes me.

965
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:53,618
- He loves you, Willy.
- Always did, Pop.

966
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:56,370
Aw, Biff, he...

967
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,140
He cried. He cried to me.

968
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:03,211
Aw, that boy.
That boy, he's going to be magnificent.

969
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:07,131
Yes, outstanding,
with 20,000 behind him.

970
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:09,675
Come to bed, Willy.
It's all settled now.

971
00:58:09,676 --> 00:58:13,096
Oh, yes, we'll sleep.
Come on, let's go to sleep.

972
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:15,806
It takes a great man
to crack thejungle.

973
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:19,144
I'm getting married.
Don't forget. I'm changing everything.

974
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:22,189
I'm gonna run that department
before the year is up.

975
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:24,857
Thejungle is dark
but full of diamonds.

976
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:28,361
Be good. You're both good boys.
Just act that way, that's all.

977
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:32,373
- Night, Pop.
- Night, boy.

978
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:36,785
- Come, dear. -S hh. One must
go in to fetch a diamond out.

979
00:58:36,786 --> 00:58:39,496
I just want to get settled down
for a little while.

980
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:42,626
- I want you upstairs.
- A few minutes. I couldn't sleep now.

981
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:45,629
- Go. You look awful tired.
- Not like an appointment.

982
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:48,757
- A diamond is rough and hard to touch.
- I'll be right up.

983
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:51,718
- I think it's the only way.
- Sure, it's the best thing.

984
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:56,665
Best thing. The only way.
Everything is gonna be...

985
00:58:56,848 --> 00:58:59,825
Aw, go on, kid. Get to bed.

986
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:05,265
- You look so tired. - Now, you
come right up. - Two minutes.

987
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:16,901
Loves me. Always loved me.
Isn't that a remarkable thing?

988
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:21,322
- Ben, he'll worship me for it.
- It's dark there.

989
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:23,198
But full of diamonds, Willy.

990
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,995
Can you imagine that magnificence
with $20,000 in his pocket?

991
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:29,204
Willy, come up.

992
00:59:29,205 --> 00:59:31,957
Yes, yes, coming, coming!

993
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:35,019
It's very smart,
you realise, don't you, sweetheart?

994
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:36,895
Even Ben sees it.

995
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:39,415
I gotta go, baby.

996
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,254
Bye-bye.

997
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:48,700
When the mail comes
he'll be ahead of Bernard again.

998
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:53,328
- A perfect proposition all around.
- Did you see how he cried to me?

999
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:57,357
- Aw, I could kiss him, Ben.
- Time, William, time.

1000
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:01,546
Ben, I always knew one way or another
we were gonna make it, Biff and I.

1001
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:04,924
Boat! We'll be late.

1002
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:11,639
Now, when you kick off,
I want a 70 yard boot.

1003
01:00:11,723 --> 01:00:15,268
And get right down the field
under the ball.

1004
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:18,688
And when you hit,
hit low and hit hard,

1005
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:21,189
because it's important, boy.

1006
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,319
There's all kinds of
important people in the stands.

1007
01:00:26,195 --> 01:00:28,922
The first thing that you know...

1008
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:30,782
Willy?

1009
01:00:30,783 --> 01:00:33,703
- Ben? Ben, where do I...?
- Willy?

1010
01:00:33,786 --> 01:00:37,874
- Ben! Ben!
- Willy!

1011
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,667
Shh. Shh.

1012
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:43,420
Shh! Shh!

1013
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:46,482
- Willy, please come up.
- Oh.

1014
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:50,652
- Willy!
- Shh!

1015
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:57,159
Willy?

1016
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:03,190
- Pop?
- Willy, answer me!

1017
01:01:03,191 --> 01:01:06,502
Willy!

1018
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:11,883
- Willy!
- Pop! No!

1019
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:15,444
- No!
- No!

1020
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:23,603
It's getting dark, Linda.

1021
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:29,442
How about it, Ma? Better get
some rest. They'll be closing the gates.

1022
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:32,612
He had no right to do that.
There was no necessity.

1023
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:35,615
- We would have helped him.
- Come on.

1024
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:39,909
- Why didn't anybody come?
- It was a very nice funeral.

1025
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:43,122
Where were the people he knew?
Maybe they blame him.

1026
01:01:43,205 --> 01:01:46,584
It's a rough world, Linda.
They wouldn't blame him.

1027
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:51,664
I can't understand it.
First time in just about 35 years

1028
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:55,593
we were almost free and clear.

1029
01:01:56,844 --> 01:02:00,030
He only needed a little salary.

1030
01:02:00,097 --> 01:02:03,059
He was even finished with the dentist.

1031
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:06,145
No man only needs a little salary.

1032
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,689
I can't understand it.

1033
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:15,154
There were a lot of nice days when he'd
come home from a trip or on Sundays,

1034
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:18,616
making the stoop,
finishing the cellar

1035
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:22,870
when he built the extra bathroom
and put up the garage.

1036
01:02:24,288 --> 01:02:27,875
You know, Charley, I think there was
more of him in that front stoop

1037
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,293
than in all the sales he ever made.

1038
01:02:30,294 --> 01:02:34,590
Yep. He was a happy man
with a bunch of cement.

1039
01:02:34,673 --> 01:02:37,509
He was wonderful with his hands.

1040
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,763
He had the wrong dreams.
AII, all wrong.

1041
01:02:40,846 --> 01:02:44,107
Don't say that.
The man didn't know who he was.

1042
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:47,185
Nobody dast blame this man.

1043
01:02:47,186 --> 01:02:49,579
You don't understand.

1044
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,916
Willy was a salesman.

1045
01:02:53,484 --> 01:02:56,320
For a salesman,
there is no rock bottom to the life.

1046
01:02:56,403 --> 01:02:58,279
He don't put a bolt to a nut,

1047
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,074
he don't tell you the law,
don't give you medicine.

1048
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:03,911
He's a man way out there in the blue,

1049
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:08,056
riding on a smile and a shoeshine.

1050
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:13,219
When they start not smiling back,
that's an earthquake.

1051
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,174
You get yourself a couple of spots
on your hat and you're finished.

1052
01:03:18,968 --> 01:03:22,028
Nobody dast blame this man.

1053
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:25,916
A salesman has got to dream, boy.
Comes with the territory.

1054
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:30,019
- The man didn't know who he was.
- Don't say that!

1055
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,039
Why don't you come with me, Happy?

1056
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:36,126
I'm not licked that easily.

1057
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:39,738
I'm staying right in the city
and I'm gonna beat this racquet.

1058
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:44,159
- Loman brothers.
- I know who I am, kid.

1059
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,911
All right, boy,
I'm gonna show you and everybody

1060
01:03:46,912 --> 01:03:50,374
that Willy Loman did not die in vain.
He had a good dream.

1061
01:03:50,457 --> 01:03:53,752
It's the only dream you can have,
to come out number one man.

1062
01:03:53,836 --> 01:03:57,514
He fought it out here and this is where
I'm gonna win it for him.

1063
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:02,777
Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute.

1064
01:04:03,095 --> 01:04:05,855
You go on, Charley.

1065
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,783
Just... just a minute.

1066
01:04:13,147 --> 01:04:16,416
I never had a chance to say good-bye.

1067
01:04:25,618 --> 01:04:28,277
Help me, Willy.

1068
01:04:28,495 --> 01:04:30,972
I can't cry.

1069
01:04:31,582 --> 01:04:36,503
Seems to me you're just away on
another trip and I keep expecting you.

1070
01:04:38,964 --> 01:04:41,574
Why did you do it?

1071
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:45,846
I search and I search,

1072
01:04:46,972 --> 01:04:49,808
and I search,

1073
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:56,106
and I can't understand it, Willy.

1074
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:02,921
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1075
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:06,841
Today!

1076
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:17,319
And there'll be nobody home.

1077
01:05:19,463 --> 01:05:22,757
We're free and clear.

1078
01:05:26,762 --> 01:05:29,272
We're free.

1079
01:05:30,057 --> 01:05:32,575
We're free.

1080
01:05:37,272 --> 01:05:40,000
We're free.

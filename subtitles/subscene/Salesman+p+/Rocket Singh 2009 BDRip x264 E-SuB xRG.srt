00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,957
Cheers..

2
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,124
Ready? Go..

3
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,415
Woo.. l'm on top of the world!!
Enough!

4
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,457
No, no, no, baby one more
one more one more please..

5
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,957
Harpreet! You passed!!

6
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,624
Bunty, you bum, congrats!
Come.. l'll get you a drink.

7
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,832
Sai.. Sai do something..

8
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,499
lt's your party dude
and the DJ is leaving.

9
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,665
What's happening?

10
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,457
Nonsense! Give him some more money.

11
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,499
He can't stop now,
the party is just warming up.

12
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,249
l just did that,
he wont take my money,

13
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,499
says it's past 2 am
and he has to wake up early.

14
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,290
Well it is past 2 am
- Wake up early.. why become a DJ?

15
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,082
Let me talk to him..

16
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,582
HP if he doesn't want money it
must be something serious. Leave it.

17
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,249
Hello Prince Charles,
not everyone is motivated by money.

18
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,707
So how else are they motivated?

19
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,832
Have you ever heard of the word
- Persuasion?

20
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,249
You can't get anywhere
with B.com 39 percent.

21
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,832
l keep telling him to apply
for an MBA, doesn't listen to me.

22
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,040
Life is not all fun and games no..

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,374
Ok grandpa

24
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,665
Wow, what did you do?

25
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,957
A little conversation, a little
persuasion, a little negotiation..

26
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,999
Done with your negotiation, can we
talk about something worthwhile?

27
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,332
Do you talk about anything else?

28
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,207
Not my work, l'm talking about yours.

29
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,165
l'm starting with my dad's law firm,
l don't care.. what about you?

30
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,957
Why? What about me?

31
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,124
He graduated, isn't that enough?

32
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,415
You won't take the MBA exam?

33
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,290
lf my grandfather was rich as your
father, l would have taken the exam..

34
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,957
So what will you do?

35
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,624
S-a-l-e-s

36
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,874
What.. you'll be a salesman?

37
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,540
Why? Aren't salesmen human beings?

38
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,332
They are.. of course they are..
but not very rich human beings.

39
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,415
My son, do you remember
Randy Bahadur, from arts?

40
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,915
He is a salesman..

41
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,165
He gets 40,000 rupees
without blinking.

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,957
Half of that is commission, which
he gets only after he gets an order.

43
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,957
And do you even know
what all a salesman has..

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,915
.. to go through to get an order?!

45
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,624
Why do you find fault
in everything l do?

46
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,124
Bloody negative bastard you are!

47
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,957
Dude he has a habit of lecturing
people.. come on, let's dance.

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,749
No, once and for all
let's get this straight,

49
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,582
these management exams
are not my cup of tea,

50
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,415
and my family doesn't have money
for a private MBA.

51
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,249
Sales is the only field where common
sense matters more than grades.

52
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,665
And now you'll say that
l don't even have common sense.

53
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,249
What'll l say..

54
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,082
Come.. come.. come.. Let's dance.

55
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,582
l don't want to.

56
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,957
Oh come on

57
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,290
l told you l don't want to.

58
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,374
l don't do things that
don't have power or money.

59
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:28,999
Just try it once. People will pay
just to watch you dance.

60
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,207
Good morning.. morning.. morning,

61
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,290
morning.. morning.. Good morning

62
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,790
Good morning.. morning..
Good morning

63
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,499
Good morning.. Good morning sir.
This is Harpreet Singh Bedi,

64
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,165
Harpreet Singh. Harpreet Singh..

65
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,582
Good morning sir l'm Harpreet
Singh Bedi.. Can l have a seat?

66
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,582
Good morning sir
l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi.. ca..ca

67
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,124
Morning gentlemen, morning ma'am.
l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi..

68
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:24,207
l can't tell you how much l admire
this unique company and.. Unique?

69
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,332
Good morning unique-

70
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,124
Come on son, come have
some sweet curd for luck.

71
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,124
Have all your certificates?

72
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,624
Especially your character
certificate? - Yes

73
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,374
Brushed up on your general knowledge?
- Yes

74
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,999
Have you memorized an essay?

75
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,082
lt's an interview, not an exam.

76
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,165
Have you memorized today's newspaper?
- Ya.

77
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,665
Put in money on your phone card?
- Ya

78
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,999
Emptied your bowels?

79
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,957
Oh man, on one side
you're feeding me sweet curd and

80
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,540
on the other.. ok l'm leaving.

81
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,874
lf you'd used your brains studying,
you wouldn't need sweet curd for luck

82
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,582
lf Einstein studied
with your snoring..

83
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,915
..he'd also have to eat sweet curd.

84
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,457
Had l taken to snoring again?

85
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,249
You weren't taking, you were giving
it to the world.. for free. Ok bye

86
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,665
At least straighten your turban.

87
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,207
What does the company make?

88
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,499
Don't know, will find out on the way

89
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,707
They make computers grandpa.
My grades are low not my lQ.

90
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,124
Oh lord, all is up to you now.

91
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,540
However he is, he is your son.
Watch over him.

92
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,374
Good morning AYS.. transferring sir

93
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,415
Good morning AYS.. line 2 sir

94
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,582
Excuse me ma'am..

95
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,665
Good morning AYS..
Transferring you to sales sir,

96
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,290
Nitin, enquiry! - He's inside
the Taj Mahal, l'll speak to them.

97
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,457
l may look it, but l am not..

98
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,624
You'll burn your fingers..

99
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,790
.. if you take a peek
at other people's clients or wives.

100
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,665
Everyone's suspicious here!

101
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,999
l'm going to leave this place.

102
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,207
l've heard it for 3 years.

103
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,374
Those who do things
don't talk about it.

104
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,957
Hello.. l haven't received a single
call since morning. l am not fasting.

105
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,499
Could you hold sir? What can l do
if your territory's dead?

106
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,165
When you get your territory,
you don't say anything.

107
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,290
lf you say something
in the Taj Mahal, you hear an echo.

108
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,082
This month's commission is gone.

109
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,749
l had narrowed in on an LCD..
wife will be upset.

110
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,790
Just try to get back home
on time everyday, she'll be happy.

111
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,790
Who troubles you more,
your motorcycle or your wife?

112
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,957
Connecting sir

113
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,749
Go pick up, it's your client.
He's been trying you for four days.

114
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,415
Call them once in a while,
clients don't die after sale.

115
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,790
Even the clients wonder, what
happens to a salesman after a sale?

116
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,165
Excuse me ma'am
- At Your Service good morning

117
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,457
Sir please try and reboot.

118
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,415
No Mr. Puri is not in lndia..

119
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,957
Chotelal, have you served
Mr. Puri his coffee?

120
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,165
He has had four since morning.

121
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,624
Nitin is inside
with the sales figures.

122
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,457
lt's a wonder
he doesn't want a drink instead.

123
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,499
What are you looking at?

124
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,082
Nothing

125
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,832
You want to get killed?!

126
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,957
Hello.. Can l help you?

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,082
Oh l'm sorry ma'am, l'm Harpreet
Singh Bedi, for the sales interview

128
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,999
One minute..
Sir a call for you on line two.

129
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,332
You should have told me earlier.

130
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,624
You looked busy
so l did not want to disturb.

131
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,707
Afraid of disturbing people..
How will you become a salesman?

132
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,415
Harpreet Singh?
- Yeah.. l mean Yes

133
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,124
Nitin sir has called you
to the conference room.

134
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,374
Where is the conference room please?

135
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,040
Up, in the sky. Follow me

136
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,624
Hello sir, l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi,

137
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,082
uh-it's an honour to be
in this fantastic company-

138
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,082
Why, what is so fantastic
about this company?

139
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,165
Sales sir,
your sales team's reputation is..

140
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,749
Good.. but it can be better.

141
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,040
1 2th 35 percent.. B.com 39 percent

142
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,832
no experience nothing,

143
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,249
'put together college magazine'

144
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,749
You want to be a salesman?
- Yes Sir..

145
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,665
Ok, sell yourself, come on.

146
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,499
Sir, uh..
l think l am a hard worker and-

147
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,707
You think, or you are..

148
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,957
l mean l-l am sir.. and l want to
learn everything about products,

149
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,332
markets, customer relations and
- Enough! Enough!

150
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,915
Do you know selling?
- Uh, of course sir

151
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,957
Sell this pencil to me,
for 1 00 rupees.

152
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,165
Sir this eraser

153
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,249
l took it off, but you convince me
that it's still there.

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,749
Sir, how can l convince you
if it's not there?

155
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,374
lf you can't sell,
how can we give you a job?

156
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,582
Apply elsewhere.

157
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,165
Hello sir, l'm Harpreet Singh
from Singh Pencils,

158
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,207
this is our new pencil, HS-1 01 6

159
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,040
Sorry we have already stocked up
pencils for the year

160
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,415
No problem sir, let me give you
a quick two-minute demo.

161
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,165
Why watch a demo of a pencil
with no eraser?

162
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,207
This is not a pencil
without an eraser.

163
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,082
lt's a pencil
with a detachable eraser.

164
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,457
Come up with something new!

165
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:33,332
Sir, the lead on this pencil
is unbreakable.

166
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,499
Sir, if you apply that much pressure,
anything will break.

167
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,165
But see, this pencil this can be
sharpened easily too.

168
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,332
Telling lies doesn't make a sale.

169
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,124
But perfume can make a sale.

170
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,082
Sir, this eraser sir, it is
a specially imported perfumed eraser.

171
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,749
Should we put
the pencil up our noses?

172
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,582
No sir, in the AC vent.. See?

173
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,915
There are many other uses for this.

174
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,624
lt's an ear bud for cleaning ears.

175
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,374
A Tooth pick for cleaning teeth.

176
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,540
Hair.. l mean comb.
Reboot your mobile.

177
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,207
You can make a 3 pin socket
into a pin socket.

178
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,374
ln case, you're still not satisfied,
you can kill time with it.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,457
Like you are..

180
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,040
What's going on?
- Sir

181
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,540
Puri sir

182
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,374
Hello sir

183
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,374
Sir, those sales interviews.

184
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,457
Nothing special sir.

185
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,957
Take him
- Sir?

186
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,457
You did not give up, l like that

187
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,749
Thank you, sir
- Okay you can go now

188
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,415
Your mark sheets

189
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,957
He failed a year, sir!

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,790
Not failed exactly,
fell short on attendance.

191
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,374
Sales' doesn't run on mark sheets,
it runs on balance sheets.

192
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,165
Selling a two rupee
pencil like a Mercedes..

193
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,332
He must be something.

194
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,457
Thank you sir,
l-l won't disappoint you

195
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,290
Don't.

198
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,624
Yes!

199
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:15,457
Everyone, this is..
uh, Singh.. sales trainee

200
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,165
Welcome to wonderland
- Disneyland

201
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,624
Koena

202
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,332
His mother's name!

00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,499
Rumaan, double A

204
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,415
Tanmay

205
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,249
Bastard.. - Chotelal give the new kid
the product brochure, rate list, etc.

206
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,582
Tomorrow is Sunday,
memorize everything. - Yes sir

207
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,082
Now go settle down.. over there..

208
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,332
Go on
- Yes sir

209
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,749
This way..

210
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,124
Okay Monday morning's meeting,
everyone's gonna get it.

211
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,332
So everyone please keep
your sales figures ready.

212
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,999
We still have eight months
to go and we know..

213
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,290
One who sells the most will be
the salesman of the year,

214
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,665
will receive a commission
of 5 lakh and a Goa vacation

215
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,790
And you'll get a London vacation,
after adding up everyone's sales.

216
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,790
l heard that..
- Where are you going this year boss?

217
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,957
We beat around in the sun
and he gets a London trip.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,999
You know, you guys need to improve..

219
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,707
personal attack is
a below the belt game.

220
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,374
Let us be professional here, okay?

221
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,457
Yesterday, he coined a new slogan

222
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,957
"those who sell.. come by,
and those who don't.. goodbye"

223
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,582
Shut up, cup-plate.

224
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,207
Sit down

225
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,957
Those who sell.. come by

226
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,624
And those who don't.. goodbye.

227
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,124
What does that mean?

228
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,915
That's what happens in sales. Those
who can't perform they have to go.

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,707
Where will he go?

230
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,582
He can go anywhere,
join another company if he likes.

231
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,124
What if that company turns out
to be the same?

232
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,624
Of course, it'll be the same.

233
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,915
Today's companies have
become so unethical.

234
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,040
Professional.. Professional grandpa.

235
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,790
Not like in your times,
go to office everyday,

236
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,957
sign in, eat lunch and come home.

237
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:16,582
As if we didn't work all our lives,
companies ran by themselves?

238
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,499
l am not talking about you..
you believe work is worship.

239
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:26,832
These professionals..
what does work mean to them?

240
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,124
Nothing, just work.

241
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,832
How does it matter? As long as
my grandson worships his work.

242
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,374
Rest, leave it to god.

243
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,915
Yes.

244
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,790
Hold him, hold the Sardar

245
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,415
Oh.. No no please,
let go of me Sardar..

246
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,957
He failed.

247
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,165
Mr. lnamdar. Honest man.
He got his due!

248
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,207
Meaning?
- Nitin sir wants to see you.

249
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,457
They want 56 computers

250
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,790
So, put in a quote for 1 6..
we'll see.

251
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,207
Yes sir

252
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,582
Read it all? All set?
- Of course

253
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,957
Anyone want to volunteer
for his field induction?

254
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,499
Haven't been on a field visit
in along time,

255
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,915
let's see what's going
on in whose territory.

256
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,749
Yeah! As if a manager becomes
a salesman again..

257
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,124
..by riding a motorcycle.

258
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,999
The Wife must have taken the car..

259
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,040
Letterheads.. visiting cards.

260
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,332
1 0 in pocket, 1 0 in wallet.
20 in bag.

261
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,582
Let's go.

262
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,582
350 huh?
Now that's a motorcycle, sir.

263
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,915
Zip it up.

264
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,582
You are wearing it the wrong way sir.

265
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,540
Does your dad run a laundry?

266
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,082
By evening the shirt will
get dirtier than your tongue.

267
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,582
From this signal to the next
is your territory.

268
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,165
No other AYS sales executive will
venture into the offices here.

269
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,999
Any inquiries from here,
Koena will let you know..

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,582
But this is a residential area, sir!

271
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,332
Where will l find an office here?

272
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,207
Even if you did, what would you do?
Sell pencils?

273
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,832
Sign in.

274
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,040
What are you doing?

275
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,624
Filling in our names
and our company's name.

276
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,207
You want to become a salesman?

277
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,207
First rule of the field,

278
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,415
never write your or your company's
correct details anywhere.

279
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,790
Why?
- Put an ad in the paper instead!

280
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,457
No one looks at the register
in the company.

281
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,915
But a competing salesman
always scans..

282
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,915
.. the entries for names of fools,
like you.

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,540
Are all these names incorrect then?

284
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,957
Of course! The salesmen names are
incorrect, like this James Bond.

285
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,874
He is from Monovo. He is marking his
territory here. He is teasing us..

286
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,249
He thinks he's already got the order.

287
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,957
So then?

288
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,290
l have a trump card.
Let me see, if l can use it now.

289
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,207
Mr. Pandey!

290
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,332
Sir! lt's been a while..

291
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,582
Thanks!

292
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,790
What news?

293
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,165
The guy from Monovo has been
hovering here since morning.

294
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,624
Saw him photocopying some documents
in a hurry.

295
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,915
Server quotation

296
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,832
Thanks.

297
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,207
Sorry boss

298
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,707
What is it?

299
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,040
Nothing boss, he's crazy.
Oh look, your floor!

300
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,999
Boss..

301
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,999
Ha! He got off on the wrong floor.
New kid from Wintel.

302
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,624
By the time he reaches
the client he'll grow up.

303
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,832
Ok sir.. yeah.. 6.30? Ok sir.

304
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,207
l'll just convey it to him.
Have a nice day.

305
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,749
Yes?

306
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,457
Are you going to say something
or keep smiling like a fool?

307
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,957
How are you?
- Sharma sir is busy.

308
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,790
Couldn't l have come to meet you?

309
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,374
You wouldn't meet your
wife without a reason.

310
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,165
First become the wife,
then we'll see.

311
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,249
Sit down, let me see, idiot.

312
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,499
ls she your girl friend?

313
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,207
l am not that desperate.

314
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,957
What if she'd taken offense?

315
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,790
You were taking a big risk, sir!

316
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,249
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

317
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,374
At least you're a salesman.

318
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,582
Ok.. go ahead!

319
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,374
ldiot.

320
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:44,040
Mr. Sharma's Australia trip canceled.
Bonuses announced.

321
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,665
Mr. Mavalankar promoted. Ha!
My next trump card.

322
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,290
You go in first. He's in bad a mood.
- Why?

323
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,957
Because Mavalankar has
been promoted. Go in!

324
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,957
Good morning sir, l am
Harpreet Singh, this is my colleague-

325
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,540
Nitin, how are you?

326
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:08,540
Now that you're a sales manager,
we don't exist anymore?

327
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:13,040
No sir, nothing like that. Tanmay
must be dropping by now and then!

328
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,207
You must be busy planning
your Australia trip?

329
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,415
No l canceled it.
There's a lot of work in office.

330
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,290
l thought this company
has other people as well?

331
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,249
Yes l have heard that there are,
but till date l haven't seen any..

332
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,790
Anyway, tell me more.. - Tanmay
must have mailed you the quotation?

333
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:39,749
ls that a quotation?
This.. you people mail anything.

334
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,957
He is a kid.
Still learning the ropes.

335
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,332
So what range are you looking at?
l will send you a fresh one.

336
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,665
Ok, l'll let you know.

337
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,915
By the way the Monovo
people were saying that..

338
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,207
.. Mr. Mavalankar asked
to keep it less than 1 0 lakh

339
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,999
Mavalankar? What has he
got to do with this quote?

340
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,582
This is not even his department!

341
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:02,124
No sir they said that
he has been promoted,

342
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,582
and now heads
the purchase department.

343
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:08,665
One minute. Do me a favour!

344
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,874
Send in a new quote of 1 0 lakh,
1 0 thousand.

345
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:18,457
Throw in a year of free service
and warranty.

346
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,957
Then let's see who gives,
l mean, who gets the order?

347
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,207
Right sir

348
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,999
But l must say these Monovo
people are very unprofessional,

349
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,957
l never expected this from them.

350
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,665
Now what can l say sir!

351
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,290
We have a policy of not
talking about Competition

352
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,582
Yes l know, sorry you?

353
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:45,332
Hello sir l'm.. - My cousin sir,
l was dropping him off to college.

354
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,999
You're too good boss

355
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,082
Weren't you getting too familiar
with Tanmay's client?

356
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,915
No, no sir,
l was introducing myself.

357
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:56,207
Started already? Sales freak!

358
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,249
Good good.

359
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:12,790
But sir, how did you
know of the Monovo plan?

360
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:16,082
Did you skip high school classes
as well? Didn't they teach you..

361
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,332
.. necessity is
the mother of invention!

362
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:20,124
But how did know
the exact quotation?

363
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,707
l read it! How else would l know?

364
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,082
On that notice board?

365
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,790
Sharma!

366
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,165
But Mr. Sharma didn't
show us any quotation

367
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,707
No one shows you a quotation kid!
You have to see it.

368
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,415
That's what he was reading!

369
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,374
You can read upside down too?

370
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,999
You know what they call a salesman
who can't read upside down?

371
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,374
What?

372
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:43,957
A Blind salesman.

373
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,624
lf Jogeshwari is
on the Goregaon link road then,

374
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,040
it is in Jogeshwari. lsn't it?

375
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,582
No it's not.
Everyone knows it's in Goregaon.

376
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,332
He is my prospect Mr.,
and l have already spoken to him.

377
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,707
Madam, when you'd called l was there.

378
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,124
Besides, l've already spoken
with Nitin.

379
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,749
Nitin!

380
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,124
Oh hello.. got your target?

381
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,957
No, where do you get it from?

382
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,915
lt falls on your head.

383
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:20,124
Look l am warning you,
if you even look at my clients,

384
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,082
l'll kill you.

385
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,165
Hello
- Put Giri on.

386
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,415
Who? - lt's Koena,
who else would call you here.

387
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,124
Pass the phone to Giri.
- Giri who?

388
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,749
Get up, look over the partition.
The Service manager.

389
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,665
Hurry up now,
his client is getting impatient.

390
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,124
Hi

391
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,165
What? - How much longer?
Your client's been waiting an hour.

392
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,332
l don't know.

393
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,957
Give me an estimate? Or will you
make him wait till evening?

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,124
Told you, l don't know. lt's
a technical problem, will take time.

395
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,207
What's the problem? - The Monitor
is not showing anything.

396
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,999
Needs a new mother board.

397
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,790
Why don't you open it
and take a look Giri sir?

398
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:02,999
Maybe it can be fixed.

399
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,374
Open it. Open it.

400
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,415
Whack it in!

401
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,832
Not that! The third one!
ls it in? Reboot.

402
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,957
lt's working.

403
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,582
lt was a loose connection.
Pack it up.

404
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,249
Dial Koena, number 9

405
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:44,290
Tell the client his mother board
was fried-Rs. 5000. Less?

406
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,915
lt's his fault, he didn't use a UPS.
That's another Rs. 3,250.

407
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,165
Will take a week to fix it all.

408
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,665
lf you want a client's blood
why don't you ask him?

409
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,374
Why are you asking for money?

410
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,832
Experience!

411
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,124
He's the one getting
a week's experience.

412
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,457
lf l fixed your computer in 5 minutes
would you pay me 1 0,000?

413
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,082
Should l tell Nitin sir?

414
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:11,415
Go tell him! How do you think
his London trip is funded?

415
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,040
From here. Now leave me alone.

416
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:20,249
Chotelal yesterday's CD..
where is it?

417
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:25,290
lt's here. Sir please don't leave it
lying around.

418
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,790
You watched it last night?

419
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,999
No, no, l left.

420
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,374
You watched "The wild Queen"?

421
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,957
Go get me a cup of tea.

422
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,249
Should l pack this?

423
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,540
What.. leave it. Get me tea first.

424
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,707
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

425
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,082
At least l'm a salesman.

426
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:45,832
What's going on?
l have an announcement.

427
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,957
Jai Hind Motors is in!

428
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:58,665
Party time in the evening,
booze is on the company,

429
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,165
Women are not, so bring your own

430
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:32,332
Yes, yeah, l'm calling from office.

431
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,207
Will l be calling you
from college again?

432
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,415
Please eat dinner, l'll be late.
l have an office get-together.

433
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:43,874
Oh! We can discuss fixing
the flush later. Ok, bye.

434
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,749
Sorry Mr. Mishra..
- What.. ?

435
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,290
You are Chotelal Mishra?

436
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,374
lt's on the intercom list

437
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,915
What's this.. the man who failed
is the most educated.

438
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,707
Chotelal, what are you doing?
lt's spilling.

439
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,290
Don't worry madam. Everyone
in a line please. l'll serve you

440
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:26,832
Move it Grandpa,
move it or l'll put in a quotation.

441
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,624
Nitin? Have you spoken
to Mr. Puri about me?

442
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,832
Oh shit..

443
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,749
Please Nitin,
the office manager's position..

444
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,999
..has been open for a longtime.

445
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,415
They will get someone eventually..

446
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,332
.. and anyways, l have been
looking over the work.

447
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,540
Hope you've been looking out
for the phone calls?

448
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,874
The credit card collector has been
trying to get to you for two months.

449
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,624
Has he reached you yet?

450
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:29,082
So attendance shortage, how are you?

451
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,999
l'm good sir, thank you,
how are you

452
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:39,040
How ambitious are you exactly?

453
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,624
Do you think you can
take over his job?

454
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,249
No sir

455
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,582
You think l would have fired him
if you said yes?

456
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,457
No, no sir

457
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:59,124
l like you,
you didn't get emotional.

458
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,124
You have a quality to go up,

459
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,040
but you also have a quality
to go down.

460
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,665
Eventually the quality that
wins will define your life.

461
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:16,624
So where you want to go?
Up or down?

462
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,040
Up sir

463
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,915
To climb up, you'll have to walk
over many people..

464
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,374
.. and they will bite you hard.

465
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,915
And tomorrow if you're late for work,
your pay will be cut. Welcome to AYS!

466
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,332
Booo!

467
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:59,499
Shit man! They say after 70,
a man's age restarts from zero.

468
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,582
Dude, close your eyes.

469
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,082
One minute..

470
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,040
l don't have two minutes..
don't you understand!

471
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:09,790
l waited for you for three hours,
you don't have 2 minutes for me

472
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,582
Ok fine, it's your carpet.
Don't blame me later.

473
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,624
New pinch!

474
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,374
What's this?

475
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,582
Our brand new scooter
- What?

476
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,499
Yes.. one with a button start.

477
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,707
No more kicking or pushing,

478
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,665
just gently press the button
and fly like a bird.

479
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,290
You want to ride a scooter
at this age?

480
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,832
Why should l ride it?

481
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:35,749
l'll sit behind like a prime
minister. You'll drive right?

482
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,915
Me?
- Yes

483
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,624
Ride a scooter?
- What's the problem?

484
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:42,415
lt's your favorite colour too.
Maroon.

485
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,624
Grandpa l have told you earlier,
jokes after 9:30 am only!

486
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:51,249
lt's no joke! l put my life's
savings into buying it.

487
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,374
But l never asked for a scooter.

488
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:57,124
You go finish your toilet, and
then we'll talk.. more comfortably

489
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,540
What comfortably?

490
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,832
You put your entire savings
into buying me a scooter..

491
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,290
.. without telling me!

492
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,540
How much advance did you pay?

493
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,457
The scooter is outside.
- You paid the entire amount?

494
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,707
You don't get a scooter
for half the price!

495
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,665
Come on sardar, check it out.

496
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,207
Bloody hell.

497
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,707
Why are you being so difficult?

498
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,999
Can't gifts given with love,
be received with love?

499
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,874
Did l ask you for it? - lt's very
modern. Ride it once and see.

500
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,415
Did l ask you for it?

501
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:29,249
Have l only given you things when you
asked for them? Who are you to ask?!

502
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,624
Go to hell!

503
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,749
Target Rs.6,00,000.

504
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:16,374
25000/-. lf 1 computer
is for Rs. 25000/-

505
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:23,665
and 24 PCs quarterly, means 24
computers in three months, monthly,

506
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:28,957
You have 8 PCs to sell and it's
already the 20th of this month.

507
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:34,207
But l started last week on the 1 4th
and l got my target today..

508
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,582
.. so ideally my month starts today?

509
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:41,915
Really? You're learning fast!
Just do what you're told boss,

510
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,832
You're a trainee not
a Managing Director.

511
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,957
Right sir
- That's the spirit

512
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,499
Listen..

513
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,332
On your way drop this quotation off

514
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,540
to Mr. Chaudhary
at National Chemicals.

515
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,874
National Chemicals is
in the wrong direction.

516
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,290
So, did we hire you
to go in the right direction!

517
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,832
Best of luck
for your first client visit.

518
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,499
Stop by a temple for blessings.

519
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,582
Emotions are under control,

520
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,165
My scooter has petrol.

521
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,082
That's all l need.

522
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,457
Good morning sir

523
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,290
Fine.. and the rest?

524
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,915
The rest sir, if you have
any further requirements,

525
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,915
let me know. l'll arrange it.

526
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,749
What's there to arrange?

527
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,915
l'll give you an address,
have it sent there.

528
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,540
Sure sir, do you have another branch?

529
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:33,457
That's a good one.
l do, my sister's house.

530
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,082
How much has been decided?

531
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,915
Whatever is in the quotation.
Plus taxes.

532
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,665
Government gets taxes.
What do we get?

533
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,957
You get the machines sir..

534
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:58,040
Nice sense of humour you have huh?
1 0 percent ok?

535
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,999
Sir please
why are you pulling my leg?

536
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:07,915
No l am not.. are you?

537
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,040
Sir, please don't embarrass me sir

538
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,207
Your attitude is very unprofessional.

539
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,082
Work will be difficult.. for you.

540
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,915
Sir please speak to Nitin directly.
l am leaving.

541
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,957
Leaving without anything?
On an empty stomach?

542
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:44,499
Some tea or coffee. Sardarji?

543
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:05,749
..connecting sir At your service,
Good afternoon..

544
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,457
l will get it sent across.
- Where is Mr. Nitin?

545
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:13,415
Right.. sir, Back so quick.
ls it raining outside?

546
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,582
Where is Mr. Nitin?

547
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,999
lnside the Taj Mahal.

548
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,040
He's already had 4 cold drinks,
waiting for you.

549
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,082
These days
there's a lot of Global warming.

550
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,249
Good afternoon sir

551
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,582
Hello sir

552
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,665
What happened at NCC?

553
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,249
What didn't happen?
Something is terribly wrong there.

554
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,624
Why? What happened?

555
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:43,832
Sir, he asked for a bribe
and to my face.

556
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,582
What are you saying?
- l swear!

557
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,624
So what was your reply?

558
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,415
l didn't say anything at the time,
l carefully tried to explain it.

559
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,832
But on my way out
l saw a complaint box,

560
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,665
l wrote down all the details
and dropped it in,

561
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,749
properly on our company letterhead.
Signature, date.. everything.

562
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,624
Here's a copy.

563
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:21,999
What happened sir?

564
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,290
Aren't you being over smart?

565
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,999
Why, what happened?

566
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,415
You think without authorization
you can use the company letterhead..

567
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,540
.. and make false allegations
against our clients?

568
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:37,165
And get away it? Sir it's a clear
case of company letterhead forgery.

569
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,624
One second boss.

570
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,790
Who do you think you are?

571
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,499
How dare you place allegations
against the General Manager of NCC?

572
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,374
You are barely born
and already trying to fly high?

573
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,624
Sir it was your decision
in the interview. - Shut up Nitin

574
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,499
We can charge him
with fraud to begin with..

575
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,124
Let's consult the lawyers,
there'll be many more charges.

576
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,207
Sir please tell him
to mind his language sir

577
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:11,957
You bastard.. You think you can go
and spoil our relations with clients,

578
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,082
and nothing will happen to you.

579
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:20,207
How dare you speak to our clients
in such a way?

580
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:25,457
You haven't sold one thing yet, but
you talk as if you've sold millions.

581
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:30,499
l'll slap you so hard,
you won't know what hit you.

582
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,832
Quietly complete your training period
and get out of here.

583
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:43,040
One mistake.. One more mistake
and l will throw you out..

584
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,999
Bloody bastard..

585
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,707
Get out!!

586
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,124
Did you have to be so righteous?

587
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,957
You should have quietly gone back
to work, and let them resolve it.

588
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,540
Did you have to become a "hero"?

589
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,374
Did someone tell me when l started,

590
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,832
that the company was corrupt
and l'd have to do all this.

591
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:23,582
Every company is like this, and
you have to do this in every company.

592
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,957
This is common sense
- Leave this job.

593
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:31,374
Leave and do what? l haven't even
finished one month yet.

594
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,040
lt'll look bad on my resume.

595
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:37,999
Hello.. yes l am in office.

596
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:43,957
No, you eat dinner, uh,
l have another get together.

597
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,124
l won't ride the scooter drunk.

598
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:52,374
You've bought me a MlG 29
it might end up crashing!

599
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:54,624
Ok bye

600
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,957
To top it off, this scooter
has tapped into his savings.

601
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,165
Why don't you join a call center?
They'll employ anyone.

602
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,374
l didn't mean it like that!

603
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,624
You will need a relieving certificate
from the previous employer.

604
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,457
Tell them it's your first job.

605
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,499
What have l done?
Why should l lie to anyone?

606
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,665
Should l go beat up Mr. Puri?

607
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,165
That's all that's needed.

608
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,957
You should have made at least
one sale in all these days..

609
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,832
How long has it been
since you joined the job?

610
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,374
Listen to me.. don't worry,
go to office tomorrow.

611
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,207
Your Puri will have
forgotten everything.

612
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,749
Who remembers a trainee
in such a big company

613
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,415
Exactly
- Right?

614
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,999
Watch me, l'll leave
for my field-rounds early tomorrow.

615
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,457
Notice! What happened? Trouble?

616
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:16,957
Did you have a fight with Nitin?

617
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,665
What happened bro?

618
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,124
What happened?
- They're praising you

619
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,874
A lot
- Read it out to him

620
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:25,665
"Mr. Harpreet Singh is henceforth
stopped from visiting any clients..

621
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,832
He will only make cold calls
from his desk..

622
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,790
.. and pass on leads to other
colleagues.. " - Colleagues

623
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,082
They have stopped you
from entering the field.

624
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,749
Your targets have been thrown away.

625
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,082
Not just targets,
your entire career is over.

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,790
Ok people, sales target meeting,
in the conference room.

627
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:46,332
Oh man what now?
There are limits to targets.

628
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:48,082
Let's go drop our pants
and stand in a row.

629
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:49,582
Don't know what's going to happen?

630
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,124
Boss, not you

631
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,582
What will you do if you came?
Yours have already been dropped!

632
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:15,457
What did you do boss?
Beat up a client?

633
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,832
Bloody idiot!! You'll get us killed,
which idiot hired you?

634
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,165
You call my clients,
l'll beat the crap out of you.

635
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,040
You look so normal on the outside,

636
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:01,124
but on the inside you're completely
mad. Why don't you get admitted?

637
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:04,582
Oh anti-corruption branch,
from now on your territory is mine..

638
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,040
.. lf you have any
leads give them to me.

639
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:07,374
l'd give them to you,
if there were any.

640
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:11,124
Look at this idiots' attitude.
Why don't you shut up.

641
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,832
Because of you all our targets have
been doubled. Watch what you say.

642
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,165
Don't come near me. l'll kill you.

643
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,624
No use talking to him. ldiot.

644
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,290
What are you doing?
The Ramayan is on.

645
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:54,332
Ramayan has been on for ten years
now. Has anyone learned anything?

646
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,624
How many times will you watch
the same thing over and over?

647
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,415
You're letting things get to you.

648
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:05,665
This job has stressed you out.
Don't work too hard.

649
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:11,874
You are a hard worker anyway.
Do your co-workers realize this?

650
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:24,374
Jobs today are too stressful.
They make good men into coconuts.

651
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,165
Hello Harpreet

652
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,332

You are not going on field,

00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,665
we'll cut them and give them to taxi.
Nitin said so.

670
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,290
This seat is cursed..

671
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:47,249
Hello sir, A 21 inch monitor

Can you drop me to the station

674
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:30,124
l had an inquiry from your territory,
for 2 PCs

675
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:33,249
Give it to Rajesh,
l have to give it to him anyway.

676
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,707
lf you don't give him one or two
you won't catch malaria.

677
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:40,332
Quietly go get an order.
Tell them after a couple of days.

678
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,124
lf you don't get an order,
you'll get into trouble;

679
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,665
Get an order,
and get into trouble.. or not.

680
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,040
Ok.. Don't take it.

681
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,082
My husband's here, Ok bye

682
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:17,332
So what l'm saying is ma'am that, the
kind of technical expertise we have,

683
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:20,457
the kind of experience we have,
and the kind of service we give,

684
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:21,832
we don't really have any competition.

685
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:25,332
But your company is so big,
so your prices..

686
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,124
Why? Just because the company
is big that doesn't mean,

687
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,790
the prices should be high.

688
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,665
They have to be based
on the customer's pocket,

689
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,124
not the company's.
And that's exactly what we do!

690
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,124
And you want a bet..

691
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,374
That is really impressive..
but.. ummm..

692
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,582
Discount.. ?

693
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:41,124
Ma'am at least place an order first.

694
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,249
Pentium processor
with this graphic card..

695
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,665
Ma'am l'm going to give you
the best price.. - Okay

696
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:59,499
Ma'am we.. uh, we don't sell Pc's
with this graphic card.

697
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:03,665
But no problem,
l'll check with the office.

698
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,415
Boss are you a trainee or something?

699
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,207
No.. but everyone has a boss.
l am sure you do too?

700
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,374
No.

701
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:13,207
He doesn't even know what kind
of product he has, forget it,

702
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,665
those who can't do anything,
become salesmen.

703
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,207
Okay, please find out
from somewhere else.

704
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,624
From where.. ?
- l don't know ma'am

705
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:28,874
Look.. l'm really sorry..

706
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:32,332
For the last two days we're
meeting salesmen after salesmen..

707
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,082
lt's okay
- at least find out for us..

708
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,249
What?

709
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,707
Which company assembles this
configuration with this graphic card?

710
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,332
Ma'am l told you, l don't know.

711
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,165
Noodles?
- Huh?

712
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,040
Maggi noodles.. come eat..

713
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:47,957
please eat.. it's ready..
please eat.

714
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:53,665
Please join us.
Ayesha, come eat. Come on

715
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,624
They are plain glasses.

716
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,582
We started a new business
but no one takes us seriously.

717
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:13,082
Neither parents,
nor clients nor salesmen.

718
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,624
l'll uh.. find out
about your graphic cards

719
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,332
Hello

720
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:02,790
Yes, how can l help?

721
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,540
Sir, do you keep this graphic card?

722
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:12,624
HD 4350.. keep them, l sell them.

723
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:15,082
What's the Price?
- Here it is.

724
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:18,040
What's the price?
- Rs. 4,400

725
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,040
And for two?

726
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,165
Why don't you take it for Rs. 8,000..

727
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,165
..l'll throw in the condiments
for free.

728
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,332
Can't it be less?

729
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:28,040
That is the wholesale rate.
How much will you reduce?

730
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:31,790
With rest of the parts,
you'll have a new PC for Rs. 20,000,

731
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,832
and you'll at least
sell it for Rs. 30,000?

732
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36,082
One can assemble a PC
with this card for Rs. 20,000?

733
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,707
Then? We make one for Rs. 25,000..
want one?

734
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,749
But companies don't sell it
to the customers

735
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,957
for less than 35-40,000 rupees.

736
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:47,165
lf it's made for so little,
why sell it for so much?

737
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:51,790
The thing is, the word customer
has "mer" (die) in it.

738
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,957
Forgive me lord Ganesh.

739
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:59,207
See, if l had an A/C room, a big
store, l would also sell it for more.

740
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,957
This is quite a con!

741
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,749
You're buying two,
who are you conning?

742
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,999
No, l am not conning anyone.

743
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,665
Can l keep this price-list?
l want it for a client.

744
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,749
Keep it. l was going
to recycle it anyway.

745
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,999
And listen, get your
stuff today or tomorrow.

746
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:19,082
Here the world changes like this..
like this.. like this.

747
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,957
There's no guarantee of anything.

748
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,749
l know..

749
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:27,540
Ok.. bye.. that, that will cost you
Rs. 350, do you want it?

750
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,499
Hello, Miss Sherena please..
Hi it's me.. Uh, Harpreet..

751
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,249
You asked me to find
out about the PC's.

752
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:11,415
How are you? Good. We'll supply it

753
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,457
Oh.. okay..

754
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:16,874
Uh.. Rs. 27,500 per PC
with one year guarantee

755
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:20,457
Are you sure? ls there a sale on?

756
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,582
No, uh, because this
is your first order.

757
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:30,874
Ok.. Who should l make the cheque
out to?.. That.. uh- hello

758
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,165
Hello.. ?

759
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,540
Rocket..

760
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,874
Rocket Sales Corporation

761
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,957
Mr. Lalwani?

762
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:10,874
l was about to close.
Do you want the card?

763
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:14,957
Yes, 2 graphic cards, and everything
that goes in for 2 PCs.

764
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,082
Pack everything.

765
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,707
Who are you conning?

766
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:20,999
You. l'll take it on credit.
Payment next week.

767
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:25,040
Do you see that
- "Cash today, credit tomorrow"

768
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:32,582
When you started your business,
how much money did you have?

769
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,665
Someone must have trusted
you and given you credit.

770
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,165
Yes, that was a relative.

771
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:44,374
So consider me your relative too
and keep my scooter as a guarantee.

772
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,207
lt's more valuable
than this purchase.

773
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,249
What kind of business
deal are you making?

774
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,874
Will you give it to me?

775
00:58:54,375 --> 00:59:01,207
Ok go ahead. As it is, l've never
seen a Sardar cheat someone, take it.

776
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,582
But when you get
what you want don't forget me,

777
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,040
you've made me your relative.

778
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:11,624
lf l forget everything, l wont
forget this Mr. Lalwani.. thanks

779
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,290
What are you doing
in office at this hour?

780
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,957
You can barely bring
in orders during the day,

781
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,374
what will happen in the night?

782
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,082
l have some work for me..
l mean you..

783
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,040
You've managed to mess up
work with this company,

784
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,332
now what work do you have?

785
00:59:57,541 --> 01:00:02,749
There's.. Uh.. there's an order

786
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:05,540
Aren't you supposed
to pass your orders to others?

787
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,249
No, l'm not giving
this order to anyone.

788
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,499
Who is the client?
- A friend of mine.

789
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:16,999
You mean it's a personal order,
not the company's?

790
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,707
Profit is also personal.

791
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:31,707
What you seem, you are not.
What you are, l don't know.

792
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,374
Do you have petrol in your scooter?
- Why?

793
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,582
l don't waste fuel on friend's work.

794
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:43,374
lt's a rule, from my engineering
college days. Shall we leave?

795
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,165
Yes
- let's go

796
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,165
What?

797
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,374
Nothing.

798
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,749
ls all this yours or AYS's?

799
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:33,665
Did l ask you if the order
was yours or AYS's

800
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:37,207
See, for 50 years,
government has been encouraging us..

801
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,332
Become entrepreneurs,
become entrepreneurs.

802
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,582
Shouldn't we do something or
will the government do everything?

803
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,207
Did you ever apply
for a government job?

804
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,749
No why?

805
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,749
Nothing, the country was spared.

806
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,957
Does Puri know?

807
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,082
No boss, keep it quiet. Why drop
an ant in an elephant's trunk?

808
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,415
What if he finds out?

809
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,749
Who'll tell him, you?

810
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,582
This is the configuration..
will you get it ready by 1 0am?

811
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:12,957
Why 1 0 am? lt'll be ready by 8 am

812
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,499
When do you sleep?

813
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:15,665
ln office!

814
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,457
Any advance cash?

815
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,165
No, it's ok.

816
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,582
Thanks. Shall l leave?

817
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,874
See you.

818
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,957
Oh, l forgot.. the software.

819
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:29,582
Were you born today?

820
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:33,290
When there's a free copy, why buy it
legally? PC will become expensive..

821
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,874
l'll reduce my profit.

822
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,540
But l won't reduce my fees..

823
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:43,457
lnstead of fees,
l'll share the profit with you.. ok?

824
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:47,207
l don't mind,
but if you use legal software..

825
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:50,790
.. and give me profit sharing,
what will you earn? Peanuts?

826
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:52,290
lt's okay

827
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,582
What?

828
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:06,499
All okay ma'am?

829
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,832
We'll know in time.
l hope your service etc..

830
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,165
See our service.

831
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,582
Well, l hope
l don't have to see it..

832
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:17,790
Of course.. any problems call me,
on my mobile phone..

833
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:19,874
No need to call my office..

834
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:21,707
Why? ls it unavailable?

835
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:26,957
Uh, no. And another thing

836
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:28,249
Yes?

837
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,124
This was my first order.

838
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:37,957
So it's not that 'those who don't
know anything become salesmen'.

839
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,790
Right
- Right

840
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,249
Well, thanks

841
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,957
Well you're most welcome

842
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:56,249
Hurry up.. dinosaurs are
jumping around in my stomach..

843
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,165
l'm coming..

844
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,040
l'm very hungry dadaji,
what's for dinner?

845
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:07,082
Lentils and spicy fried potatoes .

846
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:12,790
Oh forget the lentils, let's order
a pizza.. what do you say?

847
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,874
What's going on?
Have you received a big order?

848
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,207
Don't ask, just tell me..
you want it or not?

849
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:27,415
Yeah sure treat me,
But first let's thank the lord,

850
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,915
you've barely begun
and you are successful.

851
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:37,415
Thank you, God.
My child has worked diligently..

852
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,790
.. and you have blessed him
with success.

853
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:47,082
So please guide him
through a righteous path..

854
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,249
..and protect him from evil.

855
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:56,957
Let his mind be free from deceit
and let his head be held high.

856
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:05,332
"l belong to God,
and God is victorious"

857
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,457
Call for pizza.

858
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,749
No, let's have the lentils instead.

859
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,790
Why? What's happened now?

860
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,457
No let's have the lentils.

861
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,999
What are you doing..
l'm "downloading"

862
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:55,374
l'm confessing everything to Puri.

863
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:58,290
Whatever money l get,
l will return it to him.

864
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:04,165
And l will clear your payment
in time.

865
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:08,165
What?! What's gotten
into you this morning?

866
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,165
Calm down and let me explain.

867
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,374
lf you mention me,
l'll deny everything.

868
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:18,540
ls Mr. Puri free?

869
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,707
He has lunch at the club.

870
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,249
Where's the club?

871
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,082
Our offer is value proposition.

872
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:35,290
See the price, see the quality
and make a decision.

873
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,332
Drink? 2 More please..

874
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,957
come come..

875
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,124
Sit.
- Sorry sir,

876
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,082
l'll come back later.

877
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:06,290
Sit.. sit.. Please sit.

878
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:12,082
Remember him? Your old friend?
Say hello.

879
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,665
Hello
- Hello.

880
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,540
How are your..

881
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,999
.. complaints etc.?

882
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:32,374
Sir, l'll come back later.
- No, sit.. sit..

883
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:36,457
We were just praising you.
Sit.. sit.

884
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,624
Do you know this man?

885
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:53,957
Oh! of course you know..
but you must have thought..

886
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:57,707
ls this the company's
most idiotic employee?

887
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:05,499
No he is. He's an idiot.
Zero! Total zero!

888
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:13,207
But even a zero has value.. we were
talking about value. Ask how? Simple.

889
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:18,457
Just like the value of zero,
he also has value.

890
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,249
ldiot, doesn't have a basic brain.

891
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:28,915
Doesn't know how to talk, nor does
he understand things. A donkey, zero!

892
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,124
But even a zero can be useful sir,

893
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:38,374
if the person who uses
it understands it's value.

894
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:40,749
Put it in the right place,

895
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:45,999
and you can keep putting
it till it becomes of use.

896
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:52,124
Zero is quite amazing.
lt was invented in lndia!

897
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:54,874
Where else?

898
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:04,749
Today this idiot,
this zero was helpful..

899
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:08,999
.. to my company more than
the salesmen.. ask me how?

900
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,499
Him?

901
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:19,249
lt's a fact sir, a fact. You see,
this donkey misbehaved with you.

902
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,957
But he is a donkey,
he will kick you.

903
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:27,290
But because of his "donkey ness",
l found what an opportunity.

904
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,999
Like a 9/1 1 attack on the company.

905
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,374
l decreased the sales commissions,
doubled the targets.

906
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:35,707
And you wont believe it,

907
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:41,582
l'm sitting on the most profitable
quarter of my career.

908
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:43,874
Accountants are in a haze.

909
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:49,665
And all this
because of this big zero.

910
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,040
But what happened
with you was very wrong..

911
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,124
.. we'll ask him
to beg for forgiveness.

912
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,999
Come on say sorry to sir.

913
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:07,749
Say sorry sir, l won't do it again.

914
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,082
Shall l make him do a hand stand?
- please..

915
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,415
Should he.

916
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,374
Sorry

917
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:25,832
Forgive him. He is a small man.
Not our level.

918
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,040
So when should we expect
clearance on our order?

919
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:31,957
lt has gone to the higher ups.
By tomorrow you'll get it.

920
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,957
Just give us good service.

921
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,790
Aren't we giving you
good service now?

922
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:44,124
Let's go confront him.

923
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,082
You did your best, now just quit.

924
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:50,499
Right, you are not meant
to be a salesman. Leave it.

925
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:54,957
l'll leave it, but wherever l go
l'll be the same.

926
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,415
Was it your mistake?
lt's the company's fault.

927
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,832
And if the next company is the same?

928
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,082
And the next one?
- Meaning?

929
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,165
Meaning l always quit boss.

930
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:13,665
You two studied hard
night after night..

931
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,582
..while l played cricket, know why?

932
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,790
Because l'd failed on the inside
from the beginning.

933
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,124
That's why whatever numbers
l earned were enough.

934
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,499
Passing MBA exams is one thing,

935
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:29,374
l failed the moment
l thought of taking them.

936
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,540
l was kidding..

937
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:34,499
No listen.. do you know
why Puri insults me over and over?

938
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:39,832
Because l let him, because
l'm satisfied that l have a job.

939
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:46,207
You know what l just realized,
it's not his fault,

940
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,124
it's mine because l'm taking it.
- You're nice..

941
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:54,874
Nice! Nothing happens
with being nice. Mice are nice.

942
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,249
l had to pay the price
for being nice.

943
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:59,165
The people who are not
so nice should pay the price.

944
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,582
Have a seat.. have a seat

945
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:02,832
lf like every time,
l live with being nice,

946
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,290
it'll be the biggest
mistake of my life.

947
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,040
l'm going to teach
that Puri a lesson.

948
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,999
Forget it,
you were going to quit right?

949
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,957
l was.. but now l won't let go.

950
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,499
l wont let go off the job..

951
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,832
l was interviewed and selected.

952
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,165
l'm suitable for this job.
l haven't done anything wrong.

953
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,749
But if the whole company is wrong,
then..

954
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,999
Company is wrong
but company will be right.

955
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:33,207
l won't do wrong
and l won't leave this job.

956
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,582
So what will you do?

957
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:38,457
l don't know..

958
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:48,124
but whatever l do,
for the rest of his life,

959
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,749
Puri won't call anyone a zero.

960
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:57,249
Whatever happened till
today was a mistake.

961
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,290
But l'll make that mistake big,

962
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:10,332
so big, that AYS will look
like a mistake in front of it.

963
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,749
Calm down,
your career's just started.

964
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,582
Why are you taking such a risk?

965
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,957
Even Spiderman has to take risks,

966
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,915
at least l'm a salesman.

967
01:13:49,749 --> 01:13:53,707
You should use the key, Sakku..

968
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,665
Where were you since yesterday?

969
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:05,373
Did Puri fire you?

970
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,540
No, he offered me beer.

971
01:14:09,124 --> 01:14:11,540
Oh come on, Puri is the king..

972
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:14,040
.. in the computer assembly business
for 20 years.

973
01:14:14,124 --> 01:14:16,332
He has 2,500 clients in his pocket.

974
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:20,332
He's so shrewd, branded
companies steer clear of him,

975
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,957
and you want to compete with him?

976
01:14:28,249 --> 01:14:29,873
There's a big difference
in making a computer for a friend

977
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:32,082
and starting a company.

978
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:33,998
You haven't hatched out
of the egg yet

979
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,415
and you want to be a roast chicken?

980
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:37,415
What do you know about making a PC?

981
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:39,873
You know, that's enough.

982
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:45,040
Fifty-fifty, every order,
every month

983
01:14:53,624 --> 01:14:54,998
Lift. Lift.

984
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:32,582
Congrats.. put a sexy girl's photo
on that, it'll attract clients..

985
01:15:34,874 --> 01:15:36,082
Sorry

986
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,957
These are A4 sheets, right?

987
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,373
What's their price?

988
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,540
Why?

989
01:15:47,624 --> 01:15:49,498
How much does
the printer cartridge cost?

990
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:52,332
You want one?
l'll give them to you..

991
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:53,957
How many?

992
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:58,748
Also the electricity, we are
the only ones using it.. right?

993
01:15:58,874 --> 01:15:59,998
How much will all of this be?

994
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:02,415
Whatever it is, Puri will pay.
What is it to you?

995
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:06,748
All this, printer paper
electricity phone calls ink,

996
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:09,707
l'll return their cost to Puri
one day, with bank interest.

997
01:16:09,874 --> 01:16:13,540
Why? He wants to ruin your career
and you're looking out for him!

998
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:16,332
Not him, l'm looking out for us..

999
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:18,498
There has to be some difference..

1000
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:19,707
..between AYS and
Rocket Sales Corporation.

1001
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:23,248
Yes l can see the difference..
while he's making a profit,

1002
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,332
on our first day,
we're talking about losses.

1003
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:38,623
.Make some room..
these are old files..

1004
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:42,790
There's a lot of space on your desk..
Bablu, get more.

1005
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:48,915
Everyone! Please meet Mr. Shah,
our new office manager..

1006
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,582

1007
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,332
and over there accounts..

1008
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,998
Narayan

01:16:56,083 --> 01:17:00,165
Nitin.. Nitin.. one minute.

01:17:02,874 --> 01:17:06,290
This manager, meaning new..

1011
01:17:06,374 --> 01:17:07,790
Yes, so?

1012
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:14,707
Ohh.. happens.. let it go.

1013
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:16,915
But you said,
Puri sir was giving me..

1014
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:21,123
So? lf someday that "cup-plate"
wants to be the MD..

1015
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,123
..will we make him one?

1016
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:29,582
There is a system! Not everyone
is suited for every post.

1017
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:32,123
There's ability.. - But Nitin,
l am handling all the work,

1018
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,415
and that ability..

1019
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:38,123
ls that ability? The ability
that you have, is it less?

1020
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:44,582
You should stay
where we can see you looking pretty.

1021
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:49,123
You increase sales by 2-4%
when clients come in.

1022
01:17:56,499 --> 01:18:00,082
Now, l'm a little busy.. ok?

1023
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:17,873
Koena..

1024
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,832
One minute
- What?

1025
01:18:22,499 --> 01:18:24,373
No, not here
- What is it?

1026
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,248
The next time l'll slap you,
there are times for pranks.

1027
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,790
l am not joking
- Neither am l.. now leave.

1028
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:33,790
What's your problem?

1029
01:18:33,874 --> 01:18:36,623
Why don't you do your work,
instead of talking nonsense.

1030
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:40,498
Will you be our office
manager Koena? Join us.

1031
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,540
Join what? First get out of here..
have you lost your brains.

1032
01:18:44,749 --> 01:18:47,873
Haven't you had enough of a beating,
that now you're looking for more?!

1033
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:50,790
lf anyone inside hears of this,
they'll make mince meat out of you

1034
01:18:50,874 --> 01:18:52,665
and distribute it to
all the companies.

1035
01:18:52,749 --> 01:18:54,415
Will you join us? Yes or no?

1036
01:18:54,499 --> 01:18:55,582
Why are you doing this?

1037
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:59,498
Because, we work in an office
where no one sees our potential.

1038
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,582
And things that are the most useless,

1039
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:04,082
things that are most unrelated,
they notice the most.

1040
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:07,582
And we have become
only one thing- me a joker Sardar..

1041
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,498
..and you an "item girl".

1042
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:28,123
Have you lost your mind?
You told Koena everything! - Relax

1043
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,207
Why relax?!
She will tell Puri everything,

1044
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:33,790
then we'll be kicked out and then we
can relax for the rest of our lives.

1045
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,248
No she wont, she's not the type.

1046
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,915
Why won't she talk?
How do you know how people are?

1047
01:19:38,124 --> 01:19:40,915
ln this company,
everyone is a master of politics.

1048
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,415
They'll sell your underwear..

1049
01:19:42,499 --> 01:19:43,665
..and you'll keep saying
"thank you thank you".

1050
01:19:43,749 --> 01:19:44,873
She won't tell anyone.

1051
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:46,665
Why wouldn't she?
ls she related to you?

1052
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:48,290
Koena is not that way.

1053
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:51,332
Don't fall into her trap.
She's married.

1054
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,415
Ok, listen to me, do you trust me?

1055
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,332
Until now l did, now l don't.

1056
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:59,457
You do, l trust Koena
in the same way.

1057
01:19:59,749 --> 01:20:01,790
Now please don't open your mouth
for two minutes.

1058
01:20:03,124 --> 01:20:04,332
Don't open your mouth..

1059
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,248
Come in partner
- Oh god!!

1060
01:20:08,874 --> 01:20:10,707
Welcome to Rocket Sales Corporation.

1061
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:14,290
From today, everything our company
earns will have three shares..

1062
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:15,457
Yours, mine and Koena's.

1063
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:20,040
l see, until morning it was 50-50,
by afternoon it's 33-33.

1064
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,415
This is how you do business.

1065
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:23,790
You talk about expanding
and you keep cutting shares.

1066
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:26,040
ls this how you'll expand?!

1067
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:29,790
Koena will help us expand. Because
of her we'll be able to get business.

1068
01:20:29,874 --> 01:20:31,498
How? On the phone?

1069
01:20:34,374 --> 01:20:35,957
Correct.
- What if something goes wrong?

1070
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:38,457
Nothing will go wrong partner.
l am with you.

1071
01:20:38,874 --> 01:20:41,415
Don't be so frustrated
that you get castrated!

1072
01:20:43,249 --> 01:20:45,082
Harpreet, what if
something goes wrong?

1073
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:46,957
What could be more wrong
than what's happening here..

1074
01:20:47,999 --> 01:20:49,373
Maybe we'll do something right!

1075
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,248
Ok l better run..

1076
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,248
Good idea?

1077
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,623
Giri l have a request for you..

1078
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:00,998
Tell me..

1079
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:03,373
lf you ever look at Koena
in that way..

1080
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,748
How?

1081
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,707
The way you look at your web sites,

1082
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:11,165
l'll kill you man.. seriously!

1083
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,540
Look down.. double A

1084
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:28,998
We will soon need an office, or
at least a conference room, for sure.

1085
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:52,998
Tell me quickly,
office is about to close.

1086
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:56,665
My husband will be here any minute.
What's so funny?

1087
01:21:56,874 --> 01:21:59,123
You spend all day long glued
to those photographs,

1088
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:01,540
rest of us have to live
with human beings.

1089
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,832
Ok listen.

1090
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:08,915
From today no Rocket Sales Corporation
work will be discussed in AYS.

1091
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,332
l think it's too risky.

1092
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:16,665
Hmm.. here's a list
of "dead" clients.

1093
01:22:16,874 --> 01:22:18,040
Thanks

1094
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:23,873
They left because of
AYS's bad service.

1095
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:25,082
3 were Nitin's clients.

1096
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:28,165
2 vibha's 2 Rajesh's,
2 Rumaan's and 3 Taxi's..

1097
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:33,540
They've been sold PC's..
so they'll need good service. Right?

1098
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:34,957
Yes

1099
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:39,290
We'll offer them service
for half the price.

1100
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:41,790
How much is AYS's
service contract for?

1101
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,540
lt's whatever price
they can sell for.

1102
01:22:43,624 --> 01:22:47,123
Meaning.. 4-5,000 for one year,
for one PC.

1103
01:22:48,749 --> 01:22:52,665
We'll offer for 2,500..
plus 1 month's extra service free.

1104
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:55,957
lt's a good idea,
but who'll service them?

1105
01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:01,540
l can't, l have work
in the office all day.

1106
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:04,415
ln daytime.. you can service them
in the night.

1107
01:23:04,749 --> 01:23:06,082
You don't sleep anyhow.

1108
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:09,248
The idea is good.
But l haven't heard it before.

1109
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:11,123
That's why it's good.

1110
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:14,040
Maintenance and repair
will be done in the night,

1111
01:23:14,124 --> 01:23:16,665
clients will never get
an opportunity to see a bad PC.

1112
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:19,082
What if a client recognizes me?

1113
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:22,582
No one will recognize me.

1114
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,832
Until now,
even l didn't recognize you.

1115
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,873
Me neither

1116
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:30,332
Do you know, he keeps an account
of everything from AYS.

1117
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,790
Seriously?
- Yeah.. and one day he said..

1118
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:36,582
.. "we'll pay back everything
we've used from the office!"

1119
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:39,540
l hope he doesn't keep accounts
of your downloads,

1120
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,332
you'll have to sell your house.

1121
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:44,998
Yello..
- Hello sir, it's Harpreet.

1122
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,165
What now?

1123
01:23:46,249 --> 01:23:50,998
Uh.. Nothing sir, l have a fever.
lf l get day a off..

1124
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:55,290
Oh, His Highness can't make it
to work!

1125
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:57,040
The company will have to shut down.

1126
01:23:57,124 --> 01:23:59,082
All the work was happening
because of you.

1127
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:01,457
Teaching me what happens
during notice period!

1128
01:24:02,416 --> 01:24:03,832
Where are you going
for an interview?

1129
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,040
No sir, l really have a fever.

1130
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,332
Yes everyone has it
during notice period.

1131
01:24:08,874 --> 01:24:10,790
Do what you want,
don't waste my time.

1132
01:24:13,999 --> 01:24:16,290
Good morning.. Good morning sir,

1133
01:24:20,374 --> 01:24:21,457
Good Morning sir
l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi..

1134
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:23,248
from Rocket Sales Corporation.

1135
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:27,040
Hello sir.. l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi
from Rocket Sales Corporation.

1136
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,623
l'm Harpreet Singh Bedi
from Rocket Sales Corporation.

1137
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,498
Come in..

1138
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:48,915
Hello sir, l am Harpreet Singh
from Rocket Sales Corporation.. sir..

1139
01:24:51,374 --> 01:24:55,498
Oh meaning you provide services
at night and during holidays?

1140
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:57,707
Yes sir at night, during holidays,

1141
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:00,873
Diwali, Dusshehra, Eid, New Year..
Any day. Any time.

1142
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:04,207
One phone call and zero down time
for any PCs we sell.

1143
01:25:04,374 --> 01:25:06,873
Otherwise don't pay us,
we'll pay you double the

1144
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:08,707
service contract amount.

1145
01:25:08,874 --> 01:25:10,748
This is the unique
Rocket Sales Corporation 24 hour

1146
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:13,290
guarantee, only for this
month's customers sir.

1147
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,623
Can you give it in writing? Signed?

1148
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,248
l have seen many companies before..

1149
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:29,873
..but have never seen this
much confidence.

1150
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:33,373
Do you have money to refund?

1151
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:38,498
That will never happen sir, but
if l need to, l'll sell my scooter.

1152
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,665
l called "your"
Mr. Wajahat's contact..

1153
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:16,832
his friend said to come
by after 7 pm.

1154
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:20,623
He's not free before that,
neither are we free!

1155
01:26:23,749 --> 01:26:25,540
AYS.. Good afternoon..

1156
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:30,915
Mr. Wajahat recommended you highly.

1157
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:37,165
That's all ok, however, aren't you
a small company for such a big order?

1158
01:26:37,249 --> 01:26:40,082
lt's a small company sir..
That's why we are hungry.

1159
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:44,248
We know and you know that
you don't need us but we need you.

1160
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:47,665
And if we both know,
then there's no chance of mistakes.

1161
01:26:47,874 --> 01:26:51,165
lf something goes wrong, how will
you return double the amount?

1162
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,332
Ok, l'll do a double contract
with you sir.

1163
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,165
Every month,
l'll give you the right to

1164
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,332
the payments Mr. Wajahat
makes to us.

1165
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,373
lf you're happy with us
then you can transfer the payment,

1166
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:07,165
otherwise your company can keep it.

1167
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:11,040
You are taking a big risk

1168
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:14,665
Even Spiderman has to take risks.
At least l'm a salesman.

1169
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:19,290
very well.. 30 PCs, single order..

1170
01:27:22,874 --> 01:27:24,373
You can fill out the amount.

1171
01:27:25,624 --> 01:27:30,373
l'll say it again..
Only honesty works with me.

1172
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:33,790
That's the only thing l have sir..
Nothing else.

1173
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,707
How long will 30 PC's take?

1174
01:27:35,874 --> 01:27:38,832
30, is too many.
lt'll take at least 20 days.

1175
01:27:39,874 --> 01:27:41,873
We have to deliver in a week.
- What?!!

1176
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,165
l said yes to them.
- What?!!

1177
01:27:43,249 --> 01:27:46,873
Don't you know any other word?
He said yes!

1178
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:51,207
l told them a week..
we can't fall behind.

1179
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:57,582
We'll need another person..
who can assemble a PC.

1180
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,915
l knew that..
- Do you know anyone?

1181
01:28:05,874 --> 01:28:08,498
Of all the trustworthy people,
there's only one..

1182
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:11,040
who can assemble a PC quickly..

1183
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:12,748
Who?
- Chotelal..

1184
01:28:14,124 --> 01:28:15,873
But he doesn't even know
how to work on one.

1185
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,165
He knows how to assemble one..
He can do it in his sleep!

1186
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:22,207
lf that's the case then,
it's time we

1187
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:24,415
get another partner
into Rocket Sales Corporation.

1188
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:27,957
Are you crazy..
You'll make a peon a partner?

1189
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,123
Why not? lf someone can do
the work of a director..

1190
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,623
.. then why can't they be
a director?

1191
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,748
l knew something would go wrong.

1192
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:36,082
lf you already knew everything
then why did you join the company?

1193
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:38,415
l didn't know it would go so wrong!

1194
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:44,915
Me? Partner in a company?
No it can't be

1195
01:28:45,249 --> 01:28:48,665
Why not.. Can you assemble a PC?
- Yes

1196
01:28:48,874 --> 01:28:50,873
Then you can be a partner
in this company.

1197
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,582
But.. my job is to make tea.

1198
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:55,915
lf you miss it so much
then you can make tea as well.

1199
01:28:55,999 --> 01:29:00,207
Then it's fine..
Will l need to speak in English?

1200
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,207
No.. You don't need to speak
to anyone about anything.

1201
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:06,457
Just assemble PC's with Giri.
Say ok?

1202
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:10,873
Yes. Does it involve going to jail?

1203
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,873
We are running a business,
why will we go to jail?

1204
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,832
The big businessmen always
go to jail.

1205
01:29:14,874 --> 01:29:16,707
lt's not that big a business!

1206
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:21,040
What if Mr. Puri gets to know?

1207
01:29:21,124 --> 01:29:24,290
Who'll tell him?
Only the four of us know about this..

1208
01:29:27,124 --> 01:29:32,540
Sir, l could never have received
such respect anywhere.

1209
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,290
The day you called me Mr. Mishra,

1210
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:40,748
instead of Chotelal,
is the day you made me feel big.

1211
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:43,873
Good, good.. that means you don't
want a share in the company?

1212
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,373
No, when did l say that?

1213
01:29:57,874 --> 01:29:59,082
Partner..

1214
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:03,165
l said Partner..

1215
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:05,707
Are you tired?

1216
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:09,165
You are doing it, right?
- l am, but you are not.

1217
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:11,873
You are also a partner,
you will also get a share.

1218
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:14,873
You bastard..

1219
01:30:15,124 --> 01:30:16,457
Do it.. do it

1220
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:35,207
Good morning AYS..

01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:38,082
Good morning partner

Oh Cup-plate!
What's going on? Where's my coffee?

1223
01:30:51,916 --> 01:30:53,832
Yes sir, l'll pass on your message.

1224
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:58,040
Good afternoon AYS, can l help you..
connecting sir.

1225
01:30:58,416 --> 01:31:00,707
Good afternoon..
yes one minute sir connecting..

1226
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:07,998
Yello! Rocket Who?
Rocket Sales Corporation?

1227
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:10,540
l think you have the wrong number.

1228
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:15,332
Yeah right, the number is right
but this is AYS computers.

1229
01:31:15,874 --> 01:31:17,665
Good afternoon.. Can l help you?

1230
01:31:17,749 --> 01:31:21,040
Yes Rumaan.. What is to you
if l didn't say AYS?

1231
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:24,040
Who do you want to speak to?
One minute.

1232
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:26,915
Good afternoon.. Wrong number.

1233
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,873
Too many wrong numbers these days?
- What?

1234
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:34,207
You just put one through.
Rocket Sales Corporation?

1235
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:44,040
The credit card collectors
make up any name to get through.

1236
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,040
Yes.

1237
01:31:47,499 --> 01:31:49,707
And you would definitely
transfer them now..

1238
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:04,957
l want to speak to everyone
right now.

1239
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:10,540
Now.. no it can't wait till evening.
No right now. Didn't l say now!

1240
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:34,498
l don't know how it reached Nitin.
Must have been in a hurry..

1241
01:32:41,499 --> 01:32:45,665
There must be some way our clients
can call us and we don't get caught.

1242
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:59,790
Umm.. there are 2 connections
that were bought but never used.

1243
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:02,707
Mr. Puri probably doesn't remember.

1244
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:07,748
lf those numbers are used,
we may not have a problem.

1245
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:10,873
lf it flashes on the board,
l'll know.

1246
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:15,123
Fantastic! - lf you ever cheat
on your husband, he's had it.

1247
01:33:15,499 --> 01:33:17,248
Will our phone bills be separate?

1248
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,498
l'll have to write it
down in the accounts.

1249
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:21,248
He's started again.. - l have to
run.. Someone might get suspicious.

1250
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:23,123
Me too.

1251
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:39,998
Are you coming?
- No no you carry on..

1252
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,665
Ok.. l'll see you tomorrow.

1258
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:00,665
Take your time
but what will you drink?

1259
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,123
Uh, juice..

1260
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:04,290
Juice? What's happened to you?

1261
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:06,415
Sai..
- Yeah.. what happened?

1262
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:13,373

Oh-.. HP meet Sherena..

1264
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:17,665

How are you?

1271
01:34:41,124 --> 01:34:42,415
What?!

1272
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:44,832
Nothing..

1273
01:34:46,374 --> 01:34:47,665
Huh?!

1274
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:49,915
Forget it.. Nothing!

1275
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:52,998
What?!

1276
01:34:53,749 --> 01:34:55,373
Shall we go in?

1277
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:57,748
Juice?

1278
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:00,457
No.. no.. inside!
lnside. Shall we go in?

1279
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:02,415
Ok

1280
01:35:02,624 --> 01:35:03,832
Oh so you know Appy?

1281
01:35:03,874 --> 01:35:06,040
Yeah, how do you know her?

1282
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:07,832
College.. and you?

1283
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:11,915
School.. hostel.. you know,
l never thanked you..

1284
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:14,457
you sold those computers
to us at such a low price,

1285
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,540
it really helped us you know.

1286
01:35:16,999 --> 01:35:19,873
Setting up a new business
is quite difficult.

1287
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,457
Well you're welcome..

1288
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:24,123
By the way, how's your business?

1289
01:35:24,499 --> 01:35:25,832
Planning to close it down.

1290
01:35:25,874 --> 01:35:26,957
Why?

1291
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:30,582
Life is not as easy as
it seems in college.

1292
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:33,915
Salaries for 2, rent,
electricity bills,

1293
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:37,582
and clients don't even take
phone calls from new companies.

1294
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:45,582
Anyway, they say it takes 2 to 3
years to set up a new business,

1295
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:47,707
unless you are doing something wrong.

1296
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,248
Anyway how's it going with you?

1297
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,415
Uh, okay.. l mean ok-ok

1298
01:35:52,499 --> 01:35:53,748
ls your training period over?

1299
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:55,998
Yes, it was over then.
- When?

1300
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:57,998
Then.. after your order.

1301
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:00,498
lt was not that big an order ok.

1302
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:01,790
You've no idea how big it was.

1303
01:36:01,874 --> 01:36:02,915
Meaning?

1304
01:36:02,999 --> 01:36:05,707
l'll tell you some other time.
- No, tell me now.

1305
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:07,123
No, some other time.

1306
01:36:08,249 --> 01:36:09,873
You know, you're really nice..

1307
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:12,165
other wise salesmen
can be really pushy.

1308
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,665
l feel l can really talk to you..

1309
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,290
Right..

1310
01:36:19,749 --> 01:36:22,165
Hey do you want catch a film..
Sunday?

1311
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:24,540
l mean, if it's okay with you..

1312
01:36:24,624 --> 01:36:26,790
l don't want to sound like
a pushy salesman and all

1313
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:29,498
No no, actually.. you're my client..
l'm sorry.. l shouldn't

1314
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,665
Why? Don't clients watch films?

1315
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:33,082
No, of course they do

1316
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:50,498
7 PCs were assembled in 2 days..
target is 30 PCs. We are going slow.

1317
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:53,665
We are trying.. You refuse
to buy parts from another place.

1318
01:36:53,749 --> 01:36:56,665
"Your" Lalwani Electronics
is a very small supplier.

1319
01:36:56,874 --> 01:36:59,040
lf you want to increase work
leave him.

1320
01:36:59,624 --> 01:37:01,332
l won't leave him Giri.

1321
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:04,457
When l didn't have money,
he gave me credit.

1322
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:07,165
And today when l have a big order,
l should leave him?

1323
01:37:07,374 --> 01:37:08,623
Business doesn't run like this.

1324
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:10,873
You're the only one who understands,
your way of running a business.

1325
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:12,748
Why are you trying to be
a "saint" in a "jungle"?

1326
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:14,873
You'll be ruined
and you'll ruin us as well.

1327
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:17,540
Eat a sandwich,
nothing will go wrong. Trust me.

1328
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,373
ldli(Steamed cakes)

1329
01:37:19,874 --> 01:37:21,623
l didn't order any, who did?

1330
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,623
Maybe the guy on the other table.
- Correct..

1331
01:37:28,874 --> 01:37:30,332
l suspected something the moment..

1332
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:32,748
.. this kid started acting
like a smart alec..

1333
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:35,040
And that phone call..

1334
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:38,665
Where's the complaint box?

1335
01:37:39,249 --> 01:37:41,582
l have a complaint about corruption.

1336
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,498
Forget it.. lets make a phone call..

1337
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:46,665
Everyone will have Mr. Puri's
number on their cell phone..

1338
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:48,790
Whose shall l use?

1339
01:37:48,874 --> 01:37:52,707
Look, say the word, we'll make
a quiet arrangement between us.

1340
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:53,873
What do you say?

1341
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:55,998
lf l say something
then you'll say l talk a lot.

1342
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:02,457
And for not talking,
it'll cost you.. a lot.

1343
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:06,207
How much?
- 1 0%, of every sale.

1344
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:11,207
Look, if you want a share
in our company..

1345
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:13,748
.. then like all the partners,
you'll have to work for it.

1346
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,415
Ok kid.. time to wake up,
Good morning.

1347
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:21,873
From now on, the situation is such
that you can't dictate terms to me.

1348
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:24,623
But l can dictate any terms l want.

1349
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:28,582
No, we can also dictate terms
and the terms are these..

1350
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:32,998
lf you ever put
on this shameless smirk then,

1351
01:38:33,249 --> 01:38:34,832
those bogus conveyance vouchers..

1352
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,707
..that you have me fill out
for the last two years,

1353
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:38,957
l'll decorate them on a plate
and serve them to..

1354
01:38:39,041 --> 01:38:41,082
.. Mr. Puri along
with his morning coffee,.

1355
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:47,290
And.. if you call me
"cup-plate" one more time..

1356
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,415
then if this company
remains or doesn't,

1357
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:52,415
my share remains or doesn't,

1358
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:57,790
l will take this very idli
and shove it down your throat!

1359
01:38:57,874 --> 01:39:01,290
Thanking you, yours faithfully,
Mr. Chotelal Mishra.

1360
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,832
ln front of Rocket Sales
Corporation's partners,

1361
01:39:06,249 --> 01:39:10,123
l repeat my offer once again..
Work with us,

1362
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:12,498
and share the profits equally
with the other partners.

1363
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:15,373
Now there are five of us,
so each one will get 20% .

1364
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:17,665
Besides we needed another person
in sales.

1365
01:39:17,749 --> 01:39:19,873
Why should we give this snake
an equal share?

1366
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:21,790
Because he's an experienced
salesman Giri..

1367
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:28,040
He'll bring in so many orders that
20% won't seem a lot. Right partner?

1368
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,457
Welcome to Rocket Sales

1369
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,748
Number 1 . We never lie to a client.
- Even if we lose the order?

1370
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:42,040
We can lose the order
but not the client's trust.

1371
01:39:42,124 --> 01:39:45,248
Number 2. We believe
in service more than sales.

1372
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:47,415
Because the company that
provides service, sells more.

1373
01:39:47,499 --> 01:39:48,665
What are you talking about?

1374
01:39:48,749 --> 01:39:51,082
Number 3. Even if the client asks,
we never offer a bribe.

1375
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,248
Then how do you get an order?

1376
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,582
We don't want such orders.

1377
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:56,582
Number 4. Whatever date we promise..

1378
01:39:56,666 --> 01:40:00,832
on that date, at whatever cost,
we make the delivery.

1379
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:04,998
Number 5. We are always available
for the client day or night

1380
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,415
He'll drive us crazy
with his phone calls.

1381
01:40:06,499 --> 01:40:08,415
That's the rule.
- So what do think?

1382
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:10,498
This is what happens in asylums,

1383
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,915
where patients wear white coats
and become doctors.

1384
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:16,915
So wear a coat.. Best of luck
for your first client meeting.

1385
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:47,957
There's something wrong,
but it feels right

1386
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,123
The sun is finally in sight

1387
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:52,248
There's no time to think

1388
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:54,582
when you're grabbing at a chance

1389
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:56,665
There's something wrong,
but it feels right

1390
01:40:56,749 --> 01:40:58,873
The sun is finally in sight

1391
01:40:58,916 --> 01:41:00,957
There's no time to think

1392
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:03,332
when you're grabbing at a chance

1393
01:41:03,416 --> 01:41:06,873
Turning night into day

1394
01:41:07,124 --> 01:41:11,332
pinned up by stars

1395
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:15,790
Embedding the twilight

1396
01:41:15,874 --> 01:41:20,790
with a hundred moons

1397
01:41:21,124 --> 01:41:27,582
We have no time to offer apologies..

1398
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,457
for now!

1399
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:31,582
There's something wrong,
but everything's right..

1400
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,873
The sun is finally in sight

1401
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,873
There's no time to think

1402
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:38,165
when you're grabbing at a chance

1403
01:41:38,249 --> 01:41:40,248
There's something wrong,
but it feels right

1404
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,457
The sun is finally in sight

1405
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,623
There's no time to think

1406
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:47,415
when you're grabbing at a chance

1407
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:55,040
Holding our breath forever

1408
01:41:56,749 --> 01:42:03,248
We were searching
for something true

1409
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:13,207
We caught a light..

1410
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:19,748
.. and held on to it

1411
01:42:21,749 --> 01:42:23,915
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1412
01:42:23,999 --> 01:42:26,040
The sun is finally in sight

1413
01:42:26,124 --> 01:42:28,207
There's no time to think

1414
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,540
when you're grabbing at a chance

1415
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:32,623
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1416
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:34,873
The sun is finally in sight

1417
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:36,915
There's no time to think

1418
01:42:36,999 --> 01:42:39,790
when you're grabbing at a chance

1419
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:51,873
Spinning like glistening tops

1420
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:55,998
in a race against sanity

1421
01:42:56,249 --> 01:43:00,332
We travel along untravelled paths

1422
01:43:00,624 --> 01:43:05,290
leaving no trail behind

1423
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:09,998
The faster we run,

1424
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:14,123
The faster we run,
the faster desire catches up

1425
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:17,998
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1426
01:43:18,499 --> 01:43:22,373
The sun is finally in sight

1427
01:43:22,874 --> 01:43:26,540
There's no time to think

1428
01:43:27,249 --> 01:43:31,915
when you're grabbing at a chance

1429
01:43:48,999 --> 01:43:52,873
There's something wrong,
but everything's right

1430
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:57,082
The sun is finally in sight

1431
01:43:57,958 --> 01:44:01,498
M&T's order has also gone
to Rocket Sales Corporation.

1432
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:05,582
And this is not the first order
that was going to be ours..

1433
01:44:05,999 --> 01:44:09,040
.. and ended up with them. Good huh?

1434
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:14,165
And all of you, the so called
"best sales team" has lost out..

1435
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:18,873
.. for the second time in two months,
against this insignificant company.

1436
01:44:19,374 --> 01:44:23,832
What's going on? What does
this Rocket, or whatever it is,

1437
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:26,873
do to whisk away the clients
from right under your..

1438
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:30,582
.. commission filled noses?
Any ideas?

1439
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:38,415
What the shit is happening here?!

1440
01:44:38,749 --> 01:44:42,373
What is this bloody company?
What are they doing?

1441
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:44,082
How much are they bribing that,

1442
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:46,873
at the very last moment
the order ends up with them?

1443
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:49,373
Who can tell me here?

1444
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:55,165
You must have already applied
with them..

1445
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:59,457
Who are these people?
When M&T was giving them the order,

1446
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,332
were you sleeping?
How did your order go to them?

1447
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:04,665
Sir, we don't know a lot but at..

1448
01:45:04,749 --> 01:45:07,248
.. the last moment they offered
the client a terrific scheme.

1449
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:10,332
What scheme? Which scheme?

1450
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:14,332
This is lndia,
when did orders come from schemes?

1451
01:45:14,499 --> 01:45:18,207
Sir, my clients are always giving
examples of their services.

1452
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:19,998
These guys service
computers even at night!

1453
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21,165
What rubbish!

1454
01:45:21,249 --> 01:45:22,623
Sir, they keep their
quotes so low that,

1455
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:24,707
one of my clients called me
a thief to my face.

1456
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:26,332
How low?

1457
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:30,665
Sir the simple PC that we sell
for 32,000 they offer it for..

1458
01:45:30,749 --> 01:45:35,415
.. 26,000 with two years free
service, including nights services.

1459
01:45:37,833 --> 01:45:41,957
So, if they have priced their PC
at this rate it means,

1460
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:46,457
they are only earning 2,200
while we make 6,000.

1461
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:49,082
What are they doing?

1462
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:53,123
Don't know sir..

1463
01:45:58,624 --> 01:45:59,998
Where is their office?

1464
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:12,873
How's it possible that
they are taking away orders..

1465
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:16,415
.. from right under your noses,
and besides this pamphlet..

1466
01:46:16,499 --> 01:46:22,123
.. and phone number,
no one knows anything about them.

1467
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,707
Something is very wrong.

1468
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:32,998
Nitin One week.. get the history..

1469
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:37,415
.. and geography of this
Rocket Sales Corporation! Get out!

1470
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,415
You stay!

1471
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:59,082
The post for
the vice President Sales is vacant.

1472
01:46:59,999 --> 01:47:02,582
l want a very useful person there.

1473
01:47:04,374 --> 01:47:11,248
Show me in a week how useful
you are, and move in.

1474
01:47:12,749 --> 01:47:17,332
Otherwise, leave.
There are other useful people here.

1475
01:47:20,249 --> 01:47:26,082
Growth will not cease,
whether a person stays or leaves.

1476
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:31,332
Enough. l think it's over.

1477
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:34,623
Before Puri catches us,
we should go apologize.

1478
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:37,373
One minute, let me think.
Don't panic,

1479
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,623
Panic? Do you know
what kind of person Puri is?

1480
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:41,207
lf he catches us,
he will ruin our careers.

1481
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:42,873
No other company will hire us.

1482
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,457
No Giri, at the moment,
he's only suspicious.

1483
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:47,207
lf my husband finds out..

1484
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:49,165
lf none of us tell him,
how will he find out?

1485
01:47:49,249 --> 01:47:50,790
Don't under estimate him.

1486
01:47:50,874 --> 01:47:52,957
Didn't you see how quickly
he calculated the profit?

1487
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:55,248
Yeah and all the client bills
have our address printed on them.

1488
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:56,498
So what? lt's just an address.

1489
01:47:56,583 --> 01:47:59,207
Mine.. l told you we should
have used a post box number.

1490
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:01,832
Sure.. those who are not suspicious
also become suspicious.

1491
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:04,873
He will know it eventually,
one of us will tell him.

1492
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:05,998
Who?

1493
01:48:06,083 --> 01:48:07,707
The snake has woken up.

1494
01:48:14,249 --> 01:48:15,873
What happened?

1495
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:22,832
Look boss, whatever happened between
us, please don't take it personally.

1496
01:48:23,333 --> 01:48:25,040
l talk nonsense most of the time,

1497
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:32,665
l had nothing against you.
We are ok boss, right?

1498
01:48:44,999 --> 01:48:48,873
lt's strange, for the first time
in my career people are..

1499
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:53,040
.. scared of me and l am not happy.

1500
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:03,290
When l first started in this
business, l was just like you.

1501
01:49:03,999 --> 01:49:06,290
The first few times,
l also didn't take any bribes.

1502
01:49:08,124 --> 01:49:10,332
But then l lost my first promotion,
soon followed by a second one.

1503
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:13,540
Everyone around me kept receiving
commissions. Eventually, l also..

1504
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:22,165
Thanks to you, after many years
l felt the need to be my own boss.

1505
01:49:24,249 --> 01:49:27,373
But today, Puri put me in my place,
in a minute.

1506
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:33,665
lf you sell out once, everyone
thinks you have sold out, forever..

1507
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:38,832
whether it's your boss or partners.

1508
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:49,165
l will never tell Puri,
l've said what l had to.

1509
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,748
The rest.. you think about it.

1510
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:03,957
Thought about it.. Giri

1511
01:50:04,749 --> 01:50:06,457
Yes
- Move somewhere else for a few days.

1512
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:07,957
But where will we
keep all the stuff?

1513
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:11,248
When the customers call,
someone has to pick up.. Right?

1514
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:13,248
Yes, someone has to do it..

1515
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:18,748
l have a friend
- She knows too?

1516
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:21,998
What kind of a secret is this,
the entire world knows?!

1517
01:50:22,291 --> 01:50:25,748
She doesn't know yet,
but l'll have to tell her someday.

1518
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:32,248
You could also be intelligent,
frankly, l didn't think so..

1519
01:50:32,374 --> 01:50:34,707
Thanks huh..
- very smart.. huh?

1520
01:50:34,874 --> 01:50:36,873
'l will have to ask the company.'

1521
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:40,082
l had taken your order
for the company..

1522
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:42,040
But supplied it yourself instead?

1523
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,498
They were throwing rockets at me!

1524
01:50:44,583 --> 01:50:48,415
Wow! What an excuse..
'they were throwing rockets at me!'

1525
01:50:49,749 --> 01:50:51,623
What would you do in my place?

1526
01:50:51,999 --> 01:50:55,790
lf l were in your place..
your boss would be dead.

1527
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:59,582
What a jerk! Kiss me quickly
before l get angry.

1528
01:51:08,124 --> 01:51:10,123
So, are we on?

1529
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:15,082
Yeah, obviously.
l love you so use me. What can l do..

1530
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:17,082
When do you want to start?

1531
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:21,790
Uh, Actually they
are waiting out side..

1532
01:51:22,416 --> 01:51:24,748
the supplies are in the van,
and the van needs to be returned..

1533
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:27,957
ls the company named after you
or you're named after the company?

1534
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,832
Can't you do things slowly?

1535
01:51:31,374 --> 01:51:32,790

1536
01:51:32,874 --> 01:51:35,790

Rocket Sales here, yup?

1540
01:51:45,958 --> 01:51:47,748
Will you talk to clients like that?

1541
01:51:48,416 --> 01:51:51,873
Just say "Rocket Sales Corporation,
may l help you?"

1542
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:57,373
Oh so what! See how nice this is..
"Rocket Sales, Hi!"

1543
01:51:57,624 --> 01:52:00,082
Clients will think
they've called a slimming center!

1544
01:52:00,291 --> 01:52:01,915
Ok? You want to make it formal?

1545
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:04,540
Ok no problem
- Sure?

1546
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:08,165
What?!

1547
01:52:08,541 --> 01:52:09,623
Nothing..

1548
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:11,665
Then why are you
giving me these stares?

1549
01:52:15,749 --> 01:52:18,623
Well at least we have
a separate number now.

1550
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,873
ln a few days, we will give these
new numbers out to the clients.

1551
01:52:20,958 --> 01:52:23,665
Thank god! l was on pins and needles.

1552
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:26,373
Not bad huh..

1553
01:52:50,374 --> 01:52:52,082
Rocket Sales Corporation,
may l help you?

1554
01:52:52,166 --> 01:52:55,915
Ah.. yes.. yes l want
to order some PCs..

1555
01:52:55,999 --> 01:52:58,290
Transferring sir
- Where is your offi..

1556
01:53:06,166 --> 01:53:09,707
Sherena, take this call.
lt's Puri, speak to him.

1557
01:53:10,291 --> 01:53:12,290
What do l know? Talk about anything..

1558
01:53:13,749 --> 01:53:15,832
Rocket Sales Corporation,
may l help you?

1559
01:53:15,874 --> 01:53:19,915
Ah yes, this is Sunil Puri,
MD of AYS Computers.

1560
01:53:20,166 --> 01:53:22,248
l would like to speak
to your MD please

1561
01:53:22,874 --> 01:53:24,415
Shit!
- Hello.. ?

1562
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:29,373
He is not in office sir.
l will give him your message.

1563
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:33,748
Okay.. ok. By the way,
where exactly is your office?

1564
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:36,082
Second floor sir,
thank you for calling

1565
01:53:47,624 --> 01:53:51,790
For now, it's only a phone call,
next time he'll go for our throat.

1566
01:53:52,874 --> 01:53:56,207
He knows. l'm telling
he knows everything.

1567
01:53:57,166 --> 01:54:03,415
lf he'd known, we wouldn't be here
chatting, we would be in jail.

1568
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:05,498
ln jail?

1569
01:54:05,749 --> 01:54:07,665
lt's not that easy to go to jail.

1570
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:09,707
You can't make a booking
on the internet, and send someone.

1571
01:54:09,791 --> 01:54:10,873
Nothing will happen.

1572
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:12,040
What if he calls again?

1573
01:54:12,124 --> 01:54:13,248
Just say.. the CEO is out sick.

1574
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:14,790
No No, tell him, he's out of town.

1575
01:54:14,874 --> 01:54:17,373
Why town?
Say he's out of the country!

1576
01:54:20,124 --> 01:54:22,082
lf he wants to meet me,
then l'll meet him.

1577
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:24,790
Do you think it's a joke?
Think it's a joke?

1578
01:54:25,624 --> 01:54:29,165
You told me this didn't involve
going to jail.. didn't you?

1579
01:54:29,624 --> 01:54:34,582
You've gotten everyone in a fix..
talking like a big shot.

1580
01:54:34,874 --> 01:54:38,165
Look. He wants to meet the MD
of Rocket Sales Corporation.

1581
01:54:38,666 --> 01:54:40,332
There must be something on his mind.

1582
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:42,248
And until l meet him,
we won't know what it is.

1583
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:45,832
What will we gain by finding out
what's on his mind? Worry about us.

1584
01:54:45,874 --> 01:54:47,582
l am worried about us.

1585
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:51,707
His business is failing,
and he'll do anything to save it.

1586
01:54:52,374 --> 01:54:55,707
Before he does something,
we should know what he'll do.

1587
01:54:56,499 --> 01:54:58,165
But how will you meet him?

1588
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:03,498
The same way Porus met Alexander.

1589
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:09,082
A king meets another king.
Face to face.

1590
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:28,957
Call him.

1591
01:55:32,499 --> 01:55:37,373
Sir, Rocket Sales Corporation's MD
is on the line for you.

1592
01:55:37,749 --> 01:55:40,373
He was bound to call. Transfer it..

1593
01:55:40,458 --> 01:55:42,040
Transferring sir

1594
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:46,790
Ok all set? 1 .. 2..

1595
01:55:46,874 --> 01:55:48,165
You should have counted till 3.

1596
01:55:48,249 --> 01:55:50,123
l wouldn't have stayed alive till 3!

1597
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:53,207
Hello, Mr.
- Singh

1598
01:55:53,291 --> 01:55:57,332
Mr. Singh, thank you for calling
back, this is Sunil Puri here.

1599
01:55:57,624 --> 01:55:59,582
We haven't met but l'm sure
you must have heard my name.

1600
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:01,748
No, not really..

1601
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:05,248
Uh, l'm the MD of AYS Computers

1602
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:09,665
Oh yes, of course of course,
sorry boss, How are you?

1603
01:56:09,749 --> 01:56:13,332
Good, very good, very good..
uh, congratulations boss,

1604
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:17,457
your business is doing well..
very well, for a small company.

1605
01:56:17,999 --> 01:56:19,082
Thank you

1606
01:56:19,166 --> 01:56:20,915
So, what are your future plans?

1607
01:56:21,249 --> 01:56:22,957
The future has all the plans,

1608
01:56:23,083 --> 01:56:26,707
the past has only.. "empty cans"

1609
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:32,832
You have a nice sense of humour.

1610
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:35,040
My sense of honour is not bad either.

1611
01:56:35,124 --> 01:56:39,707
Of course, of course..
so tell me, what are your plans?

1612
01:56:39,916 --> 01:56:41,207
Just keep watching..

1613
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:44,915
l have been watching..
but forget about the present,

1614
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:47,415
and let's look far into the future.
- Meaning?

1615
01:56:47,499 --> 01:56:49,998
Meaning boss.. you know and l know..

1616
01:56:50,249 --> 01:56:53,457
.. that this computer assembly
business is a jungle.

1617
01:56:53,874 --> 01:56:54,915
That it is.

1618
01:56:54,999 --> 01:56:57,082
And since the multinationals
have arrived,

1619
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:58,873
the jungle has only become smaller,

1620
01:56:59,499 --> 01:57:01,873
and in one small jungle
2 lions can't survive.

1621
01:57:03,874 --> 01:57:05,165
Are you leaving this business?

1622
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:10,832
You can joke well..
But can we talk seriously?

1623
01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:15,290
lnstead of competing with each other,
let's work together.

1624
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:16,665
How?

1625
01:57:16,749 --> 01:57:18,665
l'll buy out your company.

1626
01:57:20,249 --> 01:57:21,957
This is what you
call working together?

1627
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:25,957
See, why talk like you're a wet
noodle, when your name is Rocket.

1628
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,707
What's your little company's value?

1629
01:57:30,374 --> 01:57:36,040
value is in the name, sell the name.
30, 40 lakh? 50 lakh?

1630
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:38,915
Ok take 55 lakh and enjoy yourself.

1631
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:41,623
Leave your business
with people with experience.

1632
01:57:42,624 --> 01:57:44,540
Yes, what you're saying is correct.

1633
01:57:48,791 --> 01:57:50,498
Let's work together..

1634
01:57:54,874 --> 01:57:56,623
l'll buy you out.

1635
01:57:58,624 --> 01:58:00,915
You, will buy my company?

1636
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:02,790
Why not..

1637
01:58:03,999 --> 01:58:05,415
You.. you will buy me out?

1638
01:58:05,499 --> 01:58:07,873
Why? Don't you want
to work together anymore?

1639
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:18,165
Look boss, every person has two basic
qualities, to go up and to go down.

1640
01:58:18,874 --> 01:58:23,498
And whichever quality wins will
determine how he'll win life, right?

1641
01:58:24,874 --> 01:58:28,873
Ok take 60 lakh, you won't
get another chance like this.

1642
01:58:29,416 --> 01:58:33,373
Ok, l'll ask my colleagues
and let you know.

1643
01:58:36,749 --> 01:58:38,123
What happened?

1644
01:58:38,624 --> 01:58:43,290
Everyone likes to keep servants,
he may also love and care for them.

1645
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:48,040
But you're the first person l've
met who consults business with them.

1646
01:58:49,333 --> 01:58:51,957
Look, you won't get
this offer a second time.

1647
01:58:52,874 --> 01:58:54,832
l'm giving you
an offer of a lifetime.

1648
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:58,707
Oh, so you sell phone cards as well?

1649
01:59:01,916 --> 01:59:04,540
Look, understand this now.

1650
01:59:05,249 --> 01:59:07,332
You won't be in a position
to understand things later.

1651
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:11,123
Mr. Puri, in business the one
who calls the other first,

1652
01:59:11,208 --> 01:59:12,665
is not in position to threaten.

1653
01:59:12,749 --> 01:59:16,832
Look.. even my father
never spoke to me like this.

1654
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:19,707
For the last time,
sell me the company,

1655
01:59:19,791 --> 01:59:22,665
take the money
or you will regret later!

1656
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:26,123
Ok do one thing..
- What?

1657
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:29,332
Put the phone down, l am very busy.

1658
01:59:29,416 --> 01:59:32,748
Besides you have phone
cards to sell. Right?

1659
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:34,790
Bastard.. l'll see you!

1660
01:59:34,874 --> 01:59:36,832
lf you could see,
you would have seen by now.

1661
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:43,415
What have you done?

1662
01:59:44,083 --> 01:59:45,498
What?

1663
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:52,498
This is our company
not used furniture!

1664
01:59:54,124 --> 01:59:56,082
We are owners, not employees.

1665
01:59:56,708 --> 02:00:02,832
This company is not for sale and no
one can buy it. Whoever it may be!

1666
02:00:04,416 --> 02:00:06,707
We sent you to the lion's den
to negotiate..

1667
02:00:06,791 --> 02:00:08,040
.. and you shoved your hand
down the lion's mouth.

1668
02:00:08,124 --> 02:00:10,082
l wasn't afraid to put my hand
into the lion's pocket,

1669
02:00:10,249 --> 02:00:11,707
then why would l be afraid
to put it into his mouth!

1670
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,582
Look boss,
before Puri goes in deeper..

1671
02:00:13,666 --> 02:00:15,415
..let's take his money and leave.

1672
02:00:15,499 --> 02:00:18,998
You go deeper! lf he buys
the company won't he know,

1673
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:21,207
who he's buying from.

1674
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:24,665
Even if Puri wants the company,
we can't sell it.

1675
02:00:29,249 --> 02:00:31,165
But we can leave his company.

1676
02:00:34,083 --> 02:00:37,873
We have hands, brains,
clients. What else do we need?

1677
02:00:38,624 --> 02:00:42,415
l think it's time to
sacrifice our monthly pay,

1678
02:00:42,499 --> 02:00:44,248
and concentrate
on our business full time.

1679
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:46,248
Besides it's becoming difficult
to manage two jobs!

1680
02:00:50,124 --> 02:00:51,707
l'm okay..

1681
02:00:59,416 --> 02:01:03,123

1682
02:03:46,249 --> 02:03:47,332

1689
02:04:11,666 --> 02:04:13,082

1691
02:04:14,624 --> 02:04:20,665
Right sir, in 2 days we'll have
a new 24 hours helpline. Just 2 days.

1692
02:04:20,749 --> 02:04:26,832
Really? You.. you sell PCs right?

1693
02:04:26,874 --> 02:04:29,665
Not just sell,
we service them as well.

1694
02:04:29,749 --> 02:04:31,832
We build relationships sir,

1695
02:04:31,958 --> 02:04:33,248
We have the best service in lndia.

1696
02:04:33,333 --> 02:04:40,248
Ok.. so how big is your company?
How many people?

1697
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:43,957
We are a small sir,
but very dedicated team sir.

1698
02:04:44,916 --> 02:04:47,290
Sir please meet us
personally some day.

1699
02:04:47,374 --> 02:04:53,998
Yes l really want to meet you,
who is the owner of this company?

1700
02:04:54,833 --> 02:05:01,957
Sir, we are all owners.
We have no employees, only partners.

1701
02:05:03,208 --> 02:05:04,707
Really?

1702
02:05:04,916 --> 02:05:10,207
So sir, when do you want
to meet executives.. personally?

1703
02:05:11,833 --> 02:05:12,998
Right now

1704
02:05:17,499 --> 02:05:22,873
So.. let's meet then.

1705
02:05:31,833 --> 02:05:33,832
What were you thinking?

1706
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:40,790
You "chickens" can fool Sunil Puri..

1707
02:05:43,749 --> 02:05:45,915
.. and that too with this zero brain!

1708
02:05:51,083 --> 02:05:53,665
You were going to become
the vice-President anyway.

1709
02:05:54,291 --> 02:05:58,248
You could have told me everything?
What was the problem?

1710
02:05:58,999 --> 02:06:00,123
You won't understand.

1711
02:06:00,208 --> 02:06:05,498
So explain it to me.. explain it!
l can understand things..

1712
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:08,332
Before l send you to jail,
try and explain it to me.

1713
02:06:08,874 --> 02:06:11,373
Look, everything that's happened..
l started it.

1714
02:06:11,624 --> 02:06:13,415
So whatever you have to say,
speak to me.

1715
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:19,582
Oh so Mr. Zero has
leadership qualities!

1716
02:06:21,083 --> 02:06:29,290
Fine l'll only speak to you.
How long has this been going on?

1717
02:06:30,416 --> 02:06:32,832
And how many orders
have you stolen from here?

1718
02:06:32,874 --> 02:06:35,498
We have not touched
any of your clients.

1719
02:06:35,916 --> 02:06:38,582
And all the facilities that
we've used in your company,

1720
02:06:38,666 --> 02:06:42,332
this is the account, which we
were going to reimburse anyway.

1721
02:06:42,708 --> 02:06:44,082
Here is the cheque.

1722
02:06:58,791 --> 02:07:05,665
You want to give me a cheque! Things
are going to go badly for you..

1723
02:07:13,708 --> 02:07:16,707
and so that others don't
face the same bad fate,

1724
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:21,873
l will have to make it worse for you.

1725
02:08:57,874 --> 02:08:59,082
Take a bath.

1726
02:08:59,166 --> 02:09:00,498
No, it's ok.

1727
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:03,457
Take a bath, maybe
your sins will wash away.

1728
02:09:04,124 --> 02:09:05,957
Mine will never!

1729
02:09:06,041 --> 02:09:09,623
Whatever happens, l'll deal with it.
You don't need to worry about it.

1730
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:11,957
You should have left
the job right away..

1731
02:09:12,208 --> 02:09:16,582
l have looked after you for 21 years,
l would have done it for more..

1732
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:19,707
Why did you have to
do a thief's work?!

1733
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:23,582
You never taught me to how to do
a thief's work, if you'd taught me..

1734
02:09:23,666 --> 02:09:25,623
l wouldn't have
to become a thief today.

1735
02:09:33,083 --> 02:09:35,582
You accept and acknowledge that
after signing this agreement..

1736
02:09:35,666 --> 02:09:38,123
.. the trademark 'Rocket'
and 'Rocket Sales Corporation',

1737
02:09:38,208 --> 02:09:41,707
are now a property of AYS computers
in perpetuity worldwide.

1738
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:46,790
Till you keep to this and the other
commitments in this contract,

1739
02:09:46,874 --> 02:09:50,665
AYS Computers will not file a legal
case to prosecute you for forgery,

1740
02:09:50,749 --> 02:09:53,082
cheating, fraud and embezzlement.

1741
02:09:55,166 --> 02:09:57,207
ln addition, you accept and
acknowledge that you will not..

1742
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:59,665
.. engage in the computer business
formally or informally either as..

1743
02:09:59,749 --> 02:10:03,082
.. a company or as an employee
for a period of three years..

1744
02:10:03,499 --> 02:10:05,082
One sec, what is this rubbish?!

1745
02:10:05,166 --> 02:10:07,165
You want him to sign that
he won't work in the computer sales..

1746
02:10:07,249 --> 02:10:09,748
.. business for three years!
No business, nor a job?

1747
02:10:09,833 --> 02:10:11,623
Yes, that's good, isn't it?

1748
02:10:15,916 --> 02:10:17,707
Let's go, we'll think of something.

1749
02:10:20,791 --> 02:10:21,998
What are you doing? l told you
we'll think of something.

1750
02:10:22,083 --> 02:10:27,082
lt's not just me Sai, there are
4 other people. They trusted me.

1751
02:10:29,583 --> 02:10:31,873
They can, at least,
start their careers again.

1752
02:10:37,333 --> 02:10:38,748
So the Rocket's fallen?

1753
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:48,873
Ok then.. from 4 o' clock today your
Rocket Sales Corporation is mine..

1754
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:52,873
.. and all your clients..
are also mine!

1755
02:10:53,291 --> 02:10:58,165
Congratulations.
You have sold your company!

1756
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:05,915
See, everyone has a quality
to go up and to go down.

1757
02:11:07,374 --> 02:11:10,957
Once l humbly requested you
for this name.

1758
02:11:12,333 --> 02:11:16,123
And today, you're on
your knees like a beggar..

1759
02:11:16,208 --> 02:11:20,373
selling me this very brand name.
What have you learned?

1760
02:11:21,624 --> 02:11:27,873
What have you learned kid?.. that a
man should stay in his place. Right?

1761
02:11:28,708 --> 02:11:30,665
Otherwise the fool will
never belong anywhere.

1762
02:11:34,583 --> 02:11:40,540
You don't have it in you..
You are a zero! Get out!

1763
02:11:43,874 --> 02:11:48,123
Oh.. at least take your
full and final compensation.

1764
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:06,582
Don't ever become a businessman,
you'll fail again!

1765
02:12:21,333 --> 02:12:28,707
Yes sir.. the big news..
is here sir.. yes.

1766
02:12:29,416 --> 02:12:30,707
Now that two big brands have merged,

1767
02:12:30,791 --> 02:12:32,957
the investors will definitely come.

1768
02:12:33,041 --> 02:12:38,165
Let me wrap up
and hide away my dreams

1769
02:12:38,749 --> 02:12:43,873
Let me fold up
and bury my desires deep

1770
02:12:44,749 --> 02:12:49,873
The heart cannot be a slave

1771
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:55,832
Let the wings be touched by a breeze

1772
02:12:56,083 --> 02:13:06,540
Let it soar, let it soar

1773
02:13:07,958 --> 02:13:10,832
Let it feel the breeze,

1774
02:13:10,874 --> 02:13:14,498
let it wake up to possibilities.

1775
02:13:14,874 --> 02:13:17,790
Let the wings be touched by a breeze

1776
02:13:17,874 --> 02:13:20,707
What is this l am hearing boss,
you sold your company?

1777
02:13:20,791 --> 02:13:21,915
Yes sir..

1778
02:13:21,999 --> 02:13:24,165
l didn't think
you were the type Harpreet..

1779
02:13:24,374 --> 02:13:26,290
Are you sure you have
made the right decision?

1780
02:13:26,374 --> 02:13:27,665
Yes sir..

1781
02:13:45,416 --> 02:13:50,748
Like a kite, the heart's spinning
through a million wants

1782
02:13:51,416 --> 02:13:56,998
Let it go, l'll show what
l'm destined for

1783
02:13:57,458 --> 02:14:03,040
Let me fall, l'll dust myself up

1784
02:14:03,249 --> 02:14:07,748
lf you don't fade,
how will you shine

1785
02:14:08,124 --> 02:14:16,540
Let me soar! Let me soar!

1786
02:14:19,833 --> 02:14:22,832
Let it feel the breeze,

1787
02:14:22,874 --> 02:14:26,582
Let it wake up to possibilities.

1788
02:14:26,874 --> 02:14:31,332
Let the wings be touched by a breeze

1789
02:14:31,416 --> 02:14:34,498
Sir my name is Rajess Das,
new Sales Manager of AYS-

1790
02:14:34,583 --> 02:14:36,123
Rocket Sales Corporation..

1791
02:14:36,541 --> 02:14:38,332
As you know Rocket Sales Corporation
is now part of AYS,

1792
02:14:38,416 --> 02:14:40,915
so l dropped by for an introduction.

1793
02:14:41,333 --> 02:14:44,498
Sir, why don't we continue this,
somewhere else.. over lunch?

1794
02:14:44,583 --> 02:14:48,082
Let me soar!

1795
02:14:49,874 --> 02:14:58,873
Let it feel the breeze,

1796
02:14:58,916 --> 02:15:02,207
Let it wake up to possibilities.

1797
02:15:02,874 --> 02:15:08,248
Let the wings be touched by a breeze

1798
02:15:15,249 --> 02:15:16,415
What's going on?

1799
02:15:16,499 --> 02:15:19,040
Nothing sir.. We are meeting
their clients one by one.

1800
02:15:19,416 --> 02:15:21,832
Meetings are ok, but when are you
getting their orders?

1801
02:15:21,874 --> 02:15:24,082
These clients have..
strange expectations sir!

1802
02:15:24,166 --> 02:15:25,665
They ask for all sorts of things..

1803
02:15:25,749 --> 02:15:28,957
These Rocket's clients are used
to some other type of service..

1804
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:30,582
But we'll handle it sir..

1805
02:15:31,791 --> 02:15:33,873
This is Kumar, Giri's replacement.

1806
02:15:34,166 --> 02:15:38,665
Service will happen but help the
sales team! That's the real job.

1807
02:15:38,874 --> 02:15:40,415
Of course sir

1808
02:15:41,749 --> 02:15:43,415
Hi
- Hi..

1809
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:36,540
Sir brands keep coming and going..
But please listen to me sir..

1810
02:17:25,916 --> 02:17:29,665
Sir, Wajahat's order
is not going to come..

1811
02:17:30,874 --> 02:17:35,873
Some of Rocket's other clients
are not looking too hopeful either!

1812
02:18:24,583 --> 02:18:27,582
Sir, we haven't really benefited
from Rocket Corporation's clients.

1813
02:18:28,499 --> 02:18:30,582
We haven't gained anything
from this buy out.

1814
02:18:31,666 --> 02:18:33,665
ln fact,
the liabilities have gone up..

1815
02:18:34,166 --> 02:18:36,332
Salaries of new engineers apart.

1816
02:18:37,999 --> 02:18:42,207
Sir, Rajesh said that
Rocket Sales was about

1817
02:18:42,541 --> 02:18:45,623
to receive a big order
from lnamdar's company.

1818
02:18:46,666 --> 02:18:51,498
lf we get that, then l can
manage the remaining accounts.

1819
02:18:53,333 --> 02:18:55,873
Look lnamdar, you are one of us.

1820
02:18:56,416 --> 02:19:00,790
l need this order.
Whatever has to be done, l'll do it.

1821
02:19:02,583 --> 02:19:03,873
Will you give us service?

1822
02:19:03,958 --> 02:19:07,998
Service is my guarantee,
You've known me for a long time.

1823
02:19:08,499 --> 02:19:10,915
lt's a new team
but the company is the same.

1824
02:19:10,999 --> 02:19:15,498
Yes, the company is the same.
You still don't understand.

1825
02:19:16,124 --> 02:19:18,082
You've bought
Rocket Sales Corporation's name,

1826
02:19:18,166 --> 02:19:24,540
but you've let it's people go..
you've been foolish..

1827
02:19:29,416 --> 02:19:32,707
Look, let bygones be bygones.

1828
02:19:33,999 --> 02:19:38,040
Let's start a new relationship.

1829
02:19:44,791 --> 02:19:47,290
l'm canceling all future orders.

1830
02:19:47,708 --> 02:19:50,665
And as far as l'm aware, rest of
the Rocket Sales' clients have

1831
02:19:50,833 --> 02:19:53,165
either done the same,
or are about to.

1832
02:20:04,333 --> 02:20:06,582
Mr. Puri there was a day
when your ways had changed

1833
02:20:06,666 --> 02:20:08,707
the geography of this business.

1834
02:20:10,041 --> 02:20:14,623
Don't take it badly,
but your way is now history.

1835
02:20:18,208 --> 02:20:19,748
Good Day!

1836
02:21:43,416 --> 02:21:46,457
Who are you.. Who are you!!

1837
02:21:47,583 --> 02:21:49,332
Who are you?!!
- Sir

1838
02:21:49,416 --> 02:21:52,082
What are you made of?

1839
02:21:52,999 --> 02:21:57,207
What is it with which you're
fooling everyone? What is it?

1840
02:22:00,499 --> 02:22:03,123
Who do you think you are
to sell for so little?

1841
02:22:04,166 --> 02:22:07,582
One's back breaks,
but still one doesn't make profit.

1842
02:22:08,458 --> 02:22:11,623
Sold your company.. who won?

1843
02:22:12,249 --> 02:22:14,165
You're on the street!

1844
02:22:16,374 --> 02:22:21,332
l've been selling computers for
1 0 years, 1 0 years before that fax

1845
02:22:21,416 --> 02:22:24,790
and 5 years before that,
electronic typewriters.

1846
02:22:26,583 --> 02:22:29,123
l have this business
running in my blood.

1847
02:22:33,208 --> 02:22:35,248
But l made one mistake..

1848
02:22:36,208 --> 02:22:40,040
The person l should have
made salesman of the year,

1849
02:22:40,958 --> 02:22:43,498
l kicked him out
and made him a competitor.

1850
02:22:45,416 --> 02:22:50,165
No problem, l made a mistake..
l had fun.

1851
02:22:51,416 --> 02:22:53,332
Now l'll straighten it out.

1852
02:22:55,374 --> 02:22:58,665
Come, l'll give you your job back.

1853
02:23:01,874 --> 02:23:06,998
vice-President's position
is still open.. come back.

1854
02:23:17,083 --> 02:23:19,748
You used to tell me that every
person has a quality to go up

1855
02:23:19,833 --> 02:23:22,457
and also to go down. And the road..

1856
02:23:23,999 --> 02:23:27,540
l took the road going down
because you never left me a choice.

1857
02:23:28,708 --> 02:23:31,790
l didn't know anything sir.
But l learnt by doing,

1858
02:23:31,874 --> 02:23:34,457
in business there are no tricks,
no schemes, and no magic.

1859
02:23:34,874 --> 02:23:37,373
Just one thing
- people!

1860
02:23:38,124 --> 02:23:40,373
The one's that work with you,
one's that your customers.

1861
02:23:43,749 --> 02:23:47,248
But you never saw them as people,
you saw them as numbers.

1862
02:23:47,749 --> 02:23:50,707
Who achieved which number,
who broke a target by how much..

1863
02:23:50,791 --> 02:23:54,998
But l never really understood
numbers. l always saw people.

1864
02:23:55,791 --> 02:24:00,457
Who's happy.. Who's sad.. Who does
good work.. Who enjoys what work..

1865
02:24:01,583 --> 02:24:04,832
do you know what the amazing
this is, when people are happy,

1866
02:24:05,124 --> 02:24:06,915
numbers increase on their own.

1867
02:24:09,041 --> 02:24:13,873
Because business is not numbers,
business is people. Only people.

1868
02:24:16,458 --> 02:24:18,790
You took my company.. no problem.

1869
02:24:19,208 --> 02:24:21,957
lt came from your company
and it went back into your company.

1870
02:24:22,041 --> 02:24:25,582
No problem. But what l have learned,
you can't take.

1871
02:24:26,083 --> 02:24:28,873
And with that l can build 1 0 more
companies, and l will one day.

1872
02:24:29,874 --> 02:24:34,582
But what will you do sir?
All that you know has become zero.

1873
02:24:34,958 --> 02:24:37,748
Who will you put
a zero "next" to sir?

1874
02:24:39,874 --> 02:24:42,082
All l wanted was a chance
in your company.

1875
02:24:42,583 --> 02:24:46,457
You didn't give me that..
And the way you're giving it to me..

1876
02:24:47,124 --> 02:24:48,790
l don't want it.

1877
02:24:51,374 --> 02:24:53,123
Wish me best of luck sir.

1878
02:24:55,374 --> 02:25:00,790
l couldn't be like you,
but l became a man.

1879
02:25:05,708 --> 02:25:07,790
l'll see you on the field!

1880
02:25:17,624 --> 02:25:21,207
l have never seen
a bigger zero than you.

1881
02:25:29,874 --> 02:25:32,998
And "it" ended up in such a place
that the company changed.

1882
02:25:33,458 --> 02:25:36,540
And when l removed "it",
the customers changed.

1883
02:25:38,416 --> 02:25:41,082
My people couldn't
handle your customers,

1884
02:25:41,166 --> 02:25:43,582
l have brains to understand that.

1885
02:25:44,833 --> 02:25:50,415
And a young kid has defeated me,
l can accept that too.

1886
02:25:57,958 --> 02:25:59,957
Do you have one rupee?

1887
02:26:01,083 --> 02:26:04,082
Do you have.. one rupee?

1888
02:26:19,541 --> 02:26:22,873
Here, l'm returning your company.

1889
02:26:23,958 --> 02:26:25,623
l couldn't digest it.

1890
02:26:29,666 --> 02:26:31,040
You want me to spell it out..

1891
02:26:31,916 --> 02:26:34,540
You won, l lost.

1892
02:26:40,291 --> 02:26:43,498
When blood and sweat are
printed on paper together,

1893
02:26:45,333 --> 02:26:49,165
table becomes a bed,
and office a home,

1894
02:26:52,041 --> 02:26:56,790
hunger and thirst are forgotten
and children are neglected..

1895
02:26:59,916 --> 02:27:02,207
only then a company is made.

1896
02:27:05,291 --> 02:27:07,457
And that is not given away as alms,

1897
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:10,498
especially not to a man like me.

1898
02:27:13,916 --> 02:27:16,123
And a man like me never takes it.

1899
02:27:18,166 --> 02:27:21,248
l'm leaving you
with your life's biggest lesson.

1900
02:27:22,499 --> 02:27:24,957
And l've never even given
my father anything for free.

1901
02:27:27,874 --> 02:27:29,582
The thing you're doing..

1902
02:27:29,874 --> 02:27:33,165
l don't know if it's business or not

1903
02:27:35,249 --> 02:27:40,082
but never become a businessman,
you'll fail again.

1904
02:27:44,749 --> 02:27:46,582
l'll see you on the field.

1905
02:27:50,041 --> 02:27:51,790
l'll see you on the field

1906
02:29:50,708 --> 02:29:52,790
Giri, the delivery is in 4 days.

1907
02:29:56,749 --> 02:29:59,790
Mr. Mishra can you please
follow up on that delivery

1908
02:29:59,874 --> 02:30:01,623
Yes.. Can l speak
to Mr. Saxena please?

1909
02:30:01,791 --> 02:30:03,498
Yes, l'll hold ma'am..

1910
02:30:03,999 --> 02:30:05,415
Good job Nitin!

1911
02:30:05,791 --> 02:30:07,790
Yes sir.. this is Nitin
from Rocket Sales..

1912
02:30:12,458 --> 02:30:14,123
Hi Rocket Sales Corporation,
yes sir..

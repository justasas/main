00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:34,926
Come on out!

24
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,603
The building's about to collapse.

25
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,903
The building's falling apart.
Get out of there!

26
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,512
What's going on?

27
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,503
What are you doing here, honey?
Come here, honey.

28
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,697
Why? What's going on?

29
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:01,323
Mr. Etesami evacuate the building.
It's collapsing. Hurry up!

30
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:04,939
- Let's go, everyone!
- Rana! Rana!

31
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,318
- What's going on, Emad?
- Come here, Rana! Hurry up!

32

Let's go, man!

00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:20,727
Rana! Hurry up! Come on!

35
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,656

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,997
I'm coming, wait.

40
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,204
Here, here, put this on.

41
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:44,470
- What? Let me come with you.
- No, you can't. Just go down to the alley.

42
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:47,452
- Go tell everyone to go to the alley.
- Mrs. Samimi! Mrs. Samimi!

43
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,326
- Where's Hossein?
- I can't get him out of there.

44
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:01,962
Hossein get up, my boy!
The house is coming down.

45
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,797
Get up, Hossein! Get up!

46
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:09,535
- Emad, come on, everyone's gone.
- Go down to the alley. Go tell everyone.

47
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,372
Mr. Fallah, get everyone down to the alley.

48
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,178

49
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:23,583
- Glasses... my glasses...
- I'll bring your glasses.

51
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,872
Guys!
There's no need to bring all your stuff.

52
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,795
- We've got everything down in our place.
- Okay.

53
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,645
- I can't find it.
- I don't know, just look around.

54
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:15,828
- You want me to take these?
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

55
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,995
I thought you were supposed to just
bring your towel and toothbrushes?

56
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,865
The towel and the brushes are in there too.

57
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,399
- Did you lock the car?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,589
Ah, keys, keys! Gimme the keys.

59
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,091
Here.

60
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:32,427
Guys!

61
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,638
Hey.

62
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,723
Hey, Kati.
Hi.

63
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:37,680
What's up, Kati?

64
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,349
You're alive?

65
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:41,463
The way Sia said the house has collapsed,

66
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,257
I thought we'd have to drag
you from under the ruins.

67
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,234
Oh, whoa! What's going on here?

68
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,986
There's smell of gas...

69
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,445
It's from last night.

70
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:54,491
Well, then, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

71
00:05:59,287 --> 00:05:59,809
Hey.

72
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,871
Why did you come up?

73
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,000
Cut off the electricity,
this is dripping.

74
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:16,514
I can't find the card, man.

75
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:19,599
Well, see if it's between
your documents and stuff.

76
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,269
Kati, dear, don't go
there, it's dangerous.

77
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,397
Oh, my God!

78
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,507
<i>You could only hear the sobbing
of Mashti Hassan's wife,</i>

79
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,740
<i>sitting alone with her lit
lantern on the stable's roof</i>

80
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:37,367
<i>and the desperate moans of a
cow from inside the stable.</i>

81
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:40,368
Sir! Is it a true story?

82
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,311
True? No, but you could say that
in a way, in Saedi's stories

83
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:50,774
the scenery, the type of characters,
and relationships are real. Very real.

84
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,319
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

85
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,050
Try looking in the mirror.

86
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,449
You think you're funny, huh?

87
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:59,493
But seriously, Sir, how does
a person turn into a cow?

88
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,143
Gradually...

89
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,896
Sir, are we gonna watch the
film of this story too?

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,418
Yeah, that's a good idea.

91
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:10,651
Maybe I bring it next time and
we can watch it together.

92
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:11,276
Yes?

93
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,611
Sir, when can we see your play?

94
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,237
The performance begins next week.

95
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:18,618
Once we've had a few days to settle in,
I'll definitely invite you all to come.

96
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:19,889
- Thank you, Sir!
- What's it called, Sir?

97
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,411
"Death of a Salesman",
who's read it?

98
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:22,746
"The enemy"!

99
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:26,456
Jokes aside,
have any of you read it?

100
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,416
Sir, who's the author?

101
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:29,336
Arthur Miller.

102
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:31,129
Hmm... no, I've not.

103
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:32,933
Very good.

104
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,613
Excuse me, boys.

105
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:37,385
Yes?

106
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:39,471
Hello.

107
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:41,556
Yes.

108
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:45,044
Sorry, I can't talk right now,
I'm in class.

109
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,381
If you call back in 10 minutes,
I'll be free.

110
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,151
Yeah, with stick shifts... Silver...

111
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,385
Sure... that's fine.

112
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,822
Sir, what's your role?

113
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:01,159
The Salesman.

114
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,746
- What are you selling, Sir?
- Potatoes!

115
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,686
When you come,
you'll see for yourselves.

116
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,206
What's it's model, Sir?

117
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,762
- What?
- Your Peugeot 206, you know.

118
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,441
- Why do you wanna know?
- Aren't you selling, Sir?

119
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:16,278
Sir, his dad's a parking officer, just
tell him to scrap your fines for you.

120
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,531
Do you even commit driving offenses, Sir?

121
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,721
Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

122
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,099
I didn't hear you.

123
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:27,310
Why do Iranians call BMW's
"Bee-Em-Veh's"?

124
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:30,961
- Get outta here!
- Dude, just zip it!

125
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,776
That's alright.
He doesn't know, so he's asking.

126
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,384
I don't know either.

127
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,722
Guys... eh, for your next session...

128
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:48,853
I want a summary of this story.
I don't want any excuses, like...

129
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:52,607
"I fell asleep, we had guests",
and... stuff like that.

130
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,704
Mister, could you please
scooch over a bit?

131
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:21,740
Sir, can I sit in front and
this young man sits back here?

132
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:51,770
Father...

133
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,772
Somebody in there?

134
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:58,527
No, I think the noise
was from the next door.

135
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,156
- No, no, somebody got in your bathroom!
- No, there's no one there.

136
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:06,032
It's the next room, there's a party.
These kind of noises are normal...

137
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,911
Can I come out?

138
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:12,021
There's something moving
in the bathtub, Willy!

139
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,491
Ah, Miss Francis, you better
go back to your room.

140
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,382
They must be finished painting by now.

141
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,092
But I can't, I've got to get dressed first!

142
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:26,617
Yes, you can, you can! Please!

143
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:30,640
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my next-door neighbor.

144
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:35,376
They were painting her room.
And she asked to come and use the bath.

145
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:40,278
And I said, that's alright.
So, I let her take a shower here.

146
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,444
You can go back to your room now.

147
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,111
But Willy, I don't have any clothes on!

148
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:46,012
Please, get out of here!
Go back to your room.

149
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,577
You promised me stockings, Willy!

150
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:50,641
I have no stockings here!

151
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,477
Why? You had two boxes of size 9s
for me, and I want them, Willy!

152
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:56,585
Alright, take one and go.
For God's sake, will you get outta here!

153
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:58,150
Please!

154
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,296
Go!

155
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,272
I just hope there's nobody in the hall.
I can't go out without any clothes!

156
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:27,365
By the way, are you
football or...

157
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,827
Dammit!

158
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:32,913
Siavash!

159
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,102
What happened, mom?

160
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,927
I do my best to ignore it but he
keeps getting worse every night!

161
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:37,839
Sadra, dear, come
down, let's go!

162
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:39,607
Sanam, dear, just ignore him.

163
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:41,794
He thinks just because I'm playing a
whore, he can do whatever he wants.

164
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:43,173
- What's that got to do with it?

165
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,987
Why don't you laugh at
the others then, huh?

166
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,837
I was laughing at your
clothes, not you...

167
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:48,120
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

168
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,784
Siavash, come here!

169
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,349
Sanam, don't be childish on
this final night. Sanam...

170
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:55,831
- Alright, I'm freaking sorry... I'm sorry.

171
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:59,814
In this cold, rehearsing every night,
with this child. Let's go, honey.

172
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,526
- You just had to fuck it up, didn't you?

173
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,881
- What's that got to do with us?
It's your own husband.

174
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,069
Let me take the k...

175
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,154
Let go!

176
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:10,239
Sanam don't...

177
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:11,658
I said get off!

178
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,325
I was kidding...
I said get off!

179
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,620
I was kidding...

180
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,544
- I was messing with you.
- Where are you going?

181
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:23,917
Comes out of the shower
with a raincoat, and says,

182
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,784
"How can I go out without any clothes?"

183
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,972
I can't, man,
it makes me laugh.

184
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,807
Go after her or she'll get
annoyed and won't come tomorrow.

185
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,957
Don't make me go out without clothes!
I'm shy!

186
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,856
Come on, how can I go out
without any cloth...

187
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:41,729
Sanam!

188
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,358
The guy's totally nuts!

189
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:55,201
Did you find a place?

190
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:59,706
60 sq. Metres, 3rd floor, no elevator.
40 mils in front, 600k tomans per month.

191
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,355
- Where?
- Amiratabak.

192
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:04,483
- What sort of a place are you looking for?
- Something temporary...

193
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,468
If we can't find anywhere,
we have to bring our stuff,

194
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,306
and live right in the middle of the stage.

195
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,469
You free tomorrow afternoon?

196
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:12,721
How come?

197
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,097
I'm taking you somewhere.

198
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:17,496
Come on guys... once more from
the top, no interruptions.

199
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:22,228
You tired?

200
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,314
Nope.

201
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:26,232
Oh, you're here too!

202
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:30,280
Aww kitty! Who's this?

203
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:32,471
Come here, you!

204
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:40,188
He's tame... What's up, kitty?

205
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:47,151
This place is cool!

206
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,203
Babak.

207
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,477
Is that the storage room?

208
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,605
- Which one?
- This.

209
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,670
No! It's the second bedroom.

210
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,672
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

211
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,570
- Isn't it too small?
- It's a two-bedroom!

212
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,655
So it's good?

213
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,928
You're just two people, what do you
need all this space for anyways?

214
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,438
Watch your mouth, "two people"!

215
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,875
Who knows, maybe we end
up being three people...

216
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,352
Rana, is he serious?

217
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,582
No, come on!

218
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,669
- He doesn't look like it.
- Why is that?

219
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,462
Is this door locked?
Is it locked?

220
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,799
The previous tenant's stuff is in there;
They're supposed to be collecting it.

221
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,990
Don't be scared kitty, it's just me.

222
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:03,999
- How long's it been vacant?
- Three weeks.

223
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,552
What are they doing to this city?

224
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,514
I wish we could tear it
all down and start again.

225
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:23,768
They've already destroyed and rebuilt
it, and look how it's turned out...

226
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:25,560
Babak?

227
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:26,020
Yes dear.

228
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,771
God have mercy on us.

229
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,778
When do you think they'll
clear their stuff out?

230
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,178
They promised they'll be
here in the next day or two.

231
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:45,707
There's no parking, you'll have
to leave your car on the street.

232
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,594
We don't need parking anyways.

233
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,082
We're selling our car to pay
your mortgage down payment.

234
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:49,459
Who mentioned money?

235
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,524
Well, either way...

236
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,672
Hello Hello Mr Salimi.

237
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,300
0ne of the good things about this
place are Mr. Shanazari and his wife.

238
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,008
- Hello.
- Hello, how're you doing?

239
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,263
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. How do you do Ma'am?

240
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,496
Babak, which one's the storage?

241
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,581
It's here, come, take a look.

242
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:11,629
- Mr Salimi?
- Yes?

243
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,860
The door's open, take a look.

244
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,242
Please make sure it doesn't
turn out like the last one.

245
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,285
- No, come on, I know these guys.
- You said you knew the last ones too.

246
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,371
Don't worry about it.

247
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,791
- Babak, what do they do?
- They're my friends, they're into arts.

248
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:28,521
I hope so.

249
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:30,001
It's okay for a few months.

250
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:35,340
Just make sure he lets us pay him for it.
No favors.

251
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,010
Looks like we've finally caught a break.

252
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:46,977
Careful, don't rush.

253
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:50,209
You need help, Sir?
- No, you go ahead and bring the rest.

254
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,909
Just be careful not to hit the light bulb.

255
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:06,913
Sorry sir, thanks for the help.

256
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,003
- Are the keys here too?
- They took that one room's with 'em.

257
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:22,658
Where's Ali?

258
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:32,981
Ali...

259
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:33,564
Yep?

260
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,630
For God's sake, leave that alone,
I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

261
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,382
It'll only take a second.

262
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:39,863
Leave it, man!

263
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:44,055
If she'd said, we wouldn't have
hired the truck and the movers.

264
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:50,415
How was I supposed to know? She sounded so
sure that I didn't think she'd bail on us.

265
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,229
So, what's she saying now?

266
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,213
Hasn't answered
ever since this morning.

267
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,340
Why don't you try from a different number?

268
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:01,364
Bring your phone Nana.

269
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:06,765
We really need that room, we've
brought a pickup full our things.

270
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:12,208
Yes.

271
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,023
Okay.

272
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,401
He's here if you like to speak to him,

273
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:25,429
Thanks.

274
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,974
Says, she's said all
she has to say to you.

275
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:30,539
Well, what did she say?

276
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:34,066
She signed the contract on
a new place two days ago,

277
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,362
but the landlord bucked at the last moment,

278
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,924
She's looking for a place, but can't come
for her stuff until she finds somewhere.

279
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:45,178
She said to tell you not to let
anyone touch her stuff. Please.

280
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,768
Oh, yeah, and she doesn't
want to talk to you again.

281
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,375
Any news? What happened?

282
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,857
I don't know, nothing for now.
Let me take it, Kati.

283
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,694
Ali.

284
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,280
- Yes?
- You got a screwdriver in your car?

285
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,582
This is enough stuff for a bride's dowry!

286
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,896
I thought it was just a
few bits and pieces.

287
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,371
Maybe we should leave it...

288
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,150
It's fine, I'll take
responsibility for it.

289
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:21,340
Alright, boys, let's move
those things over there.

290
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:31,516
Rana...

291
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,061
<i>mumbling.</i>

292
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,645
These are people's belongings.

293
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,928
What do you want me to do?
It's been 3 days now.

294
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:40,885
She keeps saying...

295
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,633
"I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow."

296
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:43,486
What if she shows up?

297
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:46,904
Well she should've kept her word then.
Never mind. Come on!

298
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:49,034
Guys, I can't carry anything heavy!

299
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,413
Mr?

300
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,764
Come on, let's eat.

301
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,060
Rana, dear!

302
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:15,810
Yes dear?

303
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,148
Honey... the charger.

304
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:25,258
<i>I'll turn into words, run
through your ears...</i>

305
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,866
<i>I'll turn into thoughts,
stick in your head...</i>

306
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:31,516
<i>I'll be a Benz, race
under your feet...</i>

307
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:35,375
<i>I'll be poverty
in your purse...</i>

308
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,773
<i>I'll be a wolf, raid your Hurd.</i>

309
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,709
You two, go to the door and
bring over one of those boxes.

310
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:24,586
Hi guys.

311
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:26,337
Are these your 206's car parts, Sir?

312
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:26,755
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

313
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:29,509
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

314
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:33,845
Very good guys, I want the
poem memorized for next time.

315
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:33,971
Okay.

316
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:34,764
Okay.

317
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:36,057
Thank you.

318
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,391
Bye, Sir.

319
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:40,478
Bye.

320
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:08,715
- Bye, Sir!
- So, long.

321
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:12,508
Thanks Sir.

322
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,596
Goodbye.

323
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:20,039
- Sir, can I say something?
- What?

324
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:22,020
Sir, I was really pissed off the other day.

325
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:23,313
Which day?

326
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,983
The day that woman
insulted you in the Taxi.

327
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:30,318
Was it an insult?

328
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,614
You know, that she said, she
wants to sit in the front seat.

329
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:39,327
Sir, after you got out of the car, I
told them that you were my teacher.

330
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:42,582
And that we all love you so much.
Like, all the guys.

331
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,335
What was your first name again?

332
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:46,774
Amin.

333
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:53,510
Amin, you can be sure, some guy had done
something to her in a taxi before...

334
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:56,535
to make her think
that way about everyone.

335
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,306
Don't worry about it, it's just the
first 100 years that are tough.

336
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,266
See you.

337
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:01,517
Bye See you.

338
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,227
Bye.

339
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:43,768
Okay.

340
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,087
Of all the time...

341
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,278
I don't know what to do with her.

342
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:54,738
Who?

343
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,656
This woman

344
00:23:56,948 --> 00:23:59,743
I called to ask when she'll
clear her stuff out.

345
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,909
She got angry, started threatening...

346
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,121
Over what?

347
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:07,582
"Why did you touch my personal things?
Those were my private stuff...

348
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,374
I'll sue you.."

349
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:11,607
Last night I was running around, saving her
stuff from the rain, up until morning.

350
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:12,589
Her problem's something else...

351
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:15,404
- Who Babak, the woman?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,656
When's she coming to get her stuff?

353
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,700
Says, whenever she finds a place.

354
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,228
Sadra darling, come here with me.
Hurry up.

355
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:32,317
Hurry up guys, the audience
will be in in five minutes.

356
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:42,659
Emad... Emad, they're coming here
again after the performance.

357
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:47,728
They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions,
there's another three left.

358
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:49,502
If you stay around after the
performance, you can talk to them.

359
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:50,125
Tonight after the performance?

360
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:50,563
Yes.

361
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:52,502
If it helps, I'll stay.

362
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,777
Sure, or else there's a chance they
might cancel the whole show tomorrow.

363
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,298
How many did they say?

364
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:57,176
Three... Guys will you please hurry up!

365
00:24:57,384 --> 00:24:58,093
I'll go, then.

366
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,970
Won't you wait around?

367
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,827
No, you'll be stuck here
until around midnight.

368
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:04,641
Take the car, then.

369
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:06,309
Where are the house keys?

370
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:07,996
In my coat's pocket.

371
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:09,458
Have a good performance.

372
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,355
You too!

373
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,357
Say, on your way back, if
the supermarket's open...

374
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:58,443
buy something, we've got
nothing for breakfast.

375
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:03,218
Yes, I said if it's open. If it's open!

376
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:08,890
Also, pick up some hand sanitizer.

377
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,645
Maybe I take a shower
until you get here.

378
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,794
No not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't
even wiped off my stage makeup.

379
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,843
I'll be out soon... soon.

380
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,659
Yup... love you, bye.

381
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:23,254
Anything else?

382
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:24,299
That's all, thanks.

383
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,467
Be my guest.
Are you paying by card?

384
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:29,054
No, cash.

385
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:42,815
Hello Ma'am.

386
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:43,339
Hello?

387
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:45,818
Good evening, I'm your upstairs neighbor.

388
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,366
We've just moved in, could
you open the door please?

389
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,326
Thank you.

390
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:10,178
Rana?

391
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:13,223
Rana?

392
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:17,519
Rana?

393
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:49,257
Rana!

394
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,425
What happened to you?

395
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:52,093
Please step outside, Sir.

396
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:55,724
You can't be in here, Sir. We'll
call you when for the CT scan.

397
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:57,517
Wait outside, please.

398
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:58,289
Look at me Rana...

399
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:03,940
Everything's fine, I'll call
you for the CT scan... Please.

400
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:10,155
Make sure you change the
locks first thing tomorrow.

401
00:30:11,364 --> 00:30:15,118
Why? Did someone get into the house?

402
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,205
I thought she'd fainted,
was dizzy or...

403
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,747
We don't know what happened yet.

404
00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:22,626
All of a sudden we heard shouting
and screaming from upstairs.

405
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,671
Not like, normal, not once,
scream after scream...

406
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:31,677
I told him go upstairs and check, he said,
couples get into fights all the time.

407
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,588
Then we heard some heavy
bangs in the stairs,

408
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:37,437
I told him "Muhammad, God
knows, something's up."

409
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:38,037
Who was it?

410
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,375
By the time we reached the stairs, we
just saw someone fleeing up the street.

411
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,854
I don't know what happened to his foot,
but it had bled all over the stairs.

412
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:48,714
If I'd caught him, he'd be dead now.

413
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:52,718
Then we went upstairs and found
your wife unconscious...

414
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,746
there was blood all over
the bathroom floor.

415
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,395
I dressed her and brought her here.

416
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:59,702
Never mind that, thank God
something worse didn't happen.

417
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:06,169
Woman, do us a favour, go to the ER, and
check if there's any news or something.

418
00:31:07,587 --> 00:31:11,381
Sorry about putting you
to all this trouble.

419
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,927
Have a seat, sit down, son.

420
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,872
Was anything missing from the house?

421
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:25,230
I don't know.
I didn't notice anything.

422
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:29,234
I don't think it was a robbery. What
would a thief be doing in the bathroom?

423
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,026
Then who was it?

424
00:31:32,028 --> 00:31:34,362
The guy was one of
that woman's customers.

425
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:35,657
Who? What woman?

426
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,451
The woman who lived there
before you moving in.

427
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:43,832
Tell you the truth, she
was kind of messed up...

428
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:47,795
and I think, the guy came here on
account of her still being there.

429
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,141
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

430
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:03,683
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

431
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:04,206
Sure.

432
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,611
Come on, lie down.

433
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,536
Take my sleeve, hold this bit.

434
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:25,290
Thanks.

435
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:34,633
Wait, let me take off your scarf.

436
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:38,051
You want me to put
two pillows for you?

437
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,012
No.

438
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:49,814
Turn off the light, so she can sleep.

439
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:50,815
Don't turn it off.

440
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,152
Can I get you anything?

441
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:55,508
No, thanks.

442
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,580
Where are you going, Emad?

443
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:07,956
Darling?

444
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,499
I said, where are you going?

445
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:12,460
I'm not going anywhere, I'll be here.
Do you need anything?

446
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:16,341
Nope. Leave the door open.

447
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,352
Okay, thanks.

448
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,857
Look, her blood pressure's low, be
careful when she's walking around.

449
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,898
Thanks for everything.

450
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:34,649
Sit down guys, I'll make
you some breakfast.

451
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:35,652
No thanks, I'm fine.

452
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:39,531
Come on, you haven't
eaten since last night.

453
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:45,453
Kati, you wanna stay here, and
make soup or something for them?

454
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:46,601
- You want me to stay?
- You want Kati to stay?

455
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:47,372
No, no.

456
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:48,665
Are you sure?

457
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,543
You must be tired.
Go, get some rest.

458
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:53,378
Call if you need anything.

459
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:56,921
Really, man, just let us know.

460
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,009
- Thanks again for everything, guys.
- Bye

461
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:12,195
<i>scrap metal... Iron doors...
Aluminium doors...</i>

462
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:15,797
<i>Fences... Metal dishes...
buying...</i>

463
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:29,451
<i>scrap metal... lamps... Samovars...
anything, bring it over...</i>

464
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,623
Come on, stand here while
I use the bathroom.

465
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,970
What are you doing?

466
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,600
Leave it, I'll wash it myself,
Rana, dear. Leave it.

467
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:17,913
Come and wash it then.

468
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,604
Alright, turn off the water
and come out.

469
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,400
Then, come and clean it
before I use it.

470
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,320
The police might need to see it.

471
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:33,867
Yes?

472
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:37,370
Of course, sorry.

473
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:38,455
Who was it?

474
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,165
A neighbor.

475
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,124
What did they say?

476
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:42,042
I'll be right back.

477
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,633
Sorry

478
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:05,897
I'm really sorry for all the trouble
you've been put through, ma'am.

479
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:08,673
Now, come on, don't say that.

480
00:39:08,674 --> 00:39:11,593
I think you should call 110, they'll be
able to track him down through the car.

481
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:15,242
Yeah, I'll definitely do that. Anyways,
I'll try to find some place...

482
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,286
Here I was thinking, when that woman left
she's taken all her troubles with her.

483
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:21,164
Have you ever seen this
car's owner around here?

484
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:25,041
Well, it wasn't like, just a
couple guys visiting her.

485
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:28,672
I might have to trouble you
again when the police comes...

486
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,883
if they have any questions
about exactly what you saw.

487
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:33,383
Of course, it's our duty. Would you
like to take my mobile number?

488
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:34,342
Yes, please.

489
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,510
I'll get going.

490
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:36,784
Thank you so much, ma'am.

491
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,643
They should put an ewer
around these guys necks,

492
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,685
and parade them around
the city, shaming them.

493
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:43,562
0912...

494
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,706
Why are you out here? Come in

495
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,043
I'm scared of being
alone in the house.

496
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:09,754
Where did you go?

497
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,718
I went to thank the
neighbors for last night.

498
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,634
What did they say?

499
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:17,992
Nothing.

500
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:19,721
They asked how you were.

501
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:23,435
You didn't tell Kati and the
guys what happened, did you?

502
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:24,728
No.

503
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:27,355
Okay, I'm going to
the police station.

504
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:31,193
We have to file a complaint for
them to start looking for the guy.

505
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:33,484
How will they find him?

506
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:35,403
He left his pickup behind.

507
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:39,618
His mobile too,
but it's disconnected.

508
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:43,580
Who was he, Emad?

509
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:50,420
The neighbors are saying the woman
who lived here before us was shady.

510
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:55,217
The scumbag must've been
one of her customers.

511
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:56,469
Came here on account of her.

512
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:00,430
Do you remember what he looked like?

513
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:02,224
No.

514
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,663
Didn't you get a look at him?

515
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,800
It's cold. Come inside,
you'll catch a cold.

516
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:31,044
Gimme that.

517
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,011
Who helped me out of the bathroom?

518
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:43,807
One of the neighbors.

519
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,452
Which one?

520
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:47,727
I don't know, just forget it.

521
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:55,402
Eat your breakfast. And
then go get some rest.

522
00:41:58,238 --> 00:42:02,993
I can't. As soon as I close my
eyes that scene comes to my mind.

523
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:14,421
How did he get in?

524
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:19,718
I opened the door,
I thought it was you.

525
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:25,473
I came out of the bathroom, buzzed
him in, and then went back.

526
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:36,943
I was shampooing my hair when I
realised someone had come in.

527
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:41,865
He put his hand in my hair from
behind and I thought it was you.

528
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:46,599
But then I saw his hands
and after that it's blank.

529
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:03,762
Rana...

530
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:07,641
Darling, have some breakfast.

531
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:14,773
Rana, dear...

532
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,276
Sweetie...

533
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,545
What about tonight's performance?

534
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:21,882
I called and told them to cancel it.

535
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,298
No, call and say I'm coming.

536
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,634
How? In this condition of yours?

537
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:27,491
It's harder for me to stay at home.

538
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,349
Put this on,
let's go to the police station.

539
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,507
We might get held up there
for a while anyways.

540
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,649
No, leave it.
Let's not go to the station.

541
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:41,234
We can't just do nothing!

542
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:48,742
I don't want to have to go there and tell a
bunch of officers or whoever what happened.

543
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:52,412
Did something happen
that you can't tell?

544
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:54,621
No.

545
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:57,501
Then, you don't have to say anything.
I'll tell 'em myself.

546
00:44:58,752 --> 00:45:00,212
I can't, it'll be too much.

547
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:13,350
No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.

548
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:17,604
When I'm walking in the street,
I clearly feel these things...

549
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:22,297
They pass me by, but it's as if they're
laughing at me with their eyes.

550
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,029
Why? Why would they laugh at you? Don't
talk that way about yourself, Willy.

551
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:29,449
Sometimes they pass me by
as if I don't even exist.

552
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:34,913
As though nobody sees me.
Nobody notices me. Nothing.

553
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,753
Linda?

554
00:45:49,678 --> 00:45:54,558
How long are you going to spend
repairing those socks, huh?

555
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,352
You know it makes me angry.

556
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:01,524
At least don't do it while I'm
home, talking to you. Okay?

557
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:13,577
Okay, we'll talk about something
else, for example my income.

558
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,500
My never-changing income. God,
this is really ridiculous.

559
00:46:20,646 --> 00:46:23,065
<i>What's wrong with you? Why
aren't you saying your lines?</i>

560
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:28,592
Willy, darling, you're the most
handsome man in the world to me.

561
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:37,599
You always say this to me, Linda,
always, but it doesn't help me at all.

562
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:40,059
I'll never be able to make
you happy, do you know why?

563
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:44,482
Because I'm just a salesman. I'm nothing!
I'm nothing, Linda!

564
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:49,362
But I always tried... why
are you crying, anyways?

565
00:46:53,408 --> 00:46:54,993
Wait, where are you going?

566
00:46:55,994 --> 00:46:57,579
Linda, come back...

567
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:07,797
Sorry, I have to stop the play.
I apologize to you all.

568
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:11,445
My wife, the other actor,
isn't feeling well.

569
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:14,259
Please give us a ten minute intermission.

570
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:14,982
Sorry.

571
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:20,058
Can you carry on?

572
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,189
What do you mean, Kati? Can't you see
she's not well? Go on, cancel it.

573
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:27,150
Do you wanna go to the other
room and lie down a little?

574
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,071
Alright, guys, let's just clear the room.
She's not well.

575
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,406
Sanam, dear.

576
00:47:35,408 --> 00:47:37,367
I'm coming.

577
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:39,454
Can I get you anything?

578
00:47:45,335 --> 00:47:46,628
Kati darling...

579
00:47:47,087 --> 00:47:49,089
Go and cancel the show.

580
00:47:59,516 --> 00:48:01,601
What happened there?

581
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:09,860
The way someone in the audience
was staring at me bothered me.

582
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:16,616
The audience have come to watch the play,
of course they'll be looking at you.

583
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:19,244
Looked at me just like that guy.

584
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,292
I thought you said you didn't see him.

585
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:31,673
I'm really unwell, I just
don't know what to do.

586
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:36,551
Babak, come here a minute.

587
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:38,138
Coming...

588
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:48,565
Is she feeling better?

589
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:52,214
Goddammit, man,
what can I say to you...?

590
00:48:52,215 --> 00:48:56,178
Don't you think you had to let me know
about the kind of people who lived there?

591
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,072
- What's happened?
- You're supposed to be my friend.

592
00:48:58,074 --> 00:49:02,120
Seriously, what's happened? What is
it to you who lived there before?

593
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:05,248
That apartment's infamous
in the whole neighborhood.

594
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:06,896
Who's said such a thing?

595
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,919
Let's say nobody's said anything, why isn't
this woman coming to collect her stuff?

596
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:14,028
I just wanted to help.

597
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:17,678
Remember the state you were in, last week?
Ready to sleep on the set?

598
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:20,785
Regardless, should you have hidden
that woman's line of work from me?

599
00:49:20,972 --> 00:49:21,869
What hiding?

600
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:24,705
Well, yeah. Did you tell me or not?

601
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:30,563
Was I supposed to pass on to you
some unfounded gossip? To upset you?

602
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:32,899
Well, what's going, anyways?
What's this all about?

603
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:34,359
Babak, I'm going

604
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,028
I'm coming.

605
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:38,448
Go take a look at Rana,
you'll see what this is all about.

606
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:40,992
They said she slipped
in the bathroom.

607
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:47,749
We said right in front of you we
might be having a kid in that place.

608
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,606
And you didn't say a word, what kind of...

609
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:51,795
You were joking!

610
00:49:52,462 --> 00:49:55,255
If we weren't joking,
would you have told us?

611
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:58,549
Told you what?

612
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:01,534
Put yourself in my shoes, the same
room we sleep in, each night...

613
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:06,227
how many strange men have
been with that woman.

614
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:11,145
Don't take it so hard on yourself.
I haven't cashed your check yet.

615
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:16,820
Whenever you find another place whose
previous tenants had your approval,

616
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,264
you can move out.

617
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:30,373
Hello.

618
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:30,791
Hello Hello.

619
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:31,208
Hello.

620
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:31,961
How are you doing.

621
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:37,171
Be careful not to slip on the
stairs Mrs Shahnazari, they're wet.

622
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:44,846
I was actually going to ask the cleaner
to come early and sort these out.

623
00:50:44,848 --> 00:50:49,267
But, I thought you'd want to report it,
the police might want to see them.

624
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:52,105
Well, it wasn't such a big deal.

625
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:53,948
You wouldn't say that,

626
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:58,040
if you'd been there and seen
the state your wife was in,

627
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,706
on the bathroom floor.

628
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:04,179
When Mr. Alimoradi opened
the bathroom door,

629
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:07,869
he thought, God forbid,
your wife was dead.

630
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:10,790
Say hello from me.

631
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:18,381
Get up, I've made some breakfast for you.

632
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:19,714
I'm heading out.

633
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:20,509
Wait.

634
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:29,098
Wait, I'll get ready and come with you.

635
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,144
Where to? I have class.

636
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:32,979
I know, I'll wait in the car.

637
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:35,941
It's not just an hour or
two, you'll get tired.

638
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:37,567
Then don't go today.

639
00:51:37,588 --> 00:51:38,399
What?

640
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:40,820
I said, don't go today.

641
00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:43,821
Let's say I don't, what
about tomorrow then?

642
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:46,532
The day after tomorrow?
It's not gonna work.

643
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:49,371
I can't stay here alone.

644
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:53,416
I said, I don't want
to be here alone.

645
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:55,193
What can I do?

646
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,825
You want me to get you a ticket to
visit your parents for a few days?

647
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:03,134
Looking like this?

648
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:06,367
I've made up my mind...

649
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:11,686
we either have to go to the police,
or forget this altogether.

650
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:15,395
Okay forget it, but let's look for
a new apartment right from today.

651
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:16,938
Okay, we'll start looking.

652
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,942
But until we find somewhere, you
need to try and pick yourself up.

653
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:22,986
What do you mean? It's not
something I can control.

654
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:26,219
You taking your pills and not staying up
all night getting worked up about it,

655
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,226
is up to you, isn't it?

656
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:31,955
Go take a shower, I'll wait here.

657
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:35,333
I don't want to go in that bathroom.

658
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:41,421
I'll drop you off at a friend's place.
Use theirs.

659
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:44,217
Go and tell them we've
come to take a shower?

660
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:47,074
What do you want me to do?

661
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:50,849
You keep changing your mind.

662
00:52:51,558 --> 00:52:53,909
At night you tell me not to come near you,

663
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:56,644
then in the morning you
tell me not to leave you.

664
00:52:56,646 --> 00:52:58,646
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

665
00:52:58,648 --> 00:52:59,314
Just go, you're late.

666
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:01,975
It'll take a couple weeks to find a place.

667
00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:02,639
What?

668
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:06,057
You're not gonna wash up
with that wound of yours?

669
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:27,385
I love you.

670
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:32,597
Just think, it could've been worse.

671
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:36,701
What if a piece of glass had gone in your
eye, or your head had been hit harder?

672
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:37,727
Then...

673
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:39,856
then what the hell would I have done?

674
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:42,442
I wish my head had been hit harder.

675
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:47,572
God forbid! Honey, don't
say things like that.

676
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:51,511
Hello, Mr. Etesami.

677
00:55:04,107 --> 00:55:06,985
Hello Sir, how are you doing?

678
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:10,155
Mr. Yeganeh gave me these
books to give them to you.

679
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:13,700
Be quiet. What's so funny?

680
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:17,410
Why?

681
00:55:17,412 --> 00:55:20,040
He said they're not suitable for kids.

682
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,584
Quiet!

683
00:55:23,919 --> 00:55:27,005
Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't
suitable for the kids?

684
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:30,342
Go, throw them in the bin.

685
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,299
Why the bin?

686
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:33,386
Just throw them away.

687
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:46,022
Give me your phone.

688
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:47,357
I don't have a phone, Sir.

689
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,107
Give it to me.

690
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:49,277
I don't have a cell.

691
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:51,571
Sir, wait a minute.

692
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,115
Give it to me.

693
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:57,661
Sir, there's nothing in it about you.

694
00:55:57,786 --> 00:55:58,618
I want to see what you have

695
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,577
I've deleted it.

696
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:00,995
Let me see it.

697
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:02,872
Sir please, I've deleted it.

698
00:56:02,874 --> 00:56:06,044
Sir, I have private photos in there.

699
00:56:06,294 --> 00:56:07,543
Put your hand down.

700
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:08,880
That's not fair.

701
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:12,008
Mr Etesami?

702
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:15,053
Sir?

703
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:20,892
I have personal things on there.
I deleted the video.

704
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:25,272
On my mother's life, I deleted it.

705
00:56:25,522 --> 00:56:28,093
Sir, send it on Telegram,
so that everyone can see.

706
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,774
It's much better than this movie.

707
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:32,779
I'll kick you out of the class,
if you say another word.

708
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,237
Mr. Etesami!

709
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:34,862
Sorry, Sir.

710
00:56:34,865 --> 00:56:35,780
You stay out of this!

711
00:56:35,782 --> 00:56:36,698
Mr Etesami?

712
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,764
I mean all of you.

713
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:40,329
I'm talking to him.

714
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:42,372
I deleted it.

715
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:44,457
Please.

716
00:56:48,295 --> 00:56:49,925
Call your father to come to the school,

717
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:51,991
and see the kind of photos
you have on your cell.

718
00:56:53,884 --> 00:56:56,052
His dad's dead, Sir.

719
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,274
Hi, sorry about that.

720
00:57:53,276 --> 00:57:55,966
Hi, no problem.

721
00:57:55,968 --> 00:57:59,296
If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it,
then you can leave it in the corner.

722
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:00,324
Next to the boiler room.

723
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:03,826
When my husband gets back he'll
move it to a better place.

724
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:07,372
I don't want you to have to keep
going up and down the stairs.

725
00:58:07,374 --> 00:58:10,750
I'm going out for a couple of
hours you can take my spot.

726
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:12,877
Don't worry, I'll find
a better place for it.

727
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:14,462
Suit yourself.

728
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:14,755
Sorry.

729
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,423
If you give me the keys, I can do it.

730
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:18,134
Thanks.

731
00:58:20,512 --> 00:58:24,472
My wife said, you're not
going to report it.

732
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:25,139
No.

733
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:28,601
You're doing the right thing, they won't
do anything, even if they catch him.

734
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:34,484
And you'll have to explain over
and over why you opened the door

735
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:36,988
plus trekking back
and forth to the court.

736
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:38,987
Endless hassle for nothing.

737
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:43,574
But he'll probably be back for his car.
Please, call me if he shows up.

738
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:45,662
I'll sort out that bastard.

739
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:03,011
I'll take mine out and
then come and park yours.

740
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:04,846
There's no need,
I'll do it myself.

741
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:06,391
Okay, then, goodbye. Thanks.

742
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,810
Goodbye.

743
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:38,713
How's it going?

744
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:41,174
Hey, you okay? Is Rana here?

745
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:42,634
No, wasn't she with you?

746
00:59:42,636 --> 00:59:43,801
She's coming on her own.

747
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:45,680
Any news about the guy?

748
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:50,810
Who?

749
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:55,106
Babak had heard some things
from your neighbors.

750
00:59:58,026 --> 00:59:59,651
Where is he? Is he here?

751
00:59:59,653 --> 01:00:00,777
Babak?

752
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:02,614
Yep, he's back there.

753
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:11,414
Hi.

754
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,372
Hi.

755
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:14,125
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

756
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:16,876
What should I have told you?

757
01:00:16,878 --> 01:00:19,089
About the man turning up
the other night.

758
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:22,133
How's Rana?

759
01:00:22,676 --> 01:00:24,511
The neighbors told you.

760
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:29,013
They're also worried...

761
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:31,307
Tell 'em nothing happened,
the guy just barged in.

762
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:33,559
Then why are you keeping his pickup?

763
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:35,647
Shahnazari said it's in the parking lot.

764
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:41,067
Tell them we'll be gone soon
we're looking for a new place.

765
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:43,027
Where will you go?

766
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:45,657
I won't let you.

767
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:50,036
Can you find that previous tenant
and arrange a meeting for me?

768
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:51,911
Why?

769
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:53,997
I wanna talk to her.

770
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:56,082
Ask her why she did this.

771
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:57,043
Did what?

772
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,210
Did what?

773
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:01,963
Sent this thug to our house.

774
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:03,131
Why would she do that?

775
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:07,051
You said yourself, she made threats
about us touching her stuff.

776
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:08,403
She's nothing like that.

777
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:12,225
She hasn't taken her stuff because
she still hasn't found a place.

778
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:14,833
She was just annoyed with me that day.

779
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:17,063
Hello.

780
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:19,772
Feeling better?

781
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:21,902
Yep, I'm fine thanks.

782
01:01:30,493 --> 01:01:32,662
Did you tell the guys?

783
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:33,786
No.

784
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:35,455
Then how do they know?

785
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:38,249
One of the neighbor had called Babak.

786
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:40,170
I'm not sure what they said.

787
01:01:41,254 --> 01:01:44,070
Emad, get dressed and
come for the make up.

788
01:01:47,093 --> 01:01:49,095
My outfit's not here.

789
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:52,182
Kati's going to take your place tonight.

790
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:04,567
And you accepted, just like that?

791
01:02:04,569 --> 01:02:06,821
What can I do?
It's not up to me.

792
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:10,156
The director wanted her
to replace you tonight.

793
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:13,660
If you're alright, and you can
do it, I'll go talk to her.

794
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:15,413
No, I don't want to.

795
01:02:16,373 --> 01:02:18,625
Have you started house hunting?

796
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:21,211
No, I will do.

797
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:23,920
As soon as I get time.

798
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:27,674
When you get time! Like it doesn't
matter how I feel in that place!

799
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:29,217
You haven't done anything.

800
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:30,720
Huh?

801
01:02:32,472 --> 01:02:35,390
I want us to go to the police, but
you won't let me. What do you mean?

802
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:39,102
You said you'd drop by the school, find
a substitute teacher, and pick me up.

803
01:02:39,104 --> 01:02:41,836
I couldn't find anyone
to cover my class.

804
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:50,490
Auntie?

805
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:52,573
Yes Baby?

806
01:02:52,576 --> 01:02:55,412
Why aren't you acting tonight?

807
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:58,371
I'm not feeling well tonight, darling.

808
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,790
Why did you come here then?

809
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:03,209
I get bored at home.

810
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:04,752
What?

811
01:03:04,754 --> 01:03:07,215
I get bored at home.

812
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:12,971
Well, I get bored here.

813
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:18,185
Would you like to come to
our house this evening?

814
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,685
Do you have Spongebob?

815
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,021
No, but we can go buy it on the way home.

816
01:03:23,023 --> 01:03:25,690
From tomorrow you really
need to perform again.

817
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:30,071
Everything's topsy turvy.
Everybody's making mistakes.

818
01:03:31,323 --> 01:03:32,614
Why?

819
01:03:32,616 --> 01:03:34,699
I don't know, everyone's upset.

820
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:37,201
You're better now, you
should act again tomorrow.

821
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:37,869
Mum?

822
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:38,661
Darling?

823
01:03:38,663 --> 01:03:39,829
Can I go to Auntie's house?

824
01:03:39,831 --> 01:03:40,788
No, baby.

825
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:45,877
Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone.
I'll bring him with me tomorrow.

826
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:50,946
He can't, his dad's coming to pick
him up to go to his house tomorrow.

827
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:57,432
Well, his Dad can pick
him up from our place.

828
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:04,145
You wanna go?

829
01:04:04,147 --> 01:04:05,023
Yes!

830
01:04:05,273 --> 01:04:07,357
You won't be a nuisance for Auntie Rana?

831
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,027
He won't.

832
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:12,531
Tell Emad we're taking the car.

833
01:04:13,657 --> 01:04:15,867
I'll bring his things over.

834
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:22,789
I need to pee, auntie.

835
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,876
I know, go on, go inside.

836
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,712
Whose bike is this?

837
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:31,967
That... belongs to some kid.

838
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,223
Where's the kid?

839
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:42,850
The kid's not here anymore.

840
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:44,102
Where did he go?

841
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:44,936
Huh?

842
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:46,690
Where'd he go?

843
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,732
Moved to a new house.
Don't you need to pee?

844
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:50,483
Oh, yes!

845
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:51,820
Go on then.

846
01:04:53,446 --> 01:04:55,699
Not that one, over here.

847
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:57,659
Well...

848
01:04:59,035 --> 01:05:00,076
it's dark!

849
01:05:00,078 --> 01:05:01,454
I'm coming...

850
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:07,000
It's scary in there.

851
01:05:07,002 --> 01:05:09,087
Come on.

852
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:13,133
No, I don't need to go anymore.

853
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,216
Let me help.

854
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:20,348
No, you go... I... I'll do it.

855
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:22,932
Are you feeling shy in front of me?

856
01:05:22,934 --> 01:05:23,852
Nope!

857
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,897
Can you do it yourself?

858
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:50,837
I'm drawing his mustache.

859
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:01,306
Yes?

860
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:03,350
Come up, dear.

861
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:05,185
Who was it?

862
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:07,268
Uncle Emad.

863
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:11,356
If it's my dad, then tell
him Sadra's not here.

864
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:12,526
Why?

865
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:16,110
Because I love my Mom.

866
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:17,239
Okay.

867
01:06:31,503 --> 01:06:32,712
Rana?

868
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:33,586
Hey.

869
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:35,421
The pickup isn't in the parking.

870
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:37,507
I parked it outside this morning.

871
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:39,175
Why?

872
01:06:39,177 --> 01:06:42,845
I didn't fancy moving it every ten minutes.

873
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:43,805
Hello!

874
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:46,808
Hello, how are you kid?

875
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:48,268
Where are the keys?

876
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,855
Where you'd left them.

877
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:52,772
How are things with my favorite?

878
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:54,734
Welcome to our house, all good?

879
01:06:55,193 --> 01:06:56,403
Welcome!

880
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:02,949
Leave it where it is Emad

881
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:03,783
I'll be right back.

882
01:07:03,785 --> 01:07:05,871
Emad... Emad...

883
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:11,124
Let's forget all that for
tonight, just leave it.

884
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:14,462
I've made dinner, go wash
your hands and change.

885
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,256
Go on, darling.

886
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:31,271
Ready for takeoff ladies and gentleman!

887
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:36,902
Sadra!

888
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,443
Yes!

889
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:40,528
Emad it's ready,
come before it gets cold.

890
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:41,781
Coming.

891
01:07:42,073 --> 01:07:43,865
Let's go wash those hands of yours.

892
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:45,617
My hands are clean!

893
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:46,993
Let's wash them again anyways.

894
01:07:46,995 --> 01:07:50,373
Wow, wow, wow, look at this!

895
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,127
Thanks so much.

896
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:57,795
Get your hands off it!

897
01:07:57,797 --> 01:08:02,091
<i>Rana, where are you?</i>

898
01:08:02,093 --> 01:08:04,846
<i>Sadra, come and eat!</i>

899
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:08,014
Hello.

900
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:11,893
Hello trouble, have you two
been having fun without me?

901
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:12,269
We went shopping
and then hung out.

902
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:13,853
Well done! We went shopping
and then hung out.

903
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:15,482
We went shopping and then hung out.

904
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,232
But we didn't find Spongebob.

905
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,318
Yes, unfortunately.

906
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:25,158
<i>Don't worry, Patrick, eventually a good day
will come when you and I will find someone.</i>

907
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:29,412
<i>Look at this, Spongebob!</i>

908
01:08:29,955 --> 01:08:33,708
Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni!

909
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,626
More?

910
01:08:36,628 --> 01:08:38,004
No no, that's enough.

911
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:40,255
Okay, just let me know.

912
01:08:40,257 --> 01:08:42,133
Thank you.

913
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,637
Wow, what a nice macaroni!

914
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:48,680
Bon appetit!

915
01:08:48,682 --> 01:08:50,725
Let's eat it all.

916
01:08:51,017 --> 01:08:52,600
Look what she's made.

917
01:08:52,602 --> 01:08:53,854
Yeah, I know!

918
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:57,107
How was tonight's performance?

919
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,442
Very...

920
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,111
not that great.

921
01:09:01,361 --> 01:09:02,777
It was terrible.

922
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:04,153
You're lying.

923
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:06,533
That's how it is without you.

924
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,951
Did you find the credit card?

925
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:11,371
No.

926
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:15,166
How did you go shopping?

927
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,377
With the money you'd left.

928
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:20,378
What money?

929
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,464
In the drawer.

930
01:09:36,688 --> 01:09:38,815
Why aren't you eating?
Do you not like it?

931
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:41,776
Is it not tasty?

932
01:09:50,869 --> 01:09:52,704
Don't eat it.

933
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:55,665
What's up?

934
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:07,928
That scumbag had left it
behind the other night.

935
01:10:35,622 --> 01:10:37,040
Sadra?

936
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,168
I've got an idea.

937
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:41,709
Do you like pizza?

938
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:42,712
Yep.

939
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,090
Then let's order some pizza.

940
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,342
Don't eat that, it's not good.

941
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:51,888
Do you like fries?

942
01:10:52,806 --> 01:10:54,683
And after that Ice Cream?

943
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:05,841
- Hi there. Gimme a call when you can.

944
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:10,115
Hello? Mum? Mummy?

945
01:11:12,284 --> 01:11:16,246
Hello? Uncle? Are you there?

946
01:11:17,497 --> 01:11:21,418
It's the 3rd time I'm calling.

947
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:24,880
Hello darling, it's Babak.

948
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:31,678
Hello... Hello...

949
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:35,015
Are you there?

950
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:45,317
Gimme a call when you get
home, I'll be up late.

951
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:50,614
What are you doing?

952
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:53,200
Nothing.

953
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,327
Come on, go sleep.

954
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,454
You haven't slept for two nights

955
01:11:57,621 --> 01:11:59,623
I can't sleep.

956
01:12:07,547 --> 01:12:10,048
Why did you open her letters?

957
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,549
It's her private stuff.

958
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,509
I wanna find out who the
hell that scumbag was.

959
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:15,826
Let's say you find out how it was...

960
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:17,680
He'll say it was a mistake.

961
01:12:17,682 --> 01:12:19,515
He came inside by mistake?

962
01:12:19,518 --> 01:12:22,060
He rang the bell
and I opened the door.

963
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:25,647
He must've thought it's that woman
since I opened the door so easily.

964
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:26,858
He came here by mistake?

965
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:29,400
Any when he realized his mistake...

966
01:12:29,402 --> 01:12:31,194
Why didn't he leave?

967
01:12:31,196 --> 01:12:34,072
Because he saw the bathroom light's
on and there's a woman in there?

968
01:12:34,074 --> 01:12:35,156
How would he know it's a...

969
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:37,536
From your clothes on the bed.

970
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,539
If I'd just used the damn intercom...

971
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:46,169
If I'd just asked who it was...

972
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,964
None of this would've happened.

973
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:51,172
If you think it's that simple...

974
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:55,220
You can just tell all the
neighbors about the intercom...

975
01:12:55,324 --> 01:12:57,011
Why are you getting the
neighbors into this?

976
01:12:57,013 --> 01:12:58,763
They knew what was
going on in this house.

977
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,807
So it'd be fine with you,
if they didn't know?

978
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,894
What are you on about?

979
01:13:04,459 --> 01:13:05,711
Leave me alone.

980
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,454
The pickup wasn't there.

981
01:13:23,456 --> 01:13:24,124
What?

982
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,085
Sorry.

983
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,880
Where was it?

984
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:31,421
There.

985
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:32,966
Sorry.

986
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,927
Where did you leave it?

987
01:13:37,929 --> 01:13:39,181
I left it there.

988
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,059
Where?

989
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,854
Over there, where the Peugeot is.

990
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,487
He's taken it.

991
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:57,866
I have to find that asshole.

992
01:14:15,509 --> 01:14:17,344
Jackass!

993
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:25,352
Okay, slow down!

994
01:14:52,212 --> 01:14:53,630
It's freezing in there.

995
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:54,754
Never mind.

996
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:57,048
What do you mean, never mind?
You'll get sick.

997
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,216
Let's go to a public bath.

998
01:14:58,218 --> 01:15:00,720
No, I'll be out quick.
Just wait here.

999
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:12,146
Hasanpoor, come here a sec.

1000
01:15:12,148 --> 01:15:13,984
<i>Hello.</i>

1001
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:22,365
What can I do for you, Sir?

1002
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:23,283
Hi.

1003
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,370
How's it going?

1004
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:27,870
Your dad was a traffic cop, right?

1005
01:15:27,873 --> 01:15:29,416
He's retired now, why?

1006
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:32,625
A car hit my wife and drove off.

1007
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:33,710
Hope it's nothing serious, Sir!

1008
01:15:33,712 --> 01:15:35,797
No, thank God.

1009
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,091
It was a pickup, if I give
you the number plate...

1010
01:15:40,093 --> 01:15:44,220
Can your Dad find the guy's address?
If it's not too much trouble, that is.

1011
01:15:44,222 --> 01:15:46,178
Sure, he has contacts in the department.

1012
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:48,516
If you gimme the license
plate, he can find out.

1013
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:50,643
But, I think you should report it.

1014
01:15:50,645 --> 01:15:54,731
It wasn't anything serious, so I
don't wanna get the police mixed up.

1015
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:57,402
Okay, gimme the registration
and I'll call my Dad.

1016
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,438
- Get a pen and a paper, then.
- 'Kay.

1017
01:16:06,893 --> 01:16:08,312
Why don't you want to work for me?

1018
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,543
Have you lost your mind, Charlie?
I've got a job.

1019
01:16:11,379 --> 01:16:13,881
Then what are you walking
in here every week for?

1020
01:16:18,887 --> 01:16:21,077
Well, if you don't want
me to walk in here...

1021
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:23,008
I'm offering you a job.

1022
01:16:23,009 --> 01:16:27,544
I don't want your goddam job! I've
got one already. Get outta my way!

1023
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,151
When the hell are you
going to grow up, huh?

1024
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,281
Goddam you, Charlie!
You big ignoramus!

1025
01:16:33,386 --> 01:16:38,287
Big ignoramus! How dare
you talk to me like that?

1026
01:16:38,392 --> 01:16:41,624
If you say that to me
again, I'll rap you one!

1027
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:46,318
I don't care how big you are!

1028
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,134
You degenerate!

1029
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:04,253
What's wrong with you tonight?

1030
01:17:04,984 --> 01:17:05,818
What did I do?

1031
01:17:05,924 --> 01:17:07,488
Why are you adding dialogues?

1032
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:08,844
What did I add?

1033
01:17:09,575 --> 01:17:11,869
If you've got a problem with
me, let's sit and talk.

1034
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,581
Not on the stage, calling
me, "You degenerate!"

1035
01:17:14,582 --> 01:17:17,189
It's neither improvisation, nor
acting, you're insulting me.

1036
01:17:17,294 --> 01:17:18,963
What? Did I hurt your feeling?

1037
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:20,319
Yeah.

1038
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:23,553
And if you do that one more time, I'll
answer you right in front of everyone.

1039
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:26,578
Degenerate is the one who speaks
his mind through swearing.

1040
01:17:26,787 --> 01:17:27,621
Didn't know that.

1041
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,812
I'm really sorry.

1042
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,477
Bakery.

1043
01:17:57,445 --> 01:17:58,592
Hello, how're you doing?

1044
01:18:07,143 --> 01:18:12,461
<i>Speaking Azeri.</i>

1045
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:24,558
What can I do for you?

1046
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:26,623
Two baguettes, please.

1047
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:32,693
You want 'em cut? Thanks a lot.

1048
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:35,926
That pickup is yours? Why?

1049
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,847
There's an officer writing tickets,
from the top of the street.

1050
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:41,767
Majid, come here, go move the car.

1051
01:18:42,186 --> 01:18:44,480
Before the officer slaps a ticket on it.

1052
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:56,785
Soheil, bring the keys.

1053
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:02,542
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1054
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,607
Later.

1055
01:19:05,338 --> 01:19:06,172
Bye.

1056
01:19:06,799 --> 01:19:08,259
Here you go, Sir.

1057
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:09,511
Thanks.

1058
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,557
Thanks, dude.
I'll take a water.

1059
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:57,895
Hello, mister, sorry
is that your pickup?

1060
01:19:58,521 --> 01:19:59,355
Yeah.

1061
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:02,276
I had some load, I wanted to
ask you to move it for me.

1062
01:20:02,486 --> 01:20:03,820
Nah, that pickup is for a store.

1063
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,761
Well, not now, whenever you're free.

1064
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:08,370
No, it's just that, I do something else.
I don't do that.

1065
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,996
Not even Friday?

1066
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:10,727
Nah.

1067
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,256
You can find pickups at
the top of Haft-e-Tir.

1068
01:20:13,544 --> 01:20:14,336
No, it's just that,

1069
01:20:14,363 --> 01:20:17,532
my stuff are books and paintings and things
like that, I was looking for a softopper.

1070
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:20,844
You know, on account of
rain or things like that.

1071
01:20:21,262 --> 01:20:22,722
I'm really busy.
I don't have time.

1072
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:26,268
I don't care about the fee. I'll pay. I
just want my stuff to get there safe.

1073
01:20:26,373 --> 01:20:28,354
It's just that, I'm busy.
I can't.

1074
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:30,983
Majid, come on, man. Help the guy.
Late night or something.

1075
01:20:31,797 --> 01:20:34,925
Well, how about you gimme your number?
I'll call you whenever you say.

1076
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:37,429
And if you come yourself,
even better.

1077
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,828
Bro, find some time between
your schedule for him.

1078
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:44,730
Careful not to hit the walls.

1079
01:20:50,049 --> 01:20:52,551
Ah! What're you doing here?

1080
01:20:53,804 --> 01:20:55,889
Come here... kitty...

1081
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:01,562
Careful with that not to scratch it.

1082
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:04,963
Babak, tell 'em to come
have a cup of tea.

1083
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:07,571
- There's no need for that.
- It's getting cold.

1084
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:13,724
Where are you taking these?

1085
01:21:13,829 --> 01:21:17,791
I'm taking 'em to my parent's parking lot.
We'll see what happens.

1086
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:19,252
Won't she come to take 'em?

1087
01:21:19,983 --> 01:21:22,798
She's got problems of her own.
She hasn't found a place yet.

1088
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:32,602
Get up, Babak wants to take
away that woman's stuff.

1089
01:21:33,437 --> 01:21:34,584
What do you want me to do?

1090
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:40,737
What's going on
between you two?

1091
01:21:41,051 --> 01:21:42,971
Nothing, let him take 'em.
That's okay with me.

1092
01:21:50,853 --> 01:21:53,252
Hello? Majid?

1093
01:21:54,191 --> 01:21:56,068
It's me, Etesami, couple days ago.

1094
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,050
You free today?

1095
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,032
How about Friday?

1096
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:08,434
Yeah?

1097
01:23:10,312 --> 01:23:11,042
You?

1098
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,735
Yeah, come on up.

1099
01:23:36,901 --> 01:23:38,361
Hello, can I help you?

1100
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:41,907
Hello, Sir. You okay? Have
I come to the right place?

1101
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,181
Majid said, there's some
stuff you need to move.

1102
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:46,810
That's right, come on in.
Why didn't he come himself?

1103
01:23:46,915 --> 01:23:49,939
Well, he was busy,
so he sent me instead.

1104
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:53,068
- After you.
- You first.

1105
01:23:53,174 --> 01:23:55,259
But he didn't say anything
about all these stairs.

1106
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:57,867
With this heart of mine.

1107
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,368
Well, if I knew you're coming,

1108
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:02,377
I would've told him about the
stairs, and the broken elevator.

1109
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:06,835
Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir.
Would you gimme a glass of water?

1110
01:24:12,258 --> 01:24:13,405
Have you hired movers?

1111
01:24:14,135 --> 01:24:18,410
No, I thought he's coming. And,
we'd take the boxes ourselves.

1112
01:24:18,516 --> 01:24:20,497
Well, the poor guy
was kinda busy today.

1113
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:23,730
- Is he your son?
- Nah, my son-in-law.

1114
01:24:23,836 --> 01:24:26,130
Doesn't make a difference though.
He's like my own son.

1115
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:38,643
Sorry, old man, we just moved out.
There's no glasses or anything.

1116
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:40,917
That's alright, mister.
I'll drink from the tap.

1117
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:44,276
Where are the boxes?

1118
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:46,675
In that room.

1119
01:24:47,406 --> 01:24:49,596
We'll see. If there's too
many, we'll call movers.

1120
01:24:52,725 --> 01:24:56,791
Give him a call. Maybe he's around
here somewhere. I can pick him up.

1121
01:24:57,939 --> 01:24:58,982
Who?

1122
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:00,233
Your son-in-law.

1123
01:25:00,964 --> 01:25:04,822
Nah, the poor souls just went shopping
for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony.

1124
01:25:09,933 --> 01:25:11,914
Isn't the janitor
allowed to help here?

1125
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,209
Nah, the building's empty.

1126
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:16,712
The walls caved, the residents
have all moved out.

1127
01:25:16,818 --> 01:25:19,529
Wow, wow! What if it collapses
on us or something?

1128
01:25:19,843 --> 01:25:20,677
Nah.

1129
01:25:20,886 --> 01:25:23,910
Let's take a look and see if
it's worth hiring movers.

1130
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:25,892
Grandpa!

1131
01:25:26,832 --> 01:25:27,562
What?

1132
01:25:27,876 --> 01:25:31,108
Would you come sit here for a sec?
I wanna tell you something.

1133
01:25:31,213 --> 01:25:33,195
Look here, mister, this
isn't my line of work.

1134
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:35,490
Majid, said, "there's this guy,
who's called a couple times...

1135
01:25:35,491 --> 01:25:38,514
would you do it?" I
said, okay, why not?

1136
01:25:38,515 --> 01:25:40,497
Now, you paying depends on
how generous you're feeling.

1137
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:44,669
Nah, it's not about... wages,
fees, and stuff like that.

1138
01:25:45,295 --> 01:25:48,215
Just sit down. There's
something I have to tell you.

1139
01:25:51,344 --> 01:25:53,325
Good news, I hope.

1140
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,748
How long do you know this guy?

1141
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:01,252
- My son-in-law?
- Yeah.

1142
01:26:01,566 --> 01:26:02,296
What for?

1143
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:03,987
I wanna know
if you know him well.

1144
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,428
Well, it's about two years they've
asked for my daughter's hand.

1145
01:26:08,242 --> 01:26:10,015
Have you asked around
about him?

1146
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:14,291
Do you know Majid?

1147
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,941
If there's anything you
know, just tell me.

1148
01:26:19,194 --> 01:26:23,260
When my wife and I moved out of
here, we went to a place that...

1149
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:30,560
it's previous tenant was... you
know, a woman of the street.

1150
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:36,818
One night, when I got home a little late.
My wife was alone in the house.

1151
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:41,302
One of these lowlifes on account
of that woman still being there...

1152
01:26:42,555 --> 01:26:43,347
enters my house.

1153
01:26:46,205 --> 01:26:48,186
When my wife was
in the bathroom.

1154
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,960
The jerk goes
into the bathroom.

1155
01:26:50,482 --> 01:26:51,316
Who?

1156
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,403
That filthy
son-in-law of yours.

1157
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,764
Now, how do you know
it was Majid?

1158
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:04,041
When my wife starts screaming, the
guys makes a run for it, but...

1159
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:07,317
He was in such a hurry that,
he leaves his pickup behind.

1160
01:27:07,692 --> 01:27:10,299
I found him from his pickup. I
went down to where he works.

1161
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:14,784
I wanted to go there,
grab hold of him...

1162
01:27:17,183 --> 01:27:19,561
and dishonor him in front of
all his co-workers, but...

1163
01:27:22,606 --> 01:27:23,753
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1164
01:27:23,858 --> 01:27:26,882
This pickup changes hands
a lot in that store.

1165
01:27:26,883 --> 01:27:29,073
That's why I asked him to come here.
To talk to him, and ask him...

1166
01:27:29,074 --> 01:27:31,994
if it was him or someone else.

1167
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:33,246
Majid's not like that...

1168
01:27:35,332 --> 01:27:38,565
if I find out it's been him,
I'll call off everything.

1169
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:39,608
The wedding and all.

1170
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,596
How's your wife, now?

1171
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:50,663
I don't know what to say.

1172
01:27:54,418 --> 01:27:56,191
Let me talk to him tonight.

1173
01:27:56,296 --> 01:27:58,590
Give him a call and tell
him I wanna talk to him.

1174
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,198
Tell him to come here, I
wanna ask him who's done it.

1175
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,137
Well, it's just,

1176
01:28:02,164 --> 01:28:05,917
they've gone with my wife and daughter
for "the exchange of vows" shopping.

1177
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:08,812
Well, at least give him a call.

1178
01:28:09,855 --> 01:28:12,045
Ask him who had his pickup
that night.

1179
01:28:13,713 --> 01:28:15,069
When did this happen?

1180
01:28:15,174 --> 01:28:17,885
About two weeks ago.

1181
01:28:20,285 --> 01:28:25,081
Okay, so you just let me talk
to him tonight... Oh my...

1182
01:28:27,376 --> 01:28:29,461
But, I wanna talk to him,
old man.

1183
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:34,467
Wait a second, I wanna talk to him.
Call him.

1184
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:36,971
I don't have his number
in my phone.

1185
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:38,536
I have it.

1186
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:43,959
When I say call him to come here,
it's because I don't want to...

1187
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,150
go down to the store, make a scene
in front of his co-workers.

1188
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:48,341
You just let me
make sure it's him.

1189
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,408
I have to talk to him in such a
way that I'll get an answer...

1190
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:53,787
How about I call him myself, huh?

1191
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,477
You want me to do it?

1192
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:00,128
Okay, let me just
dial his number.

1193
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:17,542
Hello, Majid? Hi, son...
where are you guys?

1194
01:29:18,898 --> 01:29:21,714
Yeah, I'm here with him.

1195
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:25,677
Who's with you?

1196
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:32,143
Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call.
I wanna tell you something.

1197
01:29:34,751 --> 01:29:36,106
Call my cell.

1198
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:40,382
I don't have it memorized.
Ask Moj'gan.

1199
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:46,952
Okay... it's nothing... Bye.

1200
01:29:51,646 --> 01:29:51,854
He said, he'll call when he's alone.

1201
01:29:53,107 --> 01:29:55,088
Say, what do you do yourself?

1202
01:29:56,653 --> 01:29:59,364
I work with this car of Majid's.
His pickup.

1203
01:29:59,886 --> 01:30:02,702
I sell clothes from the back
of the pickup, at nights.

1204
01:30:02,807 --> 01:30:05,831
And I don't come out during the
day, on account of my heart.

1205
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,192
And, how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

1206
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:15,530
Well, I just don't. Not
just him, a lot of people.

1207
01:30:16,469 --> 01:30:18,242
Have you just bought
this number of yours?

1208
01:30:18,556 --> 01:30:19,390
No.

1209
01:30:37,743 --> 01:30:40,767
How come... your son-in-law
doesn't have your number?

1210
01:30:42,123 --> 01:30:44,626
You just told him to get
it from someone else, huh?

1211
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:47,129
I don't know, man, I don't know.

1212
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:50,884
I'm so messed up right now that, I
don't even remember my own name.

1213
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,682
Wait a second, old man.

1214
01:30:55,787 --> 01:30:57,665
- It won't open.
- Not so fast. Wait a minute.

1215
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:01,837
If it's okay, I want you
to take off your shoes.

1216
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:03,715
What for?

1217
01:31:03,924 --> 01:31:05,593
I wanna see your foot.

1218
01:31:06,845 --> 01:31:09,139
Mister, I'm as old as your father,
you telling me to take off my shoes?

1219
01:31:09,244 --> 01:31:10,912
Open the door, let me go!

1220
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:13,197
I didn't do anything to you.
Why are you talking like that?

1221
01:31:13,313 --> 01:31:15,085
Take it easy.

1222
01:31:15,295 --> 01:31:18,507
Just take off your shoes for a sec. Then,
I'll open the door for you to leave.

1223
01:31:18,528 --> 01:31:21,969
Why should I take off my shoes?
Open the door!

1224
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:25,099
Hush! Come here.
Let's go over there.

1225
01:31:35,422 --> 01:31:37,612
Sit on the stair, for a
sec, take off your shoes.

1226
01:31:39,177 --> 01:31:39,699
Sit!

1227
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:42,932
Sit down!

1228
01:31:45,853 --> 01:31:47,417
Just sit, okay?

1229
01:31:53,361 --> 01:31:54,925
Take off your shoes, please.

1230
01:31:55,239 --> 01:31:56,282
I'm not feeling well, just don't!

1231
01:31:56,596 --> 01:31:57,951
Well, let me help you.

1232
01:31:58,161 --> 01:31:59,203
I'll take it off, okay.

1233
01:32:01,186 --> 01:32:02,958
<i>Whispering: I'll take it off.</i>

1234
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:12,552
The other one,
take off the other one too.

1235
01:32:20,895 --> 01:32:21,938
Your socks too.

1236
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,692
Mister, what do you want from me?

1237
01:32:25,798 --> 01:32:27,779
Take 'em off!
I said, take off your socks.

1238
01:32:27,883 --> 01:32:29,030
Let me do it myself.

1239
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,534
- No!
- Let me! Just let me!

1240
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:50,676
Hello, Siavash!

1241
01:33:53,806 --> 01:33:55,787
No, I'm a little busy right now.

1242
01:33:57,352 --> 01:33:59,333
What time is it, anyways?

1243
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:01,941
No I'll be there. Don't worry.

1244
01:34:04,757 --> 01:34:08,198
She'll come herself...
She's a little busy.

1245
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,478
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1246
01:34:11,418 --> 01:34:12,565
Okay, bye.

1247
01:34:14,964 --> 01:34:17,780
Swear on my life, I didn't
want to harass anyone.

1248
01:34:19,866 --> 01:34:22,368
Did that woman tell you
to go there that night?

1249
01:34:22,995 --> 01:34:25,706
That woman had been messaging
me for at least a month.

1250
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,962
She said, "If you still have the
pickup, come over, I wanna see you."

1251
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:34,154
And I messaged back,
"Hello, dear, sorry...

1252
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,449
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1253
01:34:37,597 --> 01:34:40,621
She took it to herself. No matter
how many times I called...

1254
01:34:40,726 --> 01:34:43,020
She never answered.

1255
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,211
Didn't want to talk to me.

1256
01:34:45,942 --> 01:34:48,413
That night, I thought I'd drop
by and make it up to her.

1257
01:34:48,758 --> 01:34:50,218
Didn't you know she's moved out?

1258
01:34:50,532 --> 01:34:52,305
God knows, I had no idea.
Swear on my kids' life...

1259
01:34:52,306 --> 01:34:56,477
You opened the door, and went in. You
saw the furniture is different...

1260
01:34:56,478 --> 01:34:58,063
How come you're saying
you didn't know?

1261
01:34:58,147 --> 01:35:02,735
I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff,
the bicycle I had bought myself...

1262
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:06,803
I thought maybe she's moving.

1263
01:35:06,804 --> 01:35:08,889
You're not going out of that
door, until you tell the truth.

1264
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:12,477
If I had the slightest idea
that you guys have moved in,

1265
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,669
I would've thought, maybe
there's a man in the bathroom.

1266
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:18,381
- My wife's clothes were on the bed.
- I didn't saw those.

1267
01:35:18,486 --> 01:35:20,571
You saw those and figured there
must be a woman in the bath.

1268
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:23,179
All alone, she even
opened the door for you.

1269
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:24,744
I didn't see any clothes.

1270
01:35:25,163 --> 01:35:28,708
It didn't take even five minutes. I
came in, there was no one there.

1271
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:31,733
Just a minute ago, your wife
had opened the door for me.

1272
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:34,132
Why did your wife
open the door for me?

1273
01:35:34,133 --> 01:35:35,906
Well, she thought it's me.

1274
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:38,095
Let me tell you
what really happened.

1275
01:35:38,201 --> 01:35:42,893
I went by the bathroom door, called
the kid, as soon as I did...

1276
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:44,875
there starts the screaming.
Then, I ran away.

1277
01:35:44,876 --> 01:35:46,336
You went into the bathroom.

1278
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:48,109
I didn't go in the bathroom.

1279
01:35:48,215 --> 01:35:49,883
Then, where was your foot cut like that?

1280
01:35:49,884 --> 01:35:53,638
I have no idea. By the
time I was downstairs...

1281
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,922
I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've
stepped on something running down stairs.

1282
01:35:55,924 --> 01:35:57,175
Then, my wife's lying?

1283
01:35:57,176 --> 01:35:58,948
Your wife says I went into the bathroom?

1284
01:35:58,949 --> 01:36:01,188
My wife was scared and
bumped into the glass,

1285
01:36:01,215 --> 01:36:04,059
otherwise God knows what you
would've done, dirty scumbag!

1286
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:07,292
I swear on my life or
whatever's dear to you...

1287
01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:09,794
as soon as I found out I'm in
the wrong place, I ran away.

1288
01:36:09,796 --> 01:36:14,384
Well, just tell your wife to come here.
Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her.

1289
01:36:14,406 --> 01:36:16,574
What's my wife supposed to say?

1290
01:36:17,722 --> 01:36:20,851
My wife's said all she had to say.
It's your wife's turn to come here.

1291
01:36:21,477 --> 01:36:23,563
Call her, and tell her
to come here, right now.

1292
01:36:24,606 --> 01:36:25,336
What for?

1293
01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:27,631
What you said, I want you to
repeat in front of your wife.

1294
01:36:27,737 --> 01:36:30,135
Mister, why don't you get it?
I didn't go in that bath...

1295
01:36:30,136 --> 01:36:31,491
Okay, you didn't!

1296
01:36:32,014 --> 01:36:35,142
I want you to tell your wife what
you were doing in that house.

1297
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:36,290
Call her, right now!

1298
01:36:36,812 --> 01:36:38,272
Get it out, and call her!

1299
01:36:38,795 --> 01:36:40,463
Nope! Get out your cell!

1300
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:47,866
Don't make me look bad in
front of my wife and kids.

1301
01:36:48,284 --> 01:36:49,327
Call her, right now.

1302
01:36:49,536 --> 01:36:51,518
My daughter's about to get married.

1303
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:53,229
Your daughter has to know
her real father.

1304
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:58,819
I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything,
just so he knows his father-in-law.

1305
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:02,052
I don't have have to keep you here.
Go on, get out! Go!

1306
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,954
I'm gonna call your son-in-law,
tell him to bring your wife here...

1307
01:37:06,955 --> 01:37:08,832
Leave me alone, mister! Ah!

1308
01:37:15,819 --> 01:37:17,800
Someone help me! Help!

1309
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:21,034
Don't make noises! Quiet!

1310
01:37:22,599 --> 01:37:24,267
Open the door! Open up!
I'll die!

1311
01:37:26,145 --> 01:37:29,690
I'm about to have a stroke.
Open the door!

1312
01:37:30,838 --> 01:37:35,322
Mister! Open the door! I'm
afraid of closed spaces.

1313
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:40,432
Open the door, my boy.

1314
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:50,443
At least turn on the lights.

1315
01:38:16,825 --> 01:38:18,180
Forgive me...

1316
01:38:20,371 --> 01:38:22,039
my dear!

1317
01:38:25,272 --> 01:38:27,044
I can't cry.

1318
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:31,529
Why did you ever do that to yourself?

1319
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,786
I don't understand it.

1320
01:38:38,517 --> 01:38:40,811
Help me, Willy!

1321
01:38:46,443 --> 01:38:48,841
It seems to me that you're
just on another trip.

1322
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:51,553
I keep expecting you.

1323
01:38:58,646 --> 01:39:00,731
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1324
01:39:02,608 --> 01:39:03,859
Right today.

1325
01:39:05,946 --> 01:39:08,448
And there will be nobody home.

1326
01:39:11,473 --> 01:39:13,871
We're free and clear.

1327
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:19,399
We're free.

1328
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,338
Rana, lock the door,
and take the keys.

1329
01:40:56,581 --> 01:40:58,458
Get up, on your feet.

1330
01:41:14,934 --> 01:41:16,185
Here, wait.

1331
01:41:18,063 --> 01:41:19,106
Sit here.

1332
01:41:35,999 --> 01:41:37,355
You go in that room.

1333
01:42:08,115 --> 01:42:10,409
Look how mentally and
emotionally shattered she is.

1334
01:42:19,378 --> 01:42:23,653
There's my wife. Are you gonna keep saying
you haven't gone into the bathroom?

1335
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:26,574
I'm sorry.

1336
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:28,556
Answer me.

1337
01:42:31,893 --> 01:42:33,040
I made a mistake.

1338
01:42:33,771 --> 01:42:36,795
Tell me, why did you
go into the bathroom?

1339
01:42:42,635 --> 01:42:44,199
I gave into temptation.

1340
01:42:56,401 --> 01:42:57,757
What are you gonna do to him?

1341
01:42:58,175 --> 01:43:02,450
His family are on their way, I want
his wife to know what he's done.

1342
01:43:11,203 --> 01:43:13,079
You're taking your revenge.

1343
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:17,668
Let him go, let him leave.

1344
01:43:18,608 --> 01:43:20,172
I know what I'm doing.

1345
01:43:21,841 --> 01:43:23,927
You sit here, there's no
need for you to come out.

1346
01:43:47,284 --> 01:43:48,849
Where are you going?

1347
01:43:50,831 --> 01:43:53,333
I'm not feeling right at all.
Let me go.

1348
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:55,420
They're coming after you.

1349
01:43:55,942 --> 01:43:57,819
Your son-in-law called,
he asked about you.

1350
01:43:57,924 --> 01:43:59,488
I told him to come over.

1351
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:01,158
And to bring your wife too.

1352
01:44:03,661 --> 01:44:05,747
They're on their way. Sit down.

1353
01:44:12,108 --> 01:44:13,777
I'm begging you, please
let me go.

1354
01:44:14,716 --> 01:44:17,323
When your family get here. Tell
them everything you told me.

1355
01:44:18,262 --> 01:44:18,262
Then you can leave.

1356
01:44:18,889 --> 01:44:19,932
I'm begging you.

1357
01:44:39,536 --> 01:44:40,578
Miss!

1358
01:44:41,518 --> 01:44:42,561
Forgive me.

1359
01:44:43,396 --> 01:44:45,377
Let me go, before they get here.

1360
01:45:04,667 --> 01:45:07,378
That woman lived with me for
35 years.

1361
01:45:21,143 --> 01:45:22,915
Mister! Get up! Get up, go!

1362
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:28,756
You, sit down!

1363
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:30,237
Leave him alone, let him go.

1364
01:45:30,634 --> 01:45:34,492
He'll go, he will. When his family
get here, they can leave together.

1365
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,682
Sit down.

1366
01:45:36,892 --> 01:45:37,622
For the love of God!

1367
01:45:37,727 --> 01:45:38,666
Here, mister, go.

1368
01:45:38,771 --> 01:45:39,605
- Just, sit down.
- Let him go!

1369
01:45:39,606 --> 01:45:41,066
My girl! My boy!

1370
01:45:41,276 --> 01:45:43,778
- Leave him alone, Emad!
- You stay out of this!

1371
01:45:45,135 --> 01:45:47,533
- Sit down!
- Please.

1372
01:45:47,535 --> 01:45:48,056
I said sit down! Ah!

1373
01:45:48,057 --> 01:45:50,456
SIT... DOWN! Here.

1374
01:46:10,789 --> 01:46:13,918
What? What do you want?

1375
01:46:25,493 --> 01:46:26,640
Oh, my God!

1376
01:46:30,603 --> 01:46:31,646
Emad!

1377
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,983
- Does he, by any chance, take
any under-the-tongue pills?

1378
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:37,800
I searched. There's
nothing in his pockets.

1379
01:46:37,802 --> 01:46:39,679
- What happened?
- Where are you now?

1380
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:44,163
No, no, get here as soon as you can.
Okay, okay.

1381
01:46:44,894 --> 01:46:47,084
- Was it the Emergency?
- His family. They're coming.

1382
01:46:47,295 --> 01:46:50,631
- Oh, my God!
- Mister! Can you hear me?

1383
01:46:50,841 --> 01:46:53,761
Does he have a pulse? Emad,
can you hear his heartbeat?

1384
01:46:53,762 --> 01:46:56,473
Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet.
Let me see what I'm doing.

1385
01:46:59,706 --> 01:47:00,541
Where are you going?

1386
01:47:00,545 --> 01:47:02,777
He said he's got pills.
Maybe they're in the car.

1387
01:47:35,368 --> 01:47:39,226
Can you hear me?
Open your mouth. Open!

1388
01:47:55,493 --> 01:47:58,517
Mister! Get up!
Can you hear me?

1389
01:48:01,959 --> 01:48:04,566
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1390
01:48:06,339 --> 01:48:08,738
You better now?
You feeling better?

1391
01:48:11,762 --> 01:48:15,620
Breathe! Breathe!
You better, now?

1392
01:48:30,324 --> 01:48:31,366
Don't worry, he's better.

1393
01:48:31,367 --> 01:48:33,140
You didn't call the Emergency?

1394
01:48:36,049 --> 01:48:38,030
No, I was afraid he might be dead.

1395
01:48:45,914 --> 01:48:46,999
Wait a minute!

1396
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:54,194
If you say anything to his family, I don't
wanna have anything to do with you.

1397
01:49:03,684 --> 01:49:05,144
Yes?

1398
01:49:09,941 --> 01:49:12,235
- Hello.
- The elevator's broken, use the stairs.

1399
01:49:12,341 --> 01:49:14,113
Come on, ma!

1400
01:49:15,366 --> 01:49:18,702
You go ahead, I can't run
with this pain in my legs.

1401
01:49:23,917 --> 01:49:25,898
Ya Ali! My dear.

1402
01:49:27,672 --> 01:49:28,819
Come on in. Come in.

1403
01:49:38,621 --> 01:49:42,271
Ya Allah! Dad! Dad!

1404
01:49:43,106 --> 01:49:44,566
How are you dad?

1405
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,652
- Majid!
- What? Come in.

1406
01:49:46,759 --> 01:49:50,617
- Dad! Daddy!
- Thank God, he's fine.

1407
01:49:50,618 --> 01:49:51,869
You okay, dad?

1408
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:53,433
I'm fine.

1409
01:49:54,268 --> 01:49:57,188
You're okay.
That was such a scare, dad.

1410
01:49:57,814 --> 01:49:59,274
Where's you mother?

1411
01:49:59,275 --> 01:50:01,048
She's in the stairs.
Let me call her.

1412
01:50:01,049 --> 01:50:02,404
Majid, don't call her.

1413
01:50:02,614 --> 01:50:04,574
- Let's go!
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.

1414
01:50:05,326 --> 01:50:08,640
Majid! If mother doesn't see him, she'd
think something must've happened to him.

1415
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:09,606
Let her see he's fine.

1416
01:50:09,915 --> 01:50:12,730
Hello, sorry. We were in such a
hurry that we didn't notice you.

1417
01:50:13,878 --> 01:50:14,538
That's alright.

1418
01:50:14,565 --> 01:50:16,720
Sit down, dad. What
are you getting up for?

1419
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,720
I thought mother better come up and
see you, and then we'll leave. Sit.

1420
01:50:20,346 --> 01:50:23,996
We're in no hurry. Let him sit
down until he gets better.

1421
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:26,082
We're really sorry, mister.

1422
01:50:26,605 --> 01:50:30,671
Dad, just sit down. Can you?

1423
01:50:30,776 --> 01:50:32,132
Yeah, I'm alright.

1424
01:50:32,342 --> 01:50:33,280
Majid!

1425
01:50:34,949 --> 01:50:37,765
What is it, ma? We're here.

1426
01:50:37,974 --> 01:50:41,520
Come. Thank God, dad's sitting here.
He's all right.

1427
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:46,213
What is, dad? Huh?

1428
01:51:02,793 --> 01:51:05,712
- It's nothing, ma.
- What happened?

1429
01:51:08,112 --> 01:51:09,259
What happened to you?

1430
01:51:16,246 --> 01:51:18,748
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?

1431
01:51:24,797 --> 01:51:26,883
See what you're doing to me and yourself?

1432
01:51:28,865 --> 01:51:32,097
Oh, God.
Thank you so much, God!

1433
01:51:34,392 --> 01:51:37,103
God knows, on our way here I
vowed to give away a hundred

1434
01:51:37,104 --> 01:51:39,815
different charities, just to
hear his voice one more time.

1435
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:42,423
Thank God.

1436
01:51:47,012 --> 01:51:48,680
How many times did
I tell you not to go?

1437
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:52,957
My dear! I don't want you to work.
I don't.

1438
01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:56,963
Darling, you said, "Majid called,
I have to go, I'll be back soon."

1439
01:51:57,025 --> 01:51:58,902
Soon, you call this "soon"?

1440
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:01,197
Mom, we have to thank these guys,
they stayed with him all this time.

1441
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:04,118
Or else, we don't know what
would've happened to dad.

1442
01:52:04,119 --> 01:52:06,204
We really don't know how to thank you.
That was so kind of you.

1443
01:52:06,205 --> 01:52:09,855
May God give you back, miss.

1444
01:52:10,377 --> 01:52:14,131
He's my whole life, mister.
Thank you so much.

1445
01:52:14,966 --> 01:52:16,322
You gave me my life back.

1446
01:52:16,635 --> 01:52:19,555
He's all I've got.

1447
01:52:20,286 --> 01:52:22,163
Come on, mom, stop it.

1448
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:26,335
Get up, let's go.

1449
01:52:36,451 --> 01:52:38,788
Did you take all your stuff, dad?
Where's your cellphone?

1450
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:40,832
Car keys.

1451
01:52:41,353 --> 01:52:43,647
Where's his glasses? Don't
leave without his glasses.

1452
01:52:44,274 --> 01:52:47,297
I've got it... Come here,
I'll give it to you.

1453
01:52:47,924 --> 01:52:52,721
- You go, I'll get it.
- Majid, the glasses...

1454
01:52:55,642 --> 01:52:56,789
This way.

1455
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,378
What business? You just
saved his life, son.

1456
01:53:03,048 --> 01:53:05,384
No, mister, we've put you
through enough trouble already.

1457
01:53:05,655 --> 01:53:07,219
It's nothing fancy, you know.

1458
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:10,348
Come on, this way.

1459
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,581
Well, if there's anything
to do, just let me...

1460
01:53:14,103 --> 01:53:16,606
No, let him come himself.
Come on, this way.

1461
01:53:25,991 --> 01:53:27,243
You guys go.

1462
01:53:38,192 --> 01:53:40,173
Majid. Let me...

1463
01:54:26,888 --> 01:54:29,056
How much money did you leave
in the room, that night?

1464
01:54:29,287 --> 01:54:31,164
Huh?

1465
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:33,460
How much money did you
leave in the room?

1466
01:54:34,503 --> 01:54:35,232
I didn't count.

1467
01:55:55,522 --> 01:55:56,982
What happened, dad?

1468
01:55:57,921 --> 01:56:00,007
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!

1469
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:04,179
What happened to you?
He's sick again.

1470
01:56:04,492 --> 01:56:07,621
What are these?
Where were these?

1471
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:10,249
- Come on, sit down a little.
- Is it your heart, dad?

1472
01:56:12,315 --> 01:56:15,964
Let him sit for a while.
Come on, this way.

1473
01:56:18,051 --> 01:56:20,553
We can't take him like this. Majid!

1474
01:56:20,762 --> 01:56:21,909
Majid, hurry up!

1475
01:56:34,214 --> 01:56:36,508
- We're almost there, dad.
- Esmat!

1476
01:56:36,822 --> 01:56:38,386
I'm hear, dear.

1477
01:56:40,681 --> 01:56:41,723
Come on, mom.

1478
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:44,018
Watch it, don't drop him.

1479
01:56:46,939 --> 01:56:50,067
- Esmat! Esmat!
- What? Darling, I'm here.

1480
01:56:51,112 --> 01:56:53,197
What happened to you?
Ya Abalfazl!

1481
01:56:54,658 --> 01:56:55,701
Stretch his legs.

1482
01:57:02,585 --> 01:57:04,712
- God! Dad! You hear me? Dad!
- Where are his pills?

1483
01:57:06,757 --> 01:57:09,572
Where are his pills?
Search his pockets.

1484
01:57:10,512 --> 01:57:12,806
Stretch his legs! Hurry up!

1485
01:57:15,516 --> 01:57:17,601
- God help us!
- Dad, breathe!

1486
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:20,313
- See if his pills are upstairs.

1487
01:57:30,324 --> 01:57:33,869
Miss! Miss! Are my dad's pills here?

1488
01:57:34,705 --> 01:57:36,686
He's got sick again,
he's lying in the stairs.

1489
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:50,764
Mister, for God's sake, will
you get on the way right away?

1490
01:57:51,808 --> 01:57:54,436
- Yes, miss, just give some time
for my colleagues to get there.

1491
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:58,440
Just follow my instructions. His
legs must be straight, not bent.

1492
01:58:04,113 --> 01:58:05,156
He's lying face up.

1493
01:58:13,916 --> 01:58:15,584
Mister, he's all blue in the face.

1494
01:58:16,628 --> 01:58:20,799
Just keep doing what I told you. If you
get tired, let someone else do it.

1495
01:58:26,222 --> 01:58:30,184
Mister, he's not moving... No, no, nothing.
He's not moving at all.

1496
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,215
Mister, can we put his
pill under his tongue?

1497
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:42,074
- No, no, miss, don't give him
nothing, just do what I told you.

1498
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:44,723
Just make sure his legs,
are stretched, not bent.

1499
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:45,396
Yeah, yeah.

1500
01:59:27,121 --> 01:59:28,581
Guys, please hurry up!

1501
01:59:32,961 --> 01:59:35,151
- Hello, where's the patient?
- He's inside.

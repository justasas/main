is that the implication
stated within the addendum

- Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.

even the wrong word,

has implications,

are fairly self-evident, right?

I mean, perhaps
not through and through,

144
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,081
but let's be clear.

145
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,849
This endeavor
would not have received

and classification

were not self-evident.

148
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,921
- I agree
they're self-evident,

149
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,256
but I still feel
they need to be aired,

150
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,626

- Why is it self-evident?

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,074
- Well, I mean...

159
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,377

of doing something like this.

163
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,420
- Right.

164
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,922
Well, I guess, uh,
I guess I feel

165
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,891
there are two things wrong
with what you just said.

166
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:04,195
Um, first of all, we were
told from--promised, actually,

167
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,965
that any of the applied
mathematical results

168
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,333
of our findings
would be our own

169
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,835
and they would not
be classified.

170
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,003
They'd be government
purpose rights,

171
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,204
but that's it, right?

172
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,040
He changed that
somewhere along the way.

173
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,876
Second of all, to assume
that any of us as mathematicians

174
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,278
can sufficiently gauge
the real-world implications

175
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,213
of this project, it's--

176
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,815
[chuckles]
It's hubris.

177
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,116
I mean, it's--it's--

178
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,252
it's just hubris.

179
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,055
- Wow.

180
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:33,391
How do you ever get a date
with such an academic mind?

181
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,126
- I'm not sure I understand
what you're suggesting.

182
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,295
- I simply dazzle them
with my card tricks.

183
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,964
I mean, come on, guys,
this is...

184
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,068
I feel like this is the argument
that evolutionary scientists

185
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,470
have over steak dinner
and a glass of wine, right?

186
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,472
It's--one solves
one problem,

187
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,840
and the other one
looks back and says,

188
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,141
"well,
what was before that?"

189
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,342
And then,
"well, what was before that?

190
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,178
What was before that?"
I mean...

191
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
How do we get our minds
around something like that?

192
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,915
- Why don't you read
my addendum?

193
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,917
- I did,
and I find your assumptions

194
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,885
to be inadequate,
among other things.

195
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,887
- I don't think anyone
is saying here

196
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,889
that we can accurately
forecast

197
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,057
the implications
of our research

198
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,026
50 years from now,

199
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,028
if I can understand
what you're trying to say.

200
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,496
Just like Oppenheimer
and fermi

201
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,164
couldn't possibly
predict the consequences

202
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,999
of the Los Alamos research.

203
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,202
- This also begs the question
of responsibility as well.

204
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,803
- How could we
possibly discuss that?

205
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,071
- At Los Alamos,
they didn't--

206
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,807
- this...Is not Los Alamos.

207
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,847
- What did you say?

208
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,001
- How's your daughter doing?
She talking yet?

209
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,505
- As much as I do appreciate
the smalltalk, horton,

210
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,039
it feels awkwardly
out of place

211
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,275
given your little
Los Alamos project.

212
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,778
- Manhattan.
- What's that?

213
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,280
- Freakin' brits.
It was the Manhattan project.

214
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,015
- Right.

215
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,152
- Yeah, yeah,
this is all s.C.I. Classified.

216
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,021
So, you know, if you
divulge anything, the NSA--

217
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,422
I think that's who
we've got over there--

218
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,158
they'll, uh,
they'll assassinate you.

219
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,425
Probably torture you first.

220
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,194
- Oh, very charming.

221
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,496
Guess I should put away
my spy camera then.

222
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,497
- [Chuckles]

223
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,065
"But, uh, but,

224
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,567
"Mr. president,
he'll see everything.

225
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,235
He'll see the big board!"

226
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,870
- Precisely the idea.

227
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,106
Where the bloody hell
is Los Alamos, anyway?

228
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,375
- Ah, it's new Mexico.
The desert.

229
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,477
- Hmm. What's it like
to live in the desert?

230
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,212
I do wonder.
- How should I know?

231
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,547
I'm from South Philly.

232
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,317
- Either way, this is certainly
not Los Alamos.

233
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,019
- Wait, what'd you say?

234
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,554
- Hmm? What,
"this is certainly not Los--"

235
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,022
- no, no, no.
Before that.

236
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,590
- Oh. I do wonder
what it's like

237
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,992
to, you know, live in a--
- right, right.

238
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,394
Live in a desert.

239
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,599
Hugh, what are some
characteristics

240
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,435
of a desert?

241
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,469
- It's hot.

242
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,271
- Right, yeah, and what else?

243
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,874
- No water.
No rain.

244
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,311
Cactuses or--cactus.
Cacti.

245
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,380
- Sand.
- Sure.

246
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:14,085
- Millions of grains of sand.

247
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,054
What if I, uh,
I took something,

248
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,122
like a-a quid coin, okay?

249
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,124
And I buried it in the sand.

250
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,559
It's buried,
you have no idea where it is,

251
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,961
and I ask you to find it.

252
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,028
How long would that
take you?

253
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,496
- [Scoffs]
Well--

254
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,298
- years, right?
I mean, millions of years,

255
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,466
if the desert
were big enough.

256
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,601
- Sure.

257
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,604
- What if I melted the sand?

258
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:37,008
Took all the sand in the desert
and melted it.

259
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,279
Glass.

260
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,016
The whole desert
becomes one big sheet of glass.

261
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,151
So now, finding the coin
is easy, right?

262
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,154
You just--
you see it floating there.

263
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,925
Change the sand to glass,

264
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,060
and finding the coin
is trivial.

265
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,308
Hugh, I think you're
gonna need to leave now.

266
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,944
- Oh, yes.

267
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,547
- No, seriously, I think
you really need to leave.

268
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,588
- What do you think?

269
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,403
What do you think?

270
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,437
- I'm sorry?

271
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,639
- Come on.

272
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,408
- Oh, I, uh,
think we should

273
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,410
wait for him to arrive
before that's discussed.

274
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,345
- Perhaps a consensus
amongst us

275
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,646
would be helpful
when he does arrive.

276
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,348
- Well, I think
it's fairly clear

277
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,251
what he'll say our
responsibility is: Nothing.

278
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,519
Our talents were used
on the chalkboards

279
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,720
in the classrooms,

280
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,555
and ultimately
composed here.

281
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,390
And that may be where
they'd like to leave things,

282
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,392
but if history
has an precedent,

283
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,195
we're at the forefront
of a new technocratic reality.

284
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,663
Just like Oppenheimer.

285
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,565
We really should be thinking
about mathematicians

286
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,133
as politicians.

287
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,335
- But those guys
had no precedent.

288
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,270
And, quite frankly,
after seeing

289
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,105
what Oppenheimer
endured after trinity,

290
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,140
I'm not sure any of us
is prepared for that.

291
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,109
- Regardless, it's reality.

292
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,711
We've all thought about it,
I mean--

293
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,713
- I'm gonna say that I object
to these comparisons.

294
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,748
- Why?
- It's just uncomfortable.

295
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,350
- I understand that,
but why?

296
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,385
- Perhaps it's heartburn,
but who knows?

297
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,220
- [Scoffs]
Come on.

298
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,456
- Because, at the penultimate
achievement of his career,

299
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,623
the only thing Oppenheimer
could remember

300
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,325
was the bhagavad gita:

301
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,296
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

302
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,098
- I don't know
who's more naive--

303
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,700
the one who believes ignoring
the problem is righteous,

304
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,168
or the one who believes
this discovery

305
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,471
is equivalent
to the atomic bomb.

306
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,705
- I think you miss my point.

307
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,340
- Whereas their work
was built around

308
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,376
threat, fear,
and ultimately destruction.

309
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,479
Her work was one of discovery
and knowledge--that's it.

310
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,314
- You can't overlook the fact
that their research

311
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,182
blazed the way
for numerous scientific

312
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,518
and medical achievements that
have saved countless lives...

313
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,353
- I understand that.
- And facilitated the growth

314
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,222
of the global economy
as we know it.

315
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,391
Nuclear power provides
20% of the U.S.'s

316
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,193
and 30% of the eu's
electrical power.

317
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,729
- I understand that,
but the aims of their project--

318
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,664
they knew what
their objective was.

319
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,099
It was destructive.

320
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,734
I mean, who are we
kidding here?

321
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,803
- No, wrong. It was political,
just as this is.

322
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,638
- I'm sorry,
you just said a moment ago

323
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,106
that there
was no possible way

324
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,408
they could understand
the consequences

325
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,776
of what they were doing.

326
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,511
Now you say their ultimate aim
was destructive?

327
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,779
- No...No.

328
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,347
There is a massive difference

329
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,215
between understanding
what you have to do

330
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,584
and not knowing how history
will view your achievements--

331
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,153
or maybe failure.

332
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,687
If you recall,
there was widespread fear

333
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,090
at Los Alamos that an
uncontrolled nuclear explosion

334
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,258
could set the atmosphere
on fire,

335
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,659
ending life on earth.

336
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,428
We're talking about
an atomic, fissile

337
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,164
particle chain reaction here,
right?

338
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,565
Certainly, these men
knew that the device

339
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,567
they were building
was destructive.

340
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,402
But how could they possibly
have understood

341
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,337
how their endeavor
would affect the future?

342
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,241
Like if it would result
in international, global--

343
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,709
I don't know--
cosmic horror?

344
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,379
If society somehow survived
such a catastrophe,

345
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,847
they'd most likely be viewed,

346
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,416
whether through propaganda
or not, as villains,

347
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,586
worse than Hitler.

348
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,623
- Well, the truth, I think,
lies somewhere in between.

349
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,360
Why don't we shift gears
before he arrives

350
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,664
and discuss if there
are any issues within the body

351
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,299
of the findings.

352
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,867
I know we applied
our own expertise

353
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,703
to portions of the report
that fit our field,

354
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,573
often independently
and while our work

355
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,609
was rigorously examined
throughout the process.

356
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,845
So...

357
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,615
I guess, are there
any questions?

358
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,153
Or issues
with anyone's work?

359
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,559
Ultimately, everything
was functional.

360
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:54,298
But no one has any questions,
comments?

361
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,835
- I had a hard time
validating your proof, doctor.

362
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,471
Computationally, on the surface,
it appeared correct.

363
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,807
It was quite elegant,
really.

364
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,543
But, upon closer examination,
a potential error--

365
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,178
- really?

366
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,413
I think we all know
it's airtight.

367
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,616
I mean, we made our
nondeterministic processor.

368
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,417
You can hold it
in your hand.

369
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,653
It's simply a physical
representation of the algorithm.

370
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,888
- To be blunt,
I'm still not convinced

371
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,523
that your final
computation class

372
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,491
is computable
in linear time.

373
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,627
- What, are you nervous?
It's right.

374
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,595
We were more than methodical,
rigorous, even.

375
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,230
Review upon review--
it's right.

376
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,499
- I agree--the processor
wouldn't compute

377
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,535
what it's computing
if p wasn't equal to np.

378
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,204
- That's right.

379
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,705
- [Sighs]

380
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,743
Let me put it another way.

381
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,645
The mind's flexibility--

382
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,815
or maybe I should
say performance--

383
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,553
is dramatically hindered
the more mileage you put on it.

384
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,855
I mean, Christ,
it's basically the theme

385
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,890
of Hardy's biography.
- Jim...

386
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,927
- P=np is the most significant
problem

387
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,662
in theoretical
computer science

388
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,397
and mathematical
complexity theory.

389
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,300
Nearly every area of knowledge
is based on the idea

390
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,535
that brute-force search
is hard, okay?

391
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,771
That it takes a long time.

392
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,241
We just showed
that it's easy.

393
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,276
Everything changes.
[Notebook hits table]

394
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,781
This could pave the way
for--it's--

395
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,287
when we prove that p=np,

396
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,491
it has to be done right.

397
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,980
[Cards shuffling]

398
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,951
- Pick a card.

399
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,387
Come on, pick a card.

400
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,763
Remember that
and put it back in the deck.

401
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,733
Okay, now, if I were
a lousy magician, I would--

402
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,401
- you are a lousy magician.

403
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,769
- The best way
to find your card

404
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,404
would be to go through each
and ask you,

405
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,572
"is this your card?"

406
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,573
- No.

407
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,974
- No.

408
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,743
No. And so on.

409
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,645
And this would take forever,
of course.

410
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,979
Imagine a deck
with a million cards.

411
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,914
- I couldn't possibly.

412
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,683
- Right. Now...
[Cards shuffling]

413
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,519
If I had this problem with
our nondeterministic oracle,

414
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,854
I would simply
give it the deck,

415
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:33,357
and I would say,
"which is the right card?"

416
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,992
Employ a little nondeterministic
computation,

417
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,562
and...
What do the French say?

418
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,930
- <i>Voila?</i>

419
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,534
- <i>Voila.</i>

420
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,641
- Quite a visual presentation.

421
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,576
So, if I can
get this straight,

422
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,746
in your explanation,
that I'm pretty sure I saw

423
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,682
somewhere between
the 10th and 11th grade,

424
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:01,786
the nondeterministic step
to simplify p=np

425
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,022
and, ultimately, the world,
works in linear time

426
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,491
because the cards say so?

427
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,760
You're simply suggesting
that your algorithm

428
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,929
is fundamental?

429
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:16,634
- No...

430
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,337
I'm simply suggesting
that it's magic.

431
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,739
[Applause]

432
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,809
[Cheers and applause]

433
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,814
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

434
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,415
And thank you, Dr. acuri,

435
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,352
for that overwhelmingly kind
introduction.

436
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,721
I'm, um, very humbled
and honored

437
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,856
to be in front of you
this evening.

438
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,125
Um, not just because
I'm a room

439
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,626
full of brilliant
mathematicians,

440
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,095
which, of course, I am.

441
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,397
But because,
not too long ago,

442
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,499
I was, in fact,
denied admission

443
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,533
to this very university.

444
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,836
[Laughter]

445
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:55,139
Uh, not enough extracurriculars,
I suppose.

446
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,075
[Chuckles]
Um...

447
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,745
This symposium's focus
is on the future of mathematics,

448
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,114
and I've been asked
to succinctly address that topic

449
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,915
with you here tonight.

450
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,852
It's difficult, of course,
to contextualize

451
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,487
something so vague
and broad

452
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:12,390
as the future
of mathematics.

453
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:16,627
If the past is any indication
of what is yet to come,

454
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,531
um, that answer
could very well be anything.

455
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,033
But I don't think many of you
would find that summary

456
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:27,638
very adequate, so I will
attempt to do better.

457
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,807
Let's, uh, let's begin
by taking stock

458
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,976
of where we are presently.

459
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,178
The extraordinary application
of mathematics

460
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,580
has allowed us luxuries
and necessities

461
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,948
such as mobile phones,

462
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,719
GPS navigation,
automatic dish--dishwashers.

463
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,989
It's allowed us computer games,
portable televisions,

464
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,557
compact disc players.

465
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,592
It's allowed us
high-definition,

466
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,494
organic food distribution,

467
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,564
airplanes,
calculator wristwatches.

468
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,066
It's allowed radio control,
lasik eye surgery,

469
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,903
laser brain redaction,
noninvasive arthroscopy.

470
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:02,106
It's allowed g5s, c-4,

471
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,109
and weapons-grade u-235.

472
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,977
It's allowed
artificial hearts

473
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,614
and heartless
artificial intelligence.

474
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,151
It's allowed blackberries--
I hope they're all silent--

475
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,221
iPhones and all the other
portable devices

476
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,757
that enslave us to the man,

477
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,525
keep us chained
to the ever-growing

478
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,628
corporate contingency
of this world.

479
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,232
It's allowed Facebook,
MySpace,

480
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,000
and all the other
pervasive web apps

481
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,069
that enable
cutthroat enablers

482
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,038
and expedite
the greedy infiltration

483
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,674
and perversion
of our youth.

484
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:41,011
In short, it's allowed
the good, the bad,

485
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,048
and everything else.

486
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,117
[Clock ticking]

487
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:11,041
[Approaching footsteps]

488
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,547
- Gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

489
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,215
I'm sorry to be late.

490
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,727
Before I forget, would you
just pass those around?

491
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:32,563
They're from the president.

492
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,911
Has everyone eaten?
Everyone's well?

493
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:54,151
I think that today is
a culmination of many things,

494
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,186
many emotions.

495
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,123
And I'm--I'm here
to say thank you and--

496
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,258
I guess to provide
maybe a little closure

497
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,563
to a process that I'm sure
has seemed quite endless.

498
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,632
Now, I don't want to drag
this out and make it too long,

499
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,734
but I've been instructed--

500
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,636
well, actually,
pretty much ordered--

501
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,239
to make sure you guys leave here
happy and fulfilled.

502
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,042
How's that go?

503
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:22,780
Hall hath no fury
like a mathematician scorned?

504
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,749
All right, now...
It has been over a year

505
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,618
since we were all
in the same room.

506
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,787
Does anyone have any questions
that, hopefully, I can answer?

507
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,626
No?

508
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,127
All right, well,
I've got a brief agenda

509
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,729
that I want to run through,

510
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,665
so let's just pass these
around, all right?

511
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,640
First item is the order
of compensation.

512
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,208
$10 million annuities
have been established

513
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,077
in each of your names.

514
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,045
All you need to do
is check the appropriate box

515
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,380
next to the payment method.

516
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:59,216
- Direct deposit?

517
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,051
- Pardon me?

518
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,687
- Will this be direct deposit?

519
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,255
- However your research
stipends were paid,

520
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,657
this will be the same.

521
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,692
Does that work?

522
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,060
Now, including
your annual stipends,

523
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,328
has anyone had any issues
at all

524
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,330
with their payments
thus far?

525
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,833
I hope not.

526
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,401
All right, well,
your stipends will continue

527
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,670
for another six months
for any supplemental research

528
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,904
that may be needed.

529
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,073
But hopefully not.

530
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,076
And that brings your total
funding to approximately--

531
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,911
well, not approximately--

532
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,981
to exactly $22 million
U.S. dollars,

00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,984
and the annuity will ultimately
pay out more than that.

534
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,655
Not bad for a few years'
research, is it?

535
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,290
Gentlemen, before we go
to the next item,

536
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,293
I want to express to you
the level of gratitude

537
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,730
[voice distorting deeply]
The president and the country

538
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,800
owe you.

[Static]

00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,150
This is no small moment
in history.

00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,387
Next is the non-disclosure
agreement.

542
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,923
I know we have visited
and revisited this issue

543
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,125
many times over
the last few years.

544
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,895
It's a very critical one.

545
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,698
The second document reiterates
the legal ramifications

546
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,133
if any information
is published or broadcast

547
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,270
without the dod
or NSA's consent,

548
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,205
which basically
means never.

549
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,075
- I know this project itself
is classified.

550
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,243
Is there any intention
of ultimately releasing

551
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,745
the findings
to the community?

552
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,714
We all have
a lot of colleagues

553
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,149
whose applied research
could benefit from this.

554
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,752
I mean, I'm talking about
methods to cure cancer,

555
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,755
establish a causal connection
to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's--

556
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,123
- right, right,
we understand that,

557
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,858
and I want to assure you
that the government

558
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,027
will be very thoughtful
to those issues.

559
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,296
And we'll probably take those
on a case-by-case basis,

560
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,331
but for right now,
I will have to say no.

561
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,935
It will remain as a classified
national security asset.

562
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,738
- I'm sorry, that's not
what we signed up for.

563
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,139
- Well, from the outset,

564
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,807
I don't think anyone
could have predicted

565
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,442
the extent of your
accomplishments.

566
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,212
And with the sensitivity
of the findings,

567
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,114
it is in our country's
best interests

568
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:13,517
to make sure
they remain safeguarded.

569
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,187
- So if we were
to publish anything

570
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,388
in, say, a trade journal--

571
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,290
- you could be--
and, of course, it would

572
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,260
depend on what was discussed--
but you could be in violation

573
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,195
of the program's nda,
and as a result,

574
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,499
you could be arrested
for treason.

575
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,335
Now, your security clearances
will be terminated,

576
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,071
I believe within the same
six-month time frame.

577
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,273
After that, you'll
no longer have access

578
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,343
to the communications channel
or the secured network

579
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:43,247

to coordinate with each other.

580
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,849

I don't really know
who you give this spiel to.

585
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,828
But doesn't it seem
somewhat ironic,

586
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,230
given your present audience?

587
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:03,534
- I'm sorry.
I don't follow you.

588

means is that,

589
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,304
if there were
a secured network,

590
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,441
like, uh, siprnet or jwics,
that we wanted access to,

591
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:15,245
well, um...
We'd just hack in and take it.

00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,284
Well, I am sorry
to disappoint you,

594
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,252
but the defense system
that you just referenced

595
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,189
is not part of any network
that you have access to.

596
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,957
- Well, we're sorry
to disappoint you,

597
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,426
but just the fact that those
systems are on any network

598
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,961
means they're vulnerable.

599
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,162
Where was it, doctor,
that we developed

600
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,831
the system
to infiltrate siprnet?

601
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,465
Uh, Princeton?
- Sure, yeah.

602
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,034
And that was before we had
our nondeterministic process.

00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:38,335

- It was practically

604
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,070
my doctoral thesis.
- Yes, of course.

You have just admitted
to seven felony counts

off my hard drive?

took this process

00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,318
a bit more seriously,

613
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,053
we could get out of here
that much sooner.

of the addendum.

were under the impression

that, in fact, documenting
any of the system's applications

was, uh, I guess
not in the spirit

of this project's
original intentions.

to include the supplement

to apologize for that.

let me put it another way.

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,094
You have plenty
of mathematicians at the NSA,

641

baseline level intelligence.

642

of people, no one even knows
of your involvement.

651

So whatever applications
your system may provide for,

00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,760

including these findings

655

was almost a responsibility,

that logic slowly evaporates,

and I'm left with the idea
that if something terrible

659

00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,904
trillions of dollars
worth of information.

706
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,472
- Gentlemen--
- I'm not sure a value

707
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,174
can really be put on that level
of information.

708
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,309
- True, but we can roughly
quantify things here.

709
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,844
Right?
I mean, let's think.

710
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,848
Chinese gdp is around
$3.2 trillion U.S. dollars.

711
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,617
Any cryptosystem
that uses pspace algorithms,

712
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,753
which is essentially
their entire infrastructure,

713
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,555
could easily be accessed.

714
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,423
- Well, that may work for a
particular aspect of a network,

715
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,625
say, a financial institution's
records,

716
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,228
but other systems use
a different crypto algorithm.

717
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,563
- Come on.
- You can't crack it,

718
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,264
because it's
a different problem.

719
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,866
- That's utterly ridiculous.

720
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,901
We're not even talking
cutting-edge theory here.

721
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,470
Gary Johnson,
guys in the '70s

722
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,838
showed that,
fundamentally,

723
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,308
all these complex
mathematical problems--

724
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,244
knapsack, sat, whatever--
they're all the same problem.

725
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,912
- Solve one, solve all.
- That's what this is.

726
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,847
That's what np-complete
means.

727
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,916
Modern cryptography
is based on the, I guess,

728
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:02,919
now-outdated reality
that some problems

729
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:06,590
are just too computationally
expensive to brute force, right?

730
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,225
They just take too long
to try every answer.

731
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,994
So introduce
the nondeterministic processor

732
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,396
and problems that once
took millions of years to solve,

733
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,232
solved in minutes.

734
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,600
- I appreciate the lecture,

735
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,934
and I do understand
the fundamentals,

736
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,970
but my guys'
theoretical research

737
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,505
points to the fact
that separate networks,

738
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,641
separate anything,
requires separate grids

739
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,943
with distinct
computational problems.

740
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,446
- Oh, your guys?

741
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,581
- Yes, rand.

742
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,917
- It all boils down
to the nondeterministic oracle.

743
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,752
With it,
with the processor,

744
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,821
all problems
in p and np space

745
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,889
can be computed
in reasonable time.

746
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,359
Key searches, factoring,
discrete logs--

747
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,295
you can break any cryptosystem
in the world

748
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,497
if you have the will
and, I guess,

749
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,999
the software program
to do so.

750
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,268
- Not even a Chinese
hybrid cryptosystem

751
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,536
could prevent
or even acknowledge an attack.

752
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,572
- Nope.

753
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:57,807
Anyways, in my opinion,
this works more as a weapon,

754
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,310
I guess, by subtraction
or destruction,

755
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,279
much in the same way
as a conventional weapon,

756
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,347
as opposed to, say,
some sort of, I don't know,

757
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,416
intergovernmental larceny.
- Meaning?

758
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,652
- Meaning that it's impractical
to embezzle Chinese money

759
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,987
to, say, fund a federal
education bill, okay?

760
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,023
If you want more money,
just print more.

761
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,557
And at this level,
it'll have little effect

762
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,825
on their economy.

763
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,627
- And, if you're somehow
discovered,

764
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,329
you've essentially
declared war on a superpower,

765
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,463
and all you have
to show for it

766
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,698
are a few cleaner schools.

767
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,767
- Well, it could be worse.

768
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,402
- Really, the only way
I see it

769
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,070
would be to systematically
attack the asset.

770
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,406
Basically, cripple it,
take it out.

771
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,741
- I have to say, it's much
easier to discuss application

772
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,510
when it's contextualized
like this.

773
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,779
- So say you're about to launch
a cyber-attack on China,

774
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,380
what would logically
be your first target?

775
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:38,682
- Power plants.

776
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,083
- Why would you do that?

777
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,352
- Kill the power,
stifle the defensive grid.

778
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,553
The country would be
most vulnerable.

779
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,988
- Yeah, but if you
cut the power,

780
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,456
then nothing's connected--
how can you hack

781
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,824
a network
that's not online?

782
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,559
No, I think if you want
to use this as a weapon,

783
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,927
first, you crush their
entire communications system.

784
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,363
Basically act
as the country's brain.

785
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,732
You can receive and transmit
anything you like.

786
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,467
Mass hysteria, paranoia.

787
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,935
Almost like
a water-based toxin.

788
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,071
You could tear the country
apart.

789
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:04,341
I know China
is a lodestone here,

790
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,675
but I believe
it would be totally naive

791
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,410
to ignore our allies--

792
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,079
Israel, Russia, england.

793
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,647
If history has taught us
anything, it's that

794
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,916
allegiances are made
for self-gain.

795
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,951
There is literally
no one you can trust.

796
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,720
- I'm sure the trust issue
will go over well

797
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,421
with our allies
as we explain to them

798
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,957
why we completely hacked
their communication network.

799
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,492
- That's why
we don't get caught.

800
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:23,760
- Right. Look...

801
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,662
This is a foreign policy
discussion

802
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,430
none of us are prepared for,
and frankly,

803
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,832
we're all
out of our element.

804
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,734
- I don't know how much
that's true.

805
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,836
- Still, as much as I thought
our project's implications

806
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,538
should be discussed, the sudden
inclusion of the addendum

807
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,707
is a clear breach
of the original agreement.

808
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,477
- Listen, deception
or anything along those lines

809
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,646
was never part of our goal,
and not that it matters to you,

810
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,415
but this issue
is not as black and white

811
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,083
as you're making it sound.

812
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,986
Three weeks after the original
arrangement was discussed,

813
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,555
ghostnet penetrated
a secure NORAD defense system,

814
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,125
the contents of which
contain top-secret nuclear data,

815
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,127
including the longitudinal
coordinates

816
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,863
of every major missile battery
on the east coast.

817
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,498
Four months after that,

818
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,900
U.S. army call sign
database was hit.

819
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,703
That's information contained
on such a need-to-know basis

820
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,505
that it's generally accepted
that the president

821
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,874
doesn't need to know.

822
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,511
- Well, maybe you
should have hired us

823
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,146
to secure
those particular systems.

824
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,882
- In a way, we did.

825
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,750
My superiors and I find
a certain nobility

826
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,152
in your accomplishments.

827
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,721
Motives aside, you were
hired to do something

828
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,022
that godel, Von neumann,

829
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,590
everyone deemed impossible.

830
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,826
Yet you did it
for your country.

831
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,628
- Nobody's denying
that there's something noble

832
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,196
about the true pursuit
of knowledge

833
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:34,864
or national pride,
whatever.

834
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,833
But right now, I have
the sinking feeling

835
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:38,201
that all that's being lost.

836
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,769
- I merely did as asked.

837
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,604
- Yeah, so did the guards
at Auschwitz.

838
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,772
- You can go to hell
for saying that.

839
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,174
- Godwin's law strikes again.

840
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,042
- And in terms of
any contractual obligation

841
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,211
for present or future work,
as far as I'm concerned,

842
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,847
the inclusion of this addendum
is a clear breach of contract.

843
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,649
- Well, I guess, in that case,
the U.S. government

844
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,151
can just rip up your paychecks
and cancel the annuities.

845
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,920
What are you gonna do,
sue us?

846
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,154
- Maybe.

847
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,956
- Come on,
this is not a burden.

848
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,058
You serve at the pleasure
of the president.

849
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,661
This is your patriotic duty,
done immaculately well,

850
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,729
in an increasingly aggressive
world, okay?

851
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,466
- You--you speak to us
like we're lockheed

852
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,201
and we just developed
some fancy drone airplane

853
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,569
that may or may not
ever work.

854
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,070
- In a way, yes.

855
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,639
We look at your system
as a national asset.

856
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,074
- You are so stupid.

857
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,476
- Don't you condescend to me.

858
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,944
I am not here
to be ridiculed.

859
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,779
- Cooler heads, guys.
- No, you're here to--

860
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,814
to make sure we're happy.
You're a tire salesman.

861
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,816
- I will entertain
a civil discussion, yes,

862
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,685
but I'm not going to sit here
and be attacked.

863
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,920
- Yes, you will.
- Excuse me?

864
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,890
- It's your job to sit here.
You've been ordered to.

865
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,092
Though power may lie here,

866
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,727
ultimately,
it's the four of us

867
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,196
that must accept this fate,
not force-fed.

868
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,065
Truly, if this
is a patriotic duty,

869
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,733
as you're suggesting,

870
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,102
we could quite simply
conquer, destroy,

871
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,104
eradicate, and any other
destructive verb

872
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,240
you can think of,
without reprisal,

873
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,575
without mercy,
without consequence.

874
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:56,212
Surely some duty ought
to be paid to that reality.

875
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,615
- That's only the beginning.

876
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,850
- There's a war
being waged in cyberspace,

877
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,052
whether anyone
wants to admit it or not.

878
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,721
And for reasons
of economies of scale,

879
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:07,957
the United States and its allies
are dramatically behind.

880
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,960
Each week, the NSA estimates
that 233 computers

881
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,595
in the district
are compromised,

882
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,664
many of them
in classified facilities.

883
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,966
There is such an awareness
of cyber espionage

884
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,702
that the majority
of NSA correspondences

885
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,104
have reverted to handwritten
pieces of paper

886
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:22,305
that are either
burned after reading

887
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,173
or locked away.

888
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,676
Do you have any idea

889
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,278
the quantity of top-secret
correspondences that

890
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,114
are hand-delivered
by trusted couriers each year?

891
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,749
It's staggering.

892
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,818
This is the future
of the world.

893
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,986
This is now.

894
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,022
- This is bigger
than your secrets.

895
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:41,124
- As an American, I don't know
how anyone could say that.

896
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,593
- As a mathematician,
it's my conscience to say that.

897
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:44,961
- Then why don't you break it
down for me a little slower,

898
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,696
so I can understand.

899
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,198
- Hardy called mathematics
the language of the gods

900
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,268
because it, uh, it unlocks
and categorizes things

901
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,803
that the mind
can't possibly understand.

902
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,805
I-I don't expect you to
at this point.

903
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,775
But there are certain
foundational proofs, okay,

904
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,810
that lead
to more powerful conclusions.

905
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:04,948
To lock this away so you
can spy on somebody is criminal.

906
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,316
- Oh, that is so ignorant
and condescending

907
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,917
it makes me want to spit.

908
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,352
This was the most important
unsolved problem

909
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,120
in computer science.

910
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,289
To think you were the only
mathematicians in the world

911
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,892
focusing your efforts on this
is naive.

912
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,061
You're pawns, automatons.

913
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,263
We funded you.
We brought you together.

914
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,298
You were denied nothing.
Thought was fostered,

915
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,734
and, ultimately,
a solution was achieved.

916
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,235
You were a piece
of the puzzle.

917
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,905
A cog.
Separately, you're nothing.

918
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,307
You were the people
we mocked growing up.

919
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,209
But collectively,
you have altered world history

920
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:37,313
and put the proper power
in the proper hands.

921
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:41,317
But don't forget your origin.
You were made.

922
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:46,155
A soldered link
in a greater chain reaction.

- Dr. horton.

- [Laughs]
Oh.

930
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,683
Come on.

931
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,822
[Sighs]

932
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,924
Okay.

[Marker scraping]

934
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,015
Uh, it's a nice effort,

935
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,284
but let's focus more
on simplifying the algorithms

936
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:51,120
before drawing
the conclusions.

937
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,962
- You know, I can take care
of those inquiries for you.

938
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:02,131
- Yeah, well...

939
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,233
You know, I hate the ivory tower
we've got here.

940
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,903
I don't think Dr. Hawking's
had a conversation

941
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,871
with a student in,
like, 25 years.

942
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,106
- Well, I think
the voice machine

943
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,407
might have been
a slight impediment.

944
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,042
- [Chuckles]
- Though it is a hit

945
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,711
at the staff meetings.

946
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,013
Did you know, I found out
that when Isaac Newton

947
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,214
was a fellow at trinity,

948
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,784
he was in the office
right next door?

949
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:24,854
- Really?
- Yes.

950
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,394
- Hugh, what would you think

951
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,797
if there were an algorithm
that could prove itself,

952
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,900
like an automated
proof solver.

953
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,369
In other words, every time
it found a solution,

954
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:43,106
it also found another problem--
a new problem.

955
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:44,841
It would solve one
and then the next,

956
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,943
and then the next and...

957
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,045
It could iterate
ad infinitum.

958
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,214
- What would I think?
- Yeah.

959
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,015
- Well...

960
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,219
Since I'm assuming
you're talking about something

961
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,355
well beyond
the pythagorean theorem here,

962
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,090
I would say it's, uh,

963
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,392
a system that
provides solutions

964
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,161
without ever concluding.

965
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:08,531
You know, always posing
the question, "what's next?"

966
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,000
Almost like a computer worm.

967
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,468
- Yes, but bigger,
you know?

968
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,870
I'm thinking
more generalized.

969
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,938
Like, uh...

970
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,373
Well, it'll solve
any problem,

971
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,508
not just problems
it knows about.

972
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,042
Anything it encounters.

973
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,811
- That's impossible.

974
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,846
I mean, that's
practically impossible,

975
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:26,215
even in an applied sense.

976
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,885
Solving one problem
would just take forever.

977
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,253
It's np-complete.

978
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,988
- Well,
let's pretend that, uh,

979
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,322
it doesn't take forever.

980
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,857
P and np don't matter.

981
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,492
Finding solutions is fast.

982
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,127
- Really?
The only thing that powerful

983
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,796
would, uh, be the sun.

984
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,131
- Yeah, but let's keep it
more terrestrial,

985
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,401
like, uh, prometheus
or Newton's cradle, okay?

986
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,003
The only solution is that

987
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:51,207
there can't possibly be
any more solutions.

988
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,075
- Like a chain reaction?

989
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,144
- Yeah.

990
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,550
I mean...

991
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:03,820
What would you think?

992
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,322
- [Sighs]
I don't know.

993
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,162
- Thank you.

994
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,030
[Receding footsteps]

995
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,443
- Ahh.

996
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:02,945
I, uh, had dinner
a week or so ago

997
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,181
with the president
and the defense secretary.

998
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,116
Naturally,
they're very excited

999
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,918
about your work here,
and blah, blah, blah.

1000
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,653
Then I was able to slide
something past him.

1001
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,322
There's a farmer in
the provence region of France

1002
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,892
who has an extraordinarily
intelligent horse.

1003
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:18,194
He can actually give it
arithmetic problems,

1004
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,463
and it will tap out
the answer with its hoof.

1005
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,398
So we called in experts
and researchers

1006
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,499
to look at the horse,

1007
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,635
and they were fascinated
by him.

1008
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,336
As they tested him,
they found out

1009
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,472
that it could answer
algebra,

1010
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:31,674
euclidian geometry,
calculus,

1011
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,509
and even group theory.

1012
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,244
But when they
put a problem down

1013
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,046
that had cartesian
coordinates in it,

1014
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:38,214
the horse
just stood there,

1015
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,316
dumbly,
like any other horse.

1016
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,951
And I thought,
"that's pretty strange,

1017
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,086
considering how intelligent
the horse is."

1018
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,454
So then they called in
one more expert,

1019
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,223
who examined the horse,
and he figured out

1020
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,624
what the problem was.

1021
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,026
So I turned to the president,
and I said,

1022
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,627
"do you know
what the diagnosis was?"

1023
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,363
- Sure! It couldn't understand
cartesian coordinates

1024
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:59,402
because that'd be putting
"descartes" before the horse.

1025
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,442
Sorry, was that supposed
to be rhetorical?

1026
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,648
- [Grunts]
We're all very impressed.

1027
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,183
You know,
it's exhausting

1028
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,385
having someone like you
in the room,

1029
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:17,987
always with an answer.

1030
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,989
- If anything,
what you said brings to mind

1031
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,458
some issues of morality here,
since the discussion

1032
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,627
has shifted to, I guess,
a more applied arena.

1033
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,229
- How does what I said
bring you anywhere near there?

1034
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,665
- Who cares?
- No, I'm saying this

1035
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,701
is something I don't think
we've discussed.

1036
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:33,636
It doesn't directly deal with
our system's applications

1037
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,638
as much as, you know...

1038
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,006
- Playing God?

1039
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:38,674
- Well, I mean, come on.

1040
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,210
More like sabotage, theft,

1041
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,979
public secrets, espionage.

1042
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,014
The question just begs
to be asked:

1043
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,182
Just because you can
do something,

1044
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,717
does it mean you should?

1045
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,986
- Hypothetically, why not?
What's to stop someone?

1046
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,354
- I don't think anyone's
in the business

1047
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:54,090
of casually siphoning money
or secrets.

1048
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,025
There has to be some motive.
Impetus.

00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:11,086
The level
of self-absorption--

1220
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,888
- I was trying
to passively engage things,

1221
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,723
but it's now alarming how little
you seem to understand

1222
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:15,891
what you have right here--
- modern-day shamans,

1223
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,259
peddling the extraordinary.

1224
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,595
The world is not as complex
as you believe.

1225
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,763
This divisiveness is not as deep
as your imagination--

1226
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,732
- your oversimplification
is reckless!

1227
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,167
- And quite frankly, the total
tonnage of what I'm privy to

1228
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,102
and you are not would wake
a corpse from its grave!

1229
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,170
- Well, we're all
pretty smart guys.

1230
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,638
Why don't you enlighten us?

1231
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,173
- Because I don't really
care that much.

1232
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:32,808
I'm not interested
in broadening the perspectives

1233
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,510
of intelligentsia.
- You already said

1234
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,777
that your hope for our system
was that it might

1235
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,112
create a more cohesive
world order.

1236
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,146
What does that mean?

1237
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,214
- What are you looking for?

1238
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:40,516
- How 'bout some answers?

1239
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:43,852
- What do you want from me?

1240
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,759
[Softly] These meetings
can often be unpleasant.

1241
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:52,294
[Clears throat]

1242
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,231
You have been paid.

1243
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,867
Consider yourself debriefed.

1244
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,304
- Sit down.

1245
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,837
- [Sniffs]

1246
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,943
- I want a document drafted

1247
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:44,279
stating the proof p=np
belongs to the four of us.

1248
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,048
You can have the design
for the processor,

1249
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,250
classify it if you want,
but the proof,

1250
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,986
as originally promised,
is ours. Furthermore--

1251
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,287
- I'm not sure where you
get off instructing me

1252
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,855
to the fucking toilet.

1253
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,657
- Furthermore, I want
the classified addendum

1254
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,060
with any reference to our names
or applications removed.

1255
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,728
- This is not a negotiation.

1256
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,096
- Well, I suggest
you make it one.

1257
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,599
- What is any of that
going to do, hiding it?

1258
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,634
Now, I, for one,
would prefer this technology

1259
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:07,169
be licensed
to the private sector.

1260
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,804
Think about it--
it's the safest way

1261
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,672
to avoid what we all fear,
which is basically

1262
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:13,175
a monopoly--
geopolitically, corporately.

1263
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,077
I don't care.
License it to intel.

1264
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,245
License it to amd, anyone.

1265
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:18,780
The new
nondeterministic processor

1266
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,315
will blaze a trail
for the next generation

1267
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,117
of privatized
scientific advancement.

1268
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,152
Think about it,
predicting protein structures

1269
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,821
as np-complete.
- It won't happen.

1270
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,222
- What won't?
- What you're suggesting.

1271
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,958
It won't happen.
- Why?

1272
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,865
- It's something we should've
seen a long time ago.

1273
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,335
- It's more valuable to them
if it's kept a secret.

1274
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:43,005
- It's better for all of us.

1275
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,159
- I'm sorry.
So where do we stand here?

1276
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,396
- Well, in response
to Dr. horton's request,

1277
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:08,664
I have neither
the authority nor interest

1278
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,265
in altering the agreement,

1279
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,134
and any deviation from that
would be construed--

1280
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,803
again, by my superiors--
as a breach of contract

1281
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:18,440
and result in the forfeiture
of any future compensation.

1282
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,409
So I guess the question
you have to ask yourselves is:

1283
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,278
Where do you stand?

1284
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:40,395
- [Sighs]

1285
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,698
Whether any of us
could possibly understand

1286
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:47,369
the consequences of this...

1287
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:50,939
Only time will tell.

1288
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,475
As for me,
I'm satisfied.

1289
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:56,778
I'm in.
Give me the release.

1290
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,847
- Fine.

1291
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,994
Come on.
It's time.

1292
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,480
- I'm good.

1293
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,816
- Fine.

1294
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,257
[Sets pen down]

1295
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,218
- Doctor.

1296
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:46,488
- Professor.

1297
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,424
- How's it go again?

1298
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,196
- Boats against the current.

1299
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,000
- In 37 years
of mathematical rigor,

1300
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,536
I've been struck
by one constant truth--

1301
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:05,006
that the number is always
larger than my mind.

1302
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,176
This is too complicated
for any of us to understand,

1303
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:12,581
even you, doctor.

1304
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:17,419
I'm sorry, but I'm
washing my hands of it all.

1305
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,154
- Fine.

1306
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:59,094
- Admittedly, we all
come up a bit short today.

1307
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:00,996
None of us
can possibly understand

1308
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:03,131
the ramifications
of this proof.

1309
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,200
History has shown us
again and again that,

1310
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,502
with every generation,
the implications of p versus np

1311
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,437
grow greater, so...

1312
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,506
It's left to our imaginations
what this might mean

1313
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:15,577
in 20 years,
50 years, 100.

1314
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,546
But none of you--
I promise you this--

1315
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:21,082
none of you
understands the true power

1316
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,350
of what our system can do.

1317
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,252
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

1318
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,055
I'm so sick of your
condescending bullshit, okay?

1319
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:29,624
This entire "I'm holier
than thou" attitude

1320
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,526
I've had to sit through
for the past four years

1321
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:33,528
is nauseating.

1322
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,264
We've been dealt with fairly.
We've agreed to the terms.

1323
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,268
Suck it up, sign the paper,
and let's get out of here.

1324
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,637
- Doctor, you're outnumbered
and overruled.

1325
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,372
Your objections are sporting
and have been noted,

1326
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:48,310
but remember,
I'm not the enemy.

1327
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:49,678
- I have no choice...

1328
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,413
- I'm glad you see it
that way.

1329
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,648
- But to inform you that
the proof in its current state

1330
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,183
is incomplete.

1331
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:57,419
- Oh, come on.
This is absurd.

1332
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,421
- What do you mean,
incomplete?

1333
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:00,522
- I mean
that it wasn't extended

1334
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:02,557
to its fullest termination.

1335
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,329
The documentation obscures
the final computation class.

1336
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,331
The processor's oracle
lacks specificity.

1337
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:12,167
I, uh,
omitted some details in--

1338
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,568
- this is idiotic!

1339
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,470
There are three other men
at this table

1340
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,272
that have pored over
every aspect--

1341
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:18,740
diligence!
It's been built!

1342
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,175
- We still have
the implementation,

1343
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,609
the processor.

1344
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,078
- It's my design--
the classifications--

1345
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,379
- is it your design?
Really?

1346
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,114
All of it?
- What?

1347
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,417
- I'm sorry, what exactly
are you implying?

1348
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,992
- My system has the power
to shut it down.

1349
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,430
- I'm sorry, what?

1350
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:45,767
- My system has the power...

1351
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:50,171
To shut <i>it...</i>

1352
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,374
Down.

1353
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,511
- That's impossible.

1354
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,279
- No.
- Come on, doctor.

1355
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,049
Complexity theory,
chains.

1356
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:02,250
This is quite a stretch.

1357
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,752
- Not quite.

1358
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:05,720
Imagine it, crudely,

1359
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,323
as an executable form
of y2k.

1360
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:11,726
Any bank security function
on any grid will fail.

1361
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,395
Power networks,
telecommunication,

1362
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:15,096
corporate data,
will all shut down, okay?

1363
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:18,366
You see, every single system
has in common that it--

1364
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,135
I'm sorry.
You don't believe me.

1365
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:21,736
- This is insane.

1366
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:24,072
Excuse my language,
but you're a fuckin' moron.

1367
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,740
- Watch it, now.
- Best-case application,

1368
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,609
including the interface,
would allow a user

1369
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,244
limited access
to a single entity.

1370
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:31,246
- Of course.
It's like a military target.

1371
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,114
You can't destroy everything,
just what's in the crosshairs.

1372
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:34,282
- It's more like a lock pick--
you can only pick

1373
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,784
one lock at a time.

1374
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,352
But to broaden it
to the scope you're talking

1375
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:38,753
is simply absurd.
- No.

1376
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,455
- Oh, no?
- This is almost pathetic.

1377
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:42,524
- No, and you know,
from an applied perspective,

1378
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:43,758
it's not even
that complicated.

1379
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,360
You just need a bit more
imagination.

1380
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:47,062
- [Scoffs]
- Say you have a target, okay?

1381
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,596
A bank, right?

1382
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,098
We all know that
redundant security measures

1383
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,599
embedded within
the bank's framework,

1384
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,802
when triggered,
immediately shut down, okay?

1385
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:56,438
But picture
a simultaneous breach on, uh,

1386
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,206
on the bank's
telecommunications grid.

1387
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,774
All right?
It has the same limitations.

1388
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,543

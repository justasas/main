00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,100
<i>At the outbreak of World War II</i>

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>Germany increased its U-boat
production by 1000%.</i>

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,580
<i>Mass producing 17 new U-boats a month.</i>

4
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,900
<i>Hitler knew the key to winning
the war in Europe...</i>

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
<i>was to control the Atlantic.</i>

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,700
<i>And control it, they would.</i>

7
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,300
<i>By the end of 1942,
German U-boats working in groups...</i>

8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,500
<i>known as "wolfpacks",
sunk over 1,000 allied ships.</i>

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,180
<i>This success gave Germany
a decisive advantage.</i>

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,980
<i>They were winning the war,
and if this trend continued...</i>

11
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,980
<i>all of Europe would fall.</i>

12
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,500
IN ENEMY HANDS

13
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,300
<i>In January 1943, President Roosevelt,
and Prime Minister Churchill...</i>

14
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,980
<i>declared that stopping the U-boats
would be their top priority.</i>

15
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,780
<i>With the US fully committed to the war,
and new advances in technology...</i>

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>the allies strike back.</i>

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,980
<i>After losing an average
of only five U-Boats a month...</i>

18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,100
<i>Germany suffers its greatest losses
in what would be known as Black May.</i>

19
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,700
<i>That month, allies sink
and destroy 41 U-Boats.</i>

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,100
<i>8 out of every 10 U-boat sailors died.</i>

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,180
<i>The rain of the wolfpack was
rapidly drawing to a close.</i>

Dept. of the Navy
June 3, 1943

23
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,580
I've known you your whole life.

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm not going to embarrass you
with the details.

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,700
Your father was a good man.

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,180
A great soldier.

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,900
Thank you, Sir.

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,580
It's out of respect for him that
I just assume you didn't do this.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,100
We're not here to chase ghosts.

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Our job is to pursue an enemy...

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
and defeat it.

32
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,780
You certain that's what you wanna do?

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Absolutely.

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,380
When do you ship out?

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
In two weeks.

36
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,900
Monday after next...

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,700
we'll be ready.

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,380
Have you met your C.O.B. yet?

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,100
No Sir, Nate Travers, not yet.

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,980
Nathan Travers, a good man.

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,180
You might actually learn something from him
if you're interested in that sort of thing.

42
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,980
- Give 'em hell, Commander.
- Oh, I plan to, Sir.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,980
- That's an order.
- Yes, Sir.

44
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm just waiting for some things
hanging on the line to dry.

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,180
And your mom wants you
to call her before you go.

46
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,700
Don't go without calling her because I'm
the one who's gonna have to deal with it...

47
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,700
everyday until you get back.

48
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,380
I love her, but she's your mother.

49
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,700
You deal with her.

50
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
I'm gonna take this.

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
I'm taking this with me.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,380
I'll stick it right above my bunk.

53
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,300
It'll be the last thing
I see when I go to bed...

54
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,500
and the first thing
I see when I wake.

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,300
Oh, dammit.
Why do you go and do that?

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
- What?
- You know what.

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,700
Now you got me started,
and I can't stop once I get started.

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,180
Sorry.

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,180
You're not sorry.

60
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,900
I love you.

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,980
- Promise me something Nate Travers.
- Anything.

62
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,500
Promise me you won't get yourself
killed trying to be a hero.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,300
You think you can get rid
of me that easily?

64
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,500
No, I'm serious.

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,500
Honey, don't start that.

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,180
Promise me you'll come home.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,100
I promise.

68
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,700
Swear it.

69
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,100
I swear... I'll come home to you.

70
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,100
Okay.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,380
Two Months later
August 2nd 1943

72
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,780
Mid-Atlantic Convoy Route
600 miles off the U.S. Coast

73
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,500
- Heinrich!
- Turn off the air-intake!

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,500
- Stubborn bastards, those Americans.
- All ahead, 15 degrees starboard.

75
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,100
- They're leaving.
- They're leaving.

76
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Periscope depth. We'll teach them
who the stubborn ones are.

77
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,100
- 286 degrees, 15 knots.
- Distance: 2,700 meters.

78
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,700
Ready tubes 3 and 4.

79
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,380
Ready.

80
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,500
- 112 degrees.
- Torpedo ready?

81
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
3 and 4 ready.

82
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Ready.

83
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,780
Fire.

84
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,900
Yes! We got her!

85
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,700
We got her!

86
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,300
- A good yankee is a dead yankee.
- We dive.

87
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,380
U.S.S. Swordfish
Balao-Class Attack Submarine

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,780
- All ahead two thirds.
- All ahead two thirds.

89
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,780
Make ready to dive.

90
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,180
Make ready to dive.

91
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Shut 'em down, we're switching
to battery power!

92
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,780
Come on! Move it! Let's go!

93
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,500
Knock it off, come on!
And get your hands off your pecker!

94
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,500
- Giddy up!
- Yeah, yeah!

95
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
- Green board, pressure in the boat.
- Take her to 60.

96
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Take her to 60, five degree down-angle.

97
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,500
60 feet, five degree down-angle, aye.

98
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Fuck!

99
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,580
60 feet, Sir.

100
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,580
- Zero bubble?
- Zero bubble, Sir.

101
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,700
Zero bubble at 60, Sir.

102
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,580
Scope up.

103
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,900
Scope up!

104
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,700
Time?

105
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
64 seconds.

106
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,980
64 seconds.

107
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,300
64 seconds.

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,380
Prepare to surface, exercise complete.

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,180
Prepare to surface, exercise complete.

110
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,900
Chief, in my quarters.

111
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,100
Periscope going down!

112
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,580
Not again!

113
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,900
Maybe I should just go for a swim.

114
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Can I join you?

115
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,580
- Now, Chief.
- Be right there, Sir.

116
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
You look like crap,
you should see the medic.

117
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,180
There's a lot of things I should do.

118
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Three months. Three months in the water
and the men become compleasant and sloppy.

119
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,100
If you were in my shoes,
would that trouble you?

120
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,700
Yes, Sir.

121
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,300
Today's dive time was 64 seconds.

122
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,700
3 days ago it was 58 seconds.

123
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,780
6 seconds, Chief.

124
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,980
We're in the Atlantic now...

125
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,380
we can't afford to give the
Germans a six second advantage.

126
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,580
I'll speak to the men.

127
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,100
See that you do.

128
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,500
Chief.

129
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,100
You may have more experience...

130
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,780
but I've been preparing for this for
a long time and I do know what I'm doing.

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,700
I don't doubt that, Sir.

132
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,980
So, what's on your mind, Chief?
Let's have it.

133
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,500
I was thinking about
the men's morale.

134
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
They're frustrated by these
constant exercises...

135
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,780
and it's clearly not helping
their performance.

136
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,500
What is it? You and the men are
disappointed we haven't seen any action?

137
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,580
No, it's not that.

138
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,380
Then what is it, Chief?
What is it?

139
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,380
I was thinking...

140
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,100
to keep spirits up,
maybe we could...

141
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,300
give 'em a little more latitude...

142
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,900
little less exercise.

143
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,100
That's not your decision.

144
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
And I've made mine.

145
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
The crew's performance is
not what it needs to be.

146
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,500
And the drills will
continue per my orders.

147
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,100
Understood?

148
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,380
Aye, Sir.

149
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Is that all?

150
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,700
Yeah, that's all.

151
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,300
You're dismissed.

152
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,980
- How is Heinrich?
- Concussion. He'll be okay.

153
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,100
Good, I'll check in on him later.

154
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,100
- Good move.
- You always win anyway.

155
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,100
- Do you know what your problem is?
- My queen is in a bad position.

156
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,900
You always underestimate yourself.

157
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,780
You should have been a commander yourself,
instead of hanging around with me.

158
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,900
I thought that you would be more cheerful,
after we sunk that cruiser.

159
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,700
We sink one, they sink 30.
We're lucky that the torpedo exploded.

160
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,700
- The Americans joined the war.
- It didn't go so well last night.

161
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,100
It'll all be better soon.
With a little luck...

162
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
With a little luck,
we'll make it home in one piece.

163
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,900
- What is it, Bauer?
- Look at this.

164
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,780
Always when you least expect it.

165
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,980
- How many moves do I have left?
- Two.

166
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,700
Check...

167
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,500
...mate.

168
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,100
Good, I hate chess.
I get worse in every new move.

169
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,100
- Sorry to disturb you, Captain. Mr. Cremer.
- We're finished.

170
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,300
We got a message...
from home.

171
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,780
Give it to me.

172
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,900
Jonas... what does it say?

173
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,500
I need a moment alone.

174
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,500
They bombed Hamburg. The school his
daughters attend is completely destroyed.

175
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
No survivors.

176
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,700
All right, don't be stingy.

177
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,780
Thanks.

178
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,780
How many dress rehearsals is that?
Twenty seven, twenty eight maybe?

179
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,700
I don't know... I don't care.

180
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,700
I figured as much from you.

181
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,700
I mean...

182
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,900
It's not like we've
never done it before?

183
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,980
I just don't get why he
doesn't find some krautsto pester...

184
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,900
instead of jerking
our chains and fuckin' us.

185
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,500
Yeah, I mean, what's he trying to prove?

186
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,300
The least he could do is, whenever
it's not real, he could tell us.

187
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,700
So we don't shit
our pants everytime.

188
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
That would explain the complaints
I've been getting from laundry services.

189
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,180
Chief.

190
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,100
The reason we've conducted twenty
seven exercises Mr. Miller...

191
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,780
is for you to become so accustomed
to your task, so masterful in your skills...

192
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,900
that you do not shit yourself when
this boat comes under attack.

193
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
I understand, Chief.

194
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,380
Wanna talk some trash? Save it for
those nazi sons of bitches...

195
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,380
crawling up and down our East Coast
looking to blow us out of the water.

196
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,580
Anyone seen the XO?

197
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
Oh, yeah. I think I saw
him go into the head, Chief.

198
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,380
You're all right in there, Sir?

199
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,100
Fine, Chief.

200
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll be out in a minute.

201
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,940
U 281
Two days later

202
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,180
290 miles northeast of Bermuda

203
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,380
British Merchant Vessel Achilles

204
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,780
Torpedoes... Fire.

205
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,300
How do you lose an entire convoy?

206
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,580
Increase speed to 18 knots.

207
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,580
The Achille's last
radio contact, here.

208
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,580
That's where the closest allied
vessel had been ordered to take a look.

209
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,100
There's been no report of U-Boat
activity in that area for several weeks.

210
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,700
That does not mean
they're not there.

211
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,380
Chief...

212
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,700
no drill this time.

213
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,180
I'll inform the men.

214
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Confirm coordinates, let CINCLANT
know that we're on our way.

215
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,580
Aye, Captain.

216
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,900
We have to surface.

217
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,980
Jonas, it's night.
We have to surface.

218
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,100
- Yes, prepare for surfacing.
- Ready for surfacing.

219
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,780
Who's in there?

220
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I've been waiting for too long.

221
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,900
Hey, open up.

222
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
- Oh, shit!
- Who is it?

223
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
The XO, let's get him
to the medic. Come on.

224
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,580
Flu?

225
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,380
Not sure.

226
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,980
Could be a reaction
to something he ate.

227
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
How long have you
been feeling like this?

228
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,380
A week maybe, since Panama.

229
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
Hey, Chief. The Captain needs you.

230
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
I think it's important.

231
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,380
I need to come too.

232
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,380
- You're not going anywhere.
- You wish you could order me around.

233
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,500
I can.

234
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,780
Keep the liquids coming,
and let me know of any changes.

235
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
Yes, Sir.

236
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,100
There's Cooper at your service.

237
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,380
We need to keep him here,
away from the rest of the crew.

238
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,900
Until I have a chance to check on the others
to see if they have any of the same symptoms.

239
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,500
Is that serious?

240
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,900
It could be meningococcus.

241
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,780
English?

242
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,300
It's a form of meningitis,
it's highly contagious...

243
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,700
and in some cases it can be fatal.

244
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,580
We couldn't stop the bleeding
in the brain.

245
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,180
How old was he? 18?

246
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,900
Heinrich wanted to show
what he could do.

247
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,300
From the first day.

248
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,500
You couldn't do anything.
You couldn't stop it.

249
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,100
No...

250
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,700
That's the problem.

251
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
Anything?

252
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,700
No, Sir.

253
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,700
Chief, glad you could join us.
Put the men on full alert.

254
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,900
Yes, Sir.

255
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,980
Where's the XO?

256
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,180
In a sick room, Sir,
he's taken ill.

257
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Have Mr. Goodman standing by.

258
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,900
Sir, the XO can barely stand.

259
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,380
He's got a rash, and the med--

260
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,380
Chief, we're in hostile waters, the XO
is breathing, I want him at his post.

261
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,100
Aye, Sir.

262
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,380
U 821
Two days later

263
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,380
Captain...

264
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,580
Glenn Miller?

265
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,100
Good.

266
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,180
<i>That's music by Glenn Miller,
from the spacious Café Rouge...</i>

267
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,980
<i>of the Hotel Pennsylvania
in New York City.</i>

268
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,380
<i>Where the young at heart come from
far and near to watch and hear...</i>

269
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,300
<i>the orchestra that has given America
some of the most beautiful sounds ever.</i>

270
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,500
Captain!

271
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,500
Captain! I've got something
at 3-4-0, 4,000 feet.

272
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,980
Sounds... sounds like music.

273
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,100
You dirty dog!

274
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Mr. Goodman, set torpedo
depth at 10 feet.

275
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,780
Set torpedo depth 10 feet.

276
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,300
- Depth set!
- Depth is set!

277
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,100
Ready tubes one and two.

278
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,580
Ready bow tubes one and two.

279
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Come on.

280
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,380
- Gyro angle?
- 349.

281
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,980
Gyro angle 349.

282
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,980
- Set?
- Set.

283
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,980
Fire one.

284
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,980
Fire one.

285
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,980
Fire one!

286
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,500
Fire two.

287
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,180
Fire two.

288
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Fire two!

289
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,500
- Torpedoes!
- Damn!

290
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,100
All ahead full. Dive!

291
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,700
They were hit, Sir,
but are still up.

292
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,180
Goddamn it! Prepare to attack again.

293
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,180
Prepare to attack again!

294
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,700
Set torpedo depth to 12 feet.

295
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,300
Set torpedo depth to 12 feet.

296
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,980
- Depth is set!
- Depth is set!

297
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,500
Ready bow tubes three and four.

298
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,300
Ready bow tubes three and four.

299
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,580
Where the hell is he?

300
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Two subs.
One of ours, the other is American.

301
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,180
- Distance?
- 4,000 meters.

302
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,580
Angle? Angle?

303
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,980
351.

304
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,500
351, are we set? Mr. Goodman, set?

305
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,580
Gyro angle 351.

306
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,780
Tube three ready.

307
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,780
Tube three ready!

308
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,500
Set!

309
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,300
Fire three!

310
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
Fire three!

311
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,300
- She's right in front of us.
- Distance 400 meters. Fire!

312
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,500
Captain!

313
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,980
- She's cooked alright! Well done!
- Yeah!

314
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,380
Good work, boys! Good work!

315
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,580
We got 'em!

316
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,100
How does it feel to have
your cherry popped?

317
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,500
- Oh, God! Even better than the first time.
- First time?

318
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,580
That's what it's all about, all right?

319
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,380
He's dead.

320
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,900
Screw in the water!

321
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Right full rudder
all ahead flank, now! Move!

322
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Right full rudder all ahead flank.

323
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
I need damage reports, Chief!
Damage reports!

324
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,780
Mr. Right, I need damage reports!

325
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
It's no use, he's gone.

326
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,980
- Miller!
- Yes, Sir!

327
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Blow bow bouyancy. Surface!

328
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,780
Surface! Surface!

329
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,100
Help me!

330
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,180
- Who's in there?
- Nobody!

331
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,300
They're all dead in there,
Chief. Come on!

332
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
Listing 10 degrees port, sir.

333
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,300
Forward torpedo and forward
barrack taking on water, Sir!

334
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,300
We've lost the engines, Captain!

335
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
We're not gonna make it,
Captain. She's going down.

336
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,180
- Captain, you gotta--
- Don't tell me what I have to do, Chief.

337
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,980
I know what I have to do.

338
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,100
This is your captain speaking...

339
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,900
Abandon ship.

340
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
I repeat, abandon ship.

341
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,380
Abandon ship.

342
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Captain! There's nothing more you can do!
She's going down, come on!

343
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,300
Tend to the others, Chief.
That's an order.

344
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,900
Come on, Chief!
We gotta hurry!

345
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,900
Come on. Captain,
we gotta get out of here!

346
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,980
- Not till the crew's out.
- No. Listen to me.

347
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,780
They're all dead. This is a casket.
We gotta get out of here.

348
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,100
<i>You made me love you...</i>

349
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,180
<i>I didn't wanna do it...</i>

350
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,980
<i>I didn't wanna do it...</i>

351
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,500
<i>You made me love you...</i>

352
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,300
<i>And all the time you knew it...</i>

353
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,700
<i>I guess you always knew it...</i>

354
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,580
<i>You made me happy...</i>

355
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,300
This has been the best
thanksgiving ever.

356
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,300
I do get holidays.

357
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,900
You just wait till Christmas.

358
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Kiss me.

359
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Follow me. Now!

360
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,580
Come.

361
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,540
Move!

362
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,780
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

363
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,380
It's okay, Captain. You got it.

364
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,100
You got it.

365
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,100
Move it!

366
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,780
You're not scared of a few Americans?

367
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
I'm worried about supplies.

368
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,300
We'll be at the supply vessel in a week.
We have enough supplies.

369
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,900
There's nothing to worry about.

370
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,900
When we get there, we'll turn
over the Americans for interrogation.

371
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,100
Klaus, could you give us a moment?

372
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,380
As you wish.

373
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,780
What is it?

374
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,900
You said it yourself - the war is ending.
Why risk everything now?

375
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,580
Make sure my orders are followed, Ludwig.

376
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,300
Yes, Captain.

377
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,300
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

378
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,580
I don't know about you guys,
but I don't wanna go to Germany.

379
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
You know what they do
to prisoners in Germany?

380
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,100
They torture them, and then
they gas them or they burn them alive!

381
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Shut up!

382
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,580
Shut up.

383
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,500
That's what those officers
in Panama said they did...

384
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,300
to all those jews!
They just cooked them!

385
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,900
- They cooked them like meat.
- Calm down, Miller.

386
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,300
That's an order, sailor.

387
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,780
We gotta hold it together.

388
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,100
We panic now,
we're as good as dead.

389
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
They were supposed to
just let us drown, Captain.

390
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
Why didn't they just
let us fucking drown?

391
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,580
Chief...

392
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,580
We're going to break up
into three groups.

393
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,300
I'll head up a team to
search for food and supplies.

394
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,380
I want you to radio
CINCLANT our position.

395
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,900
Find out what our orders are.
Tell them we contacted the enemy.

396
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,900
Understand? Understand?

397
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
But, Captain...

398
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,500
Take it easy... easy.

399
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Come here!

400
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,700
Come on.

401
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,580
I got it.

402
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
You should have let me
die on my boat, Chief.

403
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,780
You should have let me
die on my boat.

404
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,580
Is he dead?

405
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,500
What are we gonna do Chief?

406
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,700
What are you looking at me for?
The captain--

407
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,500
The Captain ain't the Captain no more.

408
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,580
He's gone off his mind, Chief.

409
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,300
He ain't gonna be able
to help us now.

410
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,300
- Why the hell did he bring them onboard?
- There are rules in war.

411
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Not when they just sunk one of ours.
The entire crew was killed.

412
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,780
- Our Comrades!
- Are you questioning him?

413
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,100
I don't doubt the Captain's
orders. Neither should you.

414
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,500
Mr. Cremer, he puts us in danger.

415
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,100
That's what war is about.

416
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,780
I counted at least 20 of them pricks.

417
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,300
There's probably twice that many.

418
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,100
Yeah, and they got guns too.

419
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,300
Eat.

420
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,900
They don't understand a word.

421
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,380
Here you go.
I hope you like it.

422
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,380
Piss off, you damn kraut!

423
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Hey, come on.

424
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,500
Leave it.

425
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,980
What the hell is this?

426
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,300
My guess is... pig balls and
chicken guts if we're lucky.

427
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,500
Give me one for the Captain.

428
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,100
How do we know they
didn't poison it, Chief?

429
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,580
How do we know they
didn't do that?

430
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Cause if they wanted us dead,
they would have let us drown.

431
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,180
Besides, we're gonna need all
the strenght we can get, so...

432
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Eat up.

433
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,900
You should try to eat something.

434
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,500
You said that Goodman had a rash.

435
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,180
What did the medic think it was?

436
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,780
Meningitis.

437
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,300
What did it look like?

438
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,180
I want you to keep this
between us, Chief.

439
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,100
I don't wanna startle
the men, understand?

440
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,380
Hey!

441
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,980
Hey, someone's coming!

442
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,380
Who is of highest rank?

443
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,980
- It's alright.
- It's okay, okay, okay!

444
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,980
What's your position?

445
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,380
Chief of Boat.

446
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,780
What happened to your Captain,
Chief of Boat?

447
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,300
He didn't make it.

448
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,700
He went down with the ship?

449
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,500
Yeah, he did.

450
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,100
These are your men.

451
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,900
They do as you tell them,
and we do not have a problem.

452
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
What's the matter with him?

453
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,380
He was injured, trying to get out.

454
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,180
He'll be needing medical assistance.

455
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,100
You'll split in half.
Smaller groups, more comfortable...

456
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,100
for all of us.

457
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Chain them, and give him medicine.

458
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,500
- Let him die.
- Do as I say!

459
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,700
Take his handcuffs off.

460
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Mind your fucking head.

461
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,900
For him.

462
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,900
How can anybody sleep like that?

463
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Got clobbered in the head,
probably has a concussion.

464
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
Well, should we wake him first?

465
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Shit, I wouldn't.

466
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,980
Oh, man. Look at that.

467
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,780
Hey, Right, don't touch that.

468
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,300
Right, don't fucking touch it!

469
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,900
Why? Why not?

470
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,380
Shit. Guys, that's not a wound,
that's a rash.

471
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,900
- What?
- My sister got it when she was a kid.

472
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Meningitis I think,
I don't know exacly.

473
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,900
She got it from
the water in our well.

474
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,380
How long does it last?

475
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
About a week.

476
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Okay, so how do you treat it?
I got a bunch of stuff...

477
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,700
You don't, Right.

478
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,700
So, what, it just goes away?

479
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,500
No.

480
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,300
- You said it lasted a week.
- Yeah, I said about a week.

481
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,700
And then we buried her.

482
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,500
Christ, Abers!

483
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
Abers, is it contagious?

484
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,980
Well, I didn't get it.
But, yeah.

485
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
Oh, great! Great!

486
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,100
The krauts won't kill us,
the Captain will.

487
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,980
What are you looking at, rat?

488
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,180
What are you doing?!

489
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Not only are you eating our food,
I also have to look at you.

490
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,180
- What is he saying?
- Oh, come on! What the hell are you doing?

491
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,700
That's enough.

492
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,500
Are you all right?

493
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Three days later
August 10th

494
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,700
450 miles off the U.S. Coast

495
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,700
I hurt everywhere,
and it's difficult to breathe.

496
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,380
I'll give you something for the pain.
Get some rest.

497
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,380
You'll be well soon.

498
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,180
- How many?
- Eight sick. Others have the symptoms.

499
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,100
Captain, come here, please.

500
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,300
We're almost there,
but the supply vessel isn't here.

501
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:29,100
- What do you mean?
- They aren't answering our radio signals.

502
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,580
- Are we in the right position?
- Yes.

503
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,580
Damn! Up periscope.

504
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,500
An American destroyer. Damn!

505
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,980
- Distance?
- 2,500 meters.

506
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,700
2,500.

507
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,700
Captain?

508
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,980
What's your command?
We must act.

509
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,900
- How many torpedoes do we have?
- Two front, one stern.

510
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,900
Ready one and two.
Set torpedo depth at 5 meters.

511
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,900
Chief, they prepare to attack.

512
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,180
We gotta do something.

513
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,380
1800 meters.

514
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,380
Otto, come here.

515
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,300
- Torpedoes ready.
- Ready.

516
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,980
Now!

517
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,780
Captain, torpedoes ready.

518
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,980
- The Americans escaped!
- I told you it would happen!

519
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,900
- Stop the launch!
- I'm on it!

520
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,900
We've got company!

521
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,700
Ox, a little help!

522
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,380
How are you gonna know
which one is which?

523
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,100
I was born to fire
torpedoes, don't matter...

524
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,180
if it's German, jap or
portuguese for that matter.

525
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,380
Do it fast!

526
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,180
Got it! I got it!

527
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,180
Cooper!

528
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,100
No!

529
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,780
Stop! Stop it right now!

530
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,580
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

531
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,300
Right, full rudder.
Take evasive action.

532
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,980
Get me a location on that thing.

533
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,180
Dive!
Depth: stern minus 20, bow minus 30.

534
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,900
- Quick!
- Everybody to the front!

535
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,100
Hurry! Quick!

536
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,100
What was that?

537
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,180
50 meters.

538
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,180
Fool... You've killed us all.

539
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:38,300
If you pull that trigger now, you might just
pin a bull's eye on the side of this boat.

540
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,780
Captain, is it over?

541
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,180
It hasn't even started.

542
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,900
Back!

543
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,300
Don't shoot! Captain! Captain!

544
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:29,380
Captain! Captain!

545
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Captain! Captain!

546
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,780
Captain's dead.

547
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,180
- We have to get rid of the Americans.
- Here? A mass execution?

548
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:13,300
I want to get rid of them as well. But we
can't get rid of the bodies.

549
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,780
I can live with the smell.

550
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,980
- What is it, Bauer?
- There's something you have to see.

551
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,100
Wilhelm was the first to
get the symptoms. Here.

552
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,900
The Americans are like The Plague.
And we have them here onboard.

553
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,780
Look at him!

554
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,900
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

555
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,580
A medic thought it might
be meningitis.

556
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,180
Contagious?

557
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,300
Very.

558
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Is there a cure?

559
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,180
I'm not a doctor.

560
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,300
- The crew must not know.
- What? But the Americans...

561
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,300
That is an order!
And you will obey.

562
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,900
Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus,
until we can surface.

563
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,380
- The Americans can't have any.
- Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus.

564
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:15,580
Yes, Captain.
How long are we staying down here?

565
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,780
As long as we can.

566
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,780
Abers.

567
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,380
- I'm here.
- When you get out...

568
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
don't you tell my mother
that I died this way.

569
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,780
Tell her that I went quick.
No pain.

570
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,180
No pain.

571
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,380
August 13th

572
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,900
380 miles off the U.S. Coast

573
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,980
<i>Don't quit!</i>

574
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,100
<i>Don't quit on me, Nate.</i>

575
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,180
Rachel.

576
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,500
I've never seen you
like this before.

577
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,380
My men are dying.
We're near the end.

578
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,100
I can't accept that.

579
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,900
I'm sorry.

580
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,100
Never be sorry.

581
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,100
What am I supposed to do, hun?

582
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,580
You're supposed to come home to me.

583
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,300
How?

584
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,780
I don't have any fight left.

585
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,180
I don't--

586
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,380
I'm not going to be one
of those wives, Nate Travers.

587
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,580
I'm not back there waiting for some
telegram to tell me that my husband is dead.

588
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,300
I won't let you do that to me.

589
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,580
You made me a promise.

590
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,300
Oh, God, I miss you.

591
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,380
Then come back to me.

592
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,300
- Is she still there?
- Perhaps.

593
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,100
"Perhaps" is not good enough.

594
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,100
- Ready to surface.
- We'll be an easy target.

595
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,700
What would you prefer?
Dying here or up there?

596
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,300
At least we have a chance up there.

597
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,300
Surface.

598
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,100
We're clear!

599
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,980
Transmit emergency signal.

600
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,500
It's fresh air.
The hatch is open.

601
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,500
It means we lost our navy.

602
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,140
Family?

603
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,900
Yeah. That's my family.

604
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,180
That's Vivian, and...
and Ol' Danny Jr.

605
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,780
- Looks like me, huh?
- Give it a rest, will ya?

606
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,380
They don't care.

607
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,300
They don't care about your family.

608
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,380
Is this your son?

609
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,980
Yes, my son. Peter... Jr.

610
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,500
Never forget this is the enemy.

611
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,980
Take care of your own men.
Out.

612
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,300
Eat!

613
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,300
And?

614
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,380
Every second is precious.

615
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,700
We must do something about the Americans.

616
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,580
Take off his handcuffs.

617
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,900
That is all.

618
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Your men, they follow
your orders, do they not?

619
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,900
They do.

620
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,500
Would they follow mine?

621
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,380
I've lost two thirds of my men.
Your navy is not far away...

622
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,580
and our distress calls have failed,
I've no option left.

623
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,780
Between all of us we have just enough
hands to make this boat operational.

624
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,900
If you and your men join my men,
we might have a chance.

625
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,780
You want us to help you?

626
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,580
I want you to help yourselves.

627
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,900
And if we refuse?

628
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,580
We all die.

629
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,900
That he's speaking to them - that alone
is treason.

630
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,180
You've seen how he behaves.
He's insane.

631
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,500
This is insane.

632
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,780
- What do we do?
- I refuse to obey him.

633
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,980
I hope
that you will do the same.

634
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,980
What exactly are you proposing?

635
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,380
Our diesel is nearly exhausted
and the fuel line has been damaged.

636
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,180
But if we're efficient,
we should be able to make 500...

637
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,780
maybe 600 kilometers.

638
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,900
You can't really expect my men
to help you deliver them into custody.

639
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,580
We travel submerged by day,
making up time on top at night.

640
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,180
If my calculations are correct...

641
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,180
we should be able...

642
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,780
to make landfall in three days.

643
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,700
UNITED STATES

644
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,900
Jonas!

645
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,980
You're serious?

646
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,780
Once we're close to shore
we deploy the life-rafts...

647
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,980
we evacuate the men and...

648
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,100
we scuddle the boat.

649
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,900
You understand I will not allow my boat
to fall into your country's hands.

650
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,380
In return for this, I surrender myself to
you and ask for consideration for my men.

651
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,180
- You can't just surrender.
- It's my duty to save the men.

652
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,700
Don't surrender us to them!

653
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,980
- We can manage without them.
- If only we could.

654
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,100
Ludwig!

655
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,900
I need your hand, Sir.

656
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,580
I can't make any guarantees
once you're in US custody.

657
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,300
I understand.

658
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,980
All I ask for is that you report
to your superiors what I've done.

659
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,700
So, when this war is over,
they save my men like I saved yours.

660
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,500
I'll need to speak to my men first.

661
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,780
All of them.

662
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,780
You've two minutes.

663
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,380
You want us to team-up
with the Jerries?

664
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,380
I don't like it, Chief... no siree.

665
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,380
I'm with them on this one.
I don't trust these kraut bastards...

666
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,780
as far as I could throw 'em.

667
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,380
Why don't, why don't
we just wait 'em up?

668
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
They're dropping like flies...
we wait until enough...

669
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,380
of them are infected and
then we take the boat.

670
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,180
Why not?

671
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,700
How long are you gonna wait?

672
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,900
Romano's already dead.
How long before you are infected?

673
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,380
We don't have time. None of us
are in the clear on this thing.

674
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,700
Chief, we've been taught since
day one to hate these guys...

675
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,780
and now you want us
to work with them?

676
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,700
Shit!

677
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,100
I don't like it either,
but this is our best shot.

678
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,780
I made a promise to my wife.

679
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,780
That I'd get home without
getting myself killed.

680
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,180
It's a promise I wanna keep.

681
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,580
It's time.

682
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,100
Okay, listen up.

683
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,900
- Miller.
- Yeah.

684
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,700
You stick with Officer Cremer.

685
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,180
He'll help you to get
a hand along things.

686
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,780
- Okay, Chief.
- And remember, we're metric now.

687
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:06,100
Ox, I want you to... hmm.
It's Hans, right?

688
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,700
Your name is Hans?

689
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,780
Good.

690
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,700
I want you to follow Hans
to the engine room.

691
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,180
We'll run on one engine only,
I wanna conserve as much diesel as we can.

692
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
Go to hell.

693
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,300
Make it happen.

694
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,780
All right. What else?

695
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,900
A planesman.

696
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,580
Abers.

697
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,980
Think you can fly this boat?

698
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,180
Yeah...

699
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,980
All right, Virgil...

700
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,700
- Have we surrendered captain?
- Shut up! This is my boat!

701
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,900
I make the decisions.

702
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,900
We won't make it home, not in this boat.

703
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,700
If you want to die, we all die.

704
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:57,780
But if you want to make it back home alive
this is our only chance.

705
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,980
Let's continue.

706
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,700
Come on!

707
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,900
Come on, Jerry!
Let's get this over with!

708
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,900
Cooper!

709
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,380
Hang on, all right?
Can't you see the man's praying?

710
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,580
Coming up.

711
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,500
Ahead, half speed.

712
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,980
Ahead one half.

713
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,380
Confirm course.

714
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,900
285.

715
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,500
Bearing 285.

716
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Bearing 285.

717
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,980
All ahead, full.

718
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,380
All ahead full.

719
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,380
Hey, come on.

720
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,900
We must do something.

721
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,980
Nah.

722
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,180
Used to smoke... two packs a day.

723
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,980
Down here...

724
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,700
two packs need
to last you two months.

725
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,980
Nah, I... Okay.

726
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,780
Your men, are good.
You've trained them well.

727
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,100
Oh, it wasn't just me,
but thank you.

728
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,900
Maybe this crazy plan can work.

729
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,700
Maybe.

730
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,380
Captain.

731
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,780
Yes?

732
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,900
Sun's coming up soon,
I suggest we prepare to dive.

733
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,100
Of course.

734
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,100
I've lost them.

735
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,980
Captain has lost
the respect of his men.

736
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,780
Well, they'll respect you later.
When you save their lives.

737
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,100
If the situation were reversed...

738
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,180
Would you do the same?

739
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,780
I'm not a Captain,
I couldn't make that call.

740
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,100
Just pretend.

741
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,100
In the grand scheme of things,
what's one boat?

742
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,980
This war is gonna end. It doesn't
mean we have to end with it.

743
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,900
There's one thing
we haven't discussed.

744
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,300
What do we do if we
come across a German boat?

745
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,380
You mean,
do I throw away our plan?

746
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,700
You go back to being prisoners,
maybe killed?

747
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,700
And we go back to Germany?

748
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,700
Crossed my mind.

749
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,780
What if we come across
an American warship?

750
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,300
What stops you from having
me and my men killed?

751
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,900
These items belong to your men.

752
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,700
Thank you.

753
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,780
You're married?

754
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,500
Yeah.

755
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,100
To the only woman
who would have me.

756
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,100
You?

757
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,300
Yes.

758
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:23,700
Kids?

759
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,300
Three. I have three girls.

760
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,100
Well, even more reason to
get through this thing alive.

761
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,700
Do you know why I picked up
you and your men?

762
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,700
It's protocol for a sub commander
after sinking an enemy vessel...

763
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,380
to arrest only the Captain and Chief.

764
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,780
Hitler himself made that
a standing order.

765
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,300
If that's the case, then...

766
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,700
why the others?

767
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,300
We hold positions of power,
Mr. Travers.

768
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,180
Men look to us for leadership.

769
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,780
Saving you and your men...

770
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,300
was the first time in all my years
of service I actually felt powerful.

771
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,780
To save a life instead
of taking it away.

772
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,980
That's power.

773
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,900
I'm tired of this war.

774
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,900
This can no longer be about sides.

775
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,700
We are now on the same side.

776
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:18,900
So...

777
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,580
what happens if, and when...

778
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,900
we come across an American
or a German boat?

779
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,780
We do what we have to, to make sure
that our men come home alive.

780
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,780
August 17th

781
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,180
78 miles from the U.S. Coast

782
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,100
What's going on in here?
Where's Hans?

783
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,500
What is it with you guys?
Lovers' spat?

784
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,380
Help!

785
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,900
What the hell are you doing?

786
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,300
Got him?

787
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,380
Stop at once!

788
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,900
Since first met, never liked.

789
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,100
You will get what you deserve!

790
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,900
All of you!

791
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,300
- What's happening?
- We're being attacked. Hurry!

792
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,580
What's going on, Chief?

793
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:25,100
No, leave it.
Put down the phone.

794
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:31,180
- The torpedo will explode! Are you mad?
- You can ask the captain about that.

795
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,900
Go up there. Go!

796
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:40,380
Put down the gun!

797
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,780
Hands up!

798
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,780
Traitor! I will not let
you surrender the boat.

799
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:52,580
- Are you going to kill us all?
- I'd rather die with my honor intact!

800
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:56,100
- No more talk now. The war is over.
- Exactly.

801
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,100
Go to...!

802
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,380
Jonas!

803
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,980
It's your boat now.

804
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,980
Get the crew home.

805
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,700
He sold us out, Chief.
The bastard sold us out.

806
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,380
We're so damn close, Chief.

807
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,780
Do we know what was sent?

808
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,180
At best, our position,
at worse, our situation.

809
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,100
Well, then...

810
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,980
we don't have much time.

811
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:35,900
All right.

812
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,780
You're in charge.

813
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,700
What do we do?

814
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,300
Periscope depth.
We're going up.

815
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,100
Periscope depth.
Let's take it up.

816
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,500
Let's move guys.

817
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,780
What's our depth?

818
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,580
Straight and level at 12 meters.

819
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:08,780
Periscope up.

820
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,180
Periscope up!

821
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,380
Hey, hey, I've got something.

822
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,180
Bearing 1-8-0. 2,300 meters.

823
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,740
Damn.

824
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,980
Have a look.

825
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,780
It's an American destroyer.

826
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,780
2,400 meters, Chief.
She's moving away.

827
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,100
Wherever she's going,
she's in one hell of a hurry.

828
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,780
- 2,600 meters.
- Think she saw us?

829
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,180
No, but...

830
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,980
- What?
- She may be the one.

831
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,980
- The one what?
- You think you can reach her?

832
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,100
Yeah, if she's got her ears on,
I can reach her, Chief.

833
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,900
- What do you wanna do?
- We show our hand.

834
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,900
I don't understand "show our hand".

835
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,700
We make radio contact.
We surface.

836
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,740
If we surface, they can attack.

837
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,380
What's he saying?

838
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,180
If we surface,
they blow us out of the water.

839
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,900
They can blow us out
of the water anyway.

840
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,780
It's an American boat.

841
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,780
It's your call.

842
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,700
Blow all ballast.
Prepare to surface!

843
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,100
Prepare to surface.

844
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,980
Whoa! Chief, I think
she's turning around.

845
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,700
- Virgil?
- I'm working on it, Chief!

846
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,580
2,400 meters, Chief.

847
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:26,980
I got it!

848
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,180
2,300 meters.

849
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,180
C.O.B., you're on!

850
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,780
This is Chief of Boat, Nathan Travers,
of the U.S.S. Swordfish.

851
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,380
I repeat, this is Chief of Boat,
Nathan Travers, of the U.S.S. Swordfish.

852
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,500
I am onboard the U 429
with my surviving crew.

853
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,180
We're in control of this boat.

854
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,380
Sir. Sir, you should hear this.

855
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,100
Hold all fire, we will surface in--

856
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,900
What's going on? What is that?

857
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,500
We're being jammed.

858
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,500
No, no. There's gotta be a mistake.

859
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,300
No, Sir. He said his name was
Chief of Boat, Nathan Travers.

860
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,300
- We've got company.
- Boat in the water, 800 meters and closing.

861
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,780
- Whose is it?
- I can't tell.

862
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,300
It's a German boat.

863
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,180
I fear he sent more than
a simple distress signal.

864
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,580
Ready one and two.
Sink the traitor!

865
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,980
- Another U-boat, Sir.
- Shit!

866
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,100
That's it! Give me CINCLANT, now!

867
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:36,980
Yes, Sir.

868
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,500
We should stay in the course.

869
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,100
And head straight for the U-boat?

870
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,700
Well, if we go that way,
we run right into that destroyer.

871
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,100
I'll take my chances with the sub.

872
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,180
Why?

873
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,380
'Cause I got you.

874
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,300
Fire!

875
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,900
She's firing.

876
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:52,980
On whom?

877
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,380
Eel in the water!

878
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,100
Turn to diesel,
turn to battery, and dive!

879
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:14,980
Battlestations!

880
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,500
GENERAL ALARM

881
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,700
- Depth!
- Yeah!

882
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,580
50 meters!

883
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,900
- Take her to 70.
- No!

884
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,780
That's exactly what he expects.

885
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,580
Trust me, we've played
this game many times.

886
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,380
Take her up.

887
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:46,700
You heard that, take her up.

888
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:07,700
All ahead, full. 110 starboard.Torpedoes
3 and 4 reload. Ready one for fire.

889
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,580
Chief, we can't take
much more of this.

890
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,580
We have to fight back.

891
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,900
No! We can do this.

892
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,900
We can do this!
I need damage reports!

893
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,100
Fire!

894
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,500
- Incoming.
- Incoming!

895
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,980
- Shit! What?
Right rudder!

896
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,300
Goddamn, seems all hell's
broken lose out there.

897
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,780
I'd like to know what the hell
is going on, is that too much to ask?

898
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,300
Give it to me.

899
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,580
No, there.

900
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:47,980
Cease fire! Cease fire! There's Germans
onboard and we're in control.

901
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:53,700
- Cease fire!
- Prepare for combat.

902
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:59,980
- Next time we're dead.
- It's our countrymen.

903
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,460
They're going to kill us!

904
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,180
I can't fire my own!

905
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,100
They don't seem to have
a problem firing on you.

906
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,180
I can't make this decision.

907
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,980
You have to.
You're the Captain now.

908
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,580
We've one shot to do this.

909
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,780
How's that?

910
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,380
We have only one torpedo left.

911
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,580
Ready three and four.

912
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,180
Chief, U-boat 220 meters.

913
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,580
She's turning around.

914
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,980
She's right in front of us.

915
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,300
She's getting into firing position.

916
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,300
Destroyer 1,800 meters.

917
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,780
You let me worry about the destroyer,
just stay on that sub!

918
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,780
Our lone torpedo is in the stern...

919
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,780
Ok, on my mark, all ahead, full.

920
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,980
On my command, all ahead, full.

921
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,580
Load rear torpedo tube, uh...

922
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,100
- Six.
- Six.

923
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,980
Ready when you are, Chief.

924
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,380
Ready? Hold on everybody.

925
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,300
Now!

926
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:27,100
Now!

927
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,100
Dive!

928
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,700
We're right on top of her.

929
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,580
35 meters.

930
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,980
- We need more speed.
- Come on, you piece of junk.

931
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,100
50 meters.

932
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,300
75 meters.

933
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,100
Hold on, Coop. We only got one shot,
let's make it a good one.

934
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,500
I will not disappoint you.

935
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,700
- 90 meters.
- Wait.

936
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:04,980
Hold on.

937
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,380
- 120 meters!
- Fire!

938
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,700
Fire!

939
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:21,980
It's a dud, Chief.

940
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,100
Hit but didn't detonate.

941
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,900
Fire!

942
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:39,980
Fire!

943
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,580
Incoming!

944
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,180
Crash-dive!

945
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,180
- You all right?
- Yeah.

946
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,780
I can't hear.

947
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,300
Hey! Hey! Chief, we're open!
We're open!

948
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,980
Put him on the speaker.

949
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,580
You're on.

950
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,380
This is Chief of Boat, Nathan Travers,
of the U.S.S. Swordfish.

951
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,300
Hold your fire. I repeat,
hold your goddamned fire.

952
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,180
<i>Chief Travers, this is the U.S.S. Logan,
we read you loud and clear.</i>

953
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,100
<i>Chief Travers, glad to hear
you and your men are alive.</i>

954
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,180
This is Captain Samuel Littleton.

955
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:07,780
You are to secure the enigma decoding
device, and any and all documents.

956
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,980
<i>I'm sending an armed boarding
party over. Do you copy?</i>

957
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,100
We're taking on water fast, Sir.

958
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,180
There's a... there's
a crack in the hull.

959
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,900
We're going down fast,
abandoning ship.

960
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,180
<i>Chief! Chief!</i>

961
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,900
<i>Listen to me, you are to secure
those items.</i>

962
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,700
<i>- That's an order!
- Chief?</i>

963
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,700
We're not sinking.

964
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,780
Yeah, we are. Yeah.

965
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,900
It's a big damn crack.
Runs the length of this hull.

966
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,180
Don't you see it?

967
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,380
Guys, don't you see the crack
going through the hull?

968
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,180
Abers?

969
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,100
Yes, Chief.

970
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,700
- Big crack.
- That's right, a big one.

971
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,980
So let's open all the vents
and scuddle this boat.

972
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:52,980
Open them, now!

973
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,980
A promise is a promise.

974
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,180
U.S.S. Logan, did not copy last
transmission, you're breaking up.

975
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,980
Did not copy last transmission.

976
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,500
Chief!

977
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,500
Dammit.

978
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,300
- All clear, Chief.
- Up you go.

979
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,980
Ho-hoo, we're going home!

980
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,900
After you.

981
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,980
I'm still the highest ranking
officer on this boat.

982
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,180
After you.

983
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,300
<i>- But, Sir, you don't--
- No, Nate, I do.</i>

984
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,700
- I understand entirely what you're saying.
- But, Sir--

985
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,900
I just hope that you can appreciate
that, as prisoners of war...

986
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,580
it makes the situation
somewhat delicate.

987
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,380
Sir, had it not been for their
actions, six American lives...

988
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,380
including my own,
would have been lost.

989
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,100
But they're Germans.
And we're still at war here.

990
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,180
I'm sorry, Nate.
My hands are tied.

991
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,580
It is impossible.

992
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,700
I hope you understand that.

993
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,500
Nate.

994
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,580
I realize what these
men did for you.

995
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,900
And I'm gonna do anything
in my power to see to it...

996
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,900
that they're as well taken
care of as possible.

997
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:06,980
Thank you, Sir.

998
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,700
I was dead, several times.

999
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,500
I...

1000
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,900
I gave up all hope
of ever coming home.

1001
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,580
I wish I could have
been there for you.

1002
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,780
You were. In more ways than one.

1003
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,180
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

1004
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,700
What?

1005
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:43,300
You think you can get
rid of me that easily?

1006
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:18,900
Camp Cooke, California
German P.O.W. Compound

1007
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,780
Thank you.

1008
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,780
Hello.

1009
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,980
This is my wife, Rachel.
She wanted to meet you.

1010
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,700
It's my pleasure.

1011
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,300
None of us would have made it
had it not been for your husband.

1012
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,500
You've a brave man there.

1013
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,900
He says the same about you.

1014
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,300
A telegram...
was sent to my house...

1015
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,780
it said that my husband's
boat was missing.

1016
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,100
They had lost contact...

1017
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,900
and the crew was presumed dead.

1018
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,900
Thank you.

1019
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,300
I'll let you two talk.

1020
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,180
I'll be right there.

1021
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,300
She's beautiful.

1022
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,780
I can't take credit for that,
but... thanks.

1023
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,100
Here.

1024
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,900
My cigarettes!

1025
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,580
How did you get these?

1026
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,300
You don't wanna know.

1027
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,980
Thank you.

1028
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,700
How are the men?

1029
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,700
The food is good, clean rooms...

1030
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,700
The Captain was unrealistic
in his demands.

1031
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:00,300
I suspect he even knew
this'd be our fate.

1032
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,580
He didn't want you
to end up here.

1033
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,300
He wanted us to live.

1034
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,380
He succeeded.

1035
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:13,700
We succeeded.

1036
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,980
- The war will be over soon.
- Yeah.

1037
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,700
We will return home.

1038
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,380
If that torpedo had detonated...

1039
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,180
I... I don't know.

1040
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,780
I know.

1041
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,980
Good to see you, my friend.

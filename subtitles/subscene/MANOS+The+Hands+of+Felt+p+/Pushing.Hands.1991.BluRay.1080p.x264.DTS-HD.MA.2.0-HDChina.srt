1
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,435
Jesus..., oh!

2
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,935
God!!

3
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,905
No Metal in the microwave.

4
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:27,775
No metal!

5
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,452
Martha, it's Robert.

6
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,799
Just to let you know to
keep an eye peeled

7
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,716
for the first reviews of
your breathlessly awaited first novel.

8
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,016
Word is, the Times is going to rave,
rave, rave.

9
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:57,768
Talk to you soon.

10
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:53,753
Thank you.

11
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,261
You look like shit.

12
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,011
Where's Grandpa?

13
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,980
He's so cute with the headphones on.

14
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,846
Hi Grandpa!

15
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,312
Hi

16
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,856
Do you think he remembers me?

17
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,108
Come on, it's a steal.

18
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,029
You've got to see it.

19
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,316
You'll have your own room to
write in.

20
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,571
Grandpa could be out in
the back chopping bricks

21
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,281
or whatever he does out there.

22
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:25,821
You'd never even know he existed.

23
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,914
I wish he didn't.

24
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,829
God, he's really getting you down.

25
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,333
From the way Alex has acted for
the last seven years,

26
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,620
you would have
thought he didn't have a father.

27
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,252
And then boom,

28
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,209
a month ago this shows up on
the doorstep.

29
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,468
I haven't written a word since.

30
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,799
Well, Alex has got to get him out
of here.

31
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,546
It's not that simple with Alex

32
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,838
and frankly we can't afford to
buy another place

33
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,512
let it alone to buy a mansion.

34
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,630
Of course you can

35
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,687
especially if your mother's offer is
still good.

36
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,350
Alex will never accept money
from her, you know that.

37
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,348
Work on Him!

38
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:54,271
For God sakes, Martha,
you have alot to learn about men.

39
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,100
And you have a lot to
learn about husbands.

40
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:58,487
Sorry.

41
00:12:59,319 --> 00:12:59,740
It's OK.

42
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,607
I am getting a dog.

43
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,023
Hi Alex!

44
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,358
Smells good.

45
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,184
Good Jeremy.

46
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,647
Grandpa, I'm home.

47
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,478
How's my boy!

48
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,577
What's that?

49
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,542
It's a book that I made for you.

50
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,582
Animals that change.

51
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,456
One day

52
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,874
I saw the most weird thing.

53
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,963
It was a turtle and a fish, and a rat.

54
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,844
They lived in a puddle of potion.

55
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,389
They grew.

56
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,596
They destroied the universe.

57
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,314
The end.

58
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,570
Jeremy gets some ideas.

59
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,145
Come on,
let's clean up for the dinner.

60
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,366
Dad

61
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,866
you shouldn't eat so
much fat at your age.

62
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,160
How are you today?

63
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,526
Did you watch
those tapes I rented for you?

64
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,281
Terrible!

65
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,702
Then I'll get you some
Taiwanese Shows.

66
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,911
They'll be just as bad.

67
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,282
Well, what about some
Hong Kong Kung Fu movies?

68
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,168
The worst!

69
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,626
Their Kung Fu's a joke.

70
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,789
Dad! They're only acting,

71
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,545
but you are a Tai Chi master.

72
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,463
To learn English is boring to me.

73
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,258
To go back?

74
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,259
Even more boring.

75
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,388
My life is going to nowhere.

76
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,308
Dad.

77
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:38,263
It hasn't even been a month

78
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,187
since you retired and came to
the States.

79
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,305
Give yourself some time.

80
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,448
Jeremy

81
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,066
Come here

82
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,953
Come here! You little rascal.

83
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,538
Come here.

84
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,377
Come here, Jeremy.
Get off the couch.

85
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,040
I don't have time for this, come here.

86
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,005
Whoa!

87
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,215
My precious young man
running barely naked!

88
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,588
The future of our Chu family

89
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,094
depends on your little treasure.

90
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,225
What does he think he's doing?

91
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,011
That's all right

92
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,304
Chinese elders must
always reassure themselves

93
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,018
that their family name will go on.

94
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,774
Come on Jeremy, upstairs with you!

95
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,777
Eh? She's afraid he'll catch coId.

96
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,525
Kids aren't made out of paper.

97
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:54,764
Thanks.

98
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,848
No, thanks.

99
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,894
Why this American woman only
eats vegetables?

100
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,853
She's afraid of getting fat.

101
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,397
Why am I not fat?

102
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,237
On this Earth there are
two kinds of food.

103
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,449
Vegetables are "yin".

104
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,288
Meat is "yang".

105
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,706
You must eat both to be balanced.

106
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,833
Then the man can be completed.

107
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,540
Alex, Linda came over today.

108
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,329
Great.

109
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,962
What's that supposed to mean?

110
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,340
Just great.

111
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,173
What exactly do you have to
against her anyway?

112
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,302
So what if was a Maoist in coIlege.

113
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,170
From Maoist revolutionary to
real estate baron.

114
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,558
If there's one thing worse than
a communist,

115
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,305
it's an ex-communist who has
become a capitalist.

116
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,017
Well, she's ready to
do us quite a big favor.

117
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,739
Oh no, she's trying to
sell us a house again.

118
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,898
What's she mumbling about?

119
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,816
Nothing.

120
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,651
Something about cigarette butts?

121
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:51,987
What?

122
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,154
Mom said she wants to move out.

123
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,192
Quiet!

124
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,281
Alex, I'm talking to you.

125
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,081
Mom, can I watch cartoons?

126
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,745
Here.

127
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,119
Put some meat on your bones!

128
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,619
I don't want it, thank you.

129
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,621
Jeremy, finish your milk and
you can watch TV.

130
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,503
What did she say?

131
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,917
If he finish his milk,
he can watch TV.

132
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,394
American people teach children

133
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,681
like they're doing business.

134
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,104
Everything's a deal.

135
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,392
You should at least take
a look at the photos.

136
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,605
It's apparently a real steal.

137
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,776
If children can't concentrate
on eating,

138
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,824
what else can they concentrate on?

139
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,537
Yes, father.

140
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,036
And these American cartoons

141
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,239
are only adding weirdness and
violence

142
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,040
to mess up the world,

143
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,623
For children?

144
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,539
It's just a mess.

145
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,245
Our sages said...

146
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,045
Dad...

147
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,708
Just eat!

148
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,427
Please don't get upset.

149
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,342
I'm just afraid
your dinner's getting coId.

150
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,891
What has he been babbling about?

151
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,175
The violence in cartoons.

152
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,137
How could he complain?

153
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,758
He's a martial arts expert himself.

154
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:04,974
Isn't that violent enough?

155
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,313
Would you cut it off?

156
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,267
Both of you!

157
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,773
Just eat.

158
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,537
You finish up.

159
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,208
I'm going out for a smoke.

160
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,636
In America, you're so polite to kids.

161
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,720
You think so?

162
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,465
You don't treat kids as kids

163
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,551
It's interesting.

164
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,475
It's very interesting.

165
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,842
It's called democracy.

166
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,349
Democracy means no big and
no little.

167
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,310
Ok,

168
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,731
you understand America better than
I do.

169
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,360
Chinese Time.

170
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,576
Jeremy, stop playing.

171
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,919
Come on, time for homework.

172
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,340
Alex.

173
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,092
The teachers here can't
speak Chinese fluently,

174
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,187
how can kids learn in the good way?

175
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,846
They are fine,

176
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,270
don't be too picky!

177
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,269
We only have
one Chinese schooI around here.

178
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,351
Every weekend,
Jeremy learns some Chinese,

179
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,566
I can play basketball,

180
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,855
and you get to teach Tai Chi.

181
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,607
Thanks God for it!

182
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,359
No matter how they teach it,

183
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,612
We learn it by their ways.

184
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,953
Eh! Not like that!

185
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,405
Dad, I've got some things to
take care of.

186
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,751
Jeremy,

187
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,757
look!

188
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,219
Grandpa will teach you an
oId Chinese rhyme.

189
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,509
On East West Street.

190
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,842
North South Go.

191
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,917
Outside the gate, a man bites a dog!

192
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,423
Grab the dog to hit a brick.

193
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,265
Watch out!
That brick might bite the hand.

194
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,230
FoIlow Grandpa.

195
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,060
On East West Street.

196
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,136
North South Go.

197
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,101
Outside the gate a dog bites a man.

198
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,682
A dog bites a man!

199
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:02,862
A man bites a dog!

200
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,053
Shit!

201
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,385
Just one more sentence.

202
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,687
Okay.

203
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,734
How's your computer virus?

204
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,371
Almost killed.

205
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,040
When can
I start reading your new book?

206
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,089
There is no new book, can't you tell

207
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,879
Shit Alex,
are as out of it as your father

208
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,138
You don't know my father.

209
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,602
I have spent every single day

210
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,476
in the same room with that man

211
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,473
since he showed up here
a month ago.

212
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,187
Alex, it's impossible.

213
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,115
He has taken over my work room,

214
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,948
I just don't have the space to think.

215
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,403
Not enough space?

216
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:11,909
In China,

217
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,326
this house is big enough for
four families.

218
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,075
Sure, but they'd speak the
same language

219
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,627
so they could talk to each other.

220
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,790
Alex he hasn't learned one word
of English.

221
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,458
And what about you?

222
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,923
What have you done

223
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,718
but making fun of him,
treating him with disrespect?

224
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,001
Alex, I've tried.

225
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,044
I'm his only son.
What do you want me to do?

226
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,257
You could consider moving into
a bigger place.

227
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,388
We can afford it.

228
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,224
No.

229
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,056
I don't see why we have to
pay for his insurance,

230
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,806
letting him eat us out of
house and home

231
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,978
when we can't accept a little loan
from my mother.

232
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,096
It's not a little loan,

233
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,312
it's a bride,

234
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,191
a big bride,

235
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,528
and you know it.

236
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,209
You look a little freaked out here.

237
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,711
Come on, let's go to bed.

238
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,891
Good night, Alex.

239
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,643
Honestly, Linda,
I don't know why we're here.

240
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,100
Come on, let's explore.

241
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,743
Father and the son.

242
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,194
Father.

243
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,034
Mom.

244
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,745
M for mom...

245
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,581
Mom.

246
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,869
Mother.

247
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:33,713
Son.

248
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:55,690
Punch.

249
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,449
Sweep.

250
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,581
Step back.

251
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,293
CoIlect a cloud.

252
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,084
Hook.

253
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,125
Step out.

254
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:16,844
Single whip.

255
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,255
Raise hands and step up.

256
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:23,816
Lean.

257
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,227
White crane spreads its wing.

258
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,440
Left hand ward off,

259
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,858
and right hand attack.

260
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,525
Excuse me,
are you the instructor here?

261
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:38,866
My name is Chen.

262
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,123
I teach the cooking class.

263
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,995
Could you please do me a favor?

264
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,741
What is your name?

265
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:44,491
Chu.

266
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,492
Master Chu.

267
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,785
Please, we're all friends here.

268
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,378
Don't call me master.

269
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,628
Mr. Chu.

270
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,425
I don't know what our principal
is thinking,

271
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,590
my class is making dumplings,

272
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,678
half-done.

273
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,634
Some workmen just came
in to do some repairs,

274
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,852
and we have to leave.

275
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,974
I see you have plenty of space here,

276
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,511
Could we move in?

277
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,554
Just this once?

278
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,358
Dumplings can be moved in,

279
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,731
but they can't be moved out.

280
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,268
We've also got scallion pancakes
and spring roIIs!

281
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,620
Come on, let's help!

282
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,196
Thank you.

283
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,068
Sink your chest.

284
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,321
Stretch your back.

285
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,918
Imagine a string pulling up
your head.

286
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:26,669
Sink lower your body.

287
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,831
Lower.

288
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,576
Master Chu,

289
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,170
don't torture the child!

290
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,837
Look at all his weight.

291
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,255
How can he "sink his chest"?

292
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,217
Let him help me knead the dough.

293
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,642
Oh, it's so difficult.

294
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,094
Mrs Chen,
next week I'll help you to make dumplings.

295
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,185
Can I be enroIled?

296
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,097
There will be
no dumplings next week,

297
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,308
but General's Tso's Special Chicken.

298
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:03,764
Master Chu,

299
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,558
would you please demonstrate

300
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,921
how to emit force with
Pushing Hands?

301
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:07,517
Okay,

302
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,021
let's try.

303
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:10,387
Thank you.

304
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,408
Ouch, would that hurt?

305
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,132
Master Chu, try me!

306
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:49,517
I cannot move you.

307
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,137
So your Kung Fu can only go so far!

308
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,099
Okay.

309
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:55,776
Hey!

310
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,149
Mr. Chu right there!

311
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,273
Can you take the fighting away?

312
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,726
Don't you see these burners

313
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,281
and the boiling water!

314
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:03,824
It's alright if the
heavyweight gets burned,

315
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:04,657
but if you smash the dumplings,

316
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,571
what should we eat then?

317
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,232
We'll eat roast pigling!

318
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,737
OK, OK!

319
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,377
Far enough?

320
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:19,799
I'm ready Master!

321
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,945
What! Haven't you any eyes to see!

322
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,155
Sorry, sorry!

323
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,321
I don't mean you!

324
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,159
It's your Master who wasn't looking!

325
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:49,774
Hey,

326
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,780
of all the directions,

327
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,875
why did you throw the
heavyweight on my dumplings!

328
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,036
Excellent aim!

329
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,451
Okay! No dumplings today!

330
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,534
Instead, we'll have sandy
crab scalded noodle lump soup!

331
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,379
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

332
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:02,587
It wasn't on purpose!

333
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,839
It was on purpose!

334
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:05,716
Are you OK?

335
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,092
It was on purpose!

336
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,099
In front of all these people sooner
or later,

337
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,761
I knew you'd show off!

338
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,510
All the skills you have learned,

339
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,261
will be shown to all the audiences.

340
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,473
Sorry, sorry!

341
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,401
Okay! Don't stand there with
a red face!

342
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,363
Let's clean up!

343
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:21,942
Sure.

344
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,688
Everyone helps!

345
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:24,939
No more Tai Chi Chuan!

346
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,020
We'll make dumplings!

347
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,945
Come..., did you hear that!

348
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,985
Master says no more Tai Chi!

349
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,528
Hurry up!

350
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:35,623
Heavyweight, wipe your face!

351
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,538
Oh my goodness,

352
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,999
what's this shape?

353
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,078
HoId on, let me see your hands.

354
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:43,883
Filthy!

355
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,756
Men, all of you wash your hands.

356
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:46,714
Use soap!

357
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:47,922
No dirty hands on my dumplings.

358
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,841
Is that clear?

359
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:49,639
Hurry up!

360
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,014
Mr Chu,

361
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,088
please have a seat.

362
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,263
Let the young people stand.

363
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,931
Come and have a seat.

364
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,229
Not bad.

365
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,475
Thin skin, plump stuffing, nice twist.

366
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:02,648
It's nothing.

367
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,399
Northerners like making things
from dough.

368
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,527
Where did you come from?

369
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,272
Are you from Beijing?

370
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,153
Yes.

371
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,359
How long have you been here?

372
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,910
Just over a month.

373
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,738
Are you used to it here?

374
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,915
If I was,
would I be here messing around.

375
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,918
Watch what you're saying,
I'm here too.

376
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,037
I didn't mean it.

377
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,497
America is a world for young people.

378
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,333
Are you also from Beijing?

379
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:25,506
Do I seem like I am?

380
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,674
By your accent, yes;
by the way you look, no.

381
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:29,720
That's right.

382
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,507
I went to Taiwan

383
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,427
with my husband in 1949.

384
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,475
And Mr Chen is?

385
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,188
He is dead.

386
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,641
His name wasn't Chen.

387
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:40,688
Not long after we arrived in Taiwan,

388
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:41,982
he got liver cancer and passed away.

389
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,891
I'm called Mrs Chen

390
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,691
because of my second husband.

391
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,491
Oh..., and Mr. Chen?

392
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:50,573
He's dead too,

393
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,697
just in last year.

394
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,748
Life and death, it's fate.

395
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,079
Riches and rags are
given by the gods.

396
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,243
You just accept it.
Everything is destiny.

397
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,827
Sure, sure.

398
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:01,827
Earlier this year,

399
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,159
I left Taiwan for here with
my daughter.

400
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,214
Every Saturday,

401
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,337
I bring my granddaughter here to
study Chinese.

402
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,717
Are you used to it here?

403
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,303
How did you put it just now?

404
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,224
If I wasn't so bored at home,

405
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,677
how could your Heavyweight have
smashed that.

406
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,427
A computer couldn't have
aimed more accurately.

407
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,930
Destiny, it's all destiny.

408
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,682
That's right!

409
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,822
What a great Kung Fu!

410
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,073
What's the matter?

411
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,364
Since last year,

412
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,902
Sometimes my right
arm just gives out.

413
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:38,748
When I pick up
something a little heavy,

414
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,080
it's out of control...,

415
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,576
it's useless.

416
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,787
Have you seen a doctor?

417
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,916
Yes.

418
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,202
Chinese doctors, western doctors,

419
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,455
accupressure, acupuncture,

420
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,918
herbal remedies, shots, medicine.

421
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,297
I've tried everything

422
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,805
but getting a spell cast on me.

423
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,175
I'm just oId.

424
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,845
Mrs Chen,
I don't want to sound like a self-promoter

425
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:01,516
but practicing Tai Chi will
heal your arm.

426
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,183
Okay, give me a break!

427
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,144
Haven't I suffered enough in this life.

428
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,221
Practice!

429
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,356
I am not that stupid.

430
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,564
When you practice Tai Chi,

431
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,153
your circulation and energy will flow.

432
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,899
I've let go, I'm not hoIding on.

433
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,482
Energy must be released,

434
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:19,869
cannot be practiced.

435
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,325
When its released there's no tension,

436
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,086
and one feels at ease.

437
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,009
What's up?

438
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,465
The review, I can't find it.

439
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,444
When you arrive at oId age,
everything is quiet.

440
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:25,165
There the gentle wind
passes through the pine forest.

441
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,496
Fifteen minutes to practice.

442
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:26,861
Okay.

443
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:31,711
When the moon is rising and
shining on the mountain.

444
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,297
I only want to go to
the familiar forest.

445
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,252
I reply with
a simple fisherman's song.

446
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:41,509
Alex?

447
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:42,882
Yes?

448
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,720
Where can we mount
Chinese calligraphy in NY?

449
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,098
Who's the present for?

450
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:48,976
You know, last week,

451
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,893
I smashed Mrs Chen's dumplings.

452
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,101
I was so embarrassed,

453
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,059
and I want to give her this.

454
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,561
I'm just afraid she'll laugh at
my calligraphy.

455
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,892
C come on, Dad,

456
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,354
we know you're good.

457
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:02,988
What's the matter?

458
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,652
They've ignored the book.

459
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,654
Just pretended that it doesn't exist.

460
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,112
It will be in the next week.

461
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,244
What's the matter with her?

462
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:11,544
There is no review of her book.

463
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,330
Just tell her,

464
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,541
years from now,
we'll all be lying peacefully underground.

465
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,211
What's the big deal?

466
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,629
Dad, when're we going?

467
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:22,376
OK!

468
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:26,516
What is it?

469
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,310
A stomach cramp or something.

470
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,263
Nothing important.

471
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,853
Do you want to
lie down on the couch?

472
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,566
What's wrong with her?

473
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:41,736
A stomach cramp.

474
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,073
Let me take a look,

475
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,238
make her lie down.

476
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,112
Dad said he wants to take a look at it.

477
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,324
He knows this kind of thing.

478
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,154
He does?

479
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,999
Yes, he is an expert.

480
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,127
She's too nervous,
something's wrong with her stomach.

481
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:03,843
You are too tight.

482
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,259
Thanks for letting me know.

483
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,768
Tell her to relax.

484
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,307
Just relax.

485
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:34,869
What happened!

486
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:35,740
Mom!

487
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,626
What happened!

488
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,297
Relax!

489
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,338
Oh my God! Get away from me!

490
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,341
What did you do to her!

491
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:39,882
Her stomach's bleeding!

492
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,666
Quick get her to the hospital!

493
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,174
I want to go too.

494
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,000
Jeremy, be good.

495
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,696
You broke Mama.

496
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,670
Jeremy wants a goIdfish, right?

497
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,786
Here's a big tail,

498
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,345
big eyes,

499
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,550
thick lips.

500
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:40,978
And wings.

501
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,000
What's Martha's condition?

502
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,417
She has to stay in the hospital for
her bleeding stomach.

503
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,966
How's Mommy?

504
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:04,879
Yes?

505
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,341
Mommy is all right,
and she just needs a little rest.

506
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,393
I didn't do anything to her,

507
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,059
but she did it to herself.

508
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:21,483
I know that.

509
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,332
Can I go to the hospital with you?

510
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,051
Dad.

511
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,803
Is this the calligraphy you
want matted?

512
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,478
Go and take care of Martha,
and just leave alone.

513
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,541
Can I have some macaroni and
cheese please?

514
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:28,628
Wait until Sunday when
your mother comes home, all right?

515
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,495
Hi, Master Chu.

516
00:42:58,619 --> 00:42:59,750
Hello everyone.

517
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,703
Master Chu, they toId me that
your kung-fu is great.

518
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,124
Last week, you sent Mr.
Sung flying by barely touching him.

519
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,503
And threw the fatty Zhao on
the dumplings, too.

520
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,672
I am flattered.

521
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:11,549
Where is Mrs Chen?

522
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,055
I don't know.
She is not teaching anymore.

523
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,637
Now I am the teacher.

524
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:15,966
Not teaching anymore? Yes.

525
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,557
Why? I don't know.

526
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,971
Maybe you can ask them.

527
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:23,018
Their family changes to
the school in north.

528
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,144
If you want to find her,

529
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,061
you can ask the principal about
her telephone number

530
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:29,729
OK, I will go for my class.

531
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,234
No General Tso's Special Chicken
today?

532
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,233
There is no left cock or right hen,

533
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:37,787
but the "Stoky Rice" today.

534
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:38,944
"Stoky Rice"?

535
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:40,159
Yes,

536
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,366
"Stoky Rice".

537
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,037
Oh yes, STICKY RICE.

538
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:51,086
Hey, will you throw the fatty Zhao
on our sticky rice?

539
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,696
Alex, will you make a call for me?

540
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,126
What's that?

541
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:26,879
Mrs Chen's family doesn't come
here any more.

542
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,631
And calligraphy is mounted,

543
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:32,044
we should contact and
send it to them.

544
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,717
It's their answer machine.

545
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,800
Yici Chen, this is Alex Chu.

546
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,355
My Dad has a present to
give your mother.

547
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:47,978
Give us a call when you are back

548
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,805
at 287-0425.

549
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:50,770
Thanks.

550
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,108
How can you talk like that?

551
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:55,523
Like what?

552
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,235
Enough! I won't go to
the hospital with you to see Martha.

553
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,815
Take me home to wait for the call.

554
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,410
Relax, they're not going anywhere.

555
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:03,573
I can't communicate with Martha.

556
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:04,784
You'll be there for hours,

557
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,457
and all I can do is stare at ceiling.

558
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:08,743
Okay.

559
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,667
Hey mister, don't make fun of me!

560
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:14,674
I never make fun of any one.

561
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,341
What's that?

562
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,893
A grenade!!

563
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:41,799
Hello, yes, it is Mr. Chu speaking.

564
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:44,844
Yes? Mrs Chen?

565
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:49,557
Why weren't you at school?

566
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,096
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

567
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:55,775
Oh, no, please don't listen to my kid.
What a nonsense!

568
00:46:55,898 --> 00:46:57,439
It's not a present.

569
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,824
I'm still embarrassed about last week

570
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,027
that I just messed your class up.

571
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,371
Ok. How about this?

572
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,872
Tomorrow at 11:00 am,

573
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,449
my son will pick his wife up
from the hospital.

574
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,706
We'll come by at 10:30 am,

575
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:19,338
does that work?

576
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:20,044
Yes?

577
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,386
Its' nothing serious,

578
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,211
she has a small stomach problem.

579
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,968
Then we make the appointment.

580
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:34,059
Fine,

581
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,648
see you tomorrow.

582
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,051
Hello, Uncle Chu!

583
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:07,638
Sorry for bothering.

584
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,303
Not at all, welcome!

585
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,681
Mom, they are here.

586
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:11,764
How are you, Yici?

587
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:13,427
Hi Jeremy.

588
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:14,219
Hi Yi-yi.

589
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:16,433
Why are you all guarding the door?

590
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:17,643
Come in.

591
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:18,262
Maybe next time,

592
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:19,979
we've got to get to
the hospital to pick up my wife.

593
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:21,569
Oh, you can't be late then.

594
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:22,693
Is your wife all right?

595
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:25,445
What am I talking about!

596
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,112
She is getting out of the hospital.

597
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,162
Mr Chu, how are you?

598
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,367
Good. Mrs Chen,

599
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:36,288
is there a cooking class at
your new school?

600
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,163
Not until I showed up.

601
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:40,915
There's a Kung Fu class too.

602
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:42,787
But it's only Karate.

603
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:46,796
Their Momentum is stronger than
Tai Chi Chuan.

604
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:48,678
But they can't throw people
as far as you can.

605
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,214
And they don't perform
as handsome as you do.

606
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,387
Much worse.

607
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:54,727
Dad, we better get going.

608
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,763
We planned for you to
stay for dinner,

609
00:48:57,895 --> 00:48:59,266
and we even went food shopping
for that,

610
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,728
but you've got to get to the hospital,

611
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:01,557
So maybe next time.

612
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:02,982
Thanks and bye.

613
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:09,869
Uh, you stopped by today to?

614
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,323
Ah! I forget.

615
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,990
You shouldn't have. Thank you.

616
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:16,952
I'm going to hang it up right away.

617
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:18,823
It's nothing.

618
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,630
Drive carefully!

619
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,964
Bye. Good bye!

620
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,012
What's the rush!

621
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,257
We didn't even get the scroII open!

622
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,403
Thanks!

623
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,196
Toothache?

624
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:41,253
I thought there is
not much you can do,

625
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,045
a lot of problems for sure you have.

626
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,257
Mr Philips called.

627
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:53,976
Jeremy received the
lowest reading scores

628
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:55,846
in the gifted class again.

629
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,803
That schooI is
too distracting for him.

630
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:00,264
No Alex,
we're too distracting for him.

631
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:01,934
He's only responding to
the atmosphere at home.

632
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,272
Then change it!

633
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,241
What's your problem?

634
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,115
I ain't got any problem.

635
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,491
Get back in the car, Alex!

636
00:51:16,617 --> 00:51:17,247
You get back in the car lady!

637
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:17,868
Shut up!

638
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:20,721
Great!

639
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:37,364
Martha?

640
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,410
What do you want?

641
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:40,484
I wanna go for a walk.

642
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:41,739
A walk?

643
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:43,240
I don't know.

644
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,162
I don't want to see if you get lost.

645
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:45,990
Smoking.

646
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:47,244
You know,
in a way I'm kind of baby sitting you.

647
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:49,126
I'll just hang around, won't go too far.

648
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:50,673
I'll just hang around,

649
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:52,206
won't go too far.

650
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,999
All right. Go ahead.

651
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:56,676
What do I care.

652
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:12,730
Oh Jeremy. Where'd you get those.

653
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,109
Teddy gave them to me.

654
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:14,945
That's disgusting!

655
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:15,900
Wel, I go put them away.

656
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,990
Go on. Go get yourself cleaned up.

657
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:23,245
Dad.

658
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:30,915
What're you looking for?

659
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:32,424
Dad. Where is he?

660
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:33,212
Oh no.

661
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:34,965
Where is he?

662
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:20,878
Is he back?

663
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:21,430
No.

664
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:19,068
Did you check with the police?

665
00:55:43,342 --> 00:55:44,884
Alex, I'm sorry.

666
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,842
I should've been more careful.

667
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:48,172
But I'm...,

668
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:49,266
with the book...

669
00:55:50,307 --> 00:55:50,768
In some ways,

670
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,022
your father is more and more like

671
00:55:52,142 --> 00:55:54,354
a child cooped up here with me.

672
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:55,640
And I can't talk to him.

673
00:55:57,064 --> 00:55:58,355
I was trying to write.

674
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:02,317
I had a feeling that
he was gonna get himself lost

675
00:56:03,654 --> 00:56:05,576
just like a kid rying to
get some attention.

676
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,234
I grew up in believing

677
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:11,240
you should care for your parents

678
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,122
the way they care for you.

679
00:56:14,498 --> 00:56:16,410
My father is a part of me.

680
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:19,244
Why can't you accept that.

681
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,928
I know.

682
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:29,094
I tried.

683
00:56:30,848 --> 00:56:32,009
Just leave me alone.

684
00:57:59,478 --> 00:58:00,900
Oh my god. You've found him.

685
00:58:01,021 --> 00:58:02,152
Thanks God, he's safe and sound.

686
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:03,854
We're looking for Mr chu.

687
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:06,445
Alex is still out looking for his father.

688
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:07,570
I'm his wife.

689
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:08,733
Okay. Mr Chu,

690
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:10,314
you take care of yourself. All right?

691
00:58:10,447 --> 00:58:12,029
Thank you very much officers.

692
00:58:16,912 --> 00:58:18,453
Alex is still out looking for you.

693
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:19,752
Are you hungry?

694
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:21,707
Thirsty?

695
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:44,143
You really should eat something.

696
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:51,318
I'm sorry too.

697
00:58:53,073 --> 00:58:54,745
Alex is furious.

698
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:09,690
Jesus.

699
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:11,529
How did you get so drunk?

700
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:14,441
Dad, where did you go?

701
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:15,903
I was just walking around

702
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:16,982
and I lost sight of the church steeple,

703
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:19,038
my landmark.

704
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:22,159
Policemen brought him back
two hours ago.

705
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:24,834
You're back, that's good.

706
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:12,037
What are you doing?

707
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:13,673
Nothing.

708
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:15,209
I won't bump this wall,

709
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,341
if I know this wall isn't thick.

710
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:18,888
What're you doing? Stop it!

711
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:22,389
Mom?

712
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:24,393
Calm down.

713
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:34,769
Jeremy, Dad isn't feeling well,

714
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:36,363
he'll be all right.

715
01:01:37,237 --> 01:01:38,028
Let me talk him.

716
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:39,822
Jeremy,

717
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:43,277
Dad banged his head by accident.

718
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,822
Do you need a band aid!

719
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:45,575
Okay.

720
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,251
Jeremy.

721
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:57,046
Only Jeremy is good.

722
01:02:01,095 --> 01:02:03,387
Jeremy cares for me better than
Mommy and Grandpa do.

723
01:02:27,955 --> 01:02:29,206
I haven't seen you that drunk since

724
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:30,583
the night we've got married.

725
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:32,499
That drunk?

726
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:33,247
Yeah.

727
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:37,339
Well, my head is clear now.

728
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:38,716
What're you mumbling about?

729
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:42,091
I've made up my mind already.

730
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:43,297
About what?

731
01:02:44,722 --> 01:02:46,303
The oId man has got to go.

732
01:02:47,224 --> 01:02:49,476
I'll send him to
an oId people's apartment.

733
01:02:51,937 --> 01:02:52,888
Are you sure?

734
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:56,193
I really don't have too much choice,
do l?

735
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:01,195
I'll go tell him right now.

736
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:38,482
Come in.

737
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,941
Dad, why didn't you get up and
exercise today?

738
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:49,366
Aren't you feeling well?

739
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:53,123
What's wrong?

740
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:56,914
I was being outside
too long last night,

741
01:03:57,044 --> 01:03:58,916
so maybe I catch a coId for that.

742
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,631
I'm going to call a doctor.

743
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:06,592
You've got
important business at work,

744
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:08,673
don't waste your time on me.

745
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:10,465
Come on, dad,

746
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,931
cut it out!

747
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:13,390
You're never sick,

748
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:15,140
if you don't feel well,
it must be serious.

749
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,972
I'm going to call a doctor.

750
01:04:18,774 --> 01:04:19,434
Why get sick now?

751
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,652
The vital organs are not in harmony.

752
01:04:21,777 --> 01:04:22,528
The circulation's blocked.

753
01:04:22,653 --> 01:04:24,575
That's why one is sick.

754
01:04:48,095 --> 01:04:50,427
Dad, Ma's been gone for
so many years,

755
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:52,347
and you've never wanted to
look at her picture.

756
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:54,393
I couldn't face her.

757
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:57,690
Do you remember this scar!?

758
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:02,071
When the red guards came to
our house,

759
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:05,197
they knew that they couldn't hurt me,

760
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:07,828
so they took it out on you and
your mother.

761
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:10,405
I only had this one body!

762
01:05:11,035 --> 01:05:13,157
In protecting you,
I couldn't protect your mother.

763
01:05:14,163 --> 01:05:15,745
When they finally stopped
their beating,

764
01:05:16,373 --> 01:05:17,625
she was too gravely injured to
survive.

765
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:19,243
In this one life,

766
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:21,586
I can never face your mother again,

767
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:22,633
but I can face you!

768
01:05:23,673 --> 01:05:24,093
Dad,

769
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:26,634
It's been so many years,

770
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:28,220
why talk about it now?

771
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:31,045
I feel stifled.

772
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:33,719
Let me tell you something,

773
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:35,220
comparing to loneliness,

774
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,262
persecution is easy.

775
01:05:37,394 --> 01:05:39,557
Look at how much hardship and
injustice

776
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:43,986
I've endured in the last 40 years,

777
01:05:44,735 --> 01:05:45,986
their tortures only inspired me

778
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:50,119
to perfect my Kung Fu.

779
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:53,953
To study the
"Soft Internal Style of Strength",

780
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:57,241
we pursue the state with the loss of
tension,

781
01:05:57,372 --> 01:05:59,915
so we can attain concentration.

782
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:03,005
And from that one,
we achieve carefree,

783
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:07,134
then this is nearly impossible to
be upgraded.

784
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:11,261
Sure, the surface is always easier.

785
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:12,137
Go on,

786
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:14,339
don't bullshit me!

787
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:19,476
I'll go call a doctor.

788
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:25,025
Do me a favor and call the
Chinese schooI principal

789
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,152
tell him that I can't teach the class
on Saturday.

790
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:29,565
Okay. You'll go when you're better.

791
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,659
I'm not going anymore.

792
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:33,243
Why?

793
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:37,111
The students always want me to
show off. I hate that.

794
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:39,418
Then what will you do on
the weekends?

795
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,173
Why don't we change to
that schooI north of here?

796
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:44,545
You mean with Mrs Chen?

797
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:45,791
No!

798
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:49,084
They say it'll be good for
Jeremy's studies.

799
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:51,969
I heard they're much stricter.

800
01:06:53,262 --> 01:06:54,303
How about it?

801
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:04,059
So did you tell him?

802
01:07:04,189 --> 01:07:06,231
He's sick. Caught a coId from
last night.

803
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:07,109
I couldn't tell him.

804
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:08,485
I hope it's not serious.

805
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:10,239
No, I don't think so.

806
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:12,276
But I'd better take him to the doctor.

807
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:15,828
I've got a great idea

808
01:07:15,951 --> 01:07:17,112
about what to do with him

809
01:07:17,244 --> 01:07:18,616
without hurting anyone's feelings.

810
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:21,413
What's that?

811
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,411
Just be patient.

812
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:30,089
Promise me,
you'll be nice to him for the time being.

813
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:30,756
Okay?

814
01:07:30,883 --> 01:07:32,014
Go on.

815
01:07:42,436 --> 01:07:43,137
You have something to do?

816
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,561
Nothing.

817
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,231
Then why do you keep looking
at your watch?

818
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:49,066
Nothing.

819
01:07:55,908 --> 01:07:56,448
Hello?

820
01:07:58,285 --> 01:07:59,657
Oh... yes... Yici.

821
01:08:00,412 --> 01:08:02,294
How's the picnic?

822
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:07,089
Sorry for bothering you.

823
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:08,375
...yes,

824
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:09,254
it's great weather,

825
01:08:09,379 --> 01:08:10,921
and it is a pity if you don't go picnic.

826
01:08:11,423 --> 01:08:12,845
Unfortunately, he doesn't have
much energy now.

827
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:14,418
If he got sick again,

828
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:15,422
it'll be trouble.

829
01:08:15,928 --> 01:08:17,520
Maybe we should let him to
have some rest.

830
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:18,969
Okay.

831
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,556
Say thank you to Chen Mama for me.

832
01:08:21,684 --> 01:08:22,775
Okay? That's it.

833
01:08:22,893 --> 01:08:23,684
Don't hang up,

834
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:25,142
Don't hang up, hoId on.

835
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,432
Who said that I'm sick?

836
01:08:27,565 --> 01:08:29,396
I didn't say sick, I said energy.

837
01:08:29,525 --> 01:08:32,437
"No energy" means that
you need to get out!

838
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:36,824
Yici,

839
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:38,370
my father says he's fine,

840
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:40,735
he'd like to get some exercise.

841
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:41,791
Let's do it by the same plan.

842
01:08:41,912 --> 01:08:42,913
Yes.

843
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:45,746
Okay.

844
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,206
That's settled then.

845
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,210
Bye.

846
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:50,172
Right.

847
01:08:50,963 --> 01:08:53,055
How can it be healthy to
stay home all the time!

848
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:54,925
That's how you get sick!

849
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:14,229
Ma, I've already had two.

850
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:15,022
Have more!

851
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:16,982
Here YiYi.

852
01:09:17,114 --> 01:09:17,775
Thank you.

853
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,580
Kids should eat more.

854
01:09:21,952 --> 01:09:22,583
Jeremy?

855
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:23,874
No, thank you.

856
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:25,835
Have more!

857
01:09:25,956 --> 01:09:27,377
Help yourself, don't worry about him.

858
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:28,372
Have another piece.

859
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:28,961
No..., thank you.

860
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:30,205
Listen to me, there's lots of meat,

861
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:32,207
and there's no point in saving it.

862
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:34,547
I have to
leave some room for tonight.

863
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:36,290
It's only the middle of the day,

864
01:09:36,425 --> 01:09:38,217
and a man shouldn't worry for this.

865
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:39,174
Come on!

866
01:09:39,303 --> 01:09:40,925
I haven't eaten since
yesterday morning.

867
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,426
I'm preparing for
the dinner you're cooking tonight.

868
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:44,138
He is a stupid one.

869
01:09:45,267 --> 01:09:45,768
Nonsense!

870
01:09:45,893 --> 01:09:46,433
Here.

871
01:09:47,227 --> 01:09:47,978
Please let me have it.

872
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:49,354
He's reaching middle age,

873
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:50,110
he's afraid of fat,

874
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,442
cholesteroI, and high blood pressure.

875
01:09:56,696 --> 01:09:57,446
Ma, again?

876
01:09:57,988 --> 01:10:00,070
Yes, damn it.

877
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:01,320
Can you give me a little massage.

878
01:10:07,456 --> 01:10:08,327
Let me take a look.

879
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,671
How can I let you do that?

880
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:12,545
It's okay.

881
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,931
Did you find the spot?

882
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:22,344
This is troublesome.

883
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:23,896
If it's trouble, leave it alone.

884
01:10:24,014 --> 01:10:24,645
Noop,

885
01:10:24,765 --> 01:10:27,347
The Chi in your Bladder Meridian
is too strong,

886
01:10:27,476 --> 01:10:29,939
but the blood is too weak.

887
01:10:30,062 --> 01:10:32,655
This kind of problem is called
"Mid-Spring Paralysis".

888
01:10:32,773 --> 01:10:36,737
Now try to move the pinky toe on
your left foot.

889
01:10:42,032 --> 01:10:43,614
Did you feel that subtle pain?

890
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:46,288
So, I was right.

891
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,283
When this illness gets serious,

892
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:51,166
you'll get a spasm under your knee,
sore waist,

893
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,373
your back will give out,
your neck will tense up,

894
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:54,714
you won't be able to lift your arm,

895
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,929
and your muscles will be stretched

896
01:10:57,047 --> 01:11:00,050
between your armpits in
one tight knot.

897
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:01,594
Enough!

898
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:03,801
Stop! Once you keep diagnosing,

899
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:05,761
all my internal organs will be shown!

900
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,592
Let me see.

901
01:11:07,725 --> 01:11:09,186
It's her right shoulder that's stiff.

902
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:10,270
He knows!

903
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:12,096
He was rubbing your left hand.

904
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:13,230
Shush!

905
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,218
It's burning.

906
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:37,257
Burning?

907
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:38,511
Your meat, on the barbeque.

908
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:43,973
Why don't you pay attention to
your own business?

909
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:46,263
Mr Chu, thank you.

910
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,430
I've just begun.

911
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:51,516
You've got a complicated problem.

912
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:53,105
It would take over a year of
treatment to get results.

913
01:11:53,979 --> 01:11:56,181
What a bother! Okay,
don't break me apart.

914
01:11:57,441 --> 01:12:00,815
Jeremy, let's go play frisbee.

915
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:01,896
Oh goody, goody

916
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:03,781
I want to look too.

917
01:12:04,156 --> 01:12:04,827
Don't got too far,

918
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:05,359
you hear me?

919
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,191
Okay.

920
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:19,088
Mr. Chu,
your Kung Fu is so powerful,

921
01:12:19,213 --> 01:12:21,255
how do you manage to
have such elegant calligraphy?

922
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:24,378
I'm ashamed to talk about it.

923
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,842
My grandfather was
a Ching Dynasty Scholar,

924
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,674
my father was one of
the Nation Founders

925
01:12:29,807 --> 01:12:32,640
who's in charge of
the Nationalist government.

926
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:35,681
My son is a PhD in computer science.

927
01:12:35,813 --> 01:12:37,394
In the middle of this line,

928
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:40,065
there's worthless me.

929
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,482
Fate and circumstances

930
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:45,364
pushed me to spend my life

931
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:47,572
on practicing martial arts.

932
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,911
You shouldn't say that.

933
01:12:50,452 --> 01:12:54,416
I had poor health when I was a kid.

934
01:12:54,749 --> 01:12:56,741
I'm an only son.

935
01:12:56,876 --> 01:12:59,709
My family was worried.

936
01:12:59,837 --> 01:13:02,209
They took one of the doctor's advice

937
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:06,460
and made me practicing Kung Fu.

938
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:09,306
I couldn't take the rough styles,

939
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:12,973
I could only take the
gentle styles like Tai Chi Chuan.

940
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:20,980
Who would have thought that
a couple years later,

941
01:13:21,108 --> 01:13:23,771
I was completely vigorous and healthy.

942
01:13:25,112 --> 01:13:26,654
At 30,

943
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:29,734
I won a national Tai Chi Pushing
Hands Championship.

944
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:32,915
Exercising the body and
teaching students,

945
01:13:33,037 --> 01:13:34,619
that's a relatively simple,

946
01:13:34,747 --> 01:13:35,497
trouble-free life.

947
01:13:36,373 --> 01:13:37,585
Trouble-free?

948
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:41,844
Since the communist liberation,
I've suffered all the pains.

949
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:44,004
Let's not talk about it.

950
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:45,883
When it comes to eaching students,

951
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:47,429
it has also hurt me so much.

952
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:48,422
Oh..., yes,

953
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:50,214
have you gone back to see

954
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:51,887
your oId home and
relatives since Taiwan loosened up?

955
01:13:52,222 --> 01:13:54,054
Two years ago,

956
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,518
I went back but
I don't have any close relative

957
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:57,354
but just some nieces and nephews.

958
01:13:59,063 --> 01:14:00,855
Still, a reunion with your family,

959
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:04,657
it must have been a happy time.

960
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:05,447
Not really.

961
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,411
When I left,

962
01:14:09,532 --> 01:14:10,663
they were not born yet.

963
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:13,370
I felt like Santa Claus,

964
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:15,489
giving so many gifts.

965
01:14:15,621 --> 01:14:16,782
There's no fun at all.

966
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:19,073
Beijing seemed to have

967
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,630
lost its flavor,

968
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:23,173
The oId warmth was gone.

969
01:14:24,797 --> 01:14:27,339
But I was very young when
I left 40 years ago,

970
01:14:28,217 --> 01:14:30,179
maybe my memories are mistaken,

971
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:31,554
anyways,

972
01:14:32,179 --> 01:14:35,342
I don't know what to
say but everything seemed unreal,

973
01:14:35,474 --> 01:14:36,976
I couldn't put my oId and
new impression together.

974
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:38,556
Mr. Chen,

975
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:40,272
Your impressions are not mistaken.

976
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:42,272
Beijing has changed a lot.

977
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:44,104
Is that so?

978
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:45,850
I feel closer when talking with you

979
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:49,989
than talking with
my neighbors in Beijing.

980
01:14:50,114 --> 01:14:51,696
Really?

981
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:54,915
Relax, don't move.

982
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:22,980
Mom, you're still in one piece.

983
01:15:23,397 --> 01:15:24,478
Child!

984
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:27,101
Dad, we're going to
take the kids up the hill.

985
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:28,317
Don't go too far, you hear me?

986
01:15:28,443 --> 01:15:28,854
Okay.

987
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,361
Don't leave us here!

988
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:32,359
I'm going with you.

989
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:33,531
It's a steep climb.

990
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:34,819
You won't make it.

991
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,822
I'll take it slow.

992
01:15:36,952 --> 01:15:39,204
Let's get everything cleaned up

993
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:41,712
and put in the car.

994
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:52,471
Mrs Chen,
let the young foIks go ahead.

995
01:15:52,593 --> 01:15:53,884
You take it slow.

996
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:55,591
No, I'm fine.

997
01:15:57,515 --> 01:15:59,476
How come your son-in-law
didn't come today?

998
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,098
Gone... gone... a... way
on bus... business.

999
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:05,485
If he weren't away...,

1000
01:16:05,606 --> 01:16:07,487
we wouldn't have you over for dinner.

1001
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:09,989
Don't mention him!

1002
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,652
He makes me angry.

1003
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:13,242
What about your daughter-in-law?

1004
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:16,949
We have almost the same story here.

1005
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:28,375
Chen Mama,
it's too much for you, let's go down.

1006
01:16:28,504 --> 01:16:29,625
Ah, Ah..., shut up, just keep going.

1007
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,101
Grandma!

1008
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,431
Grandpa!

1009
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:12,169
Don't run so fast, wait for me.

1010
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:13,553
Hey!

1011
01:17:18,804 --> 01:17:21,597
The young people are so energetic.

1012
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:22,605
They can't slow down,

1013
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:24,259
just let them go ahead.

1014
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:26,606
I'll climb slowly with you.

1015
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:27,940
Why not sit down and rest a bit?

1016
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:38,578
I'm old and useless.

1017
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:40,160
No one wants me.

1018
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:43,536
We're out for fun,
why get mad at the kids?

1019
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:46,877
How can you be so
developed in Kung Fu

1020
01:17:46,999 --> 01:17:48,791
but have no insight?

1021
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:49,589
They set us up,

1022
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,631
can't you tell this?

1023
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,541
Set us up?

1024
01:17:52,963 --> 01:17:54,004
Your precious son

1025
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:55,462
came to our house last week

1026
01:17:55,591 --> 01:17:56,712
and arranged for my daughter.

1027
01:17:58,052 --> 01:18:00,094
He asked my daughter to
call and invit you.

1028
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:02,895
They thought that I was taking a nap,

1029
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:04,436
but actually I heard everything.

1030
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,350
Can't it be?

1031
01:18:06,476 --> 01:18:07,227
It cen't be?

1032
01:18:08,103 --> 01:18:09,805
At our age,

1033
01:18:11,356 --> 01:18:12,808
why don't we have any self-respect,

1034
01:18:12,942 --> 01:18:14,864
but letting those
two children manipulate us?

1035
01:18:16,111 --> 01:18:17,693
What's this for?

1036
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:23,529
Devalue me for my oId and useless.

1037
01:18:33,378 --> 01:18:35,080
Son, thank you for your kindness

1038
01:18:35,214 --> 01:18:37,466
trying to fix me up with Mrs Chen.

1039
01:18:37,592 --> 01:18:41,295
But we still have our pride.

1040
01:18:41,428 --> 01:18:43,641
No need to drive oId persons out.

1041
01:18:43,764 --> 01:18:45,516
I have the sense to leave on my own.

1042
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:46,842
You know the oId saying that

1043
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:48,648
"It's easier to struggle together

1044
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:50,230
than to pass happy days together."

1045
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:51,766
I've never imagined that

1046
01:18:51,897 --> 01:18:55,060
this would apply to
us father and the son.

1047
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:58,696
How many difficult times in China,

1048
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:02,665
we could overcome challenges
happily together.

1049
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:05,285
But here in US with so
many fine-material things,

1050
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,203
it seems there's no place in
your home for me.

1051
01:19:09,248 --> 01:19:10,870
Comparing the two,

1052
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,753
I can't help but recall the days

1053
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:16,420
when you were a small lovely boy.

1054
01:19:16,547 --> 01:19:18,128
Don't look for me.

1055
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:21,260
Enjoy your life with your family.

1056
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:23,548
I wish you all the best.

1057
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,681
If you have time,

1058
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:28,769
send my regards to Mrs.
Chen and her daughter.

1059
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:30,635
The world is so big,

1060
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,852
how can't one find
a little corner for him?

1061
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,351
I'll rent a little room,

1062
01:19:34,481 --> 01:19:36,393
so I can spend my worthless oId age.

1063
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:38,988
Life passes before
one's eyes like smoke,

1064
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:42,244
so one shouldn't set his heart
on anything.

1065
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:43,954
Father.

1066
01:19:50,497 --> 01:19:51,539
Hurry up!

1067
01:19:55,419 --> 01:19:57,461
Thank you, come again.

1068
01:19:58,923 --> 01:19:59,463
Bye-bye.

1069
01:20:10,726 --> 01:20:11,767
Please wash the bowls faster.

1070
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:12,484
If I can't put out the soup,

1071
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:13,734
my other dishes can't go out.

1072
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:14,775
I'll wash you a bowl first,

1073
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:15,688
then the dishes.

1074
01:20:15,815 --> 01:20:16,485
Sorry.

1075
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:19,605
Thanks.

1076
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:22,995
Old Chu, I beg you, please do it faster.

1077
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:24,074
Coming, coming.

1078
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:29,406
Why do you keep sending out
the take-away orders?

1079
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:31,498
There's guests at the tables with
nothing to eat!

1080
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:32,833
And a line around the block!

1081
01:20:32,957 --> 01:20:35,830
Boss, we can't put out the
food without dishes!

1082
01:20:38,504 --> 01:20:39,334
Yesterday at the employment agency,

1083
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:41,045
you said you had experience!

1084
01:20:41,173 --> 01:20:42,845
More or less, I am getting used to it.

1085
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:45,209
I'm running a business to make money,

1086
01:20:45,344 --> 01:20:46,465
not to invite you for the free lunch!

1087
01:20:46,596 --> 01:20:47,346
What do you mean more or less?

1088
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:48,172
This is less!

1089
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:50,347
Yeah, yeah, don't get mad,
I'm hurrying.

1090
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:53,519
Soak the plates with
solid-honey in hot water.

1091
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:56,026
Don't just scrape them!

1092
01:20:56,146 --> 01:20:56,937
You break the plate,

1093
01:20:57,064 --> 01:20:57,775
you pay for it!

1094
01:20:57,898 --> 01:20:58,689
Yes.

1095
01:20:58,816 --> 01:20:59,396
Boss,

1096
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:01,186
can you please do us a favor?

1097
01:21:01,318 --> 01:21:03,230
How about not selling those
stupid honey banana balls?

1098
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:04,534
It's hard for us to make and
hard for him to wash.

1099
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:05,365
Not worth it.

1100
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:07,031
I'll decide if it's worthy or not!

1101
01:21:07,157 --> 01:21:08,448
If you don't do it,

1102
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:09,737
others will!

1103
01:21:10,202 --> 01:21:12,374
Come on,
it's just a good hearted suggestion.

1104
01:21:12,496 --> 01:21:13,487
Thanks!

1105
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:15,743
What are
you three guys stuck here for?

1106
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:16,622
Waiting for bowls.

1107
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,452
Can't you do
something else while you are waiting?

1108
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:19,747
Are you brain dead.

1109
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:21,210
There's nothing else to do!

1110
01:21:21,338 --> 01:21:22,459
Are the
Mu Shu Pork pancakes steamed?

1111
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,210
In the steamer.

1112
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,171
Sauteed Minced Pigeon with
Sliced Vegetables?

1113
01:21:24,299 --> 01:21:25,340
Vegetables are soaked.

1114
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:26,556
The wontons are boiling,

1115
01:21:26,677 --> 01:21:28,138
the orders are taken,

1116
01:21:28,262 --> 01:21:28,923
the tables are cleared,

1117
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:29,925
the checks are paid.

1118
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:03,342
Chu,

1119
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:05,715
here's today's pay.

1120
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:07,171
Thank you.

1121
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:11,103
It doesn't work.

1122
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:12,352
Don't come tomorrow,

1123
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:13,894
I'll find someone else.

1124
01:22:14,349 --> 01:22:16,391
Boss he's going okay now.

1125
01:22:16,936 --> 01:22:17,977
There were enough dishes.

1126
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:20,144
And there is no problem when
taking orders.

1127
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:22,558
What do you mean "enough dishes",
"no problem"?

1128
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:25,059
It was only after the dinner rush hour

1129
01:22:25,194 --> 01:22:27,026
that things returned to normal.

1130
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,572
Don't be pleading for
him because he's oId.

1131
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,120
Lots of young guys would fight for
the chance

1132
01:22:33,243 --> 01:22:35,035
to make 700 doIlars a
month washing dishes.

1133
01:22:35,412 --> 01:22:36,664
Why should I have an oId man?

1134
01:22:36,789 --> 01:22:37,830
I'm not running an nursing home.

1135
01:22:37,957 --> 01:22:38,958
Are you kidding?

1136
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,956
Boss, please give me one more chance.

1137
01:22:42,086 --> 01:22:44,539
We all have to start, right?

1138
01:22:47,382 --> 01:22:49,795
Okay, okay. One more chance.

1139
01:22:49,927 --> 01:22:51,088
Thank you.

1140
01:25:19,243 --> 01:25:20,535
Is Sargeant Warren there?

1141
01:25:21,537 --> 01:25:22,578
It's Alex Chu...

1142
01:25:23,998 --> 01:25:24,789
Yes.

1143
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:26,290
No?

1144
01:25:32,006 --> 01:25:32,957
Thanks Sargeant.

1145
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:33,801
Bye bye.

1146
01:25:54,278 --> 01:25:55,940
Linda?

1147
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:57,733
It's Alex.

1148
01:25:57,865 --> 01:25:58,826
Let's have a talk...

1149
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,121
...about the house.

1150
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:08,704
Hey, congratulations on your review:

1151
01:26:08,834 --> 01:26:11,036
"A boId new voice in women's fiction"

1152
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:12,211
Better late then never.

1153
01:26:12,337 --> 01:26:14,039
I'm proud of you,

1154
01:26:14,173 --> 01:26:16,716
although,
it makes me feel like I should quit my job

1155
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:18,924
and become a painter.

1156
01:26:20,012 --> 01:26:22,354
In the meantime, all I do is eat.

1157
01:26:22,472 --> 01:26:24,394
Maybe you're pregnant.

1158
01:26:24,517 --> 01:26:27,940
Sure, if you believe in
immaculate conception.

1159
01:26:28,854 --> 01:26:30,105
You know,

1160
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:31,862
I'm even thinking of going to
my high schooI reunion

1161
01:26:31,982 --> 01:26:33,944
to see if there are
any aging jocks sill available.

1162
01:26:34,068 --> 01:26:34,899
Oh, Linda!

1163
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,733
Well, at least I have my work.

1164
01:26:39,156 --> 01:26:40,157
How's yours coming?

1165
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:41,448
Two chapters this week.

1166
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:44,198
Oh, more travails of
study pioneer women.

1167
01:26:44,328 --> 01:26:46,571
Actually,
I've written in a Chinese family.

1168
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:47,456
The father brought over

1169
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:48,743
to work on the railroads.

1170
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:51,326
Don't tell me you miss the oId geezer?

1171
01:26:51,836 --> 01:26:52,496
Of course not.

1172
01:26:52,628 --> 01:26:53,999
Runaway Grandpa.

1173
01:26:54,129 --> 01:26:56,131
I'm gonna have nightmares for
the rest of my life

1174
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,137
imagining his face every morning

1175
01:26:57,257 --> 01:26:59,179
on the side of my milk cartons.

1176
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:00,342
It's sad.

1177
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:01,966
And Alex...

1178
01:27:02,096 --> 01:27:03,337
He blames you, does he?

1179
01:27:03,472 --> 01:27:05,685
No, he's just anxious...,

1180
01:27:06,559 --> 01:27:07,850
and I blame myself.

1181
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,982
Ah! Li, how can I let you do this?

1182
01:27:17,111 --> 01:27:17,732
You'd better do your own work,

1183
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:18,853
Don't worry about me.

1184
01:27:18,988 --> 01:27:20,570
Hurry up, once I get busy,

1185
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:22,570
I won't be able to help you anyway.

1186
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,321
Wu, everyone's got work to do.

1187
01:27:24,451 --> 01:27:25,823
Don't treat me special.

1188
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:26,784
I can take care of myself,

1189
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:28,033
you also have works to do.

1190
01:27:29,456 --> 01:27:30,918
Chu, this is for you,

1191
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:31,872
I've got someone.

1192
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:33,923
Boss, I've been doing all right.

1193
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:39,679
Eight bowls,

1194
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,011
five plates,

1195
01:27:41,135 --> 01:27:42,376
now it's only 6:30 pm,

1196
01:27:42,512 --> 01:27:44,223
and you even need those two to
help you.

1197
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:45,227
What will happen at 7:30?

1198
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:48,310
My guests will be
lined up outside the door?

1199
01:27:48,433 --> 01:27:49,474
He didn't ask for help,

1200
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:50,773
we volunteered.

1201
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:51,596
You volunteered? Fine!

1202
01:27:51,729 --> 01:27:52,730
He asked for help, fine!

1203
01:27:52,855 --> 01:27:55,027
I don't care.
I can't take any risks tonight.

1204
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:55,640
Liu

1205
01:27:56,066 --> 01:27:57,357
go downstairs and
get yourself an apron.

1206
01:27:58,778 --> 01:27:59,318
Here's ten doIlars,

1207
01:27:59,444 --> 01:28:01,196
take it or leave it.

1208
01:28:01,321 --> 01:28:03,994
Boss, do you have to
treat an oId man this way?

1209
01:28:04,116 --> 01:28:06,158
I'll wash faster.

1210
01:28:07,452 --> 01:28:09,244
Not just faster, but cleaner too!

1211
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,331
Come on, cut the crap, go!

1212
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:12,957
Time is money.

1213
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:15,215
Have you heard that before?

1214
01:28:17,171 --> 01:28:19,003
Probably not,
you came from Mainland China.

1215
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:20,670
I know everything's shared there,

1216
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,921
working more but gets you nothing.

1217
01:28:22,259 --> 01:28:23,050
Four decades of
such thinking has produced

1218
01:28:23,177 --> 01:28:24,919
all you lazy bums.

1219
01:28:25,054 --> 01:28:25,975
Useless trash.

1220
01:28:27,723 --> 01:28:29,094
Who are you calling a useless trash?

1221
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,142
Eh? What's wrong?
You don't accept that?

1222
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:34,682
Then go back to China and
live off others. Go on!

1223
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:36,145
No one's stopping you.

1224
01:28:36,273 --> 01:28:37,144
I'm telling you,

1225
01:28:37,274 --> 01:28:38,315
this is America.

1226
01:28:38,442 --> 01:28:40,024
There's no communal property.

1227
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:41,033
You have to earn everything

1228
01:28:41,153 --> 01:28:42,825
by yourself!

1229
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:45,439
You wanna be an American?
Go all the way!

1230
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:47,867
Buy a dishwasher to
wash faster and cleaner.

1231
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,252
Yeh! I'm offering you ten doIlars

1232
01:28:52,372 --> 01:28:54,374
because I respect your age.

1233
01:28:54,499 --> 01:28:56,411
I'm saving face for you,

1234
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:57,334
if you don't want that,

1235
01:28:57,461 --> 01:28:58,452
then I'll throw you out!

1236
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:01,626
See if you can.

1237
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:03,634
Don't think I won't touch you

1238
01:29:03,759 --> 01:29:04,590
because you're oId.

1239
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,552
Come try me!

1240
01:29:07,096 --> 01:29:08,518
If you can move me half a step,

1241
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,470
I won't say another word,

1242
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,642
but turn and leave.

1243
01:29:12,768 --> 01:29:13,769
Don't...

1244
01:29:19,191 --> 01:29:20,823
So the oId geezer knows Kung Fu.

1245
01:29:21,485 --> 01:29:23,397
No wonder you dared be
so arrogant with me!

1246
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:28,160
Li, Wu,

1247
01:29:28,283 --> 01:29:28,824
help me!

1248
01:29:29,284 --> 01:29:30,235
I'm not getting involved in this.

1249
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:32,446
Chang, Chien,

1250
01:29:32,788 --> 01:29:33,328
get over here!

1251
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:36,208
Boss, this is none of our business.

1252
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,745
Do you want to keep working here?

1253
01:29:39,294 --> 01:29:39,795
Quick!

1254
01:29:45,342 --> 01:29:46,253
Old Chu,

1255
01:29:46,385 --> 01:29:47,887
don't get angry, but we've all got

1256
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,512
families to take care of.

1257
01:29:50,097 --> 01:29:51,428
We'll just move you half a step, okay?

1258
01:29:51,932 --> 01:29:52,723
Then the business will keep going,

1259
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:53,561
and everyone will thank you.

1260
01:29:54,852 --> 01:29:56,353
Come on, careful now.

1261
01:29:56,812 --> 01:29:57,262
Come on.

1262
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:00,360
Get him!

1263
01:30:01,108 --> 01:30:02,479
Liu, help out!

1264
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,320
Get him!

1265
01:30:06,155 --> 01:30:07,196
Do something!

1266
01:30:28,218 --> 01:30:30,681
Chu, you're a hero.
We can't move you.

1267
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:33,257
We brothers apologize.

1268
01:30:34,725 --> 01:30:35,265
Boss Huang,

1269
01:30:36,519 --> 01:30:37,980
we quit!

1270
01:30:38,478 --> 01:30:40,561
Go find yourself some

1271
01:30:41,273 --> 01:30:43,025
shameless big muscles rogues.

1272
01:30:43,609 --> 01:30:45,150
I can't take this!

1273
01:30:47,905 --> 01:30:49,867
Hey, you can't all leave!

1274
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:53,447
Okay!
I'm calling every employment agency!

1275
01:30:53,578 --> 01:30:55,570
Don't think you'll work in
New York again!

1276
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:00,958
All right tough guy!

1277
01:31:01,085 --> 01:31:02,286
The business is closed tonight.

1278
01:31:02,419 --> 01:31:03,250
Think you are good?

1279
01:31:03,378 --> 01:31:04,289
But I'm calling the cops on you!

1280
01:31:04,421 --> 01:31:05,753
I don't have a green card.

1281
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:07,292
You hired me illegally.

1282
01:31:07,424 --> 01:31:09,136
They'll fine
you three thousand doIlars first.

1283
01:31:09,259 --> 01:31:10,140
I'm telling you,

1284
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,013
I'll move you without the cops!

1285
01:31:23,315 --> 01:31:25,407
Thank you, come again.

1286
01:31:52,762 --> 01:31:54,303
The oId bum is in the kitchen.

1287
01:31:54,429 --> 01:31:56,131
Go and smash him!

1288
01:31:56,265 --> 01:31:57,306
Show no mercy!

1289
01:32:19,329 --> 01:32:21,371
Yeah, I've seen this kind before.

1290
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:23,811
Ten police officers from
the Fifth Precinct

1291
01:33:23,936 --> 01:33:25,528
were injured earlier this evening

1292
01:33:25,646 --> 01:33:28,148
in a brawl inside
a Chinatown restaurant.

1293
01:33:28,273 --> 01:33:29,645
Helen Wong reports.

1294
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:32,982
Shirley, I'm standing in
front of the Lai Fu restaurant.

1295
01:33:33,112 --> 01:33:34,784
The owner Frankie Huang tried to fire

1296
01:33:34,905 --> 01:33:36,406
his seventy year oId dishwasher here

1297
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:37,533
earlier this evening.

1298
01:33:37,658 --> 01:33:39,540
But Huang get more than
he bargained for

1299
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,122
because the man he tried to fire Mr Chu

1300
01:33:42,246 --> 01:33:43,447
refused to leave the restaurant.

1301
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:44,832
Alex.

1302
01:33:44,957 --> 01:33:46,669
Police said that Mr.
Chu is a Tai Chi master.

1303
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:50,546
And he let lose a hundred
thirty pounds of martial arts fury.

1304
01:33:50,671 --> 01:33:52,462
And hurt over a dozen of
New York's finest.

1305
01:33:53,007 --> 01:33:54,128
Now it appears that

1306
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:57,131
Mr Chu's being lead out of
the restaurant by the police

1307
01:33:57,261 --> 01:33:59,003
and is being put into a squad car

1308
01:33:59,138 --> 01:34:02,762
and taken to the precinct and
be arrested.

1309
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:05,144
Peporting live, Helen Wong,

1310
01:34:05,269 --> 01:34:07,061
now back to you at the studio.

1311
01:34:43,223 --> 01:34:45,896
He's been like this ever since
he came in.

1312
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:47,189
The entire time he has been here,

1313
01:34:47,311 --> 01:34:48,392
he hasn't said anything

1314
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:50,402
nor has he eaten anything either
to drink.

1315
01:34:51,691 --> 01:34:52,401
I tell you,

1316
01:34:53,275 --> 01:34:55,487
I don't know if he's meditating or
sleeping.

1317
01:35:02,535 --> 01:35:04,917
If you don't mind me saying so,
Mr Chu,

1318
01:35:05,037 --> 01:35:05,998
it's kind of depressing.

1319
01:35:13,128 --> 01:35:15,330
I'll let you go in and talk to him.

1320
01:35:15,715 --> 01:35:16,586
Thank you, officer.

1321
01:35:17,132 --> 01:35:17,923
Any time.

1322
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:35,235
Dad.

1323
01:35:40,948 --> 01:35:47,825
Ah, attaining nothingness isn't easy.

1324
01:35:50,249 --> 01:35:52,672
Dad, we've bought a new house,

1325
01:35:52,793 --> 01:35:54,004
it's much bigger than the oId one.

1326
01:35:55,212 --> 01:35:55,873
What for?

1327
01:35:57,297 --> 01:35:58,338
I'm here to take you home.

1328
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:01,716
Home? Who's home?

1329
01:36:03,345 --> 01:36:05,267
Mine is yours.

1330
01:36:06,098 --> 01:36:08,981
Forget it. I see clearly now,

1331
01:36:10,144 --> 01:36:12,977
the only thing that matters

1332
01:36:13,105 --> 01:36:15,397
is that you have a happy life.

1333
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:18,951
If you want to
show me some filial respect,

1334
01:36:19,069 --> 01:36:24,074
rent me an apartment in Chinatown.

1335
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,702
Let me peacefully pass my days

1336
01:36:27,452 --> 01:36:28,904
and discipline my spirit.

1337
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,212
In your free time,

1338
01:36:32,332 --> 01:36:34,254
bring the boy to see me.

1339
01:36:35,545 --> 01:36:37,046
By this way, when we get together,

1340
01:36:38,047 --> 01:36:39,418
there'll still be some good feelings.

1341
01:36:42,259 --> 01:36:43,631
Dad,

1342
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:46,473
all these years,

1343
01:36:47,014 --> 01:36:49,557
I've studied and worked so hard

1344
01:36:49,684 --> 01:36:51,926
to build a family

1345
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,601
in order that one day

1346
01:36:53,729 --> 01:36:55,230
I could bring you to the States,

1347
01:36:56,065 --> 01:36:58,738
so you could have some good days
in your life.

1348
01:37:00,235 --> 01:37:01,026
Dad!

1349
01:37:14,499 --> 01:37:17,292
Alex, can you give a hand up here?

1350
01:37:17,419 --> 01:37:19,512
Okay. Coming up

1351
01:37:26,554 --> 01:37:27,595
Is this straight?

1352
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:29,351
Lower on the left,

1353
01:37:30,641 --> 01:37:31,351
yes.

1354
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:32,136
It's fine.

1355
01:37:32,267 --> 01:37:33,849
Do you think he'll ever spend
a night here?

1356
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:35,312
Oh, yes.

1357
01:37:35,437 --> 01:37:38,030
As long as Jeremy is here,
Grandpa will visit.

1358
01:37:38,148 --> 01:37:39,900
Jeremy wants to be a Tai Chi master.

1359
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:42,277
Why didn't you ever learn any
Tai Chi from your father?

1360
01:37:42,402 --> 01:37:43,654
You know, for Dad,

1361
01:37:43,779 --> 01:37:46,321
Tai Chi was a way to
escape from reality.

1362
01:37:46,949 --> 01:37:48,701
Even when he did pushing hands,

1363
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:51,909
for him, it was a way to
avoid other people.

1364
01:37:52,037 --> 01:37:53,579
Pushing hands?

1365
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:57,459
Yeah, it's like Tai Chi for two.

1366
01:37:57,585 --> 01:37:59,877
A way of keeping your balance

1367
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:01,836
while unbalancing your opponent.

1368
01:38:01,964 --> 01:38:03,135
Like marriage, only kidding.

1369
01:38:04,717 --> 01:38:06,178
Okay, you stand like this.

1370
01:38:08,262 --> 01:38:08,713
Balanced?

1371
01:38:08,846 --> 01:38:09,386
Yup.

1372
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:11,465
If you try to unbalance me,

1373
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:13,060
I simply avoid your energy

1374
01:38:13,183 --> 01:38:14,855
and turn it back on you.

1375
01:38:20,065 --> 01:38:21,356
Relax.

1376
01:38:23,611 --> 01:38:26,483
Don't resist and don't break contact.

1377
01:38:28,908 --> 01:38:30,620
Feel it?

1378
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:43,856
Good.

1379
01:39:46,777 --> 01:39:47,197
Relax.

1380
01:39:47,319 --> 01:39:48,661
Relax little, relax, squat down.

1381
01:39:59,206 --> 01:40:00,618
Relax little,

1382
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,121
lower.

1383
01:40:04,294 --> 01:40:08,589
Relax.

1384
01:40:08,716 --> 01:40:10,337
Raise your right arm, too much,

1385
01:40:10,467 --> 01:40:12,089
and look at far distance.

1386
01:40:13,846 --> 01:40:16,228
Mrs Chen, such a long time!

1387
01:40:16,348 --> 01:40:18,140
You've come a long way to
buy groceries.

1388
01:40:18,267 --> 01:40:20,099
No, not far. I live in the area.

1389
01:40:20,936 --> 01:40:21,937
Your daughter have moved?

1390
01:40:22,062 --> 01:40:23,483
No, but I have.

1391
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:26,440
That's great! Living on your own,
you're free.

1392
01:40:26,567 --> 01:40:28,609
You can do whatever you want.

1393
01:40:29,278 --> 01:40:30,530
I just finished food shopping

1394
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:33,067
saw it was early,

1395
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:35,110
so I decided to stop by your class.

1396
01:40:35,242 --> 01:40:37,154
How did you know I was
teaching here?

1397
01:40:38,412 --> 01:40:40,034
Wow! Who doesn't know about
the hero oId Mr Chu,

1398
01:40:40,164 --> 01:40:42,577
is famous all over Chinatown.

1399
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,411
The TV news showed that

1400
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:45,875
a gang of American police and
Chinese hoodlums

1401
01:40:46,003 --> 01:40:47,164
were all smashed by you.

1402
01:40:48,589 --> 01:40:49,590
From what I can see,

1403
01:40:49,715 --> 01:40:51,877
if Tai Chi Chuan could be
practiced upside down,

1404
01:40:52,009 --> 01:40:53,761
the ceiling of this oId age centre

1405
01:40:53,886 --> 01:40:55,728
would be packed with your students.

1406
01:40:56,514 --> 01:40:58,345
You're making fun of me!

1407
01:40:58,473 --> 01:41:00,676
I'm speaking the truth.

1408
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:01,601
Did you make a fortune?

1409
01:41:02,436 --> 01:41:03,387
No way.

1410
01:41:03,813 --> 01:41:04,894
Every morning,

1411
01:41:05,523 --> 01:41:07,434
I come here and pass the time with
the students.

1412
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:10,234
Anyways,

1413
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,281
we oId foIks have nothing

1414
01:41:12,404 --> 01:41:13,786
but time to kill.

1415
01:41:13,906 --> 01:41:14,947
That's fine.

1416
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,491
I earn my own money and

1417
01:41:16,617 --> 01:41:17,948
don't take anybody's flack.

1418
01:41:18,285 --> 01:41:20,998
That's why I always say,

1419
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:23,163
you can't hoId everything inside.

1420
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:24,662
Sometimes you've got to
lose your temper

1421
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:25,703
to straighten things out.

1422
01:41:27,127 --> 01:41:28,258
The kids are grown up.

1423
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:31,335
If we oId foIks don't take care of
ourselves,

1424
01:41:31,465 --> 01:41:32,456
who will?

1425
01:41:34,051 --> 01:41:35,012
You're right.

1426
01:41:36,261 --> 01:41:37,763
Is your shoulder better?

1427
01:41:38,806 --> 01:41:39,597
Better?

1428
01:41:40,182 --> 01:41:41,684
At my age, if it doesn't get worse,

1429
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:43,270
I should thank the heavens.

1430
01:41:44,019 --> 01:41:45,561
I don't know Kung Fu like you.

1431
01:41:47,607 --> 01:41:49,278
But is it convenient living alone?

1432
01:41:50,442 --> 01:41:51,153
It's all right.

1433
01:41:52,402 --> 01:41:53,944
My daughter comes to visit me

1434
01:41:54,071 --> 01:41:55,112
every two or three weeks.

1435
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:57,657
And we will go to movies,

1436
01:41:57,783 --> 01:41:59,484
restaurants, or go food shoping.

1437
01:42:00,327 --> 01:42:02,790
Uhhhh. That's good.

1438
01:42:02,913 --> 01:42:04,494
Alex and his family do the same.

1439
01:42:18,178 --> 01:42:19,930
You'd better take care of
your students, I'm leaving.

1440
01:42:20,055 --> 01:42:21,507
When you're free, stop by.

1441
01:42:22,266 --> 01:42:24,308
Sure, we're neighbors now.

1442
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:26,476
Well, please take care.

1443
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:28,102
You too.

1444
01:42:54,882 --> 01:42:55,503
Mrs Chen!

1445
01:42:58,511 --> 01:42:59,512
Why did you come out?

1446
01:43:00,805 --> 01:43:02,296
To see if you had left.

1447
01:43:03,223 --> 01:43:04,975
The sun is so pleasant today.

1448
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:06,971
I was thinking that live by myself,

1449
01:43:07,102 --> 01:43:09,515
I could go home or stay out,
both would be good,

1450
01:43:10,147 --> 01:43:12,479
anyways, standing here,
I got lost in thoughts.

1451
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:13,688
Where do you live?

1452
01:43:14,443 --> 01:43:16,485
I live in that building, room 1168.

1453
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:19,952
I live in that building, room 2101.

1454
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:23,372
Stop by for a visit sometime.

1455
01:43:24,537 --> 01:43:25,918
Do you have anything to
do this afternoon?

1456
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:31,043
Uh... Nothing.

1457
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:34,421
Nothing? Nothing.

1
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,215
Sorry, uh...

2
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,243
- Did you want your kite?
- Yes.

3
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:35,117
- Come and get it.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,867
Is there anything else you want?

5
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,579
INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS

6
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,770
Louis, I want you to meet Jeff Marlo.
He's a writer

7
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:53,773
...he rents the little blue house
and flies a kite.

8
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,276
Yes, I saw you swimming this morning.

9
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,910
I swim a lot.

10
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,763
Ah, I'm sure you do.

11
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:02,547
Would you like a drink?

12
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,575
- I've got one, thanks
- OK

13
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,524
So, I'll take care of myself.
I suppose that my...

14
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,517
...charming wife told you I drink a lot!

15
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,659
To your health.

16
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,366
How horrible.

17
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,877
Why are you laughing?

18
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,951
Why not?

19
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,062
You can't imagine... what it feels like...

20
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,471
...suddenly, it's like your heart explodes...

21
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,845
...and then, everything is black...

22
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,057
...and you die.

23
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:57,085
So, why drink, it's not very clever

24
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,623
No, no, it's got nothing to do
with being clever...

25
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,869
...or intelligent...

26
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,641
But it has everything to do with:

27
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,634
Pain!

28
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,554
Anyway...

29
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,582
Soon I'll take my...

30
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,964
...marvelous wife,

31
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,734
...somewhere, anywhere...

32
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:40,762
to America or Martinique, we'll see...

33
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,047
Come here, come on,
come, come, come...

34
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,742
...come come, closer...

35
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:09,491
...come here, please...

36
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,506
Listen, I have a few questions
to ask you, Julie...

37
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,422
...first: Why can't we make love any more...

38
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,923
...next, why don't you ever kiss me?

39
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,762
...next, why do you refuse to
let me touch you?

40
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:39,755
...and, do you hate me?

41
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,797
Stop drinking...

42
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:47,529
...It's too stupid.

43
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,443
Louis, I beg you.

44
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,471
Why do you put yourself in such a state?

45
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,787
That's a good question...

46
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,828
...That's what I call a very good question!

47
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,615
- Does he do this often?
- Yes

48
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,752
Help me, I'm going to put him to bed.

49
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,753
He's crazy.

50
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,556
NO. Don't touch it.

51
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,584
Don't touch the belt, help me.

52
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,282
What's going on?

53
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,863
It's nothing Louis.

54
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,780
Go to bed.

55
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,612
- How can you stand it?
- I can't.

56
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:10,605
I've had enough.

57
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:16,097
He hasn't touched me since his heart attack.

58
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,104
He sold his business and we settled here.

59
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,109
Now he wants us to go to Martinique.

60
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,790
He probably wants to replace
his whiskey with rum.

61
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:33,057
He'll never get there alive.

62
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,926
He won't hold up very long at this pace.

63
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,954
Why did you marry him?
He's at least 15 years older than you.

64
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,067
Eighteen.

65
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,736
He was very kind to me...

66
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,274
...I was supposed to do a film
and he financed it.

67
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,875
You were an actress?

68
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,903
I was starting out,
I didn't really want much. Anyway...

69
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,913
...he was really very nice...

70
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:03,712
...not great in bed, but nice...

71
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,364
So, let's talk about you,
what do you do besides fly kites?

72
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,357
- I write stupid shit.
- What?

73
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,270
I'm a writer.

74
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,298
I type because I can't read my handwriting...

75
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,380
...but I have no talent, I'm lazy...

76
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,550
...and I'm easily bored.

77
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,184
Bastard!

78
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,822
...I'm easily bored but you excite me...

79
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,815
Bastard.

80
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,396
He won't be around much longer,
take my word for it.

81
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,095
He won't last long.

82
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,760
THREE WEEKS LATER

83
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,893
- Are you Madam Wormser?
- Yes, I am.

84
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,921
- Your car is here.
- Don't you want to see it?

85
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,680
But are you sure you're not mistaken?

86
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,928
Mr. Wormser came by the garage...

87
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:34,035
- I'm a little late. Hope you like the car.
- Goodbye, thank you.

88
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,374
- You're crazy. This car!!
- Do you like it?

89
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,578
Of course I like it, it's my dream.

90
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,512
- Thank you.
- No no no!

91
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,016
Thank you...
Thank you for putting up with me.

92
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,186
It's to compensate...

93
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,286
Go on, go try it out.

94
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,324
No not today. Too much traffic.
I'm just going to look at it.

95
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:22,094
You've deserve it.
Me, I think I deserve a drink.

96
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:26,087
Don't move. I'll get it for you.

97
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,026
I love you!

98
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,428
Thank you.

99
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,037
I've been restless lately...

100
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,443
and I want to move, to go...

101
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,081
...do you understand?
- Yes.

102
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,077
It's true, I drink too much.

103
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,747
And afterward I feel...

104
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,713
...so tired...

105
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:56,644
too tired.

106
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,056
Sorry...

107
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,561
I talk too much.
I better go to bed, good night.

108
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,329
Good night.

109
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,357
Good night, Louis.

110
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,394
Good night, Julie.

111
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,183
This old guy is off to bed.

112
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,122
Jeff, please, Jeff, stay with me.
Don't go, I beg you...

113
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:06,025
...I beg you, please, Jeff,
don't leave me alone.

114
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,895
- No. We're already behind schedule.
- Jeff!

115
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,730
No, we can't see each other for 3 or 4 days.

116
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,132
Not even phone each other.

117
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,836
Maybe I'll just leave a few days, until...

118
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,471
the accident becomes official huh?

119
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,475
I'll let you know one way or the other.

120
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,443
You must really...

121
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,278
Yes, yes. He could wake up.

122
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,148
Think about what I'll have to do.

123
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,053
I'll have to stay alone with him all night.

124
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,105
Can't you come back sooner?

125
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,088
God, you know we can't.

126
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,491
We have to have
Mother Chauvinet as an alibi.

127
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,463
No one can even suspect
that were in this together.

128
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:47,350
It's 11:30.
In 2 hours, in 2 hours...

129
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,790
The thing is on the corner of his desk...

130
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,195
...anyhow, I'm leaving.
See you later.

131
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,269
I killed him.

132
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,267
The car!

133
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,950
<i>Darling, I took the Datsun</i>.

134
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,253
<i>After this Interminable night...</i>

135
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,281
...<i>I don't have the courage</i>
<i>to go see the cops right away</i>.

136
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,930
<i>I'll bring the car back In 2 or 3 days</i>.
<i>You'll just need to explain...</i>

137
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:08,066
...<i>that I had to go to Italy</i>
<i>to do research for my novel...</i>

138
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,201
...<i>and since I had no money,</i>
<i>Louis Insisted...</i>

139
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,135
...<i>I borrow the car...</i>

140
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,538
<i>Everything went as planned</i>.

141
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,726
<i>I'm certain that</i>
<i>Mother Chauvinet Is ready to swear...</i>

142
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:21,316
...<i>that I didn’t leave the house</i>
<i>and worked all night...</i>

143
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:24,872
<i>If you want to join me,</i>
<i>write me at my P.O. Box In Menton</i>.

144
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,717
<i>I'll check It tomorrow and the day after</i>.

145
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,745
<i>I'll be back before the beginning of the</i>
<i>Investigation, If there Is one</i>.

146
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,750
<i>But afterwards,</i>
<i>It'll be just the two of us</i>.

147
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,672
- The maritime police?
- Ah yes!

148
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,153
We've decided to investigate, Mrs. Wormser.

149
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:05,922
Oh! What's going on?

150
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,950
We were just going to
take the helicopter out.

151
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,988
I'm probably worrying for nothing.
But he's always so punctual...

152
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,227
Thank you

153
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,659
Must be the salt air, my underwear is itching.

154
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:44,652
Yes

155
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,029
- Madam.
- Gentlemen.

156
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,057
Madam Wormser?
I'm Inspector Villon, from Draguignan.

157
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,664
- Please come in.
- Excuse me, Madam.

158
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,420
Didn't we meet at the Mayor's Reception?

159
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,092
That's it, yes, let me introduce
you to Inspector Lamy, from Paris.

160
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,328
I took the liberty
of asking him to come along.

161
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,962
Hope you don't mind, Madam.

162
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,400
I'm on vacation here
and Villon, my colleague, has requested...

163
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:26,393
- Please gentlemen, sit down.
- Thank you Madam

164
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,684
Well, Mrs. Wormser

165
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,855
We received a phone call
from the Maritime Police.

166
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,289
Yes?

167
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:50,317
They have, uh,
they have found Mr. Wormser's boat

168
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,802
But no one was on board.

169
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,438
What's that?

170
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,073
Oh no!!

171
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:07,101
The divers searched
for over an hour with no results.

172
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,479
And you think that...

173
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,031
Excuse me,
would you like to drink something?

174
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,434
- No.
- Thank you Madam.

175
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:33,427
Please.

176
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,439
We understand
what you're going through, Madam.

177
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,110
I'm terribly frightened.

178
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,582
Mr. Wormser perhaps went
aboard another boat...

179
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,441
...to say hello to friends.

180
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:03,023
Oh, that's very unlikely madam.

181
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,138
We are going to inspect the boat.
We wondered if...

182
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,575
...you'd like to go with us.

183
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,943
Ah, well, I don't know... I...

184
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,948
Ah, you'd rather wait here
for your husband to call...

185
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:20,519
...to tell you where he is?

186
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:24,020
You know, I'm beginning...

187
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:28,048
I'm beginning to fear
that he won't be able to.

188
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,862
Ah, we realize how you feel, Madam.

189
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,890
There is perhaps a very simple explanation
for this disappearance.

190
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,638
But, my colleague is forced
to ask you a few questions...

191
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,474
...that you might find indiscreet.

192
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,143
I don't know how I can help you gentlemen,

193
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:51,171
but I will tell you everything
you wish to know.

194
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:59,079
Yes well, do you know
if your husband has enemies, madam?

195
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,127
Enemies?
No, certainly not.

196
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,593
He's a very kind man, very peaceful.

197
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:11,024
He retired.
He wanted to live here.

198
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:17,264
And where did you dock your boat Madam?

199
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,376
In the harbor?

200
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,246
No...
We had a dock at the foot of the cliff.

201
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,184
- Could I trouble you for a glass of water
- Of course

202
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,020
- No don't get up.
- It's this way

203
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,520
excuse me

204
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,548
- You'll find glasses by the sink.
- Ah thank you

205
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,575
Tell me, it's quite a climb
up from the dock, isn't it?

206
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,979
Yes it's why we were thinking of moving.

207
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,561
Ah, but you would stay in St. Tropez?

208
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,333
I didn't know my husband
was considering the Antilles.

209
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,882
I've heard it's a marvelous place.

210
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:22,396
You know, nothing was really decided.

211
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,600
Tell me, do you see your neighbors much?

212
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,671
No... but last night we had a visitor,
Jeff Marlo.

213
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,620
He often comes to see Louis.
He came to dinner.

214
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:39,613
Ah and is he a neighbor?

215
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,094
Yes he lives just two houses below us.

216
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,995
He's a writer.

217
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,023
- Yes, they developed a friendship
- Ah... Yes, yes, yes.

218
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,461
Perhaps, he could see your husband's boat?

219
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,608
Well, we'll go pay him a visit.

220
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,962
Oh, I don't believe it will be worthwhile.

221
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:03,281
He told us last night
he was going to Italy.

222
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:07,274
He was leaving very early this morning.

223
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,312
Well, anyhow, we'll go and make sure.

224
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,383
No I'm quite sure he left.
He took one of our cars, the Datsun.

225
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,631
Oh, he did?
Did you lend it to him?

226
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,599
Yes, well...
My husband did.

227
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,627
Mr. Marlo has no car and we knew
that he has very limited means...

228
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,541
He was planning on going
for 2 or 3 days to... huh...

229
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,569
...ah yes, he wanted to gather material
for the book he's writing.

230
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,340
So, my husband lent him the car
to save him money.

231
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,619
And he accepted?

232
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,622
Well, yes, Louis insisted.

233
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,650
You say Mr. Marlo
lives two houses from here?

234
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,129
Who owns the other?

235
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,157
Mrs. Chauvinet, an elderly lady.

236
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,605
Has she visited you lately?

237
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,598
No, I rarely see her.

238
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,317
I'm afraid.

239
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,318
Of what madam?

240
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,723
I think that Louis had another heart attack.

241
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:21,793
...and he must have fallen overboard...

242
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:24,695
He had a heart attack last year.

243
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,688
Yes, it is plausible.

244
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,801
Ah yes, effectively, yes.

245
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,371
One last question Madam,
if you'll allow me.

246
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,377
Did your husband often keep
large sums of money on him...

247
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:43,370
...or on the boat?

248
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,004
Ah yes, I see that's interesting.

249
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,124
Did he have a lot of money on him?

250
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,117
No, I don't believe so, no.

251
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,555
...I'm sure he didn't.

252
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,107
- So?
- Well, let's see...

253
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,536
...according to this Madam Chauvinot...

254
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:24,887
...it seems he was home all night, typing.

255
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,570
Although, she did sleep a little
so it's not a perfect alibi.

256
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:32,219
And also she saw Mr. Wormser
go out with a big bag of some sort.

257
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,896
...Around five in the morning.

258
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,034
This woman must spend
her whole life at the window.

259
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:40,138
She has insomnia.
I think she's a bit of a drinker.

260
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,437
She's rather funny.

261
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,558
Can't smoke on board, Inspector.

262
00:35:44,593 --> 00:35:47,610
Say, on the subject of drinking...

263
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,815
...I don't think that
the Wormsers were teetotalers.

264
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,785
The trash can is full of whiskey bottles.

265
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,886
How'd you find out?

266
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,622
By getting thirsty at the right time.

267
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,193
We've checked everything,
there is nothing suspicious.

268
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:06,186
Well, let's see about that.

269
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,170
What's in here?
The head.

270
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,514
One could say this is a well kept boat,
it looks like it's never been used.

271
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:33,246
Yes, a little too much so. It looks like
Wormser didn't do a lot of fishing.

272
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,484
- There's no bait.
- Maybe on the deck.

273
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,332
Hey, officer, wasn't there any bait?

274
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,086
Bait?
No, say that's true, there was no bait.

275
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,806
- Alexander, can you come see?
- What is it?

276
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:52,799
- A spot of blood, look here.
- Ah yes.

277
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:58,338
Let's have it analyzed and dusted for prints.

278
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,719
Well, I don't think we'll find anything else.

279
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:05,712
Say, I wouldn't mind a drink.

280
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,903
Say, I suppose that confirms
the story of the heart attack.

281
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,871
What?
The blood stain?

282
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,909
Yes.
He headed out to do some fishing...

283
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:28,902
...dropped anchor, heart attack.

284
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,407
He collapsed, hit his head
and passed overboard.

285
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,679
Not too complicated.

286
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,322
Yes, but several things bother me.

287
00:37:44,357 --> 00:37:47,887
The lack of bait, the whiskey bottles.

288
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,036
The wife is young and pretty.
Seems hot to trot.

289
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:56,029
The neighbor borrowed the car.

290
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,402
You know,
I think you've got something there.

291
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,943
Still, I like your idea there.

292
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,924
Wormser was an alcoholic.

293
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,952
His wife and that guy kept him drunk...

294
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,499
Then, knock him off
to live happily ever after with his money.

295
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,069
Yes, but if the writer is involved...
why did he borrow the car?

296
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:26,636
That wasn't smart!

297
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,338
Maybe he just got scared.

298
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,742
We've got to find this Marlo,
interrogate him.

299
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,945
I'm going to call the police station.

300
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,938
Then we'll have that drink.

301
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,810
<i>Julie darling, It's so stupid,</i>
<i>forgot to warn you about the money belt</i>.

302
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,657
<i>It was full of bills and jewels</i>.

303
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,685
<i>I'll put It In a safe place</i>
<i>until I get back In a day or two</i>.

304
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,864
<i>Everything went well, just like I said</i>.

305
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,736
<i>He came on board</i>
<i>and gave me a bloody nose</i>.

306
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,736
<i>That's all he was able to do</i>.

307
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,041
<i>Write me as soon as you can</i>
<i>and tell me everything</i>.

308
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:07,495
<i>P.O. Box Menton. I love you</i>.

309
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,880
<i>Jeff, my love, my darling...</i>

310
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,518
<i>Everything Is going well</i>.
<i>The police came to see me...</i>

311
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:18,511
...<i>but they don't suspect a thing</i>.

312
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,560
<i>Hurry back, please</i>.
<i>I'm going crazy without you</i>.

313
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:26,553
<i>I love you, I love you, Julie</i>.

314
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,719
Hello sir.

315
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,488
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

316
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,516
I would like the balance
in my husband's account, Mr. Wormser

317
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,198
Certainly, Mrs. Wormser.
I assume it's a joint account?

318
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,933
No, it's in his name.

319
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,972
Ah, we can only give
this information to the titled owner.

320
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:10,373
Of course, I understand.

321
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,941
But... something terrible has happened.

322
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,713
Yes I know.
News travels very fast, you know.

323
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,415
I think we could
bend the rule just a little...

324
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,443
I believe your husband made
a recent withdrawal. Excuse me.

325
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,725
Yes, it was yesterday actually.

326
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,470
How much did he withdraw?

327
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,475
A rather large sum; a million and a half.

328
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,468
150 million old francs.

329
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,881
But, that's impossible.

330
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,909
Well, we were surprised but it's a fact.

331
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,215
And... what is left in the account?

332
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,161
Oh, 92 francs.

333
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,189
We had to notify him
this is below the minimum.

334
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,795
Aren't you feeling well, madam?

335
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,866
- Yes, please excuse me.
- Good day Mrs. Wormser.

336
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,674
Mrs. Wormser...

337
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,073
- Hello Mrs. Wormser.
- Gentlemen.

338
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:34,990
This is a happy coincidence Madam.

339
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,729
Yes, we received permission
to open your husband's safety deposit box.

340
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:40,698
You're welcome to join us.

341
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:42,131
I'm at your disposal.

342
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,159
You are very cooperative,
Madam. We appreciate it

343
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,753
Mr. Wormser was here recently.

344
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,565
He apparently took everything.

345
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,815
I'm happy you're here, Julie.

346
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,717
You see I am so distraught.

347
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:38,355
Since yesterday,
I feel like I'm in a waking nightmare.

348
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,348
Poor Julie.
Ah, it really is incomprehensible.

349
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,442
Georges, I had thought
maybe Louis told you his plans.

350
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:51,157
You were much more than
a financial advisor to him.

351
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,171
Don't speak about him in the past, Julie...

352
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,271
In the past?

353
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,442
I'm sorry to see you in this state.

354
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:01,544
You know I'm very fond of you both.

355
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,572
There, there, I'm sure everything
will be explained, go on and eat.

356
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,579
- I'm really not very hungry.
- Eat anyway.

357
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,717
Shall we have a soufflé for dessert?

358
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,731
The police came to my office this morning.

359
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,601
They asked me the same questions you did.

360
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:26,168
I told them I didn't know anything.

361
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,771
I won't tell you exactly the same thing.

362
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,799
In fact, he intends to leave
for the Antilles as soon as possible.

363
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:38,137
He'd already made all the arrangements.

364
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,116
And you think he's left for there?

365
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:45,087
Now now Julie, not without you.
He adores you.

366
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,115
No but I do believe
he's put the house up for sale.

367
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,995
Put the house up for sale?

368
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,023
He found something in Martinique, I believe.

369
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,803
He wanted to surprise you.

370
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,831
Now you're talking about him in past tense.

371
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,290
I'm concerned about leaving you alone, Julie.

372
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,706
You're very nice George, thank you.

373
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:38,407
I've got so much work right now.

374
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,311
Anyway, if you need anything, call me.

375
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,411
You can count on me.

376
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,448
Thank you.
I know I can count on you.

377
00:44:44,483 --> 00:44:48,441
You're very pretty, Julie.

378
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,713
Dear Mrs. Wormser...

379
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,018
- Please excuse our intrusion.
- Madam

380
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,117
Gentlemen

381
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,755
- Mr. Thorent brought you back?
- Yes.

382
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,390
We saw his car.

383
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:32,418
I suppose he told you
about our visit this morning?

384
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,730
Yes, he did.

385
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,758
Yes well,
we have some important news Madam.

386
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,005
We saw Mr. Wormser's doctor and...

387
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,010
...he made some rather surprising revelations.

388
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,879
Dr. Favart? What could he have told you?

389
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,907
Well, he told us that
your husband never suffered a heart attack.

390
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,959
What do you mean? But...

391
00:46:01,994 --> 00:46:05,027
That's right, it was an act.

392
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:09,055
Mr. Wormser suffered another illness
he found terribly humiliating.

393
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,995
According to Dr. Favart,
he had become impotent.

394
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,573
And so, it was to justify
his lack of passion towards you...

395
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:33,122
that he invented...

396
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:37,150
...that he invented this story
about the heart attack.

397
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,531
That makes no sense.
I don't believe a word.

398
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,559
Ah, you mean to say that
you had normal relations with him?

399
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,464
Sexual relations, that is.

400
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,410
No.

401
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:59,438
So the good doctor's statement was correct.

402
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,876
We have several rather difficult revelations

403
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:09,348
...in any case, surprising ones to tell you.

404
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,927
Please sit down.

405
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,329
Thank you, but I'm fine standing.

406
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:18,357
Oh no, Inspector Villon is right.
You'd better to sit down, believe me.

407
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,433
We found the Datsun, Madam.

408
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,572
It crashed into some rocks near Menton.

409
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,181
There was neither corpse
nor wounded in the car.

410
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:49,388
We think the driver was thrown. Then...

411
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:54,060
...washed out to sea.

412
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,033
We found a sports coat in the back...

413
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:06,005
...in it were I.D. Papers
with the name Joseph Marlo...

414
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:13,579
...writer, living in St. Tropez.

415
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,261
My God, what's going on?

416
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,264
Ah nothing very rare, I'm afraid.

417
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:26,292
We checked Mr. Marlo's house,
and found...

418
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,329
...this,
in the living room, under a cushion.

419
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:34,600
This is yours, is it not?

420
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,273
But I've never been in
Mr. Marlo's house, never.

421
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,312
A formal inquest has been started
for your husband's disappearance...

422
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,992
...Mrs. Wormser,

423
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:54,020
...the judge is very anxious...

424
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,191
...to interview you as chief witness.

425
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,446
Your lawyer sends his apologies,
he will be a little late.

426
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,161
That's not unusual for him.

427
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:26,295
I don't know him.

428
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,331
He hasn't seen you yet?

429
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,359
A friend of my husband's
asked him to defend me.

430
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:38,175
From what I've seen so far
he'll have to be very talented.

431
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,311
Don't worry, he doesn't lack talent.

432
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:44,112
I'm not worried sir.

433
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:48,140
- Maybe you should be.
- Anyway we'll see.

434
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,056
You're very close to being indicted, Madam.

435
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:56,760
I'd rather not discuss this
without my lawyer.

436
00:49:56,795 --> 00:50:00,753
You have every right, Madam.

437
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,339
Smoke, your Honor?

438
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:14,367
No, thank you, I prefer my own.

439
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,755
You've got nerves of steel, bravo.

440
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,748
I hope you can keep it up.

441
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,027
Your honor.

442
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,997
- Counselor.
- Please excuse the delay.

443
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,034
Ah, Mrs. Wormser...
They're giving you trouble, eh?

444
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:39,001
Don't worry, I'm here to defend you.

445
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,706
My name is Albert Legal.
Perfect name for a lawyer, no?

446
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:44,740
You know, you are ravishing.

447
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,444
So, your honor,
I know you adore torturing pretty women

448
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:50,078
...but I need to ask you
to wait a few more minutes.

449
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,899
...because I have not yet had a chance
to talk with my client alone.

450
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:56,306
Is there a corner we could be alone,
I promise we won't be 10 minutes.

451
00:50:56,341 --> 00:50:59,678
Your little scene doesn't impress me,
but I will grant you the time.

452
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,228
Please take Mr. Legal
and his client to the back room.

453
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:09,221
Thank you, your honor, I'm very grateful.

454
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:17,496
You are a superb woman

455
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,507
Yes, it'll do.
And no listening at the door huh!

456
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,557
Please sit down.

457
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,329
You're much younger than your husband.

458
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:40,429
I can't help it.

459
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:44,457
Relax. I'm a little late
because I went to see everyone:

460
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,102
...your husband's banker,
your neighbor, and also...

461
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:51,130
...the real estate agent handling the house,
and of course the garage.

462
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,411
So now the police are sure
you've killed your husband...

463
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:58,181
...with the help of that guy...
what's his name?

464
00:51:58,216 --> 00:51:59,717
Jeff Marlo.

465
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:01,183
Yes, that's it.

466
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:05,211
Like they say in novels,
was he more than a friend?

467
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,289
No, nothing more.

468
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,460
You don't say his name
like that of a simple friend.

469
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:13,495
Be careful.

470
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,523
Now, did he visit you often?

471
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,338
They liked to chat together.
They got along very well.

472
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:23,772
They'd have a couple of drinks.

473
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,510
Oh, don't make me laugh.
Louis drank like a fish...

474
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,214
...maybe he cut down a little
when his heart kicked up.

475
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:33,383
As soon as he felt well
he began drinking again...

476
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:37,376
...but not a great deal.

477
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:43,215
Did you lead normal lives,
I mean like a husband and wife?

478
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,722
- We had separate bedrooms
- Yes that's it.

479
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,906
Now tell me about this earring, was it yours?

480
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,939
Yes.

481
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,411
You've never gone to his house?

482
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:02,611
Yes, just once.

483
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,915
It wasn't very smart to have lied.

484
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,482
Tell me the whole story.

485
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:11,521
Oh it was a couple of weeks ago.
We hadn't seen him in some time.

486
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:13,924
...and Louis asked me
to drop in and see him...

487
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:16,760
...the door was open, I went in.

488
00:53:16,795 --> 00:53:18,894
No one was home...

489
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,497
...I smoked a cigarette, waited,
he never showed up.

490
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,525
The next day, we found
he was spending a few days in Italy.

491
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:31,497
I see! No doubt to be seen...
and he came back this week!

492
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,528
We can't keep the judge waiting...

493
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:37,746
Let me take care of everything.

494
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,684
Just repeat in your head
"I keep my trap shut"

495
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,821
Do you dig, Julie?

496
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:46,888
I dig, Mr. Legal.

497
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,391
You're lucky to be so good looking...

498
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:53,419
...or I'd have dropped
you like a hot potato.

499
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,931
We weren't too long, your Honor?

500
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,934
Please Counselor,
don't start your little song and dance again.

501
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,355
It's eventually going to get on my nerves
and it won't do you any good.

502
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,742
You don't feel you have a solid case.
My only intention is justice.

503
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:09,646
Oh sit down, you are making me dizzy!

504
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:13,639
Please Mrs. Wormser, sit down.

505
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:28,398
- I have a few questions to ask you.
- Yes

506
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:30,565
About what?

507
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,934
But about Mr. Wormser's
disappearance of course!

508
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,373
Just a second Your Honor,
the police report goes quite a bit further.

509
00:54:36,408 --> 00:54:39,241
Yes, the police report you saw...

510
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,057
...concluded that Mr. Wormser
was robbed and killed, Counselor.

511
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:46,839
Madam Wormser has a right to know
what she is suspected of.

512
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,288
The report alleges the crime was committed
by a Mr. Joseph Marlo...

513
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:54,357
...and Mrs. Julie Wormser, born Schumann,
was his accomplice.

514
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:57,525
Well, now we know were we stand.

515
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,995
The police report explained
the following theory:

516
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,023
Louis Wormser was dead or unconscious
on his boat Monday morning.

517
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,036
That morning the neighbor,
Mrs. Marie Chauvinet, saw...

518
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:12,064
...a man pulling a big seaman's kit bag
along the beach, so she says.

519
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,644
The police report suggests it was in fact...

520
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,672
...the body of Louis Wormser,
and Joseph Marlo was carrying it.

521
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:23,053
Marlo threw the cadaver out to sea. Then...

522
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:24,919
...he swam back to shore.

523
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:28,947
He then continued to type
as if he had not stopped for the whole night.

524
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,555
Pardon me, your Honor,
Mrs. Wormser needs a glass of water.

525
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,561
- Over here?
- Right.

526
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,584
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

527
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,684
You're o. K?

528
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,687
Yes, I'm fine thanks.

529
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,525
Please continue Your Honor.

530
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,518
You're very gracious.

531
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:10,622
Marlo took the money
and whatever else he found on the boat...

532
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:14,598
maybe even on the victim's body,

533
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:17,796
a total of about 2 million francs,

534
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,141
...200 million old francs,

535
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:24,169
...and taking Mrs. Wormser's
new Datsun 260...

536
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,575
...he fled and Mrs. Wormser was
to join him later.

537
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,656
The police report states that
they were lovers.

538
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,684
But they never met up
because he was killed in a auto accident.

539
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,957
Well...

540
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:51,539
I can only compliment the police's reasoning.

541
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:55,567
It is barely certain
J. Marlo killed Louis Wormser.

542
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,333
Well, I'm delighted we're in agreement.

543
00:57:00,368 --> 00:57:03,952
Yes certainly, from what I've learned.

544
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,023
Jeff Marlo went out of his way
to befriend Mr. Wormser.

545
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:10,425
He was almost broke,
at the end of his rope...

546
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,453
I suppose there is
a great deal of proof of his guilt.

547
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,824
Obviously the stolen car is one.

548
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:24,530
Well, Mrs. Wormser stated,
her husband loaned the car to Marlo...

549
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,942
...even insisting he take it.

550
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,878
Between us that is highly unlikely.

551
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:33,906
All right, fine fine. What else?
Well go back to that...

552
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,670
The blood on board the boat.

553
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:40,790
The blood?
What is this story?

554
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,090
Additional evidence.

555
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,478
We were sure when the report became final.

556
00:57:45,513 --> 00:57:48,797
- This isn't a trap, is it?
- Please.

557
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,765
We're talking about
a little blood on the railing.

558
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,669
Before being killed Mr. Wormser must
have fought with his assassin...

559
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:56,539
...the "little blood" in question is
the same type as Mr. Marlo's.

560
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,776
...which proves Marlo was on board.

561
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:02,924
What blood type is it?

562
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:06,038
Type O. Not Mr. Wormser's.

563
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:09,068
OK, fine,

564
00:58:09,103 --> 00:58:12,020
What else?

565
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,522
We have proof Marlo mailed...

566
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:18,550
...a letter to Mrs. Wormser from Menton.

567
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,664
Do you have the letter?

568
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,702
No, but we know
Mrs. Wormser received it...

569
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:27,469
...the day of J. Marlo's death...

570
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,497
The Inspector is certain.
The mailman saw the letter stamped Menton!

571
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,878
What is this! A mailman
who remembers the stamp of Menton!!

572
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:38,871
Not Madagascar, nor Tahiti,
but Menton. Oh no.

573
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,516
You're not well, counselor?

574
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:45,544
It's obvious the mailman heard of
Mr. Wormser's disappearance...

575
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,915
It's normal he was curious
about his wife's mail.

576
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:54,230
Fine, but nothing proves
it was from J. Marlo.

577
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,665
Do you have another idea?

578
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,693
No, the letter was definitely from Mr. Marlo.

579
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,040
Mrs. Wormser spoke to me of the letter...

580
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:10,068
Marlo said he had seen
the papers and was returning...

581
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,273
...because the police wanted to discuss
the disappearance of the car.

582
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,217
You're not lucky, counselor.

583
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,123
The car was headed the opposite direction
at the time of the accident.

584
00:59:20,158 --> 00:59:23,925
Of course, Marlo lied in the letter.

585
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,508
He simply wanted
to appease Mrs. Wormser...

586
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:31,056
...to buy a little time.
He was running.

587
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:37,129
You're saying his only goal
was to appease her.

588
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,941
How do you explain this?

589
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:43,969
It was found in Marlo's suit
while checking the wrecked Datsun.

590
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,073
The handwriting is Mrs. Wormser's.
We checked.

591
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,221
Bravo.
Fine work.

592
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,956
I suppose you have the letter.

593
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:58,906
This is your handwriting, is it not, Madam?

594
00:59:58,941 --> 01:00:02,821
I suppose you have the letter Your Honor?

595
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,769
No, but it seems logical to me
he had put it in his pants pocket...

596
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:09,837
It's logical.

597
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,307
Ah yes, logical but it's too bad.

598
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,979
That letter would have proven
Mrs. Wormser innocent.

599
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:17,812
How would you know?

600
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:21,351
Very simple, Mrs. Wormser told me
what she had written the letter.

601
01:00:21,386 --> 01:00:23,284
She is ready to repeat it.

602
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:27,312
Very simply, she was imploring
Joseph Marlo to return immediately.

603
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:31,650
A man who pretended
to be his friend could not have betray him.

604
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,410
Good God, of course she suspected.
The Police saw to that.

605
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:40,192
That is why she checked
her husband's financial status.

606
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:44,374
Counselor, Mrs. Wormser is capable
of telling me all this herself.

607
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:47,008
Yes of course, I understand, but...

608
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:50,745
...she wrote him, begging he clears himself.

609
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,383
She was convinced of his guilt
but still wrote him.

610
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:56,250
Please Madam, tell us.

611
01:00:56,285 --> 01:01:00,278
That's it exactly, your Honor.

612
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:05,717
Inspector Villon went to
Mr. Marlo's residence...

613
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,862
...and found this by the couch...

614
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,890
...and he found the second earring
in a dresser drawer.

615
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,370
Please, madam.

616
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:19,398
...please repeat exactly
what you told me for his honor.

617
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,381
Yes, I don't quite know
why but in my sort of panic...

618
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,685
...I told the Inspector
I had never been to Mr. Marlo's.

619
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,588
I did go there with my husband one time.

620
01:01:31,623 --> 01:01:34,422
He wasn't home, I waited a few moments...

621
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:38,450
I think that's when
I must have lost the earring.

622
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,821
So, I add, if the police intend to use
this earring as proof of complicity...

623
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:47,225
...I warn you that
I am quite capable of proving...

624
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:51,406
...the police attempted a set up...

625
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:55,434
..."planting" the earring
due to insufficient evidence!

626
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,214
I won't do it, of course, but...

627
01:01:58,249 --> 01:02:00,700
...but I could if forced.

628
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:03,117
No threats, counselor.

629
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,987
I'm not threatening, I'm simply stating...

630
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:10,015
When Inspector Villon,
accompanied by Inspector Lamy of Paris...

631
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:14,419
...and you, the judge of their undertaking...

632
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,990
...interrogated my client,
the hypothesis was a heart attack. Why?

633
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,773
Mrs. Wormser mentioned a heart attack
less than a year earlier!

634
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:26,507
Yes.
So why did the police change their minds?

635
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:30,535
Because they learned
Mr. Wormser never had a heart attack

636
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:37,109
The truth is he was impotent.

637
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:41,546
Enough to convince them
Joseph Marlo was Mrs. Wormser's lover...

638
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,859
...add to that,
she is 15 yrs younger than her husband.

639
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:48,887
Preconceptions are so convenient.
Except there is one little catch...

640
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:54,292
The little catch is Mrs. Wormser
didn't know her husband was impotent.

641
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,297
You can check the police report;
it's clearly between the lines.

642
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,179
So, I ask the question:
What remains of their fantastic accusations?

643
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,279
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

644
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:09,307
Nothing proves that
Mr. Wormser was killed...

645
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,546
You can't even prove anything was stolen,
since the prime witness...

646
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,011
...the number one suspect,
and rightly so, Joseph Marlo, is dead.

647
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:22,969
So, legally speaking, what we have is:
A victim that doesn't exist,

648
01:03:23,004 --> 01:03:26,892
...a fortune that doesn't exist,
and a suspect that no longer exists.

649
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,430
Your Honor: Allow me
to leave these chambers with Mrs. Wormser.

650
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,364
This has been a terrible trial for her.

651
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:41,904
Let's face it, this is a ridiculous affair.

652
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:45,410
Nobody's going to gain anything from it.

653
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,595
Yes, I see,
they might as well go back to square one.

654
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:56,265
It'll never stand up in court.
Good day, Madam.

655
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,258
Goodbye and thank you, your Honor.

656
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,995
Are you surprised?

657
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,307
How can you be alive?

658
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:54,306
It's a long story!

659
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:59,010
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

660
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:04,316
I should, but I won't.

661
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:10,155
No one would suspect me.

662
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:14,259
...since I'm already dead, amusing, isn't it?

663
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:38,526
What happened?

664
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,554
You're a pretty cool girl aren't you.

665
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,791
Come here...

666
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,563
Closer.

667
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,243
You should see your eyes.

668
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:09,503
It's extraordinary...

669
01:07:09,538 --> 01:07:13,418
You're not even afraid.

670
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:20,258
Of course, I'm afraid.

671
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,339
Tell me what happened.

672
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:27,332
It's very simple.

673
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:31,836
Your plan went to shit!

674
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:42,414
I knew everything from the very beginning.

675
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:46,451
I woke up not feeling well one night,
I needed a breath of air.

676
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,660
I saw you and Jeff that night.

677
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:03,268
The following night,
I decided to not drink, I listened to you.

678
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:10,141
And the following night,
and every other night...

679
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,480
I listened, listened, listened...

680
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:21,419
...until one night,
I heard Jeff talk of murdering me.

681
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,768
And it became a sort of game.

682
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:31,796
But it was much more than a game for me.

683
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:41,439
What have you done to Jeff?
Did you kill him?

684
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,894
Did you kill him?

685
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,922
Would you like me tell you
about the night you killed me?

686
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:03,461
I went up to bed.

687
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,708
You thought I was sleeping.

688
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:08,309
But I wasn't.

689
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:12,337
I waited 'till Jeff went home.

690
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:19,420
Then I hit him.

691
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,556
You want to know what I hit him with?

692
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:26,584
<i>With the same cudgel you used later</i>

693
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,306
<i>And I too carried him to the room</i>
<i>by the back door...</i>

694
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:41,299
...<i>and put him In my bed</i>.

695
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:01,886
After that it was simple.
I just had to carry out your plans.

696
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,462
I went to Jeff's, tapped the typewriter...

697
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,968
...'till 5 in the morning.

698
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,240
I came home, through the backdoor.

699
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:30,281
What if I'd gone upstairs to your room?

700
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,766
Well, I would have killed Jeff.

701
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:42,794
And I would have convinced you
that you had.

702
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:46,941
We would have been in it together.

703
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:50,657
You probably would have
begged me to help you...

704
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:54,339
...I would have said
"Yes, of course my darling."

705
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,016
But to return to that marvelous night...

706
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,497
<i>Once out to sea, when he came to</i>.

707
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:14,525
<i>I had him drink whiskey</i>
<i>to bring him around completely</i>.

708
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:24,612
You woke him up?
Why?

709
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:28,640
For the pleasure of it.
I wanted to see his expression.

710
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,723
<i>And I had him write out</i>
<i>a full confession...</i>

711
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:38,294
...<i>stating that you were his accomplice</i>.

712
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:39,627
<i>Did he write it?</i>

713
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:43,655
<i>Of course. He had no choice</i>.
<i>He ether wrote or died!</i>

714
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,559
<i>He wrote It then he signed it</i>.

715
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,908
And what did you do after?

716
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:56,377
I knocked him out.

717
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,405
I dragged him to the side of the boat...

718
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,742
...and held his head under water
'till he drowned.

719
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:13,718
I let go of him
and the sea carried him away.

720
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,738
You didn't think I was capable did you?

721
01:12:22,773 --> 01:12:26,473
It's very easy to understand.

722
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,576
It was the first time that
my wife wanted to kill me.

723
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,604
When a man finds his wife
plans his death, he is capable of anything.

724
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,698
You are sick Louis, you're crazy!

725
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:41,879
No, I'm not sick, I'm very lucid...

726
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,857
...and I'm not finished, my dear.

727
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,994
I wrote the letters you received from Jeff.

728
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:51,022
I crashed the car,
placed your envelope in his coat pocket...

729
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,434
...your earring in his house...

730
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,462
I put the jewels in a safe place.
I did all of it, me alone.

731
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,532
And what do you have left now?
Nothing...

732
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:05,603
You have no lover, no jewels...

733
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:10,074
...you've got nothing!
And that's what I call justice.

734
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,887
You think so?

735
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:17,915
It's rather funny,
you made love to Jeff here...

736
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:22,687
...now you're going to do it with me.

737
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:27,058
You see, I'm not afraid
I'm not man enough for you.

738
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:41,515
What do you want?

739
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,052
What do you want to prove?

740
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,554
I don't want to prove anything.

741
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:51,582
From now on, we'll have a new,
"complete" relationship.

742
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:52,960
Oh yes.

743
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:56,988
A new and complete relationship,
that's impossible for you.

744
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,702
Even if you wanted to.

745
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:03,637
We'll see.

746
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,357
Louis, you're kidding!

747
01:14:05,392 --> 01:14:07,007
No, I'm not kidding.

748
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,035
You'll do exactly what I want
or I'll go to the police.

749
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:19,210
All right, let's go to the bedroom.

750
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,589
No, we'll do it right there.

751
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:29,687
Where you made love with him.

752
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:38,062
Yes, now.

753
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,866
You son of a bitch.

754
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:23,894
You're a son of a bitch.

755
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,997
Do you want a drink, Louis?

756
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:28,025
No, thank you. I've stopped drinking.

757
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,208
- Your sun
- Thank you.

758
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,726
I found it with the money you left.

759
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:55,063
Does this signify our new relationship?

760
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:59,056
Yes, that's it.

761
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:05,129
500 francs, that's not bad money
to be my husband's whore. Thank you.

762
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:14,138
Don't forget your husband is dead.

763
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:25,015
How long do you think
this can last, Louis?

764
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:31,388
Who knows!

765
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,976
That's disgust isn't it...

766
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:44,969
...hatred or what?

767
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,315
Accepting hatred.

768
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:52,343
Maybe we'll find happiness later.

769
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:57,214
Hum. Happiness!

770
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:10,227
How could you live with a woman
who tried to kill you? How?

771
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:14,576
Oh, there are millions of women
who dream of killing their husbands,

772
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:18,213
...and millions of husbands
who dream of killing their wives.

773
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:22,206
The only difference is you tried.

774
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:26,277
No that's not it.
I actually wanted to kill you, Louis.

775
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,891
Yes, I understand very well, and right now...

776
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:33,226
...I'm actually trying to forgive you.

777
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:37,199
Do you think I could ever have anything
but hate towards you?

778
01:20:37,234 --> 01:20:39,830
Even after last night?

779
01:20:39,865 --> 01:20:42,426
Last night was different.

780
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,587
What... healed you?

781
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:04,615
Watching you and Jeff together.

782
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:10,621
Each time I watched you,
I thought I couldn't take it.

783
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,993
I would leave...

784
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:20,397
...but I would come back
and start watching again...

785
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,303
I did that night after night...

786
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:38,582
...watching, and eventually...

787
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:52,162
...one day, my feelings began to change.

788
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:58,335
...almost like I became him.

789
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:04,942
Then I was a man again.

790
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:12,016
And after that
all my anxiety's disappeared...

791
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:18,222
...my nightmares disappeared.

792
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,730
It's funny; thanks to you,
I feel alive again...

793
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:35,239
...and I love life.

794
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:40,355
Are you sure, Louis?

795
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:44,348
Am I wrong?

796
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:25,298
You really have no money whatsoever?

797
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:29,326
Really.
I hardly have enough to feed myself.

798
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:33,731
Louis took everything we owned...

799
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:37,801
...our savings, our stocks. Everything.

800
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,673
Yes and you...
Oh, no, no, no, nothing.

801
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:51,515
Listen, I'm very sorry, I didn't know.

802
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:01,825
Naturally,
I can lend you money in the meantime.

803
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:07,431
In the meantime, what?
I don't know how to ever repay you.

804
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:12,669
Don't worry. We'll find a way.

805
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:19,152
No. It's impossible.

806
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:23,124
I've been thinking,
didn't Louis have a life insurance policy?

807
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:27,117
Yes of course.
50 million old francs, I believe.

808
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:31,699
Couldn't I get a loan
with that as collateral?

809
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:35,603
Possibly, around 10 million.

810
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:36,836
No more?

811
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:39,590
How much would you want?

812
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:42,275
I need at least 30 or 40.

813
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,280
Want do you want to do
with that much money, Julie?

814
01:24:45,315 --> 01:24:48,081
But George, I have absolutely nothing!

815
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:52,109
Louis sold the house.
I'm going to need to find a place to live.

816
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,768
And I want to leave here.
I want to forget everything.

817
01:24:55,803 --> 01:24:59,116
Well, obviously there is
no longer anything here for you.

818
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:04,655
But please understand the process of
inheriting could be a long one!

819
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:11,829
Louis' death needs to become official,
his will needs to be validated.

820
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:16,567
It could take over a year.

821
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:20,604
With luck, maybe I could get you
a small monthly income to get you by...

822
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:25,742
...but not the money you're asking for.

823
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,914
I'm willing to help you
as much as I can Julie, you know that.

824
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:35,385
If you don't know where to go,
I can put you up.

825
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,666
If you have nothing to eat,
you could share my meals.

826
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:43,694
But it's not possible to get you
the kind of money you're asking for.

827
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:52,603
You must not leave, Julie.

828
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:57,784
Not bad, huh?

829
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:01,588
Especially with the wind.

830
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:05,616
Too bad you're leaving so soon.
You could turn pro.

831
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,964
- Say, I've thought about the Wormser case.
- Yes?

832
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,767
I wonder if that cretin
isn't right after all?

833
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:14,234
How's that?

834
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,402
Maybe we blew it.

835
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:20,430
Maybe we didn't observe the person
who holds the key to the case.

836
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:22,308
Who is that?

837
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:26,336
- Louis Wormser.
- Your turn, Fernand.

838
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,353
But you're speaking
about him as if he's alive!!

839
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:34,787
And why wouldn't he be?

840
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:38,815
We have to think about
what Louis Wormser did before the crime.

841
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,962
Just doesn't fit.
He got out all his money...

842
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:46,467
...put his house up for sale,
didn't say a word to his wife.

843
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:50,460
All this after 10 years of marriage.

844
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:54,698
So that the beautiful Julie found
herself alone and ruined...

845
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:59,937
...when he disappeared,
and of course, under suspicion.

846
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,683
As if she was being punished.

847
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,637
She damn well deserved it...

848
01:27:05,672 --> 01:27:08,521
...believe me she's a real slut.

849
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:12,549
Hum, that's just the point.
Was this a coincidence or planned?

850
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:19,323
You think Wormser arranged
it all before he disappeared?

851
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,835
Yes. That's what I'm thinking.

852
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,589
He knew his wife was sleeping with Marlo.

853
01:27:25,624 --> 01:27:28,274
Or he'd have no reason to punish her.

854
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:32,302
Maybe he knew
our two love birds planned to kill him.

855
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:37,717
Yes, but they still had time act, no?

856
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:39,988
No, I don't think so.
Do you want dessert?

857
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:42,922
No, thanks, just coffee.

858
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,893
Do you have an aged liquor?
Cognac or something?

859
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:47,727
We have a local brandy.

860
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:51,755
Perfect!
Two provincial brandies and cigars please.

861
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:58,662
This thing with the earring
has always bothered me.

862
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:02,899
You don't lose them just like that.
Or else you notice it.

863
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:09,306
In my opinion, the earring was
planted to get little Julie under suspicion.

864
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,988
And Marlo had no motivation.
But Wormser certainly did.

865
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:15,989
That's true.

866
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:20,017
Here's what I think.
Wormser acted first.

867
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:25,565
At some point he took Marlo's place.

868
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,593
He killed him on the boat.
After all, it is Marlo's blood, right?

869
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:31,871
Not Wormser's.

870
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:33,908
He's the one who stole his own car...

871
01:28:33,943 --> 01:28:37,729
...and who wrote the letter.

872
01:28:37,764 --> 01:28:41,481
What about the car accident?

873
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:45,509
- A little more Brandy?
- Gladly.

874
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:49,322
So the car accident?
That's easy...

875
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:53,350
Wormser stole Marlo's papers
before throwing him overboard...

876
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,897
...he steals his jacket

877
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:01,925
...and the envelope to the letter
that Julie sent to Menton.

878
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,837
Now there, Wormser that's a brilliant idea.

879
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:08,865
First of all the letter itself
probably contains the proof...

880
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,403
...to Julie's guilt in
her husband's murder attempt.

881
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:18,475
Finally, the envelope's disappearance
scared the shit out of the chick.

882
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:25,982
Especially, it seems to prove
Marlo was killed running from the cops.

883
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,663
There, he got us, the bastard.

884
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,691
Marlo wouldn't have left the envelope
if he had faked the accident.

885
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:40,430
Wormser is definitely very good;
he got what he wanted.

886
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:44,512
He threw his chick into the street,
killed her lover...

887
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:48,505
...split with all the dough.

888
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,391
Say, you know it's very clever
what you've figured out.

889
01:29:56,426 --> 01:30:00,384
Not clever but it stands up.

890
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:09,192
Say, you have any idea
where Wormser might be hiding?

891
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:14,197
Oh there, you're asking too much.
But if I was you...

892
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:18,212
Wormser's financial counselor.

893
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,012
Who?
Georges Thorent?

894
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,782
Yes, Thorent.
He's one of his best friends.

895
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:26,788
And he'll surely need
to contact him sooner or later.

896
01:30:26,823 --> 01:30:30,781
If I were you, I would watch him.

897
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,877
Why are you so strange, Louis?

898
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:28,905
Because I'm getting sick
of going in and out like a thief.

899
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:35,011
- But nothing forces you to.
- No.

900
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:39,287
- No, it's simple just go to the police.
- Well.

901
01:31:39,322 --> 01:31:42,752
- I'll tell the police I have amnesia
- Yes.

902
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,968
They'll never swallow that.

903
01:31:47,003 --> 01:31:49,735
- Louis.
- Wait.

904
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:53,763
Suppose I go to the police to explain...
I'm kidding of course...

905
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,893
What would you do?

906
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:57,504
I would stay near you.

907
01:31:57,539 --> 01:31:59,045
They won't question it.

908
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,073
If I live with you,
they couldn't say anything.

909
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:07,110
We'd go back to living together?

910
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,625
I'd want to try, anyway.

911
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:16,653
You've changed Louis,
and I've changed also.

912
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:23,037
I can't believe you.

913
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:27,030
Louis please...

914
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,775
...Please, let's try.

915
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:33,513
Try, but how,
even if we lived together 20 years...

916
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,284
...I would always think
it was because of the confession.

917
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:40,277
Just burn it and we can forget everything.

918
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,630
Very nice!!
Congratulations.

919
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:52,345
What are you saying?

920
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,025
It's becoming so clear.

921
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:00,006
I'll tell you exactly what I think...

922
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:04,034
You want me to destroy the confession.
You'll have your Jeff back...

923
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:08,638
...get your jewels, the house,
everything back. You don't love me.

924
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:13,944
- I'm not crazy. I'm not an idiot.
- Louis.

925
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:34,375
- Good evening, Mrs. Wormser.
- Good evening gentlemen.

926
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:38,368
Good evening Madam.

927
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:42,650
I'm happy to find you here.

928
01:33:42,685 --> 01:33:43,783
No thanks to you.

929
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:47,622
Ah Madam, police work is thankless work.

930
01:33:47,657 --> 01:33:49,221
We sometimes have to pry.

931
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:53,249
Don't hold it against the Inspector.
Could we have a word?

932
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:55,661
At this hour?

933
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:59,433
Well, gentlemen
you're lucky to find me still up.

934
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:02,702
Yes, I know.
Please forgive us...

935
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:06,374
...but we have some interesting conclusions
to present you.

936
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:10,011
Yes and I'd like to ask you a minor question.

937
01:34:10,046 --> 01:34:13,248
Have you had any news from your husband?

938
01:34:13,283 --> 01:34:16,450
Of course not, I would have called you.

939
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:18,217
I don't doubt it at all.

940
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:20,087
So why this idiotic question?

941
01:34:20,122 --> 01:34:21,887
Oh, it's not idiotic, Madam.

942
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:24,757
It's possible that
your husband is still alive.

943
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:28,796
Oh please, you have no right
to play with people's minds.

944
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:30,815
And you're mocking my husband's death...

945
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,765
We're not playing.
This is not a game!

946
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,793
We're not fooling around.
We're seeking the truth.

947
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:40,272
The truth?
Your truth has many faces!

948
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:44,011
I haven't forgotten
your report to the police, Inspector.

949
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:47,715
Three days ago you were sure
my husband had been killed...

950
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,783
...and that I was an accomplice
to the murder.

951
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,886
Well, we think the facts
can be interpreted another way.

952
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:57,914
You think? I wouldn't have thought
you capable of thinking Inspector!

953
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:05,197
Is that a threat?

954
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:07,301
Listen Madam,
it's entirely possible your husband is alive.

955
01:35:07,336 --> 01:35:11,294
If he was alive, he would have come home.

956
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:15,732
No, maybe not.
He could have suffered a blow to the head.

957
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,844
And suffering a temporary loss of memory.

958
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:22,872
That's why the Inspector
asked you if you had news.

959
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:30,013
No, I don't have news from him.

960
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:40,056
We don't want to take up
any more of your time Mrs. Wormser.

961
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:44,127
I'm sure you'll contact us
if you see your husband, right?

962
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:50,066
Inspector, if I see him
I'll throw myself into his arms.

963
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:55,505
May I go to bed now?

964
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:13,490
You were great and I was stupid.

965
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:18,161
Please forgive me.

966
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,541
That was a little close for comfort.

967
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:26,113
Yes, but we'll have to leave.
We can't hide here our whole lives.

968
01:36:26,148 --> 01:36:28,214
What do you mean?

969
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:32,242
Don't you want to keep paying me
to make love to you?

970
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,906
Sure, I'll keep paying you.

971
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:39,613
Here's what were going to do...

972
01:36:39,648 --> 01:36:43,286
I'll trust you if you'll trust me.

973
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:49,325
I'll forgive you the same way
you'll forgive me.

974
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:56,299
O. K?

975
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:01,971
O.k.

976
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:36,039
They're gone.

977
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:45,949
Do you have a car?

978
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:53,122
- But this is...
- Get in.

979
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,408
Does George know about Jeff and me?

980
01:38:34,443 --> 01:38:38,401
George knows everything.

981
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:42,983
What's come over you, bringing her here?
You're crazy.

982
01:38:43,018 --> 01:38:45,651
No, no, not at all!

983
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:49,134
The police came to the house.
They thought I was alive.

984
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:52,582
Julie held them off all alone.
She was Magnificent.

985
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:56,128
All she wants is
to get her confession back.

986
01:38:56,163 --> 01:39:00,156
You'll see how fast
she'll turn you in after that.

987
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,818
That's disgusting!

988
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:03,335
You don't get it.

989
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:07,363
She's trying to get her dough back
any way she can.

990
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:11,634
She hit me up this morning.
Almost showed her ass to get her bread.

991
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,580
Why do you hate me?

992
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:18,608
It's just that I don't like women,
dear friend.

993
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:26,258
She tried to kill you to get your dough...

994
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:29,561
...and to split with that asshole
with the big dick.

995
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:33,589
She would steal your gold fillings
if she could. And you trust her?

996
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:40,441
Are you going to keep her with you?

997
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:43,394
Yes, that's right.

998
01:39:43,429 --> 01:39:46,278
You're really a child.

999
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:50,306
No I'm not a child.
I love her...

1000
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:53,118
...and I want to stay with her.

1001
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:57,146
All you need is to take
that fool's confession to the police...

1002
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:03,386
You can have a new life.
You deserve it, you've got the mean.

1003
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:08,913
No, I would never do that to her.

1004
01:40:08,948 --> 01:40:12,395
- O.k., so you're an idiot
- Georges

1005
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:20,679
Excuse me but Julie is my wife.

1006
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:24,707
And you'll speak to her with respect.

1007
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:33,016
I'm tired, very tired...

1008
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:39,064
...that's enough.

1009
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:43,092
This comedy has gone on
long enough. It's finished.

1010
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:50,533
Leave me alone.
You already know I have nothing left.

1011
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:52,713
You shut up you stupid female!

1012
01:40:52,748 --> 01:40:56,706
No, I won't shut up.

1013
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:01,422
You can't make me shut up.
You have no right.

1014
01:41:01,457 --> 01:41:02,688
Louis forgave me.

1015
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:06,716
We're starting over
and you can't make me shut up.

1016
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:14,757
Jeff's confession and Louis' money
are in a safe at my place.

1017
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:18,070
George, please stop.

1018
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:21,669
- Good. All this is good to know.
- Jeff!

1019
01:41:21,704 --> 01:41:25,234
Yes...
and now all the dead are resuscitated.

1020
01:41:29,516 --> 01:41:33,318
I'm sure she's cooking up something.

1021
01:41:33,353 --> 01:41:36,523
In any case the bitch knows
more than she's telling us.

1022
01:41:36,558 --> 01:41:38,357
You're a misogynist, old man!

1023
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:42,262
I don't know, but women like her
frighten the pants off me.

1024
01:41:42,297 --> 01:41:46,100
She wouldn't need
to frighten my pants off.

1025
01:41:46,135 --> 01:41:48,235
Do you think she's seen her husband?

1026
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,069
I'm sure of it!

1027
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:54,097
It's funny, but when I propose
a theory you jump on it with both feet.

1028
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:56,510
In any case, nothing proves
Wormser is still alive.

1029
01:41:56,545 --> 01:41:58,544
You've proved it to me.

1030
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:01,782
If she's seen him
she knows he killed her lover.

1031
01:42:01,817 --> 01:42:04,249
Why hasn't she turned him in?

1032
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:08,277
She can't. He's got to have proof
she and Marlo tried to kill him.

1033
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:13,783
Ah. One for you!
You're right!

1034
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,714
Mmm, your sandwich is very good.

1035
01:42:17,749 --> 01:42:21,100
You have to put butter and ham.

1036
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:25,128
God I was stupid. I should have had
the villa watched day and night.

1037
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,543
...rather than watching
the financial advisor.

1038
01:42:29,578 --> 01:42:31,343
Does your T.V. Work?

1039
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:33,213
It works but there's a strike
and in any case...

1040
01:42:33,248 --> 01:42:37,206
Even if there wasn't, it's 11:30 so...

1041
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:43,379
Did you know he was alive?

1042
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:49,385
Of course he knew.
All the time he fucked you, he knew.

1043
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:58,566
Listen Julie,
you're going to appreciate this.

1044
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:02,398
Go on, Louis.
Tell your clever little scheme.

1045
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:05,878
What do you want?

1046
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:08,147
I'll tell you what I want.

1047
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:11,485
I want the girl,
the dough, and the jewels...

1048
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,185
...And I'll get it all.

1049
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,789
He told you I was dead, huh?

1050
01:43:15,824 --> 01:43:19,087
Yes... that's what he said.

1051
01:43:19,122 --> 01:43:22,351
I could never kill anyone.

1052
01:43:22,763 --> 01:43:26,756
Tell her, tell her what happened!

1053
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:32,895
When he came to,
we were on the boat.

1054
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:38,768
I held my gun on him...

1055
01:43:39,546 --> 01:43:43,539
...told him I wanted to kill him.

1056
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,743
Told him that I knew everything.

1057
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:53,216
He begged me to spare him...

1058
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:56,361
...he started crying.

1059
01:43:56,396 --> 01:44:00,389
Watch out, I'm the one with the gun now.

1060
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:05,394
A gun can't change anything now.

1061
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:12,335
After that, I forced him to write
and sign the confession.

1062
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:20,509
I offered him 50,000 new francs...

1063
01:44:20,887 --> 01:44:23,889
...and he took it.

1064
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:27,110
I would have given him much more.

1065
01:44:27,145 --> 01:44:30,297
Poor loser, it's all his money.

1066
01:44:30,332 --> 01:44:31,897
When did you get back?

1067
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:35,925
Same time as him.
I saw you two making love.

1068
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,741
You got off on it huh?

1069
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:42,040
Yes, she did.

1070
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:46,068
You shut up, I'm talking to her now.

1071
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:06,389
I thought about you all the time Jeff.

1072
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:14,840
Julie!

1073
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:16,575
You're coming with me.

1074
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,313
We're going to get back the dough,
the jewels and my confession.

1075
01:45:19,348 --> 01:45:21,515
You watch him, I'll be back in half hour.

1076
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:24,613
Jeff! Let me come with you.
Please!

1077
01:45:24,648 --> 01:45:27,677
Watch him carefully.
I won't be long.

1078
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:30,657
You lied to me!

1079
01:45:30,692 --> 01:45:34,650
Be quiet!

1080
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:39,622
They're gone.

1081
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:11,520
Louis, Louis...

1082
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:22,431
What's the matter?

1083
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:32,751
Talk to me, Louis.

1084
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:36,779
You know very well
it was a just a put on, nothing more.

1085
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:40,859
"Put on" sometimes kill...

1086
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:44,887
We don't think about it,
and one day it happens.

1087
01:46:58,945 --> 01:47:02,938
Hold on, hold on, don't move.

1088
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:13,716
Hold on tight, I'll be back soon.

1089
01:47:18,565 --> 01:47:22,558
Good, stay here.

1090
01:47:56,169 --> 01:48:00,162
Shit

1091
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:07,703
About time.

1092
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:11,450
Hello yes. It's me.

1093
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,585
- Is that him?
- Yes, hold on.

1094
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,706
Tell him Thorent came in
with a man who could be Jeff Marlo.

1095
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:19,793
Thorent just came in with a man
who could be Jeff Marlo.

1096
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:22,127
Are you sure?

1097
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:25,499
Thorent just went in to his place
with a man who could be Jeff Marlo

1098
01:48:25,534 --> 01:48:26,698
What?

1099
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:29,697
- What do we do?
- Wait a second.

1100
01:48:29,732 --> 01:48:32,661
Hello, just one second.
Let me think.

1101
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:36,966
Tell them to stay put.
If someone comes out, follow him discreetly.

1102
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:44,073
Be ready to tail if one of them comes out?

1103
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:48,577
He says stay put
and get ready for "tailing".

1104
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:52,991
Tell him we're coming.

1105
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:57,019
- Hello, I'll be right there.
- Very good, Inspector.

1106
01:48:58,899 --> 01:49:02,892
What a mess!

1107
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:13,224
What are you doing here?

1108
01:49:13,259 --> 01:49:17,206
Louis is dying, quick, quick

1109
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:37,560
Julie.

1110
01:49:53,353 --> 01:49:55,854
What happened?
You shot him?

1111
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,123
He's dying.
His heart is giving out.

1112
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:01,595
- We've got to save him,
Jeff. Hurry, help me!

1113
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:05,588
Hurry...

1114
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:17,976
No, no! Don't stop!

1115
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:20,574
Why?
Everything is fine.

1116
01:50:20,609 --> 01:50:23,138
Don't stop, he's dying,

1117
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:59,408
I've got 200 G's back there.
And I burned my confession.

1118
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:01,286
Where is George?

1119
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,605
Don't worry about it.

1120
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,855
Did you kill him?

1121
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:07,883
Never mind. If your husband dies
we have what we wanted.

1122
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:10,695
Everything worked out for the best, no?

1123
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:14,434
But I can't leave him like this.
He's suffering.

1124
01:51:14,469 --> 01:51:17,435
You're going to make me cry.

1125
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,706
Let's get the fuck out of here,
let's disappear.

1126
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:23,699
We're free and rich Julie, rich.

1127
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:29,405
I don't want to go with you.

1128
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:34,653
Oh, So you're only
interested in the money.

1129
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:38,681
You want to dump me like
a piece of shit? You whore.

1130
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:45,354
You're mine,
you hear me, you're mine.

1131
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:49,200
You're mine.
I'm going to make you come, you slut.

1132
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:53,228
- You're going to scream like you never have.
- You're mine.

1133
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:58,067
- No Jeff, stop!
- Tell me you want some, tell me again.

1134
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:04,173
- No, say it again.
- No!

1135
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:09,878
- Say it again.
- No.

1136
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:30,933
- Cuff him.
- Julie, Julie!

1137
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:02,464
We've got to save my husband.

1138
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:07,035
We've got to save my husband.

1139
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:14,543
We've got to save my husband.

1140
01:53:57,597 --> 01:54:01,590
Your husband is dead Madam.

1141
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:20,887
Your client is waiting in the green office.

1142
01:54:20,922 --> 01:54:24,880
- Where is it?
- Follow me.

1143
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:31,220
Thank you, officer.

1144
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:38,627
You don't look like you're well.
Hello?

1145
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:44,166
You don't want to talk to me?
Admit that I've done you nothing but good!

1146
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:51,015
No, you don't want to.

1147
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:55,043
I was told you were traumatized
by this whole affair. Understandable...

1148
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:59,448
...your position could be a lot worse

1149
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:03,496
We're going to pin everything
on your boyfriend, he asked for it.

1150
01:55:03,531 --> 01:55:07,489
I'll bet he gets a solid ten to fifteen.

1151
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:12,988
As for you my beauty, it's cake...

1152
01:55:13,023 --> 01:55:15,406
I'll have you freed on your word...

1153
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:19,434
...and you'll get a year, a year
and a half probation.

1154
01:55:23,516 --> 01:55:27,509
This is unbearable.

1155
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:31,456
What do you want me to say?

1156
01:55:31,491 --> 01:55:35,361
I don't know, you could say thank you.

1157
01:55:35,396 --> 01:55:38,196
Thank you.

1158
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,433
In a way, you got everything you wanted.

1159
01:55:40,468 --> 01:55:42,635
You're rich, and your husband is dead.

1160
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,102
Please, be quiet.

1161
01:55:44,137 --> 01:55:48,141
A lawyer never stops talking,
you should know that.

1162
01:55:48,176 --> 01:55:52,134
I would give everything to have Louis alive.

1163
01:55:53,379 --> 01:55:57,372
Oh the fickleness of women!

1164
01:55:58,318 --> 01:56:01,187
I get the feeling you hate me.

1165
01:56:01,222 --> 01:56:04,991
No, not especially.

1166
01:56:05,026 --> 01:56:08,984
What is it?

1167
01:56:09,295 --> 01:56:13,288
It's odd. When I tried killing my husband
nothing happened to me...

1168
01:56:15,168 --> 01:56:19,161
...now I'm trying to save him
and I'm being punished.

1169
01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:22,591
That, my beauty,
is the puzzle of justice.

1170
01:56:22,626 --> 01:56:25,303
The truth is whatever
people want to believe.

1171
01:56:25,338 --> 01:56:27,981
And don't forget
that it's a man's world.

1172
01:56:28,016 --> 01:56:30,283
With laws made by men, for men.

1173
01:56:30,318 --> 01:56:33,718
It's men's justice.

1174
01:56:33,753 --> 01:56:36,721
You're not even trying
to understand me.

1175
01:56:36,756 --> 01:56:40,593
The law doesn't give a damn
about understanding.

1176
01:56:40,628 --> 01:56:44,586
Come on, the Judge is waiting.

1177
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:38,073
Julie!!!

1178
01:57:51,431 --> 01:57:55,424
Julie!!

1179
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:11,673
Julie!!!!

1180
01:58:15,788 --> 01:58:19,781
Julie!!!!!

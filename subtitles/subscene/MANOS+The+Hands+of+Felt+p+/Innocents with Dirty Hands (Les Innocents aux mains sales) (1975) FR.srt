1
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,381
Sorry, uh...

2
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,586
- Did you want your kite?
- Yes.

3
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,791
- Come and get it.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,375
Is there anything else you want?

5
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:02,356
INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS

6
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,836
Louis, I want you to meet Jeff Marlo.
He's a writer

7
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,572
...he rents the little blue house
and flies a kite.

8
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,774
Yes, I saw you swimming this morning.

9
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,642
I swim a lot.

10
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,512
Ah, I'm sure you do.

11
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,781
Would you like a drink?

12
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,183
- I've got one, thanks
- OK

13
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,723
So, I'll take care of myself.
I suppose that my...

14
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,860
...charming wife told you I drink a lot!

15
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,099
To your health.

16
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,840
How horrible.

17
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,384
Why are you laughing?

18
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,424
Why not?

19
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,705
You can't imagine... what it feels like..

20
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:40,280
...suddenly, it's like your heart explodes...

21
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,020
...and then, everything is black...

22
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,690
...and you die.

23
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,361
So, why drink, it's not very clever

24
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,932
No, no, it's got nothing to do
with being clever...

25
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,270
...or intelligent...

26
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,239
But it has everything to do with:

27
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:07,975
Pain!

28
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,053
Anyway...

29
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,323
Soon I'll take my ...

30
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,463
...marvelous wife,

31
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,534
...somewhere, anywhere...

32
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,438
to America or Martinique, we'll see...

33
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,790
Come here, come on,
come, come, come...

34
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,462
...come come, closer..

35
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,333
...come here, please...

36
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,282
Listen, I have a few questions
to ask you, Julie...

37
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,554
... first: why can't we make love any more...

38
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,023
...next, why don't you ever kiss me?

39
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,893
...next, why do you refuse to
Let me touch you?...

40
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,295
...and, do you hate me?

41
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,700
Stop drinking..

42
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,803
... It's too stupid.

43
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,342
Louis, I beg you.

44
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,146
Why do you put yourself in such a state?

45
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,394
That's a good question...

46
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:18,138
...That's what I call a very good question!

47
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,247
- Does he do this often?
- Yes

48
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
Help me, I'm going to put him to bed.

49
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,019
He's crazy.

50
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,622
NO. Don't touch it.

51
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,326
Don't touch the belt, help me.

52
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,936
What's going on?

53
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,137
It's nothing Louis.

54
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,054
Go to bed.

55
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,677
- How can you stand it?
- I can't.

56
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,779
I've had enough.

57
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,006
He hasn't touched me since his heart attack.

58
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,313
He sold his business and we settled here.

59
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,284
Now he wants us to go to Martinique.

60
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,755
He probably wants to replace
his whiskey with rum.

61
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,024
He'll never get there alive.

62
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,894
He won't hold up very long at this pace.

63
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,631
Why did you marry him?
He's at least 1 5 years older than you.

64
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,733
Eighteen.

65
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,836
He was very kind to me...

66
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,139
... I was supposed to do a film
and he financed it.

67
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,441
You were an actress?

68
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,113
I was starting out,
I didn't really want much. Anyway...

69
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,149
....he was really very nice ...

70
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,120
... not great in bed, but nice...

71
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,796
So, let's talk about you,
what do you do besides fly kites?

72
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,800
- I write stupid shit.
- What?

73
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,703
I'm a writer.

74
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:21,141
I type because I can't read my handwriting...

75
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,612
...but I have no talent, I'm lazy...

76
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,581
...and I'm easily bored.

77
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,751
Bastard!

78
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,153
... I'm easily bored but you excite me....

79
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,056
Bastard.

80
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,361
He won't be around much longer,
take my word for it.

81
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,630
He won't last long.

82
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,135
THREE WEEKS LATER

83
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,760
- Are you Madam Wormser?
- Yes, I am.

84
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:17,097
- Your car is here.
- Don't you want to see it?

85
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,267
But are you sure you're not mistaken?

86
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,237
Mr. Wormser came by the garage...

87
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,345
- I'm a little late. Hope you like the car.
- Goodbye, thank you.

88
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,274
- You're crazy. This car!!
- Do you like it?

89
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,342
Of course I like it, it's my dream.

90
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,746
- Thank you.
- No no no!

91
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,549
Thank you ...
Thank you for putting up with me.

92
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,651
It's to compensate...

93
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,220
Go on, go try it out.

94
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,190
No not today. Too much traffic.
I'm just going to look at it.

95
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,059
You've deserve it.
Me, I think I deserve a drink.

96
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,495
Don't move. I'll get it for you.

97
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,067
I love you!

98
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:02,503
Thank you.

99
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,013
I've been restless lately...

100
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,686
and I want to move, to go...

101
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,023
- ...do you understand?
- Yes.

102
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,807
It's true, I drink too much.

103
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,444
And afterward I feel..

104
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:47,881
...so tired...

105
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,818
too tired.

106
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,190
Sorry...

107
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,494
I talk too much.
I better go to bed, good night.

108
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,461
Good night.

109
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,364
Good night, Louis.

110
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,402
Good night, Julie.

111
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,250
This old guy is off to bed.

112
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,787
Jeff, please, Jeff, stay with me.
Don't go, I beg you...

113
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,724
... I beg you, please, Jeff,
don't leave me alone.

114
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:06,627
- No. We're already behind schedule.
- Jeff!

115
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,596
No, we can't see each other for 3 or 4 days.

116
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,466
Not even phone each other.

117
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,302
Maybe I'll just leave a few days, until...

118
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,905
the accident becomes official huh?

119
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,340
I'll let you know one way or the other.

120
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,442
You must really...

121
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,612
Yes, yes. He could wake up.

122
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,948
Think about what I'll have to do.

123
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,951
I'll have to stay alone with him all night.

124
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,620
Can't you come back sooner?

125
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:35,956
God, you know we can't.

126
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,158
We have to have
Mother Chauvinet as an alibi.

127
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,028
No one can even suspect
that were in this together.

128
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,098
It's 1 1 :30 .
In 2 hours, in 2 hours...

129
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,935
The thing is on the corner of his desk...

130
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,904
...anyhow, I'm leaving.
See you later.

131
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,643
I killed him.

132
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,139
The car!

133
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,616
<i>Darllng, l took the Datsun</i>.

134
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,952

00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,491
<i>But afterwards,</i>
<i>lt'll be just the two of us</i>.

147
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,080
- The maritime police?
- Ah yes!

148
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,618
We've decided to investigate, Mrs. Wormser.

149
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:59,453
Oh! What's going on?

150
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,091
We were just going to
take the helicopter out.

151
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,196
I'm probably worrying for nothing.
But he's always so punctual...

152
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:13,333
Thank you

153
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,223
Must be the salt air, my underwear is itching.

154
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:36,690
Yes

155
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,595
- Madam.
- Gentlemen.

156
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:46,066
Madam Wormser?
I'm Inspector Villon, from Draguignan.

157
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:51,305
- Please come in.
- Excuse me, Madam.

158
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,986
Didn't we meet at the Mayor's Reception?

159
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,623
That's it, yes, let me introduce
you to Inspector Lamy, from Paris.

160
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,992
I took the liberty
of asking him to come along.

161
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,528
Hope you don't mind, Madam.

162
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:17,664
I'm on vacation here
and Villon, my colleague, has requested...

163
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,668
- Please gentlemen, sit down.
- Thank you Madam

164
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,183
Well, Mrs. Wormser

165
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,986
We received a phone call
from the Maritime Police.

166
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,487
Yes?

167
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:46,059
They have, uh,
they have found Mr. Wormser's boat

168
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,232
But no one was on board.

169
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,434
What's that?

170
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,204
Oh no!!

171
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,377
The divers searched
for over an hour with no results.

172
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,251
And you think that...

173
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:22,095
Excuse me,
would you like to drink something?

174
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,264
-No.
-Thank you Madam.

175
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,133
Please.

176
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:39,947
We understand
what you're going through, Madam.

177
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,250
I'm terribly frightened.

178
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,324
Mr. Wormser perhaps went
aboard another boat...

179
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:52,726
...to say hello to friends.

180
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:55,829
Oh, that's very unlikely madam.

181
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,603
We are going to inspect the boat.
We wondered if...

182
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,304
...you'd like to go with us.

183
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:09,376
Ah, well, I don't know... I...

184
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,312
Ah, you'd rather wait here
for your husband to call...

185
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,547
...to tell you where he is?

186
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,618
You know, I'm beginning...

187
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,989
I'm beginning to fear
that he won't be able to.

188
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,394
Ah, we realize how you feel, Madam.

189
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:32,099
There is perhaps a very simple explanation
for this disappearance.

190
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,170
But, my colleague is forced
to ask you a few questions...

191
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,673
...that you might find indiscreet.

192
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,676
I don't know how I can help you gentlemen,

193
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,679
but I will tell you everything
you wish to know.

194
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:53,954
Yes well, do you know
if your husband has enemies, madam?

195
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,225
Enemies?
No, certainly not.

196
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:02,029
He's a very kind man, very peaceful.

197
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:05,766
He retired.
He wanted to live here.

198
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:11,672
And where did you dock your boat Madam?

199
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:14,975
In the harbor?

200
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,612
No...
We had a dock at the foot of the cliff.

201
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,481
- Could I trouble you for a glass of water
- Of course

202
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:24,384
- No don't get up.
- It's this way

203
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:25,552
excuse me

204
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,422
- You'll find glasses by the sink.
- Ah thank you

205
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,849
Tell me, it's quite a climb
up from the dock, isn't it?

206
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:01,488
Yes it's why we were thinking of moving.

207
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,260
Ah, but you would stay in St.Tropez?

208
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:10,864
I didn't know my husband
was considering the Antilles.

209
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:13,100
I've heard it's a marvelous place.

210
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,503
You know, nothing was really decided.

211
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:21,175
Tell me, do you see your neighbors much?

212
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:27,014
No... but last night we had a visitor,
Jeff Marlo.

213
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:30,250
He often comes to see Louis.
He came to dinner.

214
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:35,189
Ah and is he a neighbor?

215
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:38,458
Yes he lives just two houses below us.

216
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,393
He's a writer.

217
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:45,265
- Yes, they developed a friendship
- Ah... Yes, yes, yes.

218
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,268
Perhaps, he could see your husband's boat?

219
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,440
Well, we'll go pay him a visit.

220
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:55,275
Oh, I don't believe it will be worthwhile.

221
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,611
He told us last night
he was going to Italy.

222
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,814
He was leaving very early this morning.

223
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,653
Well, anyhow, we'll go and make sure.

224
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:12,626
No I'm quite sure he left.
He took one of our cars, the Datsun.

225
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,229
Oh, he did?
Did you lend it to him?

226
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,298
Yes, well ...
My husband did.

227
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:23,036
Mr. Marlo has no car and we knew
that he has very limited means...

228
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:26,640
He was planning on going
for 2 or 3 days to... huh...

229
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:31,211
...ah yes, he wanted to gather material
for the book he's writing.

230
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:35,215
So, my husband lent him the car
to save him money.

231
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,818
And he accepted?

232
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:40,687
Well, yes, Louis insisted.

233
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,892
You say Mr. Marlo
lives two houses from here?

234
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,561
Who owns the other?

235
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,231
Mrs. Chauvinet, an elderly lady.

236
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:55,903
Has she visited you lately?

237
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,504
No, I rarely see her.

238
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:07,781
I'm afraid.

239
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:09,483
Of what madam?

240
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:13,353
I think that Louis had another heart attack.

241
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:16,123
... and he must have fallen overboard...

242
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,193
He had a heart attack last year.

243
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:23,997
Yes, it is plausible.

244
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,166
Ah yes, effectively, yes.

245
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:30,103
One last question Madam,
if you'll allow me.

246
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:34,708
Did your husband often keep
large sums of money on him...

247
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,476
...or on the boat?

248
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,784
Ah yes, I see that's interesting.

249
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,854
Did he have a lot of money on him?

250
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,124
No, I don't believe so, no.

251
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:56,063
... I'm sure he didn't.

252
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,313
- So?
- Well, let's see...

253
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,584
... according to this Madam Chauvinot..

254
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,320
...it seems he was home all night, typing.

255
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:23,490
Although, she did sleep a little
so it's not a perfect alibi.

256
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,661
And also she saw Mr. Wormser
go out with a big bag of some sort.

257
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,329
...Around five in the morning.

258
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,833
This woman must spend
her whole life at the window.

259
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,469
She has insomnia.
I think she's a bit of a drinker.

260
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:36,503
She's rather funny.

261
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,905
Can't smoke on board, Inspector.

262
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,976
Say, on the subject of drinking...

263
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,180
... I don't think that
the Wormsers were teetotalers.

264
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,448
The trash can is full of whiskey bottles.

265
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,319
How'd you find out?

266
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,154
By getting thirsty at the right time.

267
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,391
We've checked everything,
there is nothing suspicious.

268
00:35:57,624 --> 00:35:58,926
Well, let's see about that.

269
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:15,776
What's in here?
The head.

270
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:24,451
One could say this is a well kept boat,
it looks like it's never been used.

271
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:28,455
Yes, a little too much so. It looks like
Wormser didn't do a lot of fishing.

272
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,391
- There's no bait.
- Maybe on the deck.

273
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:38,465
Hey, officer, wasn't there any bait?

274
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:40,534
Bait?
No, say that's true, there was no bait.

275
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,770
- Alexander, can you come see?
- What is it?

276
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:48,942
- A spot of blood, look here.
- Ah yes.

277
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,212
Let's have it analyzed and dusted for prints.

278
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,383
Well, I don't think we'll find anything else.

279
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,385
Say, I wouldn't mind a drink.

280
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,535
Say, I suppose that confirms
the story of the heart attack.

281
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,969
What?
The blood stain?

282
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,573
Yes.
He headed out to do some fishing...

283
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,876
... dropped anchor, heart attack.

284
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,417
He collapsed, hit his head
and passed overboard.

285
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,786
Not too complicated.

286
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:38,358
Yes, but several things bother me.

287
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,462
The lack of bait, the whiskey bottles.

288
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,201
The wife is young and pretty.
Seems hot to trot.

289
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,436
The neighbor borrowed the car.

290
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:56,310
You know,
I think you've got something there.

291
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:04,184
Still, I like your idea there.

292
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,123
Wormser was an alcoholic.

293
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,926
His wife and that guy kept him drunk...

294
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,931
Then, knock him off
to live happily ever after with his money.

295
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,634
Yes, but if the writer is involved...
why did he borrow the car?

296
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:21,969
That wasn't smart!

297
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,505
Maybe he just got scared.

298
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,974
We've got to find this Marlo,
interrogate him.

299
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,876
I'm going to call the police station.

300
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:32,145
Then we'll have that drink.

301
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:40,020
<i>Julle darllng, lt's so stupld,</i>
<i>forgot to warn you about the money belt</i>.

302
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,656

306
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,402

314
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,185
Hello sir.

315
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,588
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

316
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:52,125
I would like the balance
in my husband's account, Mr. Wormser

317
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:56,296
Certainly, Mrs. Wormser.
I assume it's a joint account?

318
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,498
No, it's in his name.

319
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:03,070
Ah, we can only give
this information to the titled owner.

320
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,639
Of course, I understand.

321
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,307
But... something terrible has happened.

322
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:10,644
Yes I know.
News travels very fast, you know.

323
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:14,414
I think we could
bend the rule just a little...

324
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:18,552
I believe your husband made
a recent withdrawal. Excuse me.

325
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,634
Yes, it was yesterday actually.

326
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:36,637
How much did he withdraw?

327
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,640
A rather large sum; a million and a half.

328
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,642
1 50 million old francs.

329
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,146
But, that's impossible.

330
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:49,249
Well, we were surprised but it's a fact.

331
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:57,157
And... what is left in the account?

332
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,160
Oh, 92 francs.

333
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:04,598
We had to notify him
this is below the minimum.

334
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:08,602
Aren't you feeling well, madam?

335
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:15,275
- Yes, please excuse me.
- Good day Mrs. Wormser.

336
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,247
Mrs. Wormser...

337
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,388
- Hello Mrs. Wormser.
- Gentlemen.

338
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,257
This is a happy coincidence Madam.

339
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,727
Yes, we received permission
to open your husband's safety deposit box.

340
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:35,596
You're welcome to join us.

341
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,598
I'm at your disposal.

342
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:41,635
You are very cooperative,
Madam. We appreciate it

343
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,027
Mr. Wormser was here recently.

344
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,572
He apparently took everything.

345
00:42:24,444 --> 00:42:25,913
I'm happy you're here, Julie.

346
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,749
You see I am so distraught.

347
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,786
Since yesterday,
I feel like I'm in a waking nightmare.

348
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:37,391
Poor Julie.
Ah, it really is incomprehensible.

349
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:42,563
Georges, I had thought
maybe Louis told you his plans.

350
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:46,066
You were much more than
a financial advisor to him.

351
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,569
Don't speak about him in the past, Julie...

352
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,737
In the past?

353
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,573
I'm sorry to see you in this state.

354
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:55,242
You know I'm very fond of you both.

355
00:42:57,044 --> 00:43:00,681
There, there, I'm sure everything
wiII be explained, go on and eat.

356
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:06,520
- I'm really not very hungry.
- Eat anyway.

357
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:10,190
Shall we have a souffle for dessert?

358
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,829
The police came to my office this morning.

359
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,365
They asked me the same questions you did.

360
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,534
I told them I didn't know anything.

361
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:23,537
I won't tell you exactly the same thing.

362
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:29,209
In fact, he intends to leave
for the Antilles as soon as possible.

363
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:31,345
He'd already made all the arrangements.

364
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:35,883
And you think he's left for there?

365
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,353
Now now Julie, not without you.
He adores you.

366
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:42,523
No but I do believe
he's put the house up for sale.

367
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,794
Put the house up for sale?

368
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:50,531
He found something in Martinique, I believe.

369
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,535
He wanted to surprise you.

370
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:58,472
Now you're talking about him in past tense.

371
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:26,466
I'm concerned about leaving you alone, Julie.

372
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,636
You're very nice George, thank you.

373
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:32,940
I've got so much work right now.

374
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:36,443
Anyway, if you need anything, call me.

375
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:37,644
You can count on me.

376
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,446
Thank you.
I know I can count on you.

377
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:40,948
You're very pretty, Julie.

378
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:10,744
Dear Mrs. Wormser...

379
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,649
- Please excuse our intrusion.
- Madam

380
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,251
Gentlemen

381
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,753
- Mr. Thorent brought you back?
- Yes.

382
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:22,923
We saw his car.

383
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,427
I suppose he told you
about our visit this morning?

384
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:29,696
Yes, he did.

385
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:33,233
Yes well,
we have some important news Madam.

386
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:37,704
We saw Mr. Wormser's doctor and...

387
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:41,742
..he made some rather surprising revelations.

388
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:45,112
Dr. Favart? What could he have told you?

389
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:51,118
Well, he told us that
your husband never suffered a heart attack.

390
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:55,255
What do you mean? But....

391
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:58,792
That's right, it was an act.

392
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:04,031
Mr. Wormser suffered another illness
he found terribly humiliating.

393
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:12,873
According to Dr. Favart,
he had become impotent.

394
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:24,218
And so, it was to justify
his lack of passion towards you...

395
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,621
that he invented...

396
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:32,626
...that he invented this story
about the heart attack.

397
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,797
That makes no sense.
I don't believe a word.

398
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:42,569
Ah, you mean to say that
you had normal relations with him?

399
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,873
Sexual relations, that is.

400
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:49,877
No.

401
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:54,181
So the good doctor's statement was correct.

402
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:59,386
We have several rather difficult revelations

403
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:03,490
...in any case, surprising ones to tell you.

404
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,326
Please sit down.

405
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:08,762
Thank you, but I'm fine standing.

406
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:12,666
Oh no, Inspector Villon is right.
You'd better to sit down, believe me.

407
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,841
We found the Datsun, Madam.

408
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:27,181
It crashed into some rocks near Menton.

409
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:36,857
There was neither corpse
nor wounded in the car.

410
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:43,597
We think the driver was thrown. Then....

411
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:47,501
... washed out to sea.

412
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,642
We found a sports coat in the back....

413
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:01,448
...in it were I.D. papers
with the name Joseph Marlo...

414
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:08,121
...writer, living in St. Tropez.

415
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:12,960
My God, what's going on?

416
00:48:14,494 --> 00:48:16,296
Ah nothing very rare, I'm afraid.

417
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:21,068
We checked Mr. Marlo's house,
and found....

418
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:25,005
...this,
in the living room, under a cushion.

419
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,874
This is yours, is it not?

420
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:35,749
But I've never been in
Mr. Marlo's house, never.

421
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:41,889
A formal inquest has been started
for your husband's disappearance...

422
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,892
... Mrs. Wormser,

423
00:48:45,158 --> 00:48:48,128
...the judge is very anxious...

424
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:53,567
...to interview you as chief witness.

425
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:14,988
Your lawyer sends his apologies,
he will be a little late.

426
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,992
That's not unusual for him.

427
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:20,327
I don't know him.

428
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:22,629
He hasn't seen you yet?

429
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:27,968
A friend of my husband's
asked him to defend me.

430
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:32,105
From what I've seen so far
he'll have to be very talented.

431
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,676
Don't worry, he doesn't lack talent.

432
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,778
I'm not worried sir.

433
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:42,749
- Maybe you should be.
- Anyway we'll see.

434
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,653
You're very close to being indicted, Madam.

435
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:50,591
I'd rather not discuss this
without my lawyer.

436
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,293
You have every right, Madam.

437
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:04,104
Smoke, your Honor?

438
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:06,507
No, thank you, I prefer my own.

439
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:18,785
You've got nerves of steel, bravo.

440
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:21,622
I hope you can keep it up.

441
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,760
Your honor.

442
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,863
- Counselor.
- Please excuse the delay.

443
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:31,632
Ah, Mrs. Wormser...
They're giving you trouble, eh?

444
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:33,800
Don't worry, I'm here to defend you.

445
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,737
My name is Albert Legal.
Perfect name for a lawyer, no?

446
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,206
You know, you are ravishing.

447
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,809
So, your honor,
I know you adore torturing pretty women

448
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,978
..but I need to ask you
to wait a few more minutes.

449
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,314
...because I have not yet had a chance
to talk with my client alone.

450
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:50,150
Is there a corner we could be alone,
I promise we won't be 1 0 minutes.

451
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:54,788
Your little scene doesn't impress me,
but I will grant you the time.

452
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:00,060
Please take Mr. Legal
and his client to the back room.

453
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:02,429
Thank you, your honor, I'm very grateful.

454
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:09,603
You are a superb woman

455
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:24,418
Yes, it'll do.
And no listening at the door huh!

456
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:28,088
Please sit down.

457
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,259
You're much younger than your husband.

458
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,329
I can't help it.

459
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:39,499
Relax. I'm a little late
because I went to see everyone:

460
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,935
...your husband's banker,
your neighbor, and also......

461
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:45,105
...the real estate agent handling the house,
and of course the garage.

462
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,276
So now the police are sure
you've killed your husband...

463
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:52,779
... with the help of that guy...
what's his name?

464
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,147
Jeff Marlo.

465
00:51:55,148 --> 00:51:56,116
Yes, that's it.

466
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,720
Like they say in novels,
was he more than a friend?

467
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:02,155
No, nothing more.

468
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,324
You don't say his name
like that of a simple friend.

469
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,060
Be careful.

470
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:10,664
Now, did he visit you often?

471
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,136
They liked to chat together.
They got along very well.

472
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,371
They'd have a couple of drinks.

473
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,908
Oh, don't make me laugh.
Louis drank like a fish....

474
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:24,478
...maybe he cut down a little
when his heart kicked up.

475
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:28,282
As soon as he felt well
he began drinking again,...

476
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:29,249
...but not a great deal.

477
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:38,225
Did you lead normal lives,
I mean like a husband and wife?

478
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:45,232
- We had separate bedrooms
- Yes that's it.

479
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,237
Now tell me about this earring, was it yours?

480
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:51,972
Yes.

481
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:55,542
You've never gone to his house?

482
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,377
Yes, just once.

483
00:52:57,711 --> 00:52:59,179
It wasn't very smart to have lied.

484
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,014
Tell me the whole story.

485
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:06,353
Oh it was a couple of weeks ago.
We hadn't seen him in some time.

486
00:53:06,553 --> 00:53:08,755
..and Louis asked me
to drop in and see him...

487
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:11,358
... the door was open, I went in.

488
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:13,026
No one was home...

489
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:16,196
... I smoked a cigarette, waited,
he never showed up.

490
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:21,502
The next day, we found
he was spending a few days in Italy.

491
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:25,205
I see! No doubt to be seen...
and he came back this week!

492
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:30,244
We can't keep the judge waiting...

493
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,613
Let me take care of everything.

494
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:35,215
Just repeat in your head
'' I keep my trap shut''

495
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:36,717
Do you dig, Julie?

496
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,687
I dig, Mr. Legal.

497
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,657
You're lucky to be so good looking...

498
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,360
... or I'd have dropped
you like a hot potato.

499
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:50,631
We weren't too long, your Honor?

500
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,734
Please Counselor,
don't start your little song and dance again.

501
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,970
It's eventually going to get on my nerves
and it won't do you any good.

502
00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:00,474
You don't feel you have a solid case.
My only intention is justice.

503
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:03,544
Oh sit down, you are making me dizzy!

504
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:06,847
Please Mrs. Wormser, sit down.

505
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,129
- I have a few questions to ask you.
- Yes

506
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:24,498
About what?

507
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,601
But about Mr. Wormser's
dissapearance of course!

508
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:31,104
Just a second Your Honor,
the police report goes quite a bit further.

509
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:33,073
Yes, the police report you saw...

510
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:37,110
..concluded that Mr.Wormser
was robbed and killed, Counselor.

511
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:40,581
Madam Wormser has a right to know
what she is suspected of.

512
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,953
The report alleges the crime was committed
by a Mr. Joseph Marlo...

513
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,989
..and Mrs Julie Wormser, born Schumann,
was his accomplice.

514
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,225
Well, now we know were we stand.

515
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:54,962
The police report explained
the following theory:

516
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:59,266
Louis Wormser was dead or unconscious
on his boat Monday morning.

517
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,903
That morning the neighbor,
Mrs. Marie Chauvinet, saw...

518
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:07,107
..a man pulling a big seaman's kit bag
along the beach, so she says.

519
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,444
The police report suggests it was in fact....

520
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:14,615
..the body of Louis Wormser,
and Joseph Marlo was carrying it.

521
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,918
Marlo threw the cadaver out to sea. Then...

522
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:19,686
... he swam back to shore.

523
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:25,025
He then continued to type
as if he had not stopped for the whole night.

524
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,764
Pardon me, your Honor,
Mrs. Wormser needs a glass of water.

525
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,968
- Over here?
- Right.

526
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:49,283
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

527
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:50,484
You're o.k.?

528
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:51,652
Yes, I'm fine thanks.

529
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,956
Please continue Your Honor.

530
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:58,392
You're very gracious.

531
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:05,732
Marlo took the money
and whatever else he found on the boat...

532
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:08,502
maybe even on the victim's body,

533
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:13,073
a total of about 2 million francs,

534
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,308
...200 million old francs,

535
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:20,013
...and taking Mrs. Wormser's
new Datsun 260...

536
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,986
...he fled and Mrs. Wormser was
to join him later.

537
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,089
The police report states that
they were lovers.

538
00:56:29,623 --> 00:56:34,928
But they never met up
because he was killed in a auto accident.

539
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:36,930
Well...

540
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,939
I can only compliment the police's reasoning.

541
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:50,777
It is barely certain
J. Marlo killed Louis Wormser.

542
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:55,048
Well, I'm delighted we're in agreement.

543
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:58,685
Yes certainly, from what I've learned.

544
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:01,355
Jeff Marlo went out of his way
to befriend Mr Wormser.

545
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,091
He was almost broke,
at the end of his rope...

546
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:08,295
I suppose there is
a great deal of proof of his guilt.

547
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:13,600
Obviously the stolen car is one.

548
00:57:15,402 --> 00:57:20,541
Well, Mrs. Wormser stated,
her husband loaned the car to Marlo...

549
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:22,709
....even insisting he take it.

550
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,378
Between us that is highly unlikely.

551
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:28,549
All right, fine fine. What else?
Well go back to that..

552
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,151
The blood on board the boat.

553
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:34,588
The blood?
What is this story?

554
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:36,890
Additional evidence.

555
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,626
We were sure when the report became final.

556
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:43,230
- This isn't a trap, is it?
- Please.

557
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,399
We're talking about
a little blood on the railing.

558
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:48,669
Before being killed Mr. Wormser must
have fought with his assassin...

559
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:51,171
...the ''little blood'' in question is
the same type as Mr. Marlo's.

560
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,373
...which proves Marlo was on board.

561
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:55,509
What blood type is it?

562
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,247
Type O. Not Mr.Wormser's.

563
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:02,316
OK, fine,

564
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,219
What else?

565
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,156
We have proof Marlo mailed...

566
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:11,558
...a letter to Mrs. Wormser from Menton.

567
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:16,563
Do you have the letter?

568
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:20,334
No, but we know
Mrs. Wormser received it...

569
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:21,835
...the day of J. Marlo's death...

570
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:26,173
The Inspector is certain.
The mailman saw the letter stamped Menton!

571
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,510
What is this! A mailman
who remembers the stamp of Menton!!

572
00:58:29,743 --> 00:58:33,280
Not Madagascar, nor Tahiti,
but Menton. Oh no.

573
00:58:34,147 --> 00:58:35,582
You're not well, counselor?

574
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,387
It's obvious the mailman heard of
Mr. Wormser's disappearance...

575
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:44,091
It's normal he was curious
about his wife's mail.

576
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:48,662
Fine, but nothing proves
it was from J. Marlo.

577
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:50,130
Do you have another idea?

578
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,601
No, the letter was definitely from Mr. Marlo.

579
00:58:57,404 --> 00:59:00,374
Mrs. Wormser spoke to me of the letter...

580
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:04,978
Marlo said he had seen
the papers and was returning...

581
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:08,949
..because the police wanted to discuss
the disappearance of the car.

582
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:10,817
You're not lucky, counselor.

583
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:14,488
The car was headed the opposite direction
at the time of the accident.

584
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:18,625
Of course, Marlo lied in the letter.

585
00:59:18,825 --> 00:59:21,695
He simply wanted
to appease Mrs. Wormser..

586
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:25,632
...to buy a little time.
He was running.

587
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:31,438
You're saying his only goal
was to appease her.

588
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:34,641
How do you explain this?

589
00:59:34,842 --> 00:59:38,312
It was found in Marlo's suit
while checking the wrecked Datsun.

590
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:42,349
The handwriting is Mrs. Wormser's.
We checked.

591
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:47,521
Bravo.
Fine work.

592
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:49,656
I suppose you have the letter.

593
00:59:49,857 --> 00:59:52,159
This is your handwriting, is it not, Madam?

594
00:59:53,627 --> 00:59:57,231
I suppose you have the letter Your Honor?

595
00:59:57,865 --> 01:00:01,168
No, but it seems logical to me
he had put it in his pants pocket...

596
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:02,536
It's logical.

597
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:07,040
Ah yes, logical but it's too bad.

598
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,977
That letter would have proven
Mrs. Wormser innocent.

599
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:11,945
How would you know?

600
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:15,482
Very simple, Mrs. Wormser told me
what she had written the letter.

601
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:17,885
She is ready to repeat it.

602
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:21,989
Very simply, she was imploring
Joseph Marlo to return immediately.

603
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:26,260
A man who pretended
to be his friend could not have betray him.

604
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:30,831
Good God, of course she suspected.
The Police saw to that.

605
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:35,169
That is why she checked
her husband's financial status.

606
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:38,405
Counselor, Mrs. Wormser is capable
of telling me all this herself.

607
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:41,608
Yes of course, I understand, but...

608
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:45,345
... she wrote him, begging he clears himself.

609
01:00:45,546 --> 01:00:48,081
She was convinced of his guilt
but still wrote him.

610
01:00:48,282 --> 01:00:50,184
Please Madam, tell us.

611
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,853
That's it exactly, your Honor.

612
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:00,460
Inspector Villon went to
Mr. Marlo's residence...

613
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:01,962
...and found this by the couch....

614
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:06,400
...and he found the second earring
in a dresser drawer.

615
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:10,070
Please, madam.

616
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,575
...please repeat exactly
what you told me for his honor.

617
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,047
Yes, I don't quite know
why but in my sort of panic ...

618
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,616
... I told the Inspector
I had never been to Mr. Marlo's.

619
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:26,019
I did go there with my husband one time.

620
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,122
He wasn't home, I waited a few moments....

621
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:32,226
I think that's when
I must have lost the earring.

622
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,831
So, I add, if the police intend to use
this earring as proof of complicity...

623
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:42,202
... I warn you that
I am quite capable of proving ....

624
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:46,073
... the police attempted a set up...

625
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:50,310
... ''planting'' the earring
due to insufficient evidence!

626
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:52,813
I won't do it, of course, but...

627
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,749
... but I could if forced.

628
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:57,184
No threats, counselor.

629
01:01:57,951 --> 01:02:00,254
I'm not threatening, I'm simply stating...

630
01:02:00,787 --> 01:02:04,758
When Inspector Villon,
accompied by Inspector Lamy of Paris...

631
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:08,529
..and you, the judge of their undertaking...

632
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:14,434
...interrogated my client,
the hypothesis was a heart attack. Why?

633
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:17,905
Mrs. Wormser mentioned a heart attack
less than a year earlier!

634
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:20,941
Yes.
So why did the police change their minds?

635
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:27,581
Because they learned
Mr. Wormser never had a heart attack

636
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,584
The truth is he was impotent.

637
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:37,191
Enough to convince them
Joseph Marlo was Mrs. Wormser's lover...

638
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:39,359
..add to that,
she is 1 5 yrs younger than her husband.

639
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:43,664
Preconceptions are so convenient.
Except there is one little catch...

640
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:49,837
The little catch is Mrs. Wormser
didn't know her husband was impotent.

641
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,374
You can check the police report;
it's clearly between the lines.

642
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:57,711
So, I ask the question:
what remains of their fantastic accusations?

643
01:02:57,911 --> 01:02:59,546
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

644
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,050
Nothing proves that
Mr. Wormser was killed...

645
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:09,623
You can't even prove anything was stolen,
since the prime witness...

646
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:13,126
...the number one suspect,
and rightly so, Joseph Marlo, is dead.

647
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:17,397
So, legally speaking, what we have is:
a victim that doesn't exist,

648
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:20,968
..a fortune that doesn't exist,
and a suspect that no longer exists.

649
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:28,375
Your Honor: Allow me
to leave these chambers with Mrs. Wormser.

650
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:32,546
This has been a terrible trial for her.

651
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:35,716
Let's face it, this is a ridiculous affair.

652
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:39,887
Nobody's going to gain anything from it.

653
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,326
Yes, I see,
they might as well go back to square one.

654
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:50,564
It'll never stand up in court.
Good day, Madam.

655
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:52,766
Goodbye and thank you, your Honor.

656
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,670
Are you surprised?

657
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,010
How can you be alive?

658
01:05:45,712 --> 01:05:47,681
It's a long story!

659
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,554
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

660
01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:59,092
I should, but I won't.

661
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,363
No one would suspect me.

662
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:10,003
...since I'm already dead, amusing, isn't it?

663
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,291
What happened?

664
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,029
You're a pretty cool girl aren't you.

665
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:39,233
Come here...

666
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:43,971
Closer.

667
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:57,751
You should see your eyes.

668
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:02,022
It's extraordinary...

669
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,093
You're not even afraid.

670
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:12,566
Of course, I'm afraid.

671
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:17,237
Tell me what happened.

672
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:19,640
It's very simple.

673
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:24,912
Your plan went to shit!

674
01:07:33,754 --> 01:07:36,423
I knew everything from the very beginning.

675
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:43,730
I woke up not feeling well one night,
I needed a breath of air.

676
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,570
I saw you and Jeff that night.

677
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:59,580
The following night,
I decided to not drink, I listened to you.

678
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:04,785
And the following night,
and every other night...

679
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,024
I listened , listened, listened...

680
01:08:12,726 --> 01:08:17,531
..until one night,
I heard Jeff talk of murdering me.

681
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,835
And it became a sort of game.

682
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,539
But it was much more than a game for me.

683
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,048
What have you done to Jeff?
Did you kill him?

684
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:48,228
Did you kill him?

685
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:52,232
Would you like me tell you
about the night you killed me?

686
01:08:54,768 --> 01:08:56,537
I went up to bed.

687
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:00,841
You thought I was sleeping.

688
01:09:01,074 --> 01:09:02,075
But I wasn't.

689
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:07,981
I waited 'till Jeff went home.

690
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:12,219
Then I hit him.

691
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:16,256
You want to know what I hit him with?

692
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:20,227
<i>Wlth the same cudgel you used later</i>

693
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:32,339
<i>And l too carrled hlm to the room</i>
<i>by the back door</i>...

694
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:33,774
...<i>and put hlm ln my bed</i>.

695
01:09:53,227 --> 01:09:59,366
After that it was simple.
I just had to carry out your plans.

696
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:06,540
I went to Jeff's, tapped the typewriter...

697
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,978
...'till 5 in the morning.

698
01:10:13,447 --> 01:10:17,184
I came home, through the backdoor.

699
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:23,824
What if I'd gone upstairs to your room?

700
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:33,500
Well, I would have killed Jeff.

701
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:37,871
And I would have convinced you
that you had.

702
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:41,508
We would have been in it together.

703
01:10:42,276 --> 01:10:44,545
You probably would have
begged me to help you...

704
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:50,384
.. I would have said
''Yes, of course my darling.''

705
01:10:56,356 --> 01:10:59,493
But to return to that marvelous night...

706
01:11:02,529 --> 01:11:05,098
<i>Once out to sea, when he came to</i>.

707
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:09,102
<i>l had hlm drlnk whlskey</i>
<i>to brlng hlm around completely</i>.

708
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:18,846
You woke him up?
Why?

709
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,082
For the pleasure of it.
I wanted to see his expression.

710
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:29,156
<i>And l had hlm wrlte out</i>
<i>a full confesslon</i>...

711
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:31,658
...<i>statlng that you were hls accompllce</i>.

712
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:34,394
<i>Dld he wrlte lt?</i>

713
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:39,299
<i>Of course. He had no cholce</i>.
<i>He elther wrote or dledl</i>

714
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:42,336
<i>He wrote lt then he slgned lt</i>.

715
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:46,707
And what did you do after?

716
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:49,142
I knocked him out.

717
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:53,413
I dragged him to the side of the boat...

718
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,618
..and held his head under water
'till he drowned.

719
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:09,530
I let go of him
and the sea carried him away.

720
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:16,470
You didn't think I was capable did you?

721
01:12:17,938 --> 01:12:19,306
It's very easy to understand.

722
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:23,644
It was the first time that
my wife wanted to kill me.

723
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:29,283
When a man finds his wife
plans his death, he is capable of anything.

724
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:32,786
You are sick Louis, you're crazy!

725
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,622
No, I'm not sick, I'm very lucid...

726
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:38,458
...and I'm not finished, my dear.

727
01:12:39,092 --> 01:12:42,062
I wrote the letters you received from Jeff.

728
01:12:42,262 --> 01:12:46,300
I crashed the car,
placed your envelope in his coat pocket...

729
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,302
...your earring in his house...

730
01:12:48,602 --> 01:12:51,505
I put the jewels in a safe place.
I did all of it, me alone.

731
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:55,142
And what do you have left now?
Nothing...

732
01:12:56,743 --> 01:12:59,680
You have no lover, no jewels...

733
01:13:01,315 --> 01:13:04,618
... you've got nothing!
And that's what I call justice.

734
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:07,788
You think so?

735
01:13:09,122 --> 01:13:12,926
It's rather funny,
you made love to Jeff here...

736
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:15,195
..now you're going to do it with me.

737
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:21,435
You see, I'm not afraid
I'm not man enough for you.

738
01:13:33,146 --> 01:13:34,114
What do you want?

739
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:37,651
What do you want to prove?

740
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,421
I don't want to prove anything.

741
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:46,627
From now on, we'll have a new,
''complete'' relationship.

742
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:48,061
Oh yes.

743
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:51,798
A new and complete relationship,
that's impossible for you.

744
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,369
Even if you wanted to.

745
01:13:55,802 --> 01:13:56,670
We'll see.

746
01:13:58,772 --> 01:13:59,840
Louis, you're kidding!

747
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:02,042
No, I'm not kidding.

748
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:06,747
You'll do exactly what I want
or I'll go to the police.

749
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:12,920
Allright, let's go to the bedroom.

750
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:19,626
No, we'll do it right there.

751
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:23,897
Where you made love with him.

752
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:31,939
Yes, now.

753
01:17:11,865 --> 01:17:13,166
You son of a bitch.

754
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,171
You're a son of a bitch.

755
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:17,798
Do you want a drink, Louis?

756
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:24,304
No, thank you. I've stopped drinking.

757
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:36,717
- Your sun
- Thank you.

758
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,959
I found it with the money you left.

759
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,563
Does this signify our new relationship?

760
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:51,832
Yes, that's it.

761
01:18:56,603 --> 01:19:00,841
500 francs, that's not bad money
to be my husband's whore. Thank you.

762
01:19:05,612 --> 01:19:08,515
Don't forget your husband is dead.

763
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:18,792
How long do you think
this can last, Louis?

764
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:23,864
Who knows!

765
01:19:33,473 --> 01:19:34,842
That's disgust isn't it...

766
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:38,011
... hatred or what?

767
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:42,983
Accepting hatred.

768
01:19:43,817 --> 01:19:47,321
Maybe we'll find happiness later.

769
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:49,623
Hum. Happiness!

770
01:20:01,668 --> 01:20:05,038
How could you live with a woman
who tried to kill you? How?

771
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,510
Oh, there are millions of women
who dream of killing their husbands,

772
01:20:10,077 --> 01:20:12,346
...and millions of husbands
who dream of killing their wives.

773
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:15,682
The only difference is you tried.

774
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:22,489
No that's not it.
I actually wanted to kill you, Louis.

775
01:20:23,056 --> 01:20:25,025
Yes, I understand very well, and right now...

776
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:27,194
.... I'm actually trying to forgive you.

777
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:32,332
Do you think I could ever have anything
but hate towards you?

778
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:33,700
Even after last night?

779
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:35,202
Last night was different.

780
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:54,588
What...healed you?

781
01:20:56,123 --> 01:20:57,491
Watching you and Jeff together.

782
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:05,065
Each time I watched you,
I thought I couldn't take it.

783
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:08,335
I would leave...

784
01:21:11,839 --> 01:21:13,674
... but I would come back
and start watching again...

785
01:21:17,744 --> 01:21:22,416
I did that night after night...

786
01:21:30,023 --> 01:21:31,158
...watching, and eventually...

787
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:48,008
...one day, my feelings began to change.

788
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:51,678
...almost like I became him.

789
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,284
Then I was a man again.

790
01:22:03,323 --> 01:22:07,227
And after that
all my anxiety's disappeared...

791
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:11,965
... my nightmares disappeared.

792
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:23,210
It's funny; thanks to you,
I feel alive again...

793
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:27,581
... and I love life.

794
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:33,554
Are you sure, Louis?

795
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:36,790
Am I wrong?

796
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,131
You really have no money whatsoever?

797
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:23,337
Really.
I hardly have enough to feed myself.

798
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:28,175
Louis took everything we owned...

799
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,312
...our savings, our stocks. Everything.

800
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:37,050
Yes and you...
Oh, no, no, no, nothing.

801
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:45,659
Listen, I'm very sorry, I didn't know.

802
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,437
Naturally,
I can lend you money in the meantime.

803
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:02,709
In the meantime, what?
I don't know how to ever repay you.

804
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:07,381
Don't worry. We'll find a way.

805
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:11,451
No. It's impossible.

806
01:24:14,454 --> 01:24:17,758
I've been thinking,
didn't Louis have a life insurance policy?

807
01:24:18,358 --> 01:24:21,895
Yes of course.
50 million old francs, I believe.

808
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:26,333
Couldn't I get a loan
with that as collateral?

809
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:29,837
Possibly, around 1 0 million.

810
01:24:30,938 --> 01:24:31,538
No more?

811
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:33,240
How much would you want?

812
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:36,510
I need at least 30 or 40.

813
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:39,446
Want do you want to do
with that much money, Julie?

814
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:42,049
But George, I have absolutely nothing!

815
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,819
Louis sold the house.
I'm going to need to find a place to live.

816
01:24:47,688 --> 01:24:49,857
And I want to leave here.
I want to forget everything.

817
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:53,927
Well, obviously there is
no longer anything here for you.

818
01:24:55,963 --> 01:25:00,501
But please understand the process of
inheriting could be a long one!

819
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:07,174
Louis' death needs to become official,
his will needs to be validated.

820
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,576
It could take over a year.

821
01:25:11,912 --> 01:25:16,216
With luck, maybe I could get you
a small monthly income to get you by..

822
01:25:17,084 --> 01:25:18,485
...but not the money you're asking for.

823
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:25,359
I'm willing to help you
as much as I can Julie, you know that.

824
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:30,564
If you don't know where to go,
I can put you up.

825
01:25:31,732 --> 01:25:33,534
If you have nothing to eat,
you could share my meals.

826
01:25:35,002 --> 01:25:37,604
But it's not possible to get you
the kind of money you're asking for.

827
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:45,179
You must not leave, Julie.

828
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:52,853
Not bad, huh?

829
01:25:53,153 --> 01:25:54,087
Especially with the wind.

830
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,194
Too bad you're leaving so soon.
You could turn pro.

831
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,798
- Say, I've thought about the Wormser case.
- Yes?

832
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:07,935
I wonder if that cretin
isn't right after all?

833
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:08,669
How's that?

834
01:26:09,436 --> 01:26:10,971
Maybe we blew it.

835
01:26:11,638 --> 01:26:15,142
Maybe we didn't observe the person
who holds the key to the case.

836
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:16,643
Who is that?

837
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:20,447
-Louis Wormser.
-Your turn, Fernand.

838
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:27,321
But you're speaking
about him as if he's alive!!

839
01:26:27,554 --> 01:26:28,555
And why wouldn't he be?

840
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,659
We have to think about
what Louis Wormser did before the crime.

841
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,098
Just doesn't fit.
He got out all his money...

842
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:41,335
... put his house up for sale,
didn't say a word to his wife.

843
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:43,203
All this after 1 0 years of marriage.

844
01:26:45,973 --> 01:26:51,011
So that the beautiful Julie found
herself alone and ruined...

845
01:26:51,245 --> 01:26:54,748
...when he disappeared,
and of course, under suspicion.

846
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:56,517
As if she was being punished.

847
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:59,353
She damn well deserved it...

848
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,955
...believe me she's a real slut.

849
01:27:03,757 --> 01:27:08,595
Hum, that's just the point.
Was this a coincidence or planned?

850
01:27:10,464 --> 01:27:12,432
You think Wormser arranged
it all before he disappeared?

851
01:27:15,135 --> 01:27:16,436
Yes. That's what I'm thinking.

852
01:27:18,138 --> 01:27:20,807
He knew his wife was sleeping with Marlo.

853
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:22,876
Or he'd have no reason to punish her.

854
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:27,014
Maybe he knew
our two love birds planned to kill him.

855
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,452
Yes, but they still had time act, no?

856
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:35,022
No, I don't think so.
Do you want dessert?

857
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:36,623
No, thanks, just coffee.

858
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:41,094
Do you have an aged liquor?
Cognac or something?

859
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:42,796
We have a local brandy.

860
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:45,866
Perfect!
Two provincial brandies and cigars please.

861
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:52,840
This thing with the earring
has always bothered me.

862
01:27:54,174 --> 01:27:57,377
You don't lose them just like that.
Or else you notice it.

863
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:05,819
In my opinion, the earring was
planted to get little Julie under suspicion.

864
01:28:06,053 --> 01:28:09,056
And Marlo had no motivation.
But Wormser certainly did.

865
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:10,591
That's true.

866
01:28:11,258 --> 01:28:15,662
Here's what I think.
Wormser acted first.

867
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:19,333
At some point he took Marlo's place.

868
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:25,138
He killed him on the boat.
After all, it is Marlo's blood, right?

869
01:28:25,339 --> 01:28:26,874
Not Wormser's.

870
01:28:27,107 --> 01:28:28,909
He's the one who stole his own car...

871
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:30,410
.. and who wrote the letter.

872
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:35,716
What about the car accident?

873
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,785
- A little more Brandy?
- Gladly.

874
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:43,423
So the car accident?
That's easy...

875
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:49,630
Wormser stole Marlo's papers
before throwing him overboard...

876
01:28:50,464 --> 01:28:51,932
... he steals his jacket

877
01:28:53,133 --> 01:28:57,538
...and the envelope to the letter
that Julie sent to Menton.

878
01:28:57,804 --> 01:28:59,773
Now there, Wormser that's a brilliant idea.

879
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:04,044
First of all the letter itself
probably contains the proof..

880
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:07,214
...to Julie's guilt in
her husband's murder attempt.

881
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:14,588
Finally, the envelope's disappearance
scared the shit out of the chick.

882
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:23,030
Especially, it seems to prove
Marlo was killed running from the cops.

883
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,898
There, he got us, the bastard.

884
01:29:25,832 --> 01:29:29,336
Marlo wouldn't have left the envelope
if he had faked the accident.

885
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:34,708
Wormser is definitely very good;
he got what he wanted.

886
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:39,379
He threw his chick into the street,
killed her lover...

887
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,948
... split with all the dough.

888
01:29:48,255 --> 01:29:50,691
Say, you know it's very clever
what you've figured out.

889
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:55,896
Not clever but it stands up.

890
01:30:00,434 --> 01:30:05,239
Say, you have any idea
where Wormser might be hiding?

891
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:08,809
Oh there, you're asking too much.
But if I was you...

892
01:30:10,544 --> 01:30:11,879
Wormser's financial counselor.

893
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:14,448
Who?
Georges Thorent?

894
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,684
Yes, Thorent.
He's one of his best friends.

895
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:20,754
And he'll surely need
to contact him sooner or later.

896
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:24,725
If I were you, I would watch him.

897
01:31:17,578 --> 01:31:19,046
Why are you so strange, Louis?

898
01:31:20,013 --> 01:31:24,551
Because I'm getting sick
of going in and out like a thief.

899
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:28,188
- But nothing forces you to.
- No.

900
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:32,926
- No, it's simple just go to the police.
- Well.

901
01:31:33,794 --> 01:31:37,931
- I'll tell the police I have amnesia
- Yes.

902
01:31:39,366 --> 01:31:41,335
They'll never swallow that.

903
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:44,371
- Louis.
- Wait.

904
01:31:44,805 --> 01:31:48,575
Suppose I go to the police to explain....
I'm kidding of course....

905
01:31:48,876 --> 01:31:49,843
What would you do?

906
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:52,045
I would stay near you.

907
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,047
They won't question it.

908
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:56,116
If I live with you,
they couldn't say anything.

909
01:31:58,218 --> 01:31:59,486
We'd go back to living together?

910
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:06,293
I'd want to try, anyway.

911
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:10,631
You've changed Louis,
and I've changed also.

912
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:16,270
I can't believe you.

913
01:32:18,138 --> 01:32:20,107
Louis please...

914
01:32:22,543 --> 01:32:24,311
...Please, let's try.

915
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:28,315
Try, but how,
even if we lived together 20 years...

916
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,984
... I would always think
it was because of the confession.

917
01:32:31,418 --> 01:32:33,854
Just burn it and we can forget everything.

918
01:32:42,262 --> 01:32:43,830
Very nice!!
Congratulations.

919
01:32:44,598 --> 01:32:45,566
What are you saying?

920
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:47,434
It's becoming so clear.

921
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:54,508
I'll tell you exactly what I think...

922
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:59,379
You want me to destroy the confession.
You'll have your Jeff back...

923
01:32:59,613 --> 01:33:02,983
...get your jewels, the house,
everything back. You don't love me.

924
01:33:04,985 --> 01:33:06,954
- I'm not crazy. I'm not an idiot.
- Louis.

925
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:29,243
- Good evening, Mrs. Wormser.
- Good evening gentlemen.

926
01:33:29,476 --> 01:33:30,711
Good evening Madam.

927
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:36,250
I'm happy to find you here.

928
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:38,585
No thanks to you.

929
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:41,955
Ah Madam, police work is thankless work.

930
01:33:42,556 --> 01:33:43,957
We sometimes have to pry.

931
01:33:44,324 --> 01:33:49,496
Don't hold it against the Inspector.
Could we have a word?

932
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:50,531
At this hour?

933
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:53,600
Well, gentlemen
you're lucky to find me still up.

934
01:33:54,535 --> 01:33:56,770
Yes, I know.
Please forgive us.....

935
01:33:57,671 --> 01:34:01,241
....but we have some interesting conclusions
to present you.

936
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:04,444
Yes and I'd like to ask you a minor question.

937
01:34:05,012 --> 01:34:07,181
Have you had any news from your husband?

938
01:34:08,348 --> 01:34:10,884
Of course not, I would have called you.

939
01:34:11,518 --> 01:34:12,753
I don't doubt it at all.

940
01:34:13,287 --> 01:34:14,655
So why this idiotic question?

941
01:34:14,855 --> 01:34:16,423
Oh, it's not idiotic, Madam.

942
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,859
It's possible that
your husband is still alive.

943
01:34:19,726 --> 01:34:23,163
Oh please, you have no right
to play with people's minds.

944
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,165
And you're mocking my husband's death....

945
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:27,534
We're not playing.
This is not a game!

946
01:34:27,734 --> 01:34:30,771
We're not fooling around.
We're seeking the truth.

947
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:34,975
The truth?
Your truth has many faces!

948
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:37,878
I haven't forgotten
your report to the police, Inspector.

949
01:34:39,246 --> 01:34:42,416
Three days ago you were sure
my husband had been killed...

950
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:43,884
...and that I was an accomplice
to the murder.

951
01:34:45,752 --> 01:34:48,288
Well, we think the facts
can be interpreted another way.

952
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:53,827
You think? I wouldn't have thought
you capable of thinking Inspector!

953
01:34:58,465 --> 01:34:59,433
Is that a threat?

954
01:35:00,234 --> 01:35:02,302
Listen Madam,
it's entirely possible your husband is alive.

955
01:35:02,302 --> 01:35:05,405
If he was alive, he would have come home.

956
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:11,144
No, maybe not.
He could have suffered a blow to the head.

957
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:13,447
And suffering a temporary loss of memory.

958
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:18,151
That's why the Inspector
asked you if you had news.

959
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:23,824
No, I don't have news from him.

960
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:34,902
We don't want to take up
any more of your time Mrs. Wormser.

961
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:39,006
I'm sure you'll contact us
if you see your husband, right?

962
01:35:41,008 --> 01:35:44,845
Inspector, if I see him
I'll throw myself into his arms.

963
01:35:46,547 --> 01:35:48,115
May I go to bed now?

964
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:08,168
You were great and I was stupid.

965
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:10,204
Please forgive me.

966
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:17,377
That was a little close for comfort.

967
01:36:17,578 --> 01:36:20,814
Yes, but we'll have to leave.
We can't hide here our whole lives.

968
01:36:21,014 --> 01:36:22,015
What do you mean?

969
01:36:23,183 --> 01:36:25,352
Don't you want to keep paying me
to make love to you?

970
01:36:27,521 --> 01:36:30,457
Sure, I'll keep paying you.

971
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:32,626
Here's what were going to do...

972
01:36:34,228 --> 01:36:38,665
I'll trust you if you'll trust me.

973
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:43,637
I'll forgive you the same way
you'll forgive me.

974
01:36:47,241 --> 01:36:48,208
O.k.?

975
01:36:52,846 --> 01:36:53,814
O.k.

976
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:27,881
They're gone.

977
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:41,328
Do you have a car?

978
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:44,631
- But this is....
- Get in.

979
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:29,543
Does George know about Jeff and me?

980
01:38:29,776 --> 01:38:30,744
George knows everything.

981
01:38:35,048 --> 01:38:37,284
What's come over you, bringing her here?
You're crazy.

982
01:38:38,252 --> 01:38:40,420
No, no, not at all!

983
01:38:41,088 --> 01:38:43,724
The police came to the house.
They thought l was alive.

984
01:38:43,957 --> 01:38:46,126
Julie held them off all alone.
She was Magnificent.

985
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:50,797
All she wants is
to get her confession back.

986
01:38:51,465 --> 01:38:52,866
You'll see how fast
she'll turn you in after that.

987
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:56,570
That's disgusting!

988
01:38:57,538 --> 01:38:58,572
You don't get it .

989
01:38:58,705 --> 01:39:01,842
She's trying to get her dough back
any way she can.

990
01:39:03,043 --> 01:39:07,381
She hit me up this morning.
Almost showed her ass to get her bread.

991
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:09,016
Why do you hate me?

992
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:14,021
It's just that I don't like women,
dear friend.

993
01:39:17,758 --> 01:39:19,927
She tried to kill you to get your dough....

994
01:39:21,562 --> 01:39:24,731
...and to split with that asshole
with the big dick.

995
01:39:24,932 --> 01:39:28,602
She would steal your gold fillings
if she could. And you trust her?

996
01:39:31,872 --> 01:39:33,507
Are you going to keep her with you?

997
01:39:35,742 --> 01:39:36,710
Yes, that's right.

998
01:39:38,111 --> 01:39:39,079
You're really a child.

999
01:39:41,615 --> 01:39:44,585
No I'm not a child.
I love her.....

1000
01:39:45,919 --> 01:39:47,387
...and I want to stay with her.

1001
01:39:48,422 --> 01:39:51,725
All you need is to take
that fool's confession to the police..

1002
01:39:54,695 --> 01:39:59,032
You can have a new life.
You deserve it, you've got the mean.

1003
01:40:00,734 --> 01:40:02,202
No, I would never do that to her.

1004
01:40:03,704 --> 01:40:06,206
- O.k., so you're an idiot
- Georges

1005
01:40:12,713 --> 01:40:15,315
Excuse me but Julie is my wife.

1006
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:19,720
And you'll speak to her with respect.

1007
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:26,960
I'm tired, very tired...

1008
01:40:33,467 --> 01:40:34,201
..that's enough.

1009
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:36,870
This comedy has gone on
long enough. It's finished.

1010
01:40:41,842 --> 01:40:45,379
Leave me alone.
You already know I have nothing left.

1011
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,581
You shut up you stupid female!

1012
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:51,084
No, I won't shut up.

1013
01:40:53,187 --> 01:40:55,856
You can't make me shut up.
You have no right.

1014
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,958
Louis forgave me.

1015
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:01,929
We're starting over
and you can't make me shut up.

1016
01:41:06,099 --> 01:41:10,037
Jeff's confession and Louis' money
are in a safe at my place.

1017
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,505
George, please stop.

1018
01:41:13,307 --> 01:41:15,976
- Good. All this is good to know.
- Jeff!

1019
01:41:16,476 --> 01:41:20,247
Yes...
and now all the dead are resuscitated.

1020
01:41:24,751 --> 01:41:26,019
I'm sure she's cooking up something.

1021
01:41:28,555 --> 01:41:30,891
In any case the bitch knows
more than she's telling us.

1022
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:32,926
You're a misogynist, old man!

1023
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:37,064
I don't know, but women like her
frighten the pants off me.

1024
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:39,032
She wouldn't need
to frighten my pants off.

1025
01:41:41,235 --> 01:41:42,803
Do you think she's seen her husband?

1026
01:41:43,403 --> 01:41:44,538
I'm sure of it!

1027
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:49,376
It's funny, but when I propose
a theory you jump on it with both feet.

1028
01:41:49,576 --> 01:41:51,211
In any case, nothing proves
Wormser is still alive.

1029
01:41:51,745 --> 01:41:53,413
You've proved it to me.

1030
01:41:53,814 --> 01:41:56,850
If she's seen him
she knows he killed her lover.

1031
01:41:57,084 --> 01:41:59,052
Why hasn't she turned him in?

1032
01:41:59,486 --> 01:42:04,291
She can't. He's got to have proof
she and Marlo tried to kill him.

1033
01:42:05,092 --> 01:42:06,994
Ah. One for you!
You're right!

1034
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:12,699
Mmm, your sandwich is very good.

1035
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:14,868
You have to put butter and ham.

1036
01:42:16,303 --> 01:42:21,675
God I was stupid. I should have had
the villa watched day and night.

1037
01:42:22,209 --> 01:42:23,610
...rather than watching
the financial advisor.

1038
01:42:24,778 --> 01:42:25,746
Does your T.V. work?

1039
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,148
It works but there's a strike
and in any case...

1040
01:42:28,382 --> 01:42:30,317
Even if there wasn't, it's 1 1 :30 so....

1041
01:42:34,555 --> 01:42:35,956
Did you know he was alive?

1042
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:44,631
Of course he knew.
All the time he fucked you, he knew.

1043
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,406
Listen Julie,
you're going to appreciate this.

1044
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:55,843
Go on, Louis.
Tell your clever little scheme.

1045
01:42:58,779 --> 01:42:59,947
What do you want?

1046
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:02,482
I'll tell you what I want.

1047
01:43:03,317 --> 01:43:05,152
I want the girl,
the dough, and the jewels...

1048
01:43:06,653 --> 01:43:07,621
...And I'll get it all.

1049
01:43:08,355 --> 01:43:09,489
He told you I was dead, huh?

1050
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,458
Yes...that's what he said.

1051
01:43:13,527 --> 01:43:15,062
I could never kill anyone.

1052
01:43:17,998 --> 01:43:20,200
Tell her, tell her what happened!

1053
01:43:24,171 --> 01:43:27,474
When he came to,
we were on the boat.

1054
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,044
I held my gun on him...

1055
01:43:34,715 --> 01:43:36,283
...told him I wanted to kill him.

1056
01:43:38,952 --> 01:43:40,320
Told him that I knew everything.

1057
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:45,692
He begged me to spare him...

1058
01:43:49,596 --> 01:43:51,098
... he started crying.

1059
01:43:51,498 --> 01:43:55,002
Watch out, I'm the one with the gun now.

1060
01:43:56,537 --> 01:43:58,939
A gun can't change anything now.

1061
01:44:03,443 --> 01:44:08,549
After that, I forced him to write
and sign the confession.

1062
01:44:11,652 --> 01:44:14,154
I offered him 50,000 new francs...

1063
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:17,224
...and he took it.

1064
01:44:19,126 --> 01:44:21,395
I would have given him much more.

1065
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:24,665
Poor loser, it's all his money.

1066
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:26,366
When did you get back?

1067
01:44:27,134 --> 01:44:31,104
Same time as him.
I saw you two making love.

1068
01:44:32,306 --> 01:44:33,807
You got off on it huh?

1069
01:44:35,909 --> 01:44:36,777
Yes, she did.

1070
01:44:37,311 --> 01:44:39,279
You shut up, I'm talking to her now.

1071
01:44:57,464 --> 01:44:59,833
I thought about you all the time Jeff.

1072
01:45:07,274 --> 01:45:08,242
Julie!

1073
01:45:10,043 --> 01:45:11,178
You're coming with me.

1074
01:45:11,712 --> 01:45:13,881
We're going to get back the dough,
the jewels and my confession.

1075
01:45:14,381 --> 01:45:15,382
You watch him, I'll be back in half hour.

1076
01:45:16,617 --> 01:45:18,452
Jeff! Let me come with you .
Please!

1077
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:20,621
Watch him carefully.
I won't be long.

1078
01:45:24,057 --> 01:45:25,025
You lied to me!

1079
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:26,760
Be quiet!

1080
01:45:30,731 --> 01:45:31,698
They're gone.

1081
01:46:02,596 --> 01:46:03,330
Louis, Louis....

1082
01:46:13,473 --> 01:46:14,441
What's the matter?

1083
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:25,752
Talk to me, Louis.

1084
01:46:27,888 --> 01:46:30,090
You know very well
it was a just a put on, nothing more.

1085
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:33,861
''Put on'' sometimes kill...

1086
01:46:35,996 --> 01:46:41,001
We don't think about it,
and one day it happens.

1087
01:46:54,081 --> 01:46:59,453
Hold on, hold on, don't move.

1088
01:47:04,758 --> 01:47:08,562
Hold on tight, I'll be back soon.

1089
01:47:13,567 --> 01:47:14,768
Good, stay here.

1090
01:47:51,271 --> 01:47:52,239
Shit

1091
01:47:58,745 --> 01:47:59,713
About time.

1092
01:48:04,084 --> 01:48:06,186
Hello yes. It's me.

1093
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,921
- Is that him?
- Yes, hold on.

1094
01:48:08,589 --> 01:48:11,658
Tell him Thorent came in
with a man who could be Jeff Marlo.

1095
01:48:11,925 --> 01:48:14,595
Thorent just came in with a man
who could be Jeff Marlo.

1096
01:48:14,795 --> 01:48:15,762
Are you sure?

1097
01:48:17,231 --> 01:48:20,200
Thorent just went in to his place
with a man who could be Jeff Marlo

1098
01:48:20,434 --> 01:48:21,401
What?

1099
01:48:21,735 --> 01:48:23,237
- What do we do?
- Wait a second.

1100
01:48:23,637 --> 01:48:27,708
Hello, just one second.
Let me think.

1101
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:33,080
Tell them to stay put.
If someone comes out, follow him discreetly.

1102
01:48:35,148 --> 01:48:37,284
Be ready to tail if one of them comes out?

1103
01:48:39,553 --> 01:48:43,891
He says stay put
and get ready for ''tailing''.

1104
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:47,661
Tell him we're coming.

1105
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:51,698
- Hello, I'll be right there.
- Very good, Inspector.

1106
01:48:53,934 --> 01:48:55,602
What a mess!

1107
01:49:04,311 --> 01:49:05,279
What are you doing here?

1108
01:49:08,282 --> 01:49:11,218
Louis is dying, quick, quick

1109
01:49:28,468 --> 01:49:29,436
Julie.

1110
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:50,090
What happened?
You shot him?

1111
01:49:50,858 --> 01:49:52,759
He's dying.
His heart is giving out.

1112
01:49:53,193 --> 01:49:56,363
-We've got to save him,
Jeff. Hurry, help me!

1113
01:49:56,496 --> 01:49:57,297
Hurry......

1114
01:50:11,945 --> 01:50:12,713
No, no! Don't stop!

1115
01:50:13,013 --> 01:50:13,981
Why?
Everything is fine.

1116
01:50:14,181 --> 01:50:15,315
Don't stop, he's dying,

1117
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:53,620
I've got 200 G's back there.
And I burned my confession.

1118
01:50:55,155 --> 01:50:56,123
Where is George?

1119
01:50:56,323 --> 01:50:57,291
Don't worry about it.

1120
01:50:57,591 --> 01:50:58,559
Did you kill him?

1121
01:50:58,825 --> 01:51:02,396
Never mind. If your husband dies
we have what we wanted.

1122
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:05,399
Everything worked out for the best, no?

1123
01:51:05,632 --> 01:51:08,135
But I can't leave him like this.
He's suffering.

1124
01:51:09,469 --> 01:51:11,505
You're going to make me cry.

1125
01:51:12,506 --> 01:51:14,408
Let's get the fuck out of here,
let's disappear.

1126
01:51:14,608 --> 01:51:17,578
We're free and rich Julie, rich.

1127
01:51:20,447 --> 01:51:21,882
I don't want to go with you.

1128
01:51:26,854 --> 01:51:28,822
Oh, So you're only
interested in the money.

1129
01:51:29,523 --> 01:51:32,359
You want to dump me like
a piece of shit? You whore.

1130
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:39,700
You're mine,
you hear me, you're mine.

1131
01:51:40,634 --> 01:51:43,737
You're mine.
I'm going to make you come, you slut.

1132
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:47,875
- You're going to scream like you never have.
- You're mine.

1133
01:51:48,976 --> 01:51:52,346
- No Jeff, stop!
- Tell me you want some, tell me again.

1134
01:51:55,115 --> 01:51:57,751
- No, say it again.
- No!

1135
01:52:00,754 --> 01:52:04,725
- Say it again.
- No.

1136
01:52:21,808 --> 01:52:22,976
- Cuff him.
- Julie, Julie!

1137
01:52:53,407 --> 01:52:55,475
We've got to save my husband.

1138
01:52:57,911 --> 01:53:00,147
We've got to save my husband.

1139
01:53:05,519 --> 01:53:07,487
We've got to save my husband.

1140
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,535
Your husband is dead Madam.

1141
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:16,423
Your client is waiting in the green office.

1142
01:54:16,623 --> 01:54:19,026
- Where is it?
- Follow me .

1143
01:54:23,063 --> 01:54:24,031
Thank you, officer.

1144
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:33,740
You don't look like you're well.
Hello?

1145
01:54:35,976 --> 01:54:40,247
You don't want to talk to me?
Admit that I've done you nothing but good!

1146
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,685
No, you don't want to.

1147
01:54:46,787 --> 01:54:50,123
I was told you were traumatized
by this whole affair. Understandable..

1148
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:54,361
... your position could be a lot worse

1149
01:54:55,629 --> 01:54:58,532
We're going to pin everything
on your boyfriend, he asked for it.

1150
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:02,870
I'll bet he gets a solid ten to fifteen.

1151
01:55:06,373 --> 01:55:08,575
As for you my beauty, it's cake..

1152
01:55:09,543 --> 01:55:10,878
I'll have you freed on your word....

1153
01:55:11,245 --> 01:55:15,048
..and you'll get a year, a year
and a half probation.

1154
01:55:19,353 --> 01:55:21,655
This is unbearable.

1155
01:55:25,559 --> 01:55:26,827
What do you want me to say?

1156
01:55:27,327 --> 01:55:30,297
I don't know, you could say thank you.

1157
01:55:31,164 --> 01:55:32,132
Thank you.

1158
01:55:34,001 --> 01:55:35,402
In a way, you got everything you wanted.

1159
01:55:36,436 --> 01:55:37,838
You're rich, and your husband is dead.

1160
01:55:38,505 --> 01:55:39,540
Please, be quiet.

1161
01:55:39,873 --> 01:55:42,476
A lawyer never stops talking,
you should know that.

1162
01:55:43,911 --> 01:55:45,879
I would give everything to have Louis alive.

1163
01:55:49,149 --> 01:55:50,851
Oh the fickleness of women!

1164
01:55:54,087 --> 01:55:55,989
I get the feeling you hate me.

1165
01:55:56,924 --> 01:55:58,058
No, not especially.

1166
01:56:00,661 --> 01:56:01,628
What is it?

1167
01:56:05,032 --> 01:56:09,603
It's odd. When I tried killing my husband
nothing happened to me....

1168
01:56:10,904 --> 01:56:13,907
...now I'm trying to save him
and I'm being punished.

1169
01:56:15,309 --> 01:56:17,344
That, my beauty,
is the puzzle of justice.

1170
01:56:17,778 --> 01:56:19,246
The truth is whatever
people want to believe.

1171
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:23,250
And don't forget
that it's a man's world.

1172
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,485
With laws made by men, for men.

1173
01:56:26,019 --> 01:56:26,987
It's men's justice.

1174
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,091
You're not even trying
to understand me.

1175
01:56:32,593 --> 01:56:34,228
The law doesn't give a damn
about understanding.

1176
01:56:36,396 --> 01:56:37,397
Come on, the Judge is waiting.

1177
01:57:29,716 --> 01:57:30,684
Julie!!!

1178
01:57:47,134 --> 01:57:48,101
Julie!!

1179
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:04,384
Julie!!!!

1180
01:58:11,525 --> 01:58:12,492
Julie!!!!!

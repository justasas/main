1
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,000
Jesus..., oh!

2
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,495
God!!

3
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,460
No Metal in the microwave.

4
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,328
No metal!

5
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,866
Martha, it's Robert.

6
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,210
Just to let you know to
keep an eye peeled

7
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,123
for the first reviews of
your breathlessly awaited first novel.

8
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,420
Word is, the Times is going to rave,
rave, rave.

9
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,171
Talk to you soon.

10
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,040
Thank you.

11
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,538
You look like shit.

12
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,286
Where's Grandpa?

13
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,251
He's so cute with the headphones on.

14
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,115
Hi Grandpa!

15
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,580
Hi

16
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,120
Do you think he remembers me?

17
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,370
Come on, it's a steal.

18
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,290
You've got to see it.

19
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,576
You'll have your own room to
write in.

20
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,828
Grandpa could be out in
the back chopping bricks

21
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,538
or whatever he does out there.

22
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,076
You'd never even know he existed.

23
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,168
I wish he didn't.

24
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,081
God, he's really getting you down.

25
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,583
From the way Alex has acted for
the last seven years,

26
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,868
you would have
thought he didn't have a father.

27
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,500
And then boom,

28
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,455
a month ago this shows up on
the doorstep.

29
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,713
I haven't written a word since.

30
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,041
Well, Alex has got to get him out
of here.

31
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,786
It's not that simple with Alex

32
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,076
and frankly we can't afford to
buy another place

33
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,748
let it alone to buy a mansion.

34
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,865
Of course you can

35
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
especially if your mother's offer is
still good.

36
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,581
Alex will never accept money
from her, you know that.

37
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,578
Work on Him!

38
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,498
For God sakes, Martha,
you have alot to learn about men.

39
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,325
And you have a lot to
learn about husbands.

40
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,710
Sorry.

41
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:57,961
It's OK.

42
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,826
I am getting a dog.

43
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,168
Hi Alex!

44
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,500
Smells good.

45
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,325
Good Jeremy.

46
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,785
Grandpa, I'm home.

47
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,616
How's my boy!

48
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,710
What's that?

49
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,673
It's a book that I made for you.

50
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,711
Animals that change.

51
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,583
One day

52
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,998
I saw the most weird thing.

53
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,083
It was a turtle and a fish, and a rat.

54
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,960
They lived in a puddle of potion.

55
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,503
They grew.

56
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,705
They destroied the universe.

57
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,423
The end.

58
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,673
Jeremy gets some ideas.

59
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,246
Come on,
let's clean up for the dinner.

60
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:02,463
Dad

61
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,960
you shouldn't eat so
much fat at your age.

62
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,251
How are you today?

63
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,615
Did you watch
those tapes I rented for you?

64
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,370
Terrible!

65
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,788
Then I'll get you some
Taiwanese Shows.

66
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,996
They'll be just as bad.

67
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,365
Well, what about some
Hong Kong Kung Fu movies?

68
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,250
The worst!

69
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,705
Their Kung Fu's a joke.

70
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,866
Dad! They're only acting,

71
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,620
but you are a Tai Chi master.

72
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,535
To learn English is boring to me.

73
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,328
To go back?

74
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,328
Even more boring.

75
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,455
My life is going to nowhere.

76
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:34,373
Dad.

77
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,326
It hasn't even been a month

78
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,248
since you retired and came to
the States.

79
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,365
Give yourself some time.

80
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,498
Jeremy

81
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,115
Come here

82
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
Come here! You little rascal.

83
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,580
Come here.

84
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,418
Come here, Jeremy.
Get off the couch.

85
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,078
I don't have time for this, come here.

86
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,038
Whoa!

87
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,246
My precious young man
running barely naked!

88
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,615
The future of our Chu family

89
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,120
depends on your little treasure.

90
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,250
What does he think he's doing?

91
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,035
That's all right

92
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,326
Chinese elders must
always reassure themselves

93
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,038
that their family name will go on.

94
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,791
Come on Jeremy, upstairs with you!

95
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,790
Eh? She's afraid he'll catch coId.

96
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,536
Kids aren't made out of paper.

97
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,750
Thanks.

98
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
No, thanks.

99
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,871
Why this American woman only
eats vegetables?

100
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,828
She's afraid of getting fat.

101
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,371
Why am I not fat?

102
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,208
On this Earth there are
two kinds of food.

103
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,416
Vegetables are "yin".

104
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,251
Meat is "yang".

105
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,666
You must eat both to be balanced.

106
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,791
Then the man can be completed.

107
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,496
Alex, Linda came over today.

108
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,285
Great.

109
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,916
What's that supposed to mean?

110
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,293
Just great.

111
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,123
What exactly do you have to
against her anyway?

112
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,250
So what if was a Maoist in coIlege.

113
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,115
From Maoist revolutionary to
real estate baron.

114
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,500
If there's one thing worse than
a communist,

115
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,245
it's an ex-communist who has
become a capitalist.

116
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,955
Well, she's ready to
do us quite a big favor.

117
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,673
Oh no, she's trying to
sell us a house again.

118
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,831
What's she mumbling about?

119
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:46,748
Nothing.

120
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,581
Something about cigarette butts?

121
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:49,916
What?

122
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,081
Mom said she wants to move out.

123
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,118
Quiet!

124
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,205
Alex, I'm talking to you.

125
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,003
Mom, can I watch cartoons?

126
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,665
Here.

127
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,038
Put some meat on your bones!

128
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,536
I don't want it, thank you.

129
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,536
Jeremy, finish your milk and
you can watch TV.

130
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,416
What did she say?

131
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,828
If he finish his milk,
he can watch TV.

132
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,291
American people teach children

133
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,576
like they're doing business.

134
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,998
Everything's a deal.

135
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,285
You should at least take
a look at the photos.

136
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,496
It's apparently a real steal.

137
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,665
If children can't concentrate
on eating,

138
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,711
what else can they concentrate on?

139
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,423
Yes, father.

140
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
And these American cartoons

141
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,121
are only adding weirdness and
violence

142
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,920
to mess up the world,

143
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,501
For children?

144
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,415
It's just a mess.

145
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,121
Our sages said...

146
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,920
Dad...

147
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,580
Just eat!

148
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,293
Please don't get upset.

149
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,206
I'm just afraid
your dinner's getting coId.

150
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,753
What has he been babbling about?

151
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,035
The violence in cartoons.

152
00:18:59,166 --> 00:18:59,996
How could he complain?

153
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,615
He's a martial arts expert himself.

154
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,830
Isn't that violent enough?

155
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,168
Would you cut it off?

156
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,121
Both of you!

157
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,623
Just eat.

158
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,370
You finish up.

159
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm going out for a smoke.

160
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,418
In America, you're so polite to kids.

161
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,501
You think so?

162
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,245
You don't treat kids as kids

163
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,328
It's interesting.

164
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,250
It's very interesting.

165
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,615
It's called democracy.

166
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,120
Democracy means no big and
no little.

167
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,080
Ok,

168
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,498
you understand America better than
I do.

169
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,123
Chinese Time.

170
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,330
Jeremy, stop playing.

171
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,671
Come on, time for homework.

172
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,076
Alex.

173
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,825
The teachers here can't
speak Chinese fluently,

174
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,918
how can kids learn in the good way?

175
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,575
They are fine,

176
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,998
don't be too picky!

177
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,995
We only have
one Chinese schooI around here.

178
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,075
Every weekend,
Jeremy learns some Chinese,

179
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,288
I can play basketball,

180
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,576
and you get to teach Tai Chi.

181
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,326
Thanks God for it!

182
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,078
No matter how they teach it,

183
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,328
We learn it by their ways.

184
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,668
Eh! Not like that!

185
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,115
Dad, I've got some things to
take care of.

186
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,458
Jeremy,

187
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,463
look!

188
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,923
Grandpa will teach you an
oId Chinese rhyme.

189
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,211
On East West Street.

190
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,543
North South Go.

191
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,616
Outside the gate, a man bites a dog!

192
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,120
Grab the dog to hit a brick.

193
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,960
Watch out!
That brick might bite the hand.

194
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,923
FoIlow Grandpa.

195
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,751
On East West Street.

196
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,825
North South Go.

197
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,788
Outside the gate a dog bites a man.

198
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,366
A dog bites a man!

199
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,540
A man bites a dog!

200
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:25,706
Shit!

201
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,996
Just one more sentence.

202
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,288
Okay.

203
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,325
How's your computer virus?

204
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,961
Almost killed.

205
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,623
When can
I start reading your new book?

206
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,668
There is no new book, can't you tell

207
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,455
Shit Alex,
are as out of it as your father

208
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,708
You don't know my father.

209
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,168
I have spent every single day

210
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,041
in the same room with that man

211
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,036
since he showed up here
a month ago.

212
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,746
Alex, it's impossible.

213
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,670
He has taken over my work room,

214
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,501
I just don't have the space to think.

215
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,955
Not enough space?

216
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,458
In China,

217
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,873
this house is big enough for
four families.

218
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,620
Sure, but they'd speak the
same language

219
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,170
so they could talk to each other.

220
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,331
Alex he hasn't learned one word
of English.

221
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,998
And what about you?

222
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,461
What have you done

223
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,253
but making fun of him,
treating him with disrespect?

224
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,535
Alex, I've tried.

225
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,576
I'm his only son.
What do you want me to do?

226
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,786
You could consider moving into
a bigger place.

227
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:30,916
We can afford it.

228
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,751
No.

229
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,580
I don't see why we have to
pay for his insurance,

230
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,328
letting him eat us out of
house and home

231
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,498
when we can't accept a little loan
from my mother.

232
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,615
It's not a little loan,

233
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,830
it's a bride,

234
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,708
a big bride,

235
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,043
and you know it.

236
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,713
You look a little freaked out here.

237
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,205
Come on, let's go to bed.

238
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,371
Good night, Alex.

239
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,083
Honestly, Linda,
I don't know why we're here.

240
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,538
Come on, let's explore.

241
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,171
Father and the son.

242
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,621
Father.

243
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,460
Mom.

244
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,168
M for mom...

245
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,001
Mom.

246
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,285
Mother.

247
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:31,120
Son.

248
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,075
Punch.

249
00:26:58,958 --> 00:26:59,828
Sweep.

250
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,955
Step back.

251
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,666
CoIlect a cloud.

252
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,455
Hook.

253
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:08,495
Step out.

254
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,208
Single whip.

255
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,615
Raise hands and step up.

256
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,173
Lean.

257
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,580
White crane spreads its wing.

258
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,790
Left hand ward off,

259
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,206
and right hand attack.

260
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,868
Excuse me,
are you the instructor here?

261
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,208
My name is Chen.

262
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,463
I teach the cooking class.

263
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,333
Could you please do me a favor?

264
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,078
What is your name?

265
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:41,828
Chu.

266
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,828
Master Chu.

267
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,118
Please, we're all friends here.

268
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,710
Don't call me master.

269
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:47,958
Mr. Chu.

270
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,753
I don't know what our principal
is thinking,

271
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,915
my class is making dumplings,

272
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,001
half-done.

273
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,955
Some workmen just came
in to do some repairs,

274
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,171
and we have to leave.

275
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,291
I see you have plenty of space here,

276
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,826
Could we move in?

277
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:03,868
Just this once?

278
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,671
Dumplings can be moved in,

279
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,041
but they can't be moved out.

280
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,576
We've also got scallion pancakes
and spring roIIs!

281
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,923
Come on, let's help!

282
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,498
Thank you.

283
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,368
Sink your chest.

284
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,620
Stretch your back.

285
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:23,213
Imagine a string pulling up
your head.

286
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:23,963
Sink lower your body.

287
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,123
Lower.

288
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,865
Master Chu,

289
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,458
don't torture the child!

290
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,123
Look at all his weight.

291
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,540
How can he "sink his chest"?

292
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Let him help me knead the dough.

293
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:38,921
Oh, it's so difficult.

294
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,370
Mrs Chen,
next week I'll help you to make dumplings.

295
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,460
Can I be enroIled?

296
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,370
There will be
no dumplings next week,

297
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,580
but General's Tso's Special Chicken.

298
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:00,961
Master Chu,

299
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,753
would you please demonstrate

300
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,115
how to emit force with
Pushing Hands?

301
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,710
Okay,

302
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,213
let's try.

303
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:07,578
Thank you.

304
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,583
Ouch, would that hurt?

305
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,285
Master Chu, try me!

306
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:46,668
I cannot move you.

307
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,285
So your Kung Fu can only go so far!

308
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,246
Okay.

309
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:52,921
Hey!

310
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,293
Mr. Chu right there!

311
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,415
Can you take the fighting away?

312
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:57,866
Don't you see these burners

313
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,420
and the boiling water!

314
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,961
It's alright if the
heavyweight gets burned,

315
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:01,793
but if you smash the dumplings,

316
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:02,706
what should we eat then?

317
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,366
We'll eat roast pigling!

318
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,868
OK, OK!

319
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Far enough?

320
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm ready Master!

321
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,043
What! Haven't you any eyes to see!

322
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,250
Sorry, sorry!

323
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,415
I don't mean you!

324
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,251
It's your Master who wasn't looking!

325
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:46,865
Hey,

326
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,870
of all the directions,

327
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,963
why did you throw the
heavyweight on my dumplings!

328
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,123
Excellent aim!

329
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,536
Okay! No dumplings today!

330
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,616
Instead, we'll have sandy
crab scalded noodle lump soup!

331
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,460
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

332
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,665
It wasn't on purpose!

333
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,915
It was on purpose!

334
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:02,791
Are you OK?

335
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,166
It was on purpose!

336
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,171
In front of all these people sooner
or later,

337
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,831
I knew you'd show off!

338
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,578
All the skills you have learned,

339
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,328
will be shown to all the audiences.

340
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,538
Sorry, sorry!

341
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,463
Okay! Don't stand there with
a red face!

342
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,423
Let's clean up!

343
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,001
Sure.

344
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,745
Everyone helps!

345
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:21,995
No more Tai Chi Chuan!

346
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,075
We'll make dumplings!

347
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,998
Come..., did you hear that!

348
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,036
Master says no more Tai Chi!

349
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,576
Hurry up!

350
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,668
Heavyweight, wipe your face!

351
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,578
Oh my goodness,

352
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,038
what's this shape?

353
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,116
HoId on, let me see your hands.

354
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,920
Filthy!

355
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,791
Men, all of you wash your hands.

356
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:43,748
Use soap!

357
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:44,955
No dirty hands on my dumplings.

358
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:45,873
Is that clear?

359
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,670
Hurry up!

360
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,043
Mr Chu,

361
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,116
please have a seat.

362
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,290
Let the young people stand.

363
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,956
Come and have a seat.

364
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,251
Not bad.

365
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,495
Thin skin, plump stuffing, nice twist.

366
00:32:58,916 --> 00:32:59,666
It's nothing.

367
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,415
Northerners like making things
from dough.

368
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,541
Where did you come from?

369
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,286
Are you from Beijing?

370
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,166
Yes.

371
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,371
How long have you been here?

372
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,920
Just over a month.

373
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:09,746
Are you used to it here?

374
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,921
If I was,
would I be here messing around.

375
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,921
Watch what you're saying,
I'm here too.

376
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,038
I didn't mean it.

377
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,496
America is a world for young people.

378
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,330
Are you also from Beijing?

379
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,501
Do I seem like I am?

380
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,666
By your accent, yes;
by the way you look, no.

381
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:26,711
That's right.

382
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,496
I went to Taiwan

383
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,415
with my husband in 1949.

384
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,461
And Mr Chen is?

385
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,173
He is dead.

386
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,623
His name wasn't Chen.

387
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:37,668
Not long after we arrived in Taiwan,

388
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,961
he got liver cancer and passed away.

389
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,868
I'm called Mrs Chen

390
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,666
because of my second husband.

391
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,463
Oh..., and Mr. Chen?

392
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,543
He's dead too,

393
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,666
just in last year.

394
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,713
Life and death, it's fate.

395
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,043
Riches and rags are
given by the gods.

396
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,206
You just accept it.
Everything is destiny.

397
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,788
Sure, sure.

398
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:58,786
Earlier this year,

399
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,116
I left Taiwan for here with
my daughter.

400
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,170
Every Saturday,

401
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,291
I bring my granddaughter here to
study Chinese.

402
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,668
Are you used to it here?

403
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,253
How did you put it just now?

404
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,171
If I wasn't so bored at home,

405
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,621
how could your Heavyweight have
smashed that.

406
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,370
A computer couldn't have
aimed more accurately.

407
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,870
Destiny, it's all destiny.

408
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,620
That's right!

409
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,751
What a great Kung Fu!

410
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,001
What's the matter?

411
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,290
Since last year,

412
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,826
Sometimes my right
arm just gives out.

413
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,670
When I pick up
something a little heavy,

414
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,001
it's out of control...,

415
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,495
it's useless.

416
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,705
Have you seen a doctor?

417
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,833
Yes.

418
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,118
Chinese doctors, western doctors,

419
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,370
accupressure, acupuncture,

420
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,830
herbal remedies, shots, medicine.

421
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,208
I've tried everything

422
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,713
but getting a spell cast on me.

423
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,081
I'm just oId.

424
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,748
Mrs Chen,
I don't want to sound like a self-promoter

425
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,415
but practicing Tai Chi will
heal your arm.

426
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,081
Okay, give me a break!

427
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,040
Haven't I suffered enough in this life.

428
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,116
Practice!

429
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,250
I am not that stupid.

430
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,455
When you practice Tai Chi,

431
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,043
your circulation and energy will flow.

432
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,786
I've let go, I'm not hoIding on.

433
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,365
Energy must be released,

434
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,750
cannot be practiced.

435
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,205
When its released there's no tension,

436
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,963
and one feels at ease.

437
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:55,791
What's up?

438
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,246
The review, I can't find it.

439
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:16,206
When you arrive at oId age,
everything is quiet.

440
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:21,921
There the gentle wind
passes through the pine forest.

441
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,251
Fifteen minutes to practice.

442
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:23,615
Okay.

443
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,460
When the moon is rising and
shining on the mountain.

444
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,043
I only want to go to
the familiar forest.

445
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,995
I reply with
a simple fisherman's song.

446
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,248
Alex?

447
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,620
Yes?

448
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,455
Where can we mount
Chinese calligraphy in NY?

449
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,831
Who's the present for?

450
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:45,708
You know, last week,

451
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,623
I smashed Mrs Chen's dumplings.

452
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,830
I was so embarrassed,

453
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,786
and I want to give her this.

454
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,286
I'm just afraid she'll laugh at
my calligraphy.

455
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,616
C come on, Dad,

456
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,076
we know you're good.

457
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,706
What's the matter?

458
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,368
They've ignored the book.

459
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,368
Just pretended that it doesn't exist.

460
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:04,825
It will be in the next week.

461
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:05,956
What's the matter with her?

462
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,253
There is no review of her book.

463
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,038
Just tell her,

464
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,246
years from now,
we'll all be lying peacefully underground.

465
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,915
What's the big deal?

466
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,328
Dad, when're we going?

467
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,075
OK!

468
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,210
What is it?

469
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,003
A stomach cramp or something.

470
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:25,955
Nothing important.

471
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,543
Do you want to
lie down on the couch?

472
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,246
What's wrong with her?

473
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,415
A stomach cramp.

474
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,751
Let me take a look,

475
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:40,915
make her lie down.

476
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,785
Dad said he wants to take a look at it.

477
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:45,996
He knows this kind of thing.

478
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:46,825
He does?

479
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,668
Yes, he is an expert.

480
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,786
She's too nervous,
something's wrong with her stomach.

481
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,500
You are too tight.

482
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,915
Thanks for letting me know.

483
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,421
Tell her to relax.

484
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:06,958
Just relax.

485
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,495
What happened!

486
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,365
Mom!

487
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,250
What happened!

488
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:33,921
Relax!

489
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:34,961
Oh my God! Get away from me!

490
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:35,963
What did you do to her!

491
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:36,503
Her stomach's bleeding!

492
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,285
Quick get her to the hospital!

493
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:40,791
I want to go too.

494
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:41,616
Jeremy, be good.

495
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,288
You broke Mama.

496
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,251
Jeremy wants a goIdfish, right?

497
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,365
Here's a big tail,

498
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,918
big eyes,

499
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,121
thick lips.

500
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,538
And wings.

501
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,540
What's Martha's condition?

502
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,956
She has to stay in the hospital for
her bleeding stomach.

503
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,503
How's Mommy?

504
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,415
Yes?

505
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,873
Mommy is all right,
and she just needs a little rest.

506
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,918
I didn't do anything to her,

507
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,581
but she did it to herself.

508
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,003
I know that.

509
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,833
Can I go to the hospital with you?

510
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,536
Dad.

511
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:54,286
Is this the calligraphy you
want matted?

512
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,958
Go and take care of Martha,
and just leave alone.

513
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,998
Can I have some macaroni and
cheese please?

514
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,080
Wait until Sunday when
your mother comes home, all right?

515
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:54,918
Hi, Master Chu.

516
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,171
Hello everyone.

517
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,121
Master Chu, they toId me that
your kung-fu is great.

518
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,540
Last week, you sent Mr.
Sung flying by barely touching him.

519
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,916
And threw the fatty Zhao on
the dumplings, too.

520
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,083
I am flattered.

521
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:07,958
Where is Mrs Chen?

522
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,463
I don't know.
She is not teaching anymore.

523
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,043
Now I am the teacher.

524
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,371
Not teaching anymore? Yes.

525
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,960
Why? I don't know.

526
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,373
Maybe you can ask them.

527
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:19,416
Their family changes to
the school in north.

528
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:20,541
If you want to find her,

529
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,456
you can ask the principal about
her telephone number

530
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,120
OK, I will go for my class.

531
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,621
No General Tso's Special Chicken
today?

532
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,618
There is no left cock or right hen,

533
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,170
but the "Stoky Rice" today.

534
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,326
"Stoky Rice"?

535
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,540
Yes,

536
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:37,746
"Stoky Rice".

537
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,415
Oh yes, STICKY RICE.

538
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,456
Hey, will you throw the fatty Zhao
on our sticky rice?

539
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,035
Alex, will you make a call for me?

540
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,463
What's that?

541
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,213
Mrs Chen's family doesn't come
here any more.

542
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,963
And calligraphy is mounted,

543
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:28,373
we should contact and
send it to them.

544
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,038
It's their answer machine.

545
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,116
Yici Chen, this is Alex Chu.

546
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,670
My Dad has a present to
give your mother.

547
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,291
Give us a call when you are back

548
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,116
at 287-0425.

549
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,080
Thanks.

550
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,415
How can you talk like that?

551
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:51,828
Like what?

552
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,538
Enough! I won't go to
the hospital with you to see Martha.

553
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,116
Take me home to wait for the call.

554
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,710
Relax, they're not going anywhere.

555
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,870
I can't communicate with Martha.

556
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,080
You'll be there for hours,

557
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,751
and all I can do is stare at ceiling.

558
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:05,035
Okay.

559
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,955
Hey mister, don't make fun of me!

560
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,960
I never make fun of any one.

561
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,620
What's that?

562
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,170
A grenade!!

563
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,998
Hello, yes, it is Mr. Chu speaking.

564
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,040
Yes? Mrs Chen?

565
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:45,748
Why weren't you at school?

566
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,285
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

567
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,960
Oh, no, please don't listen to my kid.
What a nonsense!

568
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,623
It's not a present.

569
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:58,003
I'm still embarrassed about last week

570
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,205
that I just messed your class up.

571
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,543
Ok. How about this?

572
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,040
Tomorrow at 11:00 am,

573
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,616
my son will pick his wife up
from the hospital.

574
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,870
We'll come by at 10:30 am,

575
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,500
does that work?

576
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,205
Yes?

577
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,543
Its' nothing serious,

578
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,366
she has a small stomach problem.

579
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,116
Then we make the appointment.

580
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:30,206
Fine,

581
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,793
see you tomorrow.

582
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,165
Hello, Uncle Chu!

583
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:03,751
Sorry for bothering.

584
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,415
Not at all, welcome!

585
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,791
Mom, they are here.

586
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:07,873
How are you, Yici?

587
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,535
Hi Jeremy.

588
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,326
Hi Yi-yi.

589
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,538
Why are you all guarding the door?

590
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,746
Come in.

591
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:14,365
Maybe next time,

592
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,080
we've got to get to
the hospital to pick up my wife.

593
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:17,668
Oh, you can't be late then.

594
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:18,791
Is your wife all right?

595
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,541
What am I talking about!

596
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,206
She is getting out of the hospital.

597
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,253
Mr Chu, how are you?

598
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:28,456
Good. Mrs Chen,

599
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,373
is there a cooking class at
your new school?

600
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,245
Not until I showed up.

601
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:36,995
There's a Kung Fu class too.

602
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,865
But it's only Karate.

603
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,870
Their Momentum is stronger than
Tai Chi Chuan.

604
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,750
But they can't throw people
as far as you can.

605
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,285
And they don't perform
as handsome as you do.

606
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,456
Much worse.

607
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,793
Dad, we better get going.

608
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:53,826
We planned for you to
stay for dinner,

609
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,328
and we even went food shopping
for that,

610
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,788
but you've got to get to the hospital,

611
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:57,616
So maybe next time.

612
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,040
Thanks and bye.

613
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,920
Uh, you stopped by today to?

614
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:09,371
Ah! I forget.

615
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,035
You shouldn't have. Thank you.

616
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:12,996
I'm going to hang it up right away.

617
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:14,865
It's nothing.

618
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,670
Drive carefully!

619
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,001
Bye. Good bye!

620
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,043
What's the rush!

621
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,286
We didn't even get the scroII open!

622
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,416
Thanks!

623
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,168
Toothache?

624
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,213
I thought there is
not much you can do,

625
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,003
a lot of problems for sure you have.

626
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:48,206
Mr Philips called.

627
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,923
Jeremy received the
lowest reading scores

628
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:51,791
in the gifted class again.

629
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,746
That schooI is
too distracting for him.

630
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,205
No Alex,
we're too distracting for him.

631
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,873
He's only responding to
the atmosphere at home.

632
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,210
Then change it!

633
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:10,168
What's your problem?

634
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,041
I ain't got any problem.

635
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:12,416
Get back in the car, Alex!

636
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:13,171
You get back in the car lady!

637
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:13,791
Shut up!

638
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,581
Great!

639
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,208
Martha?

640
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,253
What do you want?

641
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,325
I wanna go for a walk.

642
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:37,578
A walk?

643
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,078
I don't know.

644
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,998
I don't want to see if you get lost.

645
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:41,825
Smoking.

646
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,078
You know,
in a way I'm kind of baby sitting you.

647
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,958
I'll just hang around, won't go too far.

648
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,503
I'll just hang around,

649
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,035
won't go too far.

650
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,826
All right. Go ahead.

651
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
What do I care.

652
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,538
Oh Jeremy. Where'd you get those.

653
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:09,916
Teddy gave them to me.

654
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:10,751
That's disgusting!

655
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:11,705
Wel, I go put them away.

656
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,791
Go on. Go get yourself cleaned up.

657
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,043
Dad.

658
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:26,705
What're you looking for?

659
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,213
Dad. Where is he?

660
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh no.

661
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:30,751
Where is he?

662
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:16,618
Is he back?

663
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,170
No.

664
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,750
Did you check with the police?

665
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,540
Alex, I'm sorry.

666
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,496
I should've been more careful.

667
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,825
But I'm...,

668
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:44,918
with the book...

669
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:46,418
In some ways,

670
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:47,671
your father is more and more like

671
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,001
a child cooped up here with me.

672
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,285
And I can't talk to him.

673
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,998
I was trying to write.

674
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,956
I had a feeling that
he was gonna get himself lost

675
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:01,211
just like a kid rying to
get some attention.

676
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:04,866
I grew up in believing

677
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,870
you should care for your parents

678
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,750
the way they care for you.

679
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,035
My father is a part of me.

680
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,866
Why can't you accept that.

681
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,541
I know.

682
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,706
I tried.

683
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,618
Just leave me alone.

684
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,420
Oh my god. You've found him.

685
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,671
Thanks God, he's safe and sound.

686
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,371
We're looking for Mr chu.

687
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,960
Alex is still out looking for his father.

688
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,083
I'm his wife.

689
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,245
Okay. Mr Chu,

690
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,825
you take care of yourself. All right?

691
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,538
Thank you very much officers.

692
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,956
Alex is still out looking for you.

693
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,253
Are you hungry?

694
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,206
Thirsty?

695
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,620
You really should eat something.

696
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:46,788
I'm sorry too.

697
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,211
Alex is furious.

698
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,081
Jesus.

699
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,918
How did you get so drunk?

700
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:09,828
Dad, where did you go?

701
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:11,288
I was just walking around

702
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,366
and I lost sight of the church steeple,

703
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,420
my landmark.

704
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:17,538
Policemen brought him back
two hours ago.

705
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,210
You're back, that's good.

706
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:07,366
What are you doing?

707
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,000
Nothing.

708
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,535
I won't bump this wall,

709
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:11,666
if I know this wall isn't thick.

710
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,210
What're you doing? Stop it!

711
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:17,708
Mom?

712
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,710
Calm down.

713
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:30,075
Jeremy, Dad isn't feeling well,

714
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,668
he'll be all right.

715
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,331
Let me talk him.

716
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,123
Jeremy,

717
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:38,575
Dad banged his head by accident.

718
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,118
Do you need a band aid!

719
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:40,870
Okay.

720
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:49,538
Jeremy.

721
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,330
Only Jeremy is good.

722
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,665
Jeremy cares for me better than
Mommy and Grandpa do.

723
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,458
I haven't seen you that drunk since

724
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:25,833
the night we've got married.

725
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:27,748
That drunk?

726
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:28,495
Yeah.

727
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,583
Well, my head is clear now.

728
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:33,958
What're you mumbling about?

729
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,330
I've made up my mind already.

730
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:38,535
About what?

731
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,538
The oId man has got to go.

732
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,708
I'll send him to
an oId people's apartment.

733
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,116
Are you sure?

734
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,418
I really don't have too much choice,
do l?

735
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,415
I'll go tell him right now.

736
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,665
Come in.

737
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:39,118
Dad, why didn't you get up and
exercise today?

738
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:44,538
Aren't you feeling well?

739
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:48,291
What's wrong?

740
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,078
I was being outside
too long last night,

741
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,078
so maybe I catch a coId for that.

742
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,788
I'm going to call a doctor.

743
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,746
You've got
important business at work,

744
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,825
don't waste your time on me.

745
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:05,616
Come on, dad,

746
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,080
cut it out!

747
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,538
You're never sick,

748
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,286
if you don't feel well,
it must be serious.

749
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,116
I'm going to call a doctor.

750
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:14,576
Why get sick now?

751
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,791
The vital organs are not in harmony.

752
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:17,666
The circulation's blocked.

753
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,711
That's why one is sick.

754
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,538
Dad, Ma's been gone for
so many years,

755
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:47,456
and you've never wanted to
look at her picture.

756
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,500
I couldn't face her.

757
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:52,793
Do you remember this scar!?

758
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,170
When the red guards came to
our house,

759
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:00,293
they knew that they couldn't hurt me,

760
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,921
so they took it out on you and
your mother.

761
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,496
I only had this one body!

762
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:08,245
In protecting you,
I couldn't protect your mother.

763
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,830
When they finally stopped
their beating,

764
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,708
she was too gravely injured to
survive.

765
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:14,325
In this one life,

766
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,665
I can never face your mother again,

767
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:17,711
but I can face you!

768
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,170
Dad,

769
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,708
It's been so many years,

770
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,293
why talk about it now?

771
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,115
I feel stifled.

772
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,786
Let me tell you something,

773
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,286
comparing to loneliness,

774
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,326
persecution is easy.

775
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:34,618
Look at how much hardship and
injustice

776
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:39,043
I've endured in the last 40 years,

777
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,041
their tortures only inspired me

778
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,170
to perfect my Kung Fu.

779
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
To study the
"Soft Internal Style of Strength",

780
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:52,285
we pursue the state with the loss of
tension,

781
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,956
so we can attain concentration.

782
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:58,043
And from that one,
we achieve carefree,

783
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:02,168
then this is nearly impossible to
be upgraded.

784
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:06,291
Sure, the surface is always easier.

785
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:07,166
Go on,

786
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,366
don't bullshit me!

787
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,498
I'll go call a doctor.

788
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:20,041
Do me a favor and call the
Chinese schooI principal

789
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,166
tell him that I can't teach the class
on Saturday.

790
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,576
Okay. You'll go when you're better.

791
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,668
I'm not going anymore.

792
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,251
Why?

793
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:32,115
The students always want me to
show off. I hate that.

794
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,420
Then what will you do on
the weekends?

795
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:38,171
Why don't we change to
that schooI north of here?

796
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,541
You mean with Mrs Chen?

797
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:40,786
No!

798
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:44,076
They say it'll be good for
Jeremy's studies.

799
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,958
I heard they're much stricter.

800
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,290
How about it?

801
01:06:57,666 --> 01:06:59,036
So did you tell him?

802
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,206
He's sick. Caught a coId from
last night.

803
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:02,083
I couldn't tell him.

804
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,458
I hope it's not serious.

805
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,210
No, I don't think so.

806
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,245
But I'd better take him to the doctor.

807
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:10,793
I've got a great idea

808
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,076
about what to do with him

809
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,578
without hurting anyone's feelings.

810
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,373
What's that?

811
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,366
Just be patient.

812
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,040
Promise me,
you'll be nice to him for the time being.

813
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:25,706
Okay?

814
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,963
Go on.

815
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,075
You have something to do?

816
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:40,496
Nothing.

817
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,165
Then why do you keep looking
at your watch?

818
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:43,998
Nothing.

819
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,373
Hello?

820
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,578
Oh... yes... Yici.

821
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,213
How's the picnic?

822
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,003
Sorry for bothering you.

823
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:03,288
...yes,

824
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,166
it's great weather,

825
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,831
and it is a pity if you don't go picnic.

826
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,753
Unfortunately, he doesn't have
much energy now.

827
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,325
If he got sick again,

828
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:10,328
it'll be trouble.

829
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,423
Maybe we should let him to
have some rest.

830
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:13,871
Okay.

831
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,455
Say thank you to Chen Mama for me.

832
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:17,673
Okay? That's it.

833
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,581
Don't hang up,

834
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,038
Don't hang up, hoId on.

835
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:22,326
Who said that I'm sick?

836
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:24,288
I didn't say sick, I said energy.

837
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,326
"No energy" means that
you need to get out!

838
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:31,708
Yici,

839
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,253
my father says he's fine,

840
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,615
he'd like to get some exercise.

841
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,670
Let's do it by the same plan.

842
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:37,791
Yes.

843
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:40,621
Okay.

844
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,080
That's settled then.

845
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:43,083
Bye.

846
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,043
Right.

847
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:47,923
How can it be healthy to
stay home all the time!

848
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,791
That's how you get sick!

849
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:09,076
Ma, I've already had two.

850
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:09,868
Have more!

851
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:11,826
Here YiYi.

852
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:12,618
Thank you.

853
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,420
Kids should eat more.

854
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:17,421
Jeremy?

855
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,711
No, thank you.

856
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,670
Have more!

857
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,211
Help yourself, don't worry about him.

858
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:23,205
Have another piece.

859
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:23,793
No..., thank you.

860
01:09:23,916 --> 01:09:25,036
Listen to me, there's lots of meat,

861
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,036
and there's no point in saving it.

862
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,373
I have to
leave some room for tonight.

863
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,115
It's only the middle of the day,

864
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,040
and a man shouldn't worry for this.

865
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:33,996
Come on!

866
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,745
I haven't eaten since
yesterday morning.

867
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,245
I'm preparing for
the dinner you're cooking tonight.

868
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,955
He is a stupid one.

869
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:40,583
Nonsense!

870
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:41,248
Here.

871
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:42,791
Please let me have it.

872
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,166
He's reaching middle age,

873
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:44,921
he's afraid of fat,

874
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,251
cholesteroI, and high blood pressure.

875
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,250
Ma, again?

876
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:54,871
Yes, damn it.

877
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,120
Can you give me a little massage.

878
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,120
Let me take a look.

879
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,460
How can I let you do that?

880
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,333
It's okay.

881
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:15,711
Did you find the spot?

882
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,123
This is troublesome.

883
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,673
If it's trouble, leave it alone.

884
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:19,421
Noop,

885
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:22,121
The Chi in your Bladder Meridian
is too strong,

886
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,710
but the blood is too weak.

887
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:27,423
This kind of problem is called
"Mid-Spring Paralysis".

888
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:31,501
Now try to move the pinky toe on
your left foot.

889
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:38,371
Did you feel that subtle pain?

890
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:41,043
So, I was right.

891
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:43,036
When this illness gets serious,

892
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,916
you'll get a spasm under your knee,
sore waist,

893
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,121
your back will give out,
your neck will tense up,

894
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,460
you won't be able to lift your arm,

895
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,673
and your muscles will be stretched

896
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,791
between your armpits in
one tight knot.

897
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,333
Enough!

898
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,538
Stop! Once you keep diagnosing,

899
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,496
all my internal organs will be shown!

900
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,325
Let me see.

901
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,918
It's her right shoulder that's stiff.

902
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,001
He knows!

903
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,825
He was rubbing your left hand.

904
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:07,958
Shush!

905
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:30,923
It's burning.

906
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:31,961
Burning?

907
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,213
Your meat, on the barbeque.

908
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,670
Why don't you pay attention to
your own business?

909
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:40,958
Mr Chu, thank you.

910
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:43,123
I've just begun.

911
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,205
You've got a complicated problem.

912
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,793
It would take over a year of
treatment to get results.

913
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,866
What a bother! Okay,
don't break me apart.

914
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,495
Jeremy, let's go play frisbee.

915
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,575
Oh goody, goody

916
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,458
I want to look too.

917
01:11:58,833 --> 01:11:59,503
Don't got too far,

918
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,035
you hear me?

919
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:00,866
Okay.

920
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,750
Mr. Chu,
your Kung Fu is so powerful,

921
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,915
how do you manage to
have such elegant calligraphy?

922
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,035
I'm ashamed to talk about it.

923
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,496
My grandfather was
a Ching Dynasty Scholar,

924
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:24,325
my father was one of
the Nation Founders

925
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:27,288
who's in charge of
the Nationalist government.

926
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:30,326
My son is a PhD in computer science.

927
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,038
In the middle of this line,

928
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,706
there's worthless me.

929
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,121
Fate and circumstances

930
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,000
pushed me to spend my life

931
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,205
on practicing martial arts.

932
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:43,543
You shouldn't say that.

933
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:49,043
I had poor health when I was a kid.

934
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:51,365
I'm an only son.

935
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,330
My family was worried.

936
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,828
They took one of the doctor's advice

937
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:01,075
and made me practicing Kung Fu.

938
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,918
I couldn't take the rough styles,

939
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,581
I could only take the
gentle styles like Tai Chi Chuan.

940
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:15,580
Who would have thought that
a couple years later,

941
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,368
I was completely vigorous and healthy.

942
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,248
At 30,

943
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:24,325
I won a national Tai Chi Pushing
Hands Championship.

944
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,503
Exercising the body and
teaching students,

945
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,205
that's a relatively simple,

946
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:30,083
trouble-free life.

947
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,168
Trouble-free?

948
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,423
Since the communist liberation,
I've suffered all the pains.

949
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,581
Let's not talk about it.

950
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,458
When it comes to eaching students,

951
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,003
it has also hurt me so much.

952
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:42,995
Oh..., yes,

953
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,785
have you gone back to see

954
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,456
your oId home and
relatives since Taiwan loosened up?

955
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,621
Two years ago,

956
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,083
I went back but
I don't have any close relative

957
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:51,918
but just some nieces and nephews.

958
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:55,415
Still, a reunion with your family,

959
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:59,213
it must have been a happy time.

960
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,003
Not really.

961
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:03,963
When I left,

962
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,213
they were not born yet.

963
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,918
I felt like Santa Claus,

964
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,035
giving so many gifts.

965
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:11,326
There's no fun at all.

966
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,615
Beijing seemed to have

967
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,170
lost its flavor,

968
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:17,711
The oId warmth was gone.

969
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,873
But I was very young when
I left 40 years ago,

970
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,710
maybe my memories are mistaken,

971
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,083
anyways,

972
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,868
I don't know what to
say but everything seemed unreal,

973
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,500
I couldn't put my oId and
new impression together.

974
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,078
Mr. Chen,

975
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:34,793
Your impressions are not mistaken.

976
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:36,791
Beijing has changed a lot.

977
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:38,621
Is that so?

978
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,365
I feel closer when talking with you

979
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,500
than talking with
my neighbors in Beijing.

980
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,205
Really?

981
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:49,421
Relax, don't move.

982
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:17,458
Mom, you're still in one piece.

983
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:18,955
Child!

984
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,575
Dad, we're going to
take the kids up the hill.

985
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,790
Don't go too far, you hear me?

986
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:23,326
Okay.

987
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:25,831
Don't leave us here!

988
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:26,828
I'm going with you.

989
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:27,998
It's a steep climb.

990
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,285
You won't make it.

991
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,286
I'll take it slow.

992
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:33,666
Let's get everything cleaned up

993
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:36,171
and put in the car.

994
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,920
Mrs Chen,
let the young foIks go ahead.

995
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,331
You take it slow.

996
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,036
No, I'm fine.

997
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,918
How come your son-in-law
didn't come today?

998
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,535
Gone... gone... a... way
on bus... business.

999
01:15:59,291 --> 01:15:59,921
If he weren't away...,

1000
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,921
we wouldn't have you over for dinner.

1001
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,420
Don't mention him!

1002
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:06,081
He makes me angry.

1003
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,670
What about your daughter-in-law?

1004
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,373
We have almost the same story here.

1005
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,788
Chen Mama,
it's too much for you, let's go down.

1006
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,036
Ah, Ah..., shut up, just keep going.

1007
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:40,496
Grandma!

1008
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,825
Grandpa!

1009
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,538
Don't run so fast, wait for me.

1010
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:07,920
Hey!

1011
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,956
The young people are so energetic.

1012
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:16,963
They can't slow down,

1013
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,616
just let them go ahead.

1014
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,960
I'll climb slowly with you.

1015
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,293
Why not sit down and rest a bit?

1016
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,920
I'm old and useless.

1017
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,501
No one wants me.

1018
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,873
We're out for fun,
why get mad at the kids?

1019
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,211
How can you be so
developed in Kung Fu

1020
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,123
but have no insight?

1021
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:43,920
They set us up,

1022
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:44,961
can't you tell this?

1023
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:45,870
Set us up?

1024
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,331
Your precious son

1025
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:49,788
came to our house last week

1026
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,036
and arranged for my daughter.

1027
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,415
He asked my daughter to
call and invit you.

1028
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,213
They thought that I was taking a nap,

1029
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,753
but actually I heard everything.

1030
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:00,665
Can't it be?

1031
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:01,541
It cen't be?

1032
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,116
At our age,

1033
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,116
why don't we have any self-respect,

1034
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,170
but letting those
two children manipulate us?

1035
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:11,996
What's this for?

1036
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:17,826
Devalue me for my oId and useless.

1037
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,366
Son, thank you for your kindness

1038
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,750
trying to fix me up with Mrs Chen.

1039
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,575
But we still have our pride.

1040
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,918
No need to drive oId persons out.

1041
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:39,791
I have the sense to leave on my own.

1042
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,116
You know the oId saying that

1043
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,920
"It's easier to struggle together

1044
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:44,501
than to pass happy days together."

1045
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:46,035
I've never imagined that

1046
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:49,326
this would apply to
us father and the son.

1047
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,958
How many difficult times in China,

1048
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:56,923
we could overcome challenges
happily together.

1049
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:59,541
But here in US with so
many fine-material things,

1050
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:02,456
it seems there's no place in
your home for me.

1051
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,120
Comparing the two,

1052
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:08,000
I can't help but recall the days

1053
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,665
when you were a small lovely boy.

1054
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:12,371
Don't look for me.

1055
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Enjoy your life with your family.

1056
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,785
I wish you all the best.

1057
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,916
If you have time,

1058
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:23,001
send my regards to Mrs.
Chen and her daughter.

1059
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,865
The world is so big,

1060
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,080
how can't one find
a little corner for him?

1061
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,578
I'll rent a little room,

1062
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,618
so I can spend my worthless oId age.

1063
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,210
Life passes before
one's eyes like smoke,

1064
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,463
so one shouldn't set his heart
on anything.

1065
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:38,171
Father.

1066
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:45,748
Hurry up!

1067
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:51,665
Thank you, come again.

1068
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:53,665
Bye-bye.

1069
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:05,956
Please wash the bowls faster.

1070
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:06,673
If I can't put out the soup,

1071
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:07,921
my other dishes can't go out.

1072
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:08,961
I'll wash you a bowl first,

1073
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:09,873
then the dishes.

1074
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,670
Sorry.

1075
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:13,786
Thanks.

1076
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,173
Old Chu, I beg you, please do it faster.

1077
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,251
Coming, coming.

1078
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,578
Why do you keep sending out
the take-away orders?

1079
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,668
There's guests at the tables with
nothing to eat!

1080
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,001
And a line around the block!

1081
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:29,995
Boss, we can't put out the
food without dishes!

1082
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,496
Yesterday at the employment agency,

1083
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,205
you said you had experience!

1084
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,003
More or less, I am getting used to it.

1085
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:39,365
I'm running a business to make money,

1086
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,620
not to invite you for the free lunch!

1087
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,500
What do you mean more or less?

1088
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,325
This is less!

1089
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,498
Yeah, yeah, don't get mad,
I'm hurrying.

1090
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:47,666
Soak the plates with
solid-honey in hot water.

1091
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,171
Don't just scrape them!

1092
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:51,081
You break the plate,

1093
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:51,918
you pay for it!

1094
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:52,831
Yes.

1095
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:53,538
Boss,

1096
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,326
can you please do us a favor?

1097
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,368
How about not selling those
stupid honey banana balls?

1098
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,670
It's hard for us to make and
hard for him to wash.

1099
01:20:58,791 --> 01:20:59,501
Not worth it.

1100
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,165
I'll decide if it's worthy or not!

1101
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,581
If you don't do it,

1102
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:03,868
others will!

1103
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:06,503
Come on,
it's just a good hearted suggestion.

1104
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,615
Thanks!

1105
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,868
What are
you three guys stuck here for?

1106
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:10,746
Waiting for bowls.

1107
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,575
Can't you do
something else while you are waiting?

1108
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:13,868
Are you brain dead.

1109
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,330
There's nothing else to do!

1110
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,578
Are the
Mu Shu Pork pancakes steamed?

1111
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:17,328
In the steamer.

1112
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:18,288
Sauteed Minced Pigeon with
Sliced Vegetables?

1113
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,456
Vegetables are soaked.

1114
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,670
The wontons are boiling,

1115
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,251
the orders are taken,

1116
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,035
the tables are cleared,

1117
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:24,036
the checks are paid.

1118
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,420
Chu,

1119
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,790
here's today's pay.

1120
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,245
Thank you.

1121
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:05,173
It doesn't work.

1122
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,421
Don't come tomorrow,

1123
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:07,961
I'll find someone else.

1124
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,456
Boss he's going okay now.

1125
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,040
There were enough dishes.

1126
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,205
And there is no problem when
taking orders.

1127
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,616
What do you mean "enough dishes",
"no problem"?

1128
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,115
It was only after the dinner rush hour

1129
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,080
that things returned to normal.

1130
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,623
Don't be pleading for
him because he's oId.

1131
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,168
Lots of young guys would fight for
the chance

1132
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,081
to make 700 doIlars a
month washing dishes.

1133
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:30,708
Why should I have an oId man?

1134
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:31,873
I'm not running an nursing home.

1135
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Are you kidding?

1136
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,995
Boss, please give me one more chance.

1137
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,575
We all have to start, right?

1138
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,826
Okay, okay. One more chance.

1139
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,118
Thank you.

1140
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,415
Is Sargeant Warren there?

1141
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,456
It's Alex Chu...

1142
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,665
Yes.

1143
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:20,165
No?

1144
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:26,825
Thanks Sargeant.

1145
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:27,668
Bye bye.

1146
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,785
Linda?

1147
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,576
It's Alex.

1148
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:52,668
Let's have a talk...

1149
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,960
...about the house.

1150
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,536
Hey, congratulations on your review:

1151
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,866
"A boId new voice in women's fiction"

1152
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,040
Better late then never.

1153
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,866
I'm proud of you,

1154
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,540
although,
it makes me feel like I should quit my job

1155
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,746
and become a painter.

1156
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,173
In the meantime, all I do is eat.

1157
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,211
Maybe you're pregnant.

1158
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:21,753
Sure, if you believe in
immaculate conception.

1159
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:23,916
You know,

1160
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,671
I'm even thinking of going to
my high schooI reunion

1161
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,751
to see if there are
any aging jocks sill available.

1162
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:28,705
Oh, Linda!

1163
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,535
Well, at least I have my work.

1164
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:33,958
How's yours coming?

1165
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,248
Two chapters this week.

1166
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,995
Oh, more travails of
study pioneer women.

1167
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:40,365
Actually,
I've written in a Chinese family.

1168
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,250
The father brought over

1169
01:26:41,375 --> 01:26:42,535
to work on the railroads.

1170
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:45,116
Don't tell me you miss the oId geezer?

1171
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:46,285
Of course not.

1172
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:47,786
Runaway Grandpa.

1173
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,916
I'm gonna have nightmares for
the rest of my life

1174
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:50,921
imagining his face every morning

1175
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,961
on the side of my milk cartons.

1176
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,123
It's sad.

1177
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:55,745
And Alex...

1178
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:57,115
He blames you, does he?

1179
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:59,460
No, he's just anxious...,

1180
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,623
and I blame myself.

1181
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,746
Ah! Li, how can I let you do this?

1182
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,495
You'd better do your own work,

1183
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:12,615
Don't worry about me.

1184
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,330
Hurry up, once I get busy,

1185
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:16,328
I won't be able to help you anyway.

1186
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,078
Wu, everyone's got work to do.

1187
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:19,578
Don't treat me special.

1188
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:20,538
I can take care of myself,

1189
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:21,786
you also have works to do.

1190
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:24,668
Chu, this is for you,

1191
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:25,621
I've got someone.

1192
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,670
Boss, I've been doing all right.

1193
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,420
Eight bowls,

1194
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,751
five plates,

1195
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,115
now it's only 6:30 pm,

1196
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,960
and you even need those two to
help you.

1197
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:38,963
What will happen at 7:30?

1198
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:42,043
My guests will be
lined up outside the door?

1199
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,206
He didn't ask for help,

1200
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:44,503
we volunteered.

1201
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,325
You volunteered? Fine!

1202
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,458
He asked for help, fine!

1203
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,753
I don't care.
I can't take any risks tonight.

1204
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:49,365
Liu

1205
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:51,081
go downstairs and
get yourself an apron.

1206
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,040
Here's ten doIlars,

1207
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,916
take it or leave it.

1208
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,711
Boss, do you have to
treat an oId man this way?

1209
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:59,873
I'll wash faster.

1210
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,956
Not just faster, but cleaner too!

1211
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:05,041
Come on, cut the crap, go!

1212
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,665
Time is money.

1213
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:08,921
Have you heard that before?

1214
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,705
Probably not,
you came from Mainland China.

1215
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,370
I know everything's shared there,

1216
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,620
working more but gets you nothing.

1217
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:16,748
Four decades of
such thinking has produced

1218
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,615
all you lazy bums.

1219
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,670
Useless trash.

1220
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:22,786
Who are you calling a useless trash?

1221
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:25,831
Eh? What's wrong?
You don't accept that?

1222
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,368
Then go back to China and
live off others. Go on!

1223
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,830
No one's stopping you.

1224
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:30,828
I'm telling you,

1225
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:31,998
this is America.

1226
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,705
There's no communal property.

1227
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,713
You have to earn everything

1228
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,503
by yourself!

1229
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:39,115
You wanna be an American?
Go all the way!

1230
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,540
Buy a dishwasher to
wash faster and cleaner.

1231
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,921
Yeh! I'm offering you ten doIlars

1232
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:48,041
because I respect your age.

1233
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:50,076
I'm saving face for you,

1234
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:50,998
if you don't want that,

1235
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,115
then I'll throw you out!

1236
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,285
See if you can.

1237
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,291
Don't think I won't touch you

1238
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:58,246
because you're oId.

1239
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,206
Come try me!

1240
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,170
If you can move me half a step,

1241
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:04,121
I won't say another word,

1242
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,290
but turn and leave.

1243
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:07,416
Don't...

1244
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,463
So the oId geezer knows Kung Fu.

1245
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:17,035
No wonder you dared be
so arrogant with me!

1246
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:21,793
Li, Wu,

1247
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:22,456
help me!

1248
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:23,866
I'm not getting involved in this.

1249
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:26,075
Chang, Chien,

1250
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:26,956
get over here!

1251
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:29,833
Boss, this is none of our business.

1252
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,368
Do you want to keep working here?

1253
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:33,416
Quick!

1254
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:39,868
Old Chu,

1255
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,500
don't get angry, but we've all got

1256
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,123
families to take care of.

1257
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:45,038
We'll just move you half a step, okay?

1258
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,331
Then the business will keep going,

1259
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:47,168
and everyone will thank you.

1260
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,958
Come on, careful now.

1261
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:50,866
Come on.

1262
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:53,961
Get him!

1263
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,078
Liu, help out!

1264
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:56,918
Get him!

1265
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:00,790
Do something!

1266
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:24,251
Chu, you're a hero.
We can't move you.

1267
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,825
We brothers apologize.

1268
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:28,831
Boss Huang,

1269
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,543
we quit!

1270
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:34,121
Go find yourself some

1271
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:36,583
shameless big muscles rogues.

1272
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:38,706
I can't take this!

1273
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,418
Hey, you can't all leave!

1274
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,995
Okay!
I'm calling every employment agency!

1275
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:49,115
Don't think you'll work in
New York again!

1276
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:54,498
All right tough guy!

1277
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:55,825
The business is closed tonight.

1278
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:56,788
Think you are good?

1279
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:57,826
But I'm calling the cops on you!

1280
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,288
I don't have a green card.

1281
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,826
You hired me illegally.

1282
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:02,668
They'll fine
you three thousand doIlars first.

1283
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:03,671
I'm telling you,

1284
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:06,541
I'll move you without the cops!

1285
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:18,923
Thank you, come again.

1286
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,790
The oId bum is in the kitchen.

1287
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,616
Go and smash him!

1288
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,790
Show no mercy!

1289
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,831
Yeah, I've seen this kind before.

1290
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:17,208
Ten police officers from
the Fifth Precinct

1291
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,923
were injured earlier this evening

1292
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:21,541
in a brawl inside
a Chinatown restaurant.

1293
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:23,036
Helen Wong reports.

1294
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,370
Shirley, I'm standing in
front of the Lai Fu restaurant.

1295
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,170
The owner Frankie Huang tried to fire

1296
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:29,791
his seventy year oId dishwasher here

1297
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:30,916
earlier this evening.

1298
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,921
But Huang get more than
he bargained for

1299
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:35,501
because the man he tried to fire Mr Chu

1300
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,825
refused to leave the restaurant.

1301
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,208
Alex.

1302
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:40,043
Police said that Mr.
Chu is a Tai Chi master.

1303
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:43,916
And he let lose a hundred
thirty pounds of martial arts fury.

1304
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,831
And hurt over a dozen of
New York's finest.

1305
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:47,495
Now it appears that

1306
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:50,495
Mr Chu's being lead out of
the restaurant by the police

1307
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,365
and is being put into a squad car

1308
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,120
and taken to the precinct and
be arrested.

1309
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,500
Peporting live, Helen Wong,

1310
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,415
now back to you at the studio.

1311
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:39,211
He's been like this ever since
he came in.

1312
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,503
The entire time he has been here,

1313
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,705
he hasn't said anything

1314
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,713
nor has he eaten anything either
to drink.

1315
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,710
I tell you,

1316
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:48,793
I don't know if he's meditating or
sleeping.

1317
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:58,213
If you don't mind me saying so,
Mr Chu,

1318
01:34:58,333 --> 01:34:59,293
it's kind of depressing.

1319
01:35:06,416 --> 01:35:08,616
I'll let you go in and talk to him.

1320
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,870
Thank you, officer.

1321
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,206
Any time.

1322
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:28,501
Dad.

1323
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:41,078
Ah, attaining nothingness isn't easy.

1324
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,920
Dad, we've bought a new house,

1325
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:47,251
it's much bigger than the oId one.

1326
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:49,118
What for?

1327
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:51,581
I'm here to take you home.

1328
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:54,955
Home? Who's home?

1329
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,503
Mine is yours.

1330
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,213
Forget it. I see clearly now,

1331
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:06,205
the only thing that matters

1332
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:08,623
is that you have a happy life.

1333
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12,173
If you want to
show me some filial respect,

1334
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:17,291
rent me an apartment in Chinatown.

1335
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:19,916
Let me peacefully pass my days

1336
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:22,116
and discipline my spirit.

1337
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,421
In your free time,

1338
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:27,461
bring the boy to see me.

1339
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,250
By this way, when we get together,

1340
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,620
there'll still be some good feelings.

1341
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:36,828
Dad,

1342
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,668
all these years,

1343
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:42,748
I've studied and worked so hard

1344
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:45,115
to build a family

1345
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:46,788
in order that one day

1346
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:48,416
I could bring you to the States,

1347
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,920
so you could have some good days
in your life.

1348
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:54,206
Dad!

1349
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:10,456
Alex, can you give a hand up here?

1350
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:12,673
Okay. Coming up

1351
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,748
Is this straight?

1352
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:22,503
Lower on the left,

1353
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:24,501
yes.

1354
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:25,285
It's fine.

1355
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:26,996
Do you think he'll ever spend
a night here?

1356
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,458
Oh, yes.

1357
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:31,173
As long as Jeremy is here,
Grandpa will visit.

1358
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,041
Jeremy wants to be a Tai Chi master.

1359
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,416
Why didn't you ever learn any
Tai Chi from your father?

1360
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:36,791
You know, for Dad,

1361
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:39,456
Tai Chi was a way to
escape from reality.

1362
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:41,833
Even when he did pushing hands,

1363
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:45,038
for him, it was a way to
avoid other people.

1364
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,706
Pushing hands?

1365
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:50,583
Yeah, it's like Tai Chi for two.

1366
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:52,998
A way of keeping your balance

1367
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,955
while unbalancing your opponent.

1368
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,253
Like marriage, only kidding.

1369
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,293
Okay, you stand like this.

1370
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:01,825
Balanced?

1371
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:02,498
Yup.

1372
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,575
If you try to unbalance me,

1373
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:06,168
I simply avoid your energy

1374
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:07,961
and turn it back on you.

1375
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:14,456
Relax.

1376
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:19,578
Don't resist and don't break contact.

1377
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,710
Feel it?

1378
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:36,873
Good.

1379
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:40,211
Relax.

1380
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:41,673
Relax little, relax, squat down.

1381
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:53,618
Relax little,

1382
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,120
lower.

1383
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,581
Relax.

1384
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,328
Raise your right arm, too much,

1385
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:05,078
and look at far distance.

1386
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,213
Mrs Chen, such a long time!

1387
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,123
You've come a long way to
buy groceries.

1388
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,080
No, not far. I live in the area.

1389
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:14,916
Your daughter have moved?

1390
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,461
No, but I have.

1391
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:19,415
That's great! Living on your own,
you're free.

1392
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:21,581
You can do whatever you want.

1393
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,500
I just finished food shopping

1394
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:26,035
saw it was early,

1395
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,076
so I decided to stop by your class.

1396
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:30,118
How did you know I was
teaching here?

1397
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:32,995
Wow! Who doesn't know about
the hero oId Mr Chu,

1398
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:35,535
is famous all over Chinatown.

1399
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:37,368
The TV news showed that

1400
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,830
a gang of American police and
Chinese hoodlums

1401
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,118
were all smashed by you.

1402
01:40:41,541 --> 01:40:42,541
From what I can see,

1403
01:40:42,666 --> 01:40:44,826
if Tai Chi Chuan could be
practiced upside down,

1404
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:46,708
the ceiling of this oId age centre

1405
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,673
would be packed with your students.

1406
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,288
You're making fun of me!

1407
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:53,616
I'm speaking the truth.

1408
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,540
Did you make a fortune?

1409
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,325
No way.

1410
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,830
Every morning,

1411
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:00,368
I come here and pass the time with
the students.

1412
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,165
Anyways,

1413
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,210
we oId foIks have nothing

1414
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:06,713
but time to kill.

1415
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:07,873
That's fine.

1416
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,416
I earn my own money and

1417
01:41:09,541 --> 01:41:10,871
don't take anybody's flack.

1418
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,918
That's why I always say,

1419
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:16,081
you can't hoId everything inside.

1420
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,578
Sometimes you've got to
lose your temper

1421
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:18,618
to straighten things out.

1422
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,171
The kids are grown up.

1423
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:24,245
If we oId foIks don't take care of
ourselves,

1424
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:25,365
who will?

1425
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:27,918
You're right.

1426
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,666
Is your shoulder better?

1427
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,498
Better?

1428
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:34,583
At my age, if it doesn't get worse,

1429
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:36,168
I should thank the heavens.

1430
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:38,456
I don't know Kung Fu like you.

1431
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,170
But is it convenient living alone?

1432
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:44,043
It's all right.

1433
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:46,831
My daughter comes to visit me

1434
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:47,998
every two or three weeks.

1435
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,540
And we will go to movies,

1436
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:52,366
restaurants, or go food shoping.

1437
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,668
Uhhhh. That's good.

1438
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,371
Alex and his family do the same.

1439
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,791
You'd better take care of
your students, I'm leaving.

1440
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:14,366
When you're free, stop by.

1441
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:17,165
Sure, we're neighbors now.

1442
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:19,331
Well, please take care.

1443
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:20,955
You too.

1444
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:48,328
Mrs Chen!

1445
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:52,333
Why did you come out?

1446
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:55,115
To see if you had left.

1447
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,791
The sun is so pleasant today.

1448
01:42:58,625 --> 01:42:59,785
I was thinking that live by myself,

1449
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:02,326
I could go home or stay out,
both would be good,

1450
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:05,288
anyways, standing here,
I got lost in thoughts.

1451
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,495
Where do you live?

1452
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,290
I live in that building, room 1168.

1453
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,753
I live in that building, room 2101.

1454
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,170
Stop by for a visit sometime.

1455
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:18,713
Do you have anything to
do this afternoon?

1456
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:23,833
Uh... Nothing.

1457
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:27,208
Nothing? Nothing.

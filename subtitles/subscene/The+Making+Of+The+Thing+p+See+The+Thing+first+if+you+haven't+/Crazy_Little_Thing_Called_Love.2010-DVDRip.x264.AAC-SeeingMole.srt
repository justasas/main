1
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm fond of close up photos

2
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:25,724
because they reveal something more of

3
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,127
what we are unable to see in larger perspective.

4
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,429
When you take portrait photos,

5
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,798
what do you focus on?

6
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,792
I think I focus on the eyes.

7
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,307
You'll have to excuse me, the little one's crying.

8
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:51,913
Gosh! He's gorgeous

9
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:54,114
but too bad he has a baby already.

10
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:57,518
Hey, why are you crying? Are you hungry?

11
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,220
Are you a furious little baby?

12
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,523
You feel better now?

13
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:09,194
Everyone has special someone in their hearts.

14
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:16,400
The heart tinkles every time we think about them,

15
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:20,003
but they will always remain in our hearts.

16
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:21,405
Even though, I don't know...

17
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:25,408
how he's doing or where he is now.

18
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,614
At least, he has taught me about

19
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,216
my first love.

20
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,811
"A CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE"

21
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:13,482
No wonder why you wanna come here everyday.

22
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:17,476
What? He's got really weird scooter.

23
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,089
Hey look...

24
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,083
she's a very pretty thing!

25
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:35,401
He's gorgeous, no doubt you're so into him.

26
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:39,202
I'm not into him at all.

27
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,905
"James Bean."

28
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,875
Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.

29
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,884
Follow me.
Okay.

30
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,580
This way please.

31
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,991
Hello...

32
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,593
I wondering if you have a room for tonight.

33
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:08,294
Yes, how long are you gonna stay here?

34
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:09,196
I think 3 nights.

35
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:11,097
American breakfast.

36
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,999
Fried rice and breakfast for this table, mom.

37
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:22,073
After you're done with that table,

38
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,574
can you go to the market for me?

39
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,775
Sure, mom.

40
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:25,970
Good girl.

41
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,780
How's school dear?

42
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,083
It's going well. I'm hanging out

43
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:34,583
with my old gang, Cheer, Kie and Nim.

44
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,184
You've been with them since first grade.

45
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,987
Aren't you sick of each other already?

46
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:40,788
Well, you wouldn't have
anyone else to hang out with,

47
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,191
even if you wanted to.

48
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,693
You guys are ugly ducklings.

49
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:46,683
There...

50
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,098
Let me tell you something,

51
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,199
who we hang out with

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,667
is not all about looks you know.

53
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,570
But how you look is the first impression.

54
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,472
Good that I took after you,

55
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,574
if I looked like dad,

56
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,477
I'll never have a boyfriend.

57
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,775
There!

58
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:11,281
Enough you two,

59
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:15,084
you're too old to fight.

60
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:20,088
Don't talk like that about your father,

61
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,492
if he hears you he'll be upset.

62
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:27,452
Now go, be on your way.

63
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:33,363
He's in the states. He can't hear me.

64
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,569
You want some mangoes?

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,951
Mangoes?

66
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,467
The new seniors are so cute.

67
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:17,270
Yes, I was in all girls school since kindergarten,

68
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,871
so sick of that.

69
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:20,473
Have you got it?

70
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:23,475
Yes, mine adds up to 28.

71
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,477
25-35,

72
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,879
you're compatible with men who're leaders,

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,580
warm and kind.

74
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:33,540
Must be Tong, the Chairman of Buddhist Club.

75
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,252
Cheer got 15.

76
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,854
15-25

77
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:42,357
you're compatible with athletes, just and fair.

78
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,054
Must be Ken, the basketball player over there.

79
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:56,169
Couldn't be him.

80
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,968
Mine must be a bad boy.

81
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,874
That's quite right.

82
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,276
It must be...

83
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,878
Meaw,

84
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,540
tough guy.

85
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,649
Kie.

86
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,952
30, Nam got 30

87
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:16,654
30, you're compatible with artists,

88
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,857
unique and artistic.

89
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:22,053
Who must he be?

90
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:33,358
You seem a little down for English class.

91
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,265
Could you be a little more active like during lunch?

92
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,143
Don't smile just yet.

93
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,245
You seem to be doing well only in English.

94
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:50,048
Other subjects are so bad.

95
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,750
You little ugly duckling!

96
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:56,354
Today, we'll be studying grammar from song lyrics,

97
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,456
please pass on the paper.

98
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:04,261
His name is Shone, he's a junior.

99
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:08,255
He has quite a reputation.

100
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:12,558
Maybe it's just a rumor.

101
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:17,738
Students, if we change A to E

102
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,940
in the word 'inspiration',

103
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,934
it becomes a verb 'inspire'.

104
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,046
Two girls left the school because of him.

105
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,548
So better stay away from him.

106
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,049
You know?

107
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
Yes...

108
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,853
My friend's sister went to the same school as Shone.

109
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,853
Really?
Yes.

110
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,151
Do you think the story is true?

111
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,246
What are you guys talking about?

112
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,022
But I'm teaching...

113
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,536
Cheer.

114
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:57,038
Stand up.

115
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,032
What does 'You are the inspiration' means?

116
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,145
What does it mean?

117
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:07,147
Just moment.

118
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:10,249
You inspire me.

119
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,650
Yes...

120
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:14,552
You're the inspiration.

121
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,825
You're the inspiration.

122
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,927
Everyone is inspired by someone.

123
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:26,430
Even I'm inspired

124
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:30,132
by someone...

125
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,534
Sit down.

126
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,835
Thank you teacher.

127
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:35,337
All right.

128
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:38,340
Let's read all together now.

129
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:43,243
You are the inspiration...

130
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:44,643
Again.

131
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:06,220
Akarin, would you solve this equation, please?

132
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,229
Who did this?

133
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,434
Prof. Orn.

134
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:32,235
It's in.

135
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,504
You're good. When are you going

136
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,205
to try out for school team.

137
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,306
Playing just for fun is much better.

138
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:40,009
You're still scared? Come on let's play.

139
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,610
Shone...

140
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,612
Hey, I'll be right back.

141
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,514
Who is that girl?
Who?

142
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,712
Why is Shone talking to her?

143
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,422
Or maybe she's his ex?

144
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,926
That's not true!

145
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,724
Sorry.

146
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,912
Uncle Chang!

147
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:26,215
Mom, Nam, Uncle Chang's here.

148
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,616
Hello, we miss you so much.

149
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,519
Uncle Chang...

150
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,112
Hello, Chang.

151
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:38,425
Hey, Pang, long time no see,

152
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,292
you head still smells funky.

153
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,095
Oh, Nam? You're all grown up now,

154
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,397
I hardly recognize you.

155
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:48,500
Hey Pim, oh...

156
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,302
Hey, uncle.

157
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,102
Are you that sleepy?

158
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,304
I think it's jet lag.

159
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:56,006
I haven't adjusted to Thailand's time yet.

160
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,307
Here we go again.

161
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,707
Hey, hold it!

162
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,213
Is my dad as fat as you are?

163
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,915
Your dad is working as a sous chef.

164
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,317
He's doing all the heavy jobs,

165
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:12,019
he's very buff right now.

166
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,181
I have a photo from him to show you.

167
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:18,392
Hey, let me see.

168
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:21,088
Hey... wait.

169
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:26,598
Pim,

170
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:31,093
your man said he'll transfer more money this month.

171
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:36,597
He told me to tell you that...

172
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:39,910
I promise,

173
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:43,914
I'll pay off the mortgage of this house,

174
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:47,583
you and kids hang in there.

175
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:51,577
He should visit us sometimes.

176
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,591
He said that if one of you

177
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,492
can be top of the class,

178
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:02,486
he'll send to a ticket to visit him in the states.

179
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:07,300
The airfare is quite expensive.

180
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,801
Do you think he'll keep his promise, mom?

181
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:13,505
He knows that being top of class

182
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:17,499
is quite difficult, dear.

183
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,179
You'll see.

184
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,581
I will be the top of my class,

185
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,379
so he knows I can do it.

186
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,978
You're going to the top from the rank 30?

187
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,686
2 strawberry soda and 2 orange soda please.

188
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,689
Hey, 2 Pepsi, I'm so thirsty.

189
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,400
How can you do this?

190
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,402
I'm just really thirsty,

191
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,605
do you have a problem with that?

192
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,873
Haven't you heard that men, children,

193
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,976
and basketball players get the privileges

194
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:00,178
at this school.

195
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,579
And I'm a basketball player.

196
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,572
Can I have 4 sodas for the soccer players please?

197
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:18,393
Will Pepsi do?

198
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:19,986
Yes...

199
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,457
Darn it!

200
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,971
Hey, don't kick at me.

201
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,566
Sorry... don't you get it?

202
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,279
Hey!

203
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,977
Hey... I can handle this.

204
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,491
Nam, Shone and Ding

205
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,294
are having a fight behind the school.

206
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,594
Stop...

207
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:00,863
Where are you going?

208
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:04,856
Let's take the scooter, it's faster, come on.

209
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:06,961
Hurry!

210
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,571
I think you can handle him.

211
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,981
So you want to be hero like your dad?

212
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,984
He was a loser and cost us National Championship.

213
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,886
Did you guys know

214
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,880
that he missed the penalty kick?

215
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,858
It took ages to make it to National Championship.

216
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:38,157
Darn it...

217
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,672
We just missed seeing Ding getting beat up.

218
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,951
Let's go.

219
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,558
Do you still want this soda he gave us?

220
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,659
If you're not going to drink it,

221
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,354
can I throw it away?

222
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,563
Do not drink.

223
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,964
Why is it in the freezer if you can't drink it?

224
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,666
All right students,

225
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:08,269
I have 2 announcements today.

226
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,571
Our school has become filthy due to littering,

227
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,440
and the students are ignorant.

228
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:16,443
So from now on,

229
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:18,846
anyone who litters will be fined 1 baht per piece.

230
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,647
I have a promotion if you think this is too expensive,

231
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:24,150
this is a great deal.

232
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:27,152
Pay 50 baht per day

233
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:29,154
and you can litter anytime and anywhere,

234
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:32,456
I'll just clean up after you.

235
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,760
Students with the following names

236
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,762
please proceed to Disciplinary Office,

237
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:42,064
Jakawan Class 4/5

238
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,667
and Achawin Class 4/7.

239
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:48,437
Everybody understand?

240
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,038
Understand?

241
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,639
Yes...

242
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,040
Thank you. I love you.

243
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,143
Cross your arms.

244
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,355
If you get into fights again,

245
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,757
I'll inform your parents, do you hear me?

246
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,459
Shone, you have great talent,

247
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,661
in photography.

248
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,463
Why don't you enter
the provincial photography contest?

249
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,031
I think you should apply for it.

250
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:23,132
Maybe you can do something for our school,

251
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,833
instead of wasting your time fighting.

252
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,036
Do you understand me?

253
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,636
Yes, sir.
You may go now.

254
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,438
Thank you.

255
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,736
Next.

256
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:41,949
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

257
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,749
I'm really sorry.

258
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,151
It's okay.

259
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,653
It's not your fault.

260
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:52,057
Band aids for you.

261
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,821
Get well soon.

262
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,625
Nam.

263
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:05,029
Thank you.

264
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:12,841
Yes, he knows my name.

265
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:16,544
He actually knows my name.

266
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:19,241
He knows my name.

267
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,052
What?

268
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:27,821
They actually have books like this?

269
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:31,814
Oh... 20 ways to get your guy.

270
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:36,024
There goes the 'White Ribbon' girls.

271
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,033
I'll be right back.

272
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,434
Look at her,

273
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:47,336
since when is she friends with them?

274
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,942
Is she for real?

275
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,343
I miss my dad,

276
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:59,146
I haven't seen him for 5 years now.

277
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,714
Earn,

278
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,816
Kai's now in love with me,

279
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,618
because of this book.

280
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,121
Really? This book really works?

281
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:11,124
Yeah, Pooh also bought this book

282
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,824
before she got together with Toh.

283
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,726
9 love tips really works.

284
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,531
You're not going with them anymore?

285
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:24,525
No, they're saying I outshine them.

286
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,709
Tip No. 1.

287
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,703
Greek belief on how to win someone's heart,

288
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:41,416
look at the stars in the sky,

289
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,718
connect the stars with your fingers

290
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,919
to make the name of someone you love in Latin.

291
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,423
Hey, wait up!

292
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:51,824
Hey, I can't do it.

293
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,327
Nam, why don't you join us?

294
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:58,321
No, I think it's nonsense.

295
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:00,633
Gotta get this right.

296
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,828
I'm going to do it at home.

297
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:07,997
We're going, Nam. Later!

298
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,709
You're practicing real hard.

299
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,212
Do you have a soccer match somewhere?

300
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,811
Just around here.

301
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:57,905
Hey, I can't!
Catch!

302
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,418
I told you I can't, watch where you kick.

303
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,321
I though you were Chinese?

304
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:10,315
My ancestral accent comes out every time I'm upset!

305
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:13,093
Come on.

306
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:17,397
Look at this, Shone.

307
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:18,898
How about it?

308
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:21,400
A poster of the 3rd Photography Contest

309
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,001
that you asked about.

310
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:24,299
I see.

311
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,707
Look at him. He can play soccer day

312
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,509
and night on the streets

313
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,811
but refuses to join his school team.

314
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,312
He's just having fun,

315
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,415
I don't think he's taking soccer seriously.

316
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,907
Even if he is, he wouldn't join the team.

317
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:47,189
I should've scored that penalty kick.

318
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:52,292
Here you go again, don't blame yourself.

319
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,195
Maybe he's not really feeling ashamed

320
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:56,096
about what you did.

321
00:22:56,097 --> 00:23:00,700
Or even if he is, he has to get over it by himself.

322
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:04,694
Look at you now, how far you've come.

323
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,713
You look a bit strange.

324
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:19,982
Look, I have new braces for my teeth,

325
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,684
do you like them?

326
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:24,086
They don't look anything special to me.

327
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:27,389
Hey, here, look here.

328
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,483
I still don't like them.

329
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,695
Hey, you picked Ken?

330
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,097
Yes,

331
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:39,299
eat now,

332
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,001
eat now.

333
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:45,204
Yes, he ate.

334
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:48,107
Are you crazy? He's in the middle of his lunch.

335
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:50,608
This is not hypnotizing.

336
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,878
What are you guys doing?

337
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,079
Tip no. 2,

338
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,281
from Mayan, the indigenous people,

339
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,083
concentrate

340
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,785
and look at the one you love,

341
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:03,586
try to hypnotize him

342
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:05,187
to do what you want.

343
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,490
If he acts as you ordered,

344
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,392
it means that he is your soulmate.

345
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,201
Hey, he turned around.

346
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:22,902
Who...

347
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:25,505
Oh, no one.

348
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,874
Are you hypnotizing Shone?

349
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,073
No...

350
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:29,775
I didn't do anything.

351
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:33,769
I though you said this book is nonsense.

352
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:39,583
Well, taking beliefs from different culture

353
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:42,085
and various islands is kinda weird.

354
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:42,887
Then why are you following the book?

355
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:44,587
I... hey!

356
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:48,290
You can tell us the truth.

357
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,392
I don't wanna be teased.

358
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:52,294
Don't you worry about that.

359
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:56,288
Because we will definitely tease you.

360
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,699
Tip No. 3.

361
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,767
Scottish way of saying you love someone.

362
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:04,471
Give a gift to someone anonymously,

363
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:06,872
just for the person to know

364
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:10,070
that someone has a crush on him.

365
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,178
This jelly is mine.

366
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,671
How can you drop it?

367
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,087
Thank you so much, Prof. Pol.

368
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,688
Salted eggs.

369
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,990
Oh, I must be on your mind

370
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,294
when you were travelling.

371
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:34,462
I'll finish it all,

372
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:36,464
thank you so much.

373
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:39,466
Thank you.

374
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:42,069
Prof. Pol's eggs.

375
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,471
Prof. Pol's eggs and some salts.

376
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:47,273
Prof. Pol's salted eggs, it's correct.

377
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,475
Prof. Pol brought me eggs.

378
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:53,469
Prof. Pol's salted eggs...

379
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:01,986
Oh, don't tell me...

380
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,787
Yes, there's from Prof. Pol.

381
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:04,689
How many boxes have you got?

382
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,455
4 boxes.
4 boxes?

383
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,655
Salted eggs.

384
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,259
Hope you can finish them all.

385
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,257
See you.

386
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:26,264
Oh, no!

387
00:26:28,076 --> 00:26:29,277
My scooter's ruined!

388
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,270
I forgot we live in a tropical country.

389
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,450
Mangoes?

390
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:44,356
People give flowers and handkerchiefs,

391
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:47,658
what's so romantic about mangoes?

392
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:51,652
Hey, look over there.

393
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:56,256
Cool dude! Go...

394
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:01,960
Mango cake, I made it myself.

395
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,774
Thank you, looks delicious.

396
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,075
Are you okay?

397
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:10,777
I'm all right.

398
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:14,737
Okay, we're dead.

399
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:18,550
She only has to do that.

400
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:23,054
She's adorable and she bakes.

401
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:26,357
How can you beat that?

402
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,349
Better find another boy.

403
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:36,766
Actually I already have a date,

404
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,268
but if you invite me over for dinner

405
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:39,568
at your place,

406
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,970
and this is would be our first date...

407
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:47,141
If you're not free, that's okay.

408
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:50,444
Next semester then.

409
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:52,645
Oh, wait,

410
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:56,639
actually I'm free, I accept your invitation.

411
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:01,945
See you later this evening.

412
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,062
This dinner is not just for the two of us?

413
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,464
It's not actually a dinner,

414
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:15,865
it's a party for the end of semester,

415
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:18,267
a lot of our colleagues are coming,

416
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:19,735
it'll be fun.

417
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,328
Oh, okay.

418
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,940
Prof. Orn.

419
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:28,543
Prof.

420
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,945
I never give up.

421
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,247
This time it's war.

422
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:37,547
That's my answer sheet.

423
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,554
Higher...

424
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,055
Prof.

425
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,047
Lift me higher, Nam.

426
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,159
I got it.

427
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,562
We have to make Shone give Nam a lift home.

428
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,030
Yes...

429
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,033
It's your once in a lifetime wish isn't it?

430
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,534
Yeah.

431
00:28:58,535 --> 00:29:05,640
He gives you mangoes after he drives you,

432
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,734
how romantic is that.

433
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:13,447
You have to pretend your scooter's broken.

434
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:15,249
How?

435
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,951
He'll know once he tries to fix it.

436
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,052
That's true.

437
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:20,754
You must lose your keys.

438
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:23,255
How?

439
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:26,925
It's here.

440
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,127
Hey...

441
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:30,028
It's gone.

442
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:34,022
Hey, there he is.

443
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:41,637
Mango cake girl, what's wrong?

444
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:44,840
I tripped and must have sprained my ankle.

445
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:47,443
Come, I'll give you a lift.

446
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,344
That's all right!

447
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,249
Come on, let me take you home.

448
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,048
I'm a little clumsy.

449
00:30:08,728 --> 00:30:11,229
What a show!

450
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,431
She went to acting school or what?

451
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:19,736
"Bye Bye Grade 7. See you all Grade 8."

452
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:22,739
Mom, come see this.

453
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,040
Pang, you little brat.

454
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:28,034
Mom, Nam has a boyfriend.

455
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,614
Nam, I think this can wait until you grow up.

456
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,517
You're going away to see your dad,

457
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:40,511
concentrate on your school, dear.

458
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:58,235
Hey, Cheer.

459
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:00,037
Your little sister said

460
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,539
you've been depressed for weeks now.

461
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,841
Listening to sad tunes all week.

462
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:07,801
I thought you must have gotten over Shone by now.

463
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,713
Keep your voice down, mom might hear us.

464
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:15,707
She's off to the market already.

465
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:19,314
Don't push me.

466
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:24,224
When's your mom going to expand these stairs?

467
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:26,819
Hey, Nam, hear one more tip okay?

468
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,229
Tip no. 7

469
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,233
is from the Gypsies, let love inspire you.

470
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:37,034
The power of love shall make you smarter,

471
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:40,104
prettier and better in every way,

472
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:42,807
then that person will finally notice you.

473
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,400
Hey what?

474
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:54,617
Shone is gorgeous so Nam should be beautiful...

475
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:57,519
Okay, do that later, my skin's coming off now.

476
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,524
What is this?

477
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:44,423
Turmeric.

478
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:47,484
Let's go.

479
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:58,704
Hey, hello girls.

480
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:01,105
Let me know how I can help you okay?

481
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:04,098
Have a look around.

482
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,421
"Pornchai missed PK."

483
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:21,690
"Failed to hand Provincial cup."

484
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:24,292
I don't see him anywhere.

485
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,993
Maybe he's not home.

486
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:30,297
He's probably out. I don't see his scooter.

487
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,300
Have you found what you're looking for?

488
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:38,294
Yes, this one.

489
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:46,101
What are you buying?

490
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,277
You guys play table tennis?

491
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:59,582
Why are you so yellow?

492
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:05,893
Do you have jaundice?

493
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:08,096
Shone.

494
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,397
Mango cake girl.

495
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:10,396
Are you here to buy something?

496
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,899
I need a dozen of table tennis balls.

497
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,992
Come, I'll get them for you.

498
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:24,409
Come on kids, join my Drama Club.

499
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,611
Drama Club, anyone?

500
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:27,178
We have a lot of plays for you.

501
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,481
You can be a princess or a prince.

502
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,681
You can star in our plays.

503
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:33,384
The lords of comedy were in my club.

504
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,486
Anyone interested?

505
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,986
Join us?

506
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,689
Father of talk show was also in our club.

507
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,492
Really?
If you wanna make it in the business,

508
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:42,792
this is your chance.

509
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:46,785
Join us, dear? Don't pass over me.

510
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,601
Take off your glasses.

511
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:54,503
Your glasses.

512
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:57,304
Hey, but I feel awkward without them.

513
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,406
I think we totally don't fit with that

514
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,874
pretty-polis-posh concept

515
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,076
of that Dancing Arts Club.

516
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:08,379
Prof. Orn always selects the smartest and prettiest

517
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,581
for her club and when they perform,

518
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:11,582
the whole school goes to see them.

519
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:16,486
Unlike those weirdos in Drama Club,

520
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:18,588
no one ever watches their plays.

521
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:21,590
Well, it's worth giving it a try.

522
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:24,894
We maybe a little dark,

523
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:27,796
a little dorky but pretty in our own ways.

524
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,168
Shone,

525
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:36,370
which club are you joining?

526
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,672
Photography.

527
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:42,666
Whenever you need a model, just let me know.

528
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,075
I like photographing landscapes, not people.

529
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,382
Are you kidding me?

530
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,683
If you say so.

531
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,380
Come on, get in the frame.

532
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:18,472
You're not yellow anymore,

533
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:21,274
your skin seems lighter?

534
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:22,876
Maybe...

535
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:25,175
a little.

536
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,073
I'll be watching your performance okay?

537
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,360
You see, Nam,

538
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,061
he said you look prettier,

539
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,663
keep up head high okay?

540
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,966
If we get to do dance performance,

541
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,666
would be fantastic!

542
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,669
We'll be so pretty and fabulous.

543
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,171
If you're not sure that you're pretty enough,

544
00:36:57,172 --> 00:37:00,174
you're always welcome in other clubs, you know?

545
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,276
Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.

546
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:06,279
I wasn't talk to you, I was talking to Funn, right?

547
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,981
Liar,

548
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:09,973
you said it to us.

549
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:18,956
Stop it, girls.

550
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:21,755
I don't want any troublemakers in my club.

551
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:26,062
Wait...

552
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:30,056
Faye and Funn, stay behind.

553
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,252
Nam...

554
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:56,755
I'm sorry about earlier.

555
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,156
I have to apologize too.

556
00:37:58,157 --> 00:37:59,556
Yeah.

557
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,253
I bought extra drink, you can have it.

558
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:10,366
Wait,

559
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,368
let her drink it first.

560
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:17,072
Why won't you drink it.

561
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:17,973
Go.

562
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:19,841
If you don't want a drink spiked

563
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:23,835
with fish sauce, throw it away.

564
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,442
How can she do that?

565
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:36,255
There you are, I was looking all over for you.

566
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,057
Look at me

567
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,057
and smile...

568
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:40,959
Frown...

569
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,262
Laugh,

570
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,462
oh perfect!

571
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:48,265
See you tomorrow at the auditorium okay?

572
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:49,867
Professor.

573
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,168
Keep your voice down,

574
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:53,135
I'm only accepting a few students.

575
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:54,933
Understand?

576
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,733
Can I have some?

577
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,547
Prof. In,

578
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:09,350
oh, what's wrong?

579
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:11,050
Are you okay?

580
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,652
Are you all right?

581
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:15,855
Are you okay?

582
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:19,658
Prof. In.

583
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,660
How can I help you, sir?

584
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:24,662
Nothing, how are you?

585
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:28,232
I'm fine.

586
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,333
See you tomorrow.

587
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,427
I'm fine.

588
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:34,939
Water, need water.

589
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,139
No...

590
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,842
It's a perfect match and I mean it.

591
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,944
Prof. In.

592
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,746
Maybe I shouldn't let you do the play,

593
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,246
if you're this late.

594
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:46,047
Okay...

595
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:49,550
Oh, wait!

596
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,652
I was just joking!

597
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:55,055
We meant to tell you that...

598
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:56,956
No worries,

599
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,758
I'll give you the best parts.

600
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:01,527
We meant to tell you...

601
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,028
Come on, help me out...

602
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:05,830
We want to dance...

603
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:09,824
dance...

604
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,436
in you play,
dance...

605
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:15,429
because we're so happy to be in your play.

606
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:23,946
This year, I proudly present the play called

607
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:30,250
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"

608
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:35,422
Nam, your English is better than the rest.

609
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:37,624
You play Snow white okay?

610
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,126
Me?

611
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:45,030
Yes... ready! Oh, a rabbit,

612
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:47,832
what are you doing here?

613
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,233
I'm here to paint.

614
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,636
Then what are you doing inside the box?

615
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:55,038
I bought interior paint.

616
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,439
Go paint elsewhere.

617
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:01,143
Wait a second,

618
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:03,546
get me all phone numbers of those

619
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,242
in Art Production.

620
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:09,818
My students are so gifted in acting,

621
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:12,519
I'm sure it's gonna be a great play.

622
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,222
Are you all right? Are you sick?

623
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,624
No.

624
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,726
I feel fine.

625
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:23,329
Oh, maybe you're not used to my natural beauty.

626
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,431
Lipsticks are waste of money.

627
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,033
And most importantly,

628
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:32,036
I just wanna give someone a head start.

629
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:36,340
Perhaps you went a little too far?

630
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:37,942
Let's compete with our work.

631
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:39,043
Because judging from our looks,

632
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:40,510
we're neck and neck.

633
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:44,214
I've trained the students to put make up on

634
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:46,206
like my natural style.

635
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,311
And this is how you get the natural look.

636
00:41:56,525 --> 00:42:00,518
Are you sure you've trained them?

637
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:05,522
It this a play or a circus?

638
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,334
Could be a circus, Prof. Orn.

639
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:12,328
This is the kids' creativity.

640
00:42:26,116 --> 00:42:28,518
You're going home?

641
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,611
Yes.

642
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:37,324
Shone.

643
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,797
Home safe.

644
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:55,206
She was walking fine

645
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,607
when she got here wasn't she?

646
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:09,318
Professor.
Yes.

647
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:11,219
Would you like some water?
Thank you.

648
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:28,701
My football's going to be out of air.

649
00:43:28,702 --> 00:43:32,004
Sorry about that.

650
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:33,905
This is Pin, a junior,

651
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,407
she'll be taking care of

652
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,209
costumes and make-up for our play.

653
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,701
May I have a round of applause for Pin.

654
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,414
Please take care of this for me, Pin.

655
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:44,816
I think we should get started.

656
00:43:44,817 --> 00:43:49,219
Okay, let's get started with me.

657
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,921
I forgot I'm not in the play.

658
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,389
Let's start with Snow white then.

659
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,791
Start with me?

660
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:58,386
Yes, you first.

661
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:57,309
What do you think?

662
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,479
She looks the same to me.

663
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,471
Snow white with braces.

664
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:18,794
I don't want braces anymore.

665
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,093
I wanna take them out.

666
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:25,500
Nam, are you there?

667
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,502
Okay, ready. Stand by.

668
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,104
Where's the Prince?

669
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,406
He has diarrhea.

670
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:36,366
On a final rehearsal? Is he crazy?

671
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:42,080
You... the painter.

672
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:44,082
Can you fill in for the Prince please?

673
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,183
Me?

674
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:47,277
Yes, be a Prince, it'll be quick.

675
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:53,490
Closer, get closer.

676
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:57,794
When I say action, lean towards her to kiss okay?

677
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:59,194
Action.

678
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:05,490
You so beautiful, I have to kiss you.

679
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,788
Hey, Nam...

680
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:52,564
You're going to break you neck there.

681
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:58,269
Hey, too long already, go back to painting.

682
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:01,180
Nam standby. Koi, ready.

683
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:03,172
What?

684
00:47:06,786 --> 00:47:09,983
Ready, action.

685
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:29,662
Hello, this is Pornchai Sports Shop.

686
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:36,977
May I please speak to Shone?

687
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,378
Shone speaking.

688
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:47,342
Hello...

689
00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:01,760
He hung up.

690
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:31,757
Mirror mirror on the wall,

691
00:48:31,758 --> 00:48:35,751
who is the most beautiful one of all?

692
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:42,666
Where are you going? Toilet?

693
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,267
The witch is here,

694
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,470
this is the climax of the play.

695
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:47,570
There's the witch.

696
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:50,873
Yes, eat.
Apple?

697
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,035
Eat.

698
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:07,553
Look...

699
00:49:07,554 --> 00:49:08,855
She's not dead.

700
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:11,758
She's gonna solve her problem, you'll see.

701
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:15,058
Death snow white... death.

702
00:49:19,765 --> 00:49:23,758
No one informed me about our student

703
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:26,736
who won the provincial photography contest.

704
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:28,838
They just called to inform us now, sir.

705
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,241
Try to keep up with the performance

706
00:49:32,242 --> 00:49:34,043
of our students okay?

707
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,544
Hurry up.

708
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:36,845
Yes... I'm trying.

709
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:40,839
The iron's not working so well, sir.

710
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:45,950
Prof. Rabue, this is why.

711
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:51,848
Could you plug it for me?

712
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,162
Will you marry me?

713
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,463
Yes, I will.

714
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:02,233
And so snow while and the prince

715
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:06,227
lives happily ever after.

716
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:12,742
Well done, students, great job!

717
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,945
You can still see the footprints.

718
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,547
I ironed, I didn't wash his shirt, sir.

719
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,448
Do you want me to wash it?

720
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,850
We don't have time.

721
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,751
Don't forget your bag.

722
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:29,055
Get going now. Go.

723
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:30,648
Well done!

724
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:37,120
Dinner's on me tonight.

725
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,334
"For Snow White, I tasted it for you,"

726
00:50:41,335 --> 00:50:43,134
"it's not poisoned."

727
00:50:43,135 --> 00:50:44,735
Hold on.

728
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:48,139
One more time, eat your heart out tonight,

729
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,233
my treat!

730
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:55,041
Let's pack up now.

731
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:58,647
For Snow white.

732
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:00,950
Who is it from? A bitten apple.

733
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:03,852
Must be from Shone.

734
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,453
You really think so?

735
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:07,721
You ugly thing!

736
00:51:07,722 --> 00:51:10,714
Nam, maybe it's from that guy...

737
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:17,029
Prince Frog.

738
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,023
Princess Frog and Prince Frog.

739
00:51:21,934 --> 00:51:25,137
What a jerk, why didn't you come see the play?

740
00:51:25,138 --> 00:51:29,131
I bet you were watching those dancers.

741
00:51:43,419 --> 00:51:45,410
What a jerk!

742
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:54,327
Mac doesn't feel a thing.

743
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,429
Hey, how's my little boy?

744
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:59,632
Hey, what brings you here?

745
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:00,833
Hello.

746
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:04,827
Guys, this is Top, my friend since kindergarten.

747
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:07,839
Hello...

748
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,432
Hello.

749
00:52:11,043 --> 00:52:13,204
He's cute.

750
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,209
Hey!

751
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,819
Let's go.

752
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,722
How long are you going to stay this time?

753
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:28,823
Probably until my dad retires.

754
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:30,325
But if I can get into university,

755
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:31,626
I'll move to Bangkok with my mom.

756
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:33,727
Cute!

757
00:52:33,728 --> 00:52:35,423
Let's go see the cafeteria.

758
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,933
Hey, pretty girl,

759
00:52:39,934 --> 00:52:41,634
what's your name?

760
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:44,736
Yes, you. What's your name?

761
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:50,808
Don't be shy. Going already?

762
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,800
You wanna a little fight with me, girl?

763
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:55,613
I think Prof. In put it on.

764
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:59,416
It's probably been showing all day.

765
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,907
Let's go.

766
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,721
Hey, that's Snow white on TV.

767
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:09,624
She's cute. Does she have a boyfriend?

768
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,526
I don't think so but I don't think

769
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:13,528
you should ask her out.

770
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:15,529
Why not?

771
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,631
Isn't she too young?

772
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:21,591
Hey, I've asked for numbers of 5th graders before.

773
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:26,405
"Bye Sophomore. Hello Junior!"

774
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:28,397
"2 more subjects to make up for"
"Will follow you to Junior year!"

775
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:37,014
Shone, this is yours.

776
00:53:37,015 --> 00:53:39,216
I thought so. Every time we play soccer,

777
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,018
you'll always have give me a penalty kick.

778
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,920
You do it.

779
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,422
Hey, you're still not over it?

780
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,924
Your dad must have forgotten about it by now.

781
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:51,126
It's not that. That was too easy.

782
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,395
Yeah right, Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo.

783
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,297
Top, can I take a photo with you?

784
00:53:56,298 --> 00:53:57,298
Yeah, sure.

785
00:53:57,299 --> 00:53:58,799
Can I have one too?

786
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,401
Then who's going to the photo for me?

787
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:02,402
Will you take one for me first?

788
00:54:02,403 --> 00:54:04,304
I can take it for you.

789
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,500
Thank you...

790
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:09,308
A bit closer.

791
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:10,809
Okay...

792
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:14,803
1... 2... 3...

793
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:28,891
Hey, why are you stealing my scene?

794
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:32,885
I asked him first, you know?

795
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,899
Stop...

796
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,701
All of you stop it!

797
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:44,204
Stop it right now!

798
00:54:44,205 --> 00:54:47,407
Isn't this too much?

799
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:49,501
I have no idea.

800
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:52,711
Stop now. Stop!

801
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:05,188
I was the referee, sir.

802
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:08,391
How many days to district sports day?

803
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,393
About 2 weeks, sir.

804
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:14,396
The athletes and cheer squad are practicing hard.

805
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:17,298
Who's going to be drum major now?

806
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:18,800
I think...

807
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:20,802
I have to ask Prof. Orn for some help,

808
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:23,294
see if she can find someone.

809
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:41,486
Don't worry about that, sir.

810
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:43,580
I got it.

811
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:49,484
It's nothing.

812
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:57,399
Nam,

813
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,901
in my entire being,

814
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:02,903
I've never met anyone so perfect

815
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:04,505
and excellent like you.

816
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:07,975
You look incredible and fabulous.

817
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:09,476
Please get straight to the point.

818
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:13,470
What can I do for you, Prof. In?

819
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:17,583
I was wondering if you could be the school's

820
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:20,486
drum major for the District Sports Day?

821
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:21,086
What?

822
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,287
I'm not looking for anyone else.

823
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:25,690
You're perfect for it.

824
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:28,592
But that's in 2 weeks.

825
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,695
I don't think I can do it.

826
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:35,689
I can not find anyone else.

827
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,269
I promise I'll make it up to you in a religious way.

828
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,871
In a religious way?

829
00:56:42,872 --> 00:56:46,874
I can pray for you for 6 months...

830
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:50,868
or forever. I can definitely do that.

831
00:57:00,086 --> 00:57:03,288
Hold the baton upright then throw it up,

832
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:08,492
keep your eyes on the baton then catch it

833
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:10,094
then continue marching.

834
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:11,395
See?

835
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:14,164
As easy as that.

836
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:15,465
Can you show me?

837
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,667
I have my own baton.

838
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,169
You can do it. That's yours, this is mine.

839
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,671
Focus on how high you want to throw it,

840
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,773
then throw it up when you're ready,

841
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:28,868
123, up!

842
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:40,486
This is difficult.

843
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,978
Why didn't she pick someone else?

844
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,949
Don't give up just yet, it's only been a few days.

845
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:52,162
The most important tip

846
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:53,964
in 9 Love Tips

847
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:57,767
says that you should give it your best shot in love,

848
00:57:57,768 --> 00:57:59,769
wholeheartedly give it all you've got,

849
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,763
then the person you love will find you.

850
00:58:07,477 --> 00:58:11,378
Hey, you've come this far,

851
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:13,681
you have to keep fighting.

852
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:16,083
This is not only for school,

853
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:18,785
you're representing our town.

854
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,447
You can do it.

855
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:57,141
Top, pass the ball.

856
00:59:00,655 --> 00:59:02,555
Hey, you're distracted by girls again.

857
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:08,760
I promise you that our marching band

858
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:11,062
will be the best in town this year, sir.

859
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:12,363
What about the drum major?

860
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:13,566
You need not worry.

861
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:16,267
She's pretty, tall and fabulous.

862
00:59:16,268 --> 00:59:19,670
She's just perfect.

863
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:23,163
Watch out!

864
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,344
Sorry.

865
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,653
Don't tell me that's our drum major.

866
00:59:38,654 --> 00:59:42,647
Oh, yes. But she's been doing well, sir.

867
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:45,258
It's the first time she messed up.

868
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:47,158
She's throwing her baton like a boomerang.

869
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,862
What happens if she mess up on the sports day?

870
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,855
No incident like that will happen, sir.

871
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:02,239
Get a new drum major

872
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,540
or I'll be after you.

873
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,441
Oh, sir. But,

874
01:00:05,442 --> 01:00:09,145
we only have 1 week to practice, sir.

875
01:00:09,146 --> 01:00:10,943
This is not looking too good.

876
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:17,851
The director confiscated the baton?

877
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:19,954
Who's going to be our drum major now?

878
01:00:19,955 --> 01:00:22,856
I don't know. Serves Prof. In right.

879
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:25,558
She should've picked one of us, pretty girls.

880
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,661
I don't know how she could pick such ugly student.

881
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:31,063
Her students are always losers.

882
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:32,731
I'm glad she didn't pick us,

883
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:36,735
would be bad for our reputation.

884
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:38,235
How can you say that?

885
01:00:38,236 --> 01:00:40,438
It's true.

886
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:42,236
Bug face.

887
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:48,244
I'm going to prove them wrong.

888
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:52,238
Students of Prof. In are not always a loser.

889
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,552
You're going use a broomstick?

890
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,354
Where did you get that?

891
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,356
I borrowed from the janitor.

892
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:05,350
It's a bit light, but it'll do.

893
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:14,023
I will not let anyone look down on us and Prof. In.

894
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:28,743
Everyone, I'm asking for 100% from you today.

895
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,041
There...

896
01:01:38,955 --> 01:01:42,914
Hey, that's a foul. Hey!

897
01:01:56,736 --> 01:01:58,931
You're going to take the penalty kick?

898
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:02,740
Hey, my son's going take the penalty kick.

899
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:04,242
Let's leave.

900
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:06,144
Wait, hold on.

901
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:09,146
Unbelievable, Shone's going kick a penalty goal.

902
01:02:09,147 --> 01:02:10,447
I can't believe my eyes,

903
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:14,407
come on, he's going to kick now.

904
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:30,631
Do you guys know why

905
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:32,732
we lost the National Championship?

906
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:35,334
It's because of his dad.

907
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:39,328
Wait...

908
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,842
That was just a warm up kick.

909
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,801
Have another go.

910
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:48,914
Is there such thing as a warm up penalty kick?

911
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:50,915
In my book, there is.

912
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:52,816
In my book too.

913
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:54,317
Mine too.

914
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,820
And I haven't blown my whistle.

915
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:59,516
Yes, sir.
One more time.

916
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:08,524
Why?
He's going have another go at it.

917
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:20,400
Come here.

918
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:39,113
He's gonna do it.

919
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:50,531
If you kick like that,

920
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,900
you're ready to join our school team.

921
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:53,595
Yes.

922
01:03:56,704 --> 01:04:04,008
Yes, Shone did it...

923
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,713
He's all smile now.

924
01:04:07,714 --> 01:04:10,205
I get it now.

925
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:55,811
Very good, perfect, dear.

926
01:04:57,322 --> 01:05:01,291
My goodness, excuse me Prof. Orn,

927
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,293
I was wondering whether your students

928
01:05:03,294 --> 01:05:06,395
can throw their headdress that high and catch it?

929
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:10,389
So high, very good!

930
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,601
So, your sister is as pretty as I am now?

931
01:05:52,602 --> 01:05:56,595
She much prettier.

932
01:05:57,606 --> 01:06:00,006
Fabulous, Nam.

933
01:06:07,081 --> 01:06:09,681
I don't wanna move anywhere.

934
01:06:09,682 --> 01:06:13,675
You say that every time.

935
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:28,797
You're way to hot, Nam.

936
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,501
Last Valentine's day, she was still very dark.

937
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:35,004
I'm gonna take Kai's gift for her.

938
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:36,404
Have you asked Nam?

939
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:37,805
I don't know.

940
01:06:37,806 --> 01:06:41,765
Can I have this pink chocolate Nam?

941
01:06:44,979 --> 01:06:47,981
What's wrong with her? She looks a bit down.

942
01:06:47,982 --> 01:06:49,182
She's been waiting for him all day

943
01:06:49,183 --> 01:06:51,884
and he hasn't shown up.

944
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,878
Hey, Nam, come here... hurry.

945
01:07:00,192 --> 01:07:01,989
Go ahead.

946
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,862
Here,

947
01:07:22,377 --> 01:07:24,675
it's from a friend of mine.

948
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:19,558
See you tomorrow at 4,

949
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:22,260
on 3rd floor staircase.

950
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:24,661
I have something to tell you.

951
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,584
Do you wanna leave together, Shone?

952
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,586
You haven't left yet?

953
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:54,646
You can go ahead.

954
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:07,464
Nam.

955
01:09:10,468 --> 01:09:13,266
I knew you'd come.

956
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:19,265
This letter was from you, Top?

957
01:09:20,878 --> 01:09:25,280
Yes, it's from me.

958
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:29,240
Did you want anything?

959
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:35,455
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

960
01:09:35,456 --> 01:09:39,449
What were you going to tell me, Shone?

961
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:44,454
I was just going to ask why you're here.

962
01:09:44,664 --> 01:09:48,657
But now I know.

963
01:09:56,674 --> 01:09:59,443
So what do you say?

964
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:02,344
Silence means yes to me.

965
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:03,345
What?

966
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:07,749
Top? Where did he come from?

967
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,548
And that's what all Shone said?

968
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:14,855
What was your answer?

969
01:10:14,856 --> 01:10:17,958
I didn't say anything.

970
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:21,160
What should I do?

971
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:23,262
You have to think twice

972
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:25,164
since he's Shone's best friend.

973
01:10:25,165 --> 01:10:27,866
If you make a wrong move,

974
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:30,165
Shone's going to kill you.

975
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,940
Mistake.

976
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,142
Are you free today? Wanna go see a soccer game?

977
01:10:38,143 --> 01:10:40,443
No, I'm not free.

978
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,946
It'll only take a while.

979
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:46,548
Shone's playing for the team first time today.

980
01:10:46,549 --> 01:10:47,950
Do you wanna go?

981
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:49,543
Okay, I'll go.

982
01:10:55,157 --> 01:10:57,258
Nam.

983
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:58,749
Get on.

984
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:07,933
Some water.

985
01:11:07,934 --> 01:11:09,735
Thank you.

986
01:11:09,736 --> 01:11:11,236
Do you have some water?

987
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:13,034
No.

988
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:25,345
Let's go to plan B.

989
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:29,746
Faster...

990
01:11:57,142 --> 01:12:01,135
Dear button, I really wanna ride with Shone.

991
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,950
"Summer Holiday!"

992
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:11,443
"See you in Junior Year."

993
01:12:12,355 --> 01:12:14,123
What kind of cake would you like

994
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:17,025
for your birthday this year? Go pick one.

995
01:12:17,026 --> 01:12:19,227
Vanilla cake,

996
01:12:19,228 --> 01:12:21,128
Nam loves it.

997
01:12:26,434 --> 01:12:30,436
Hello, where are you?

998
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:33,239
We're picking a cake for Cheer's birthday right now.

999
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,640
I'm at the Dam with Shone and his friends,

1000
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:37,442
I won't make it back in time.

1001
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:40,344
I called Cheer this morning but she didn't pick up,

1002
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:42,746
please tell her Happy Birthday for me.

1003
01:12:42,747 --> 01:12:44,048
Sorry guys.

1004
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:46,517
Okay... we'll tell her.

1005
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:51,013
We'll take this one.

1006
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,434
Grilled squids.

1007
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:13,538
I'll be right back.

1008
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:44,522
What are you doing here all alone?

1009
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:49,126
It's a great view here.

1010
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:58,701
Would you like some grilled squid?

1011
01:14:00,613 --> 01:14:04,315
Have you heard a story about squids?

1012
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,409
No.

1013
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,819
I'll tell you.

1014
01:14:12,923 --> 01:14:15,225
Once upon the time,

1015
01:14:15,226 --> 01:14:17,926
two squids met

1016
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:24,332
and fell in love with each other,

1017
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,702
they decided to be together

1018
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:31,696
and eventually got married.

1019
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:36,809
On their wedding day,

1020
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:41,113
the reverend squire told them to hold hands

1021
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:44,716
so they held hands,

1022
01:14:44,717 --> 01:14:46,717
held hands...

1023
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:59,985
You're so silly.

1024
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:02,898
But that's sweet.

1025
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:04,098
The story teller or the story?

1026
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,201
The story teller.

1027
01:15:05,202 --> 01:15:08,202
Oh, the story.

1028
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:11,105
I'm all confused now.

1029
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,506
No more appetite for squids?

1030
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:17,500
I never ate squids again after I heard that story.

1031
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:24,817
Have you ever held

1032
01:15:24,818 --> 01:15:28,820
someone's hand like the squids?

1033
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:34,091
Once I held hand of a clumsy girl

1034
01:15:34,092 --> 01:15:36,493
who was about to fall off the stage,

1035
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:37,994
so I grabbed her hand.

1036
01:15:37,995 --> 01:15:41,697
Nam...

1037
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,799
Why don't you eat the squids?

1038
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,501
They're really delicious.

1039
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,903
Don't...

1040
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:52,406
Why? They're yummy.

1041
01:15:52,407 --> 01:15:54,208
Seriously,

1042
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:55,809
do you like Nam?

1043
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,611
You're going out with her,

1044
01:15:57,612 --> 01:16:00,213
why are you asking me this?

1045
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:03,115
Oh, it's nothing.

1046
01:16:08,087 --> 01:16:09,388
Are you all right?

1047
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:11,288
I'm fine, just hurts a bit.

1048
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:14,792
Can you try to walk?

1049
01:16:14,793 --> 01:16:17,091
Come on, get on my back.

1050
01:16:25,402 --> 01:16:29,395
Dear button, Shone carried my bag today.

1051
01:16:41,282 --> 01:16:43,582
Happy Birthday...
Is that you Nam?

1052
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,384
Cheer's not here.

1053
01:16:45,385 --> 01:16:47,386
She went with Kie and Nim.

1054
01:16:47,387 --> 01:16:49,988
You didn't go with them?

1055
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:51,389
No.

1056
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:55,383
Give them a call okay?

1057
01:17:07,004 --> 01:17:08,703
I miss the old times,

1058
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:13,074
when we would do reports together, don't you?

1059
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:15,075
Angels should be in heaven,

1060
01:17:15,076 --> 01:17:17,278
not in hell like us.

1061
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:19,480
Take it easy, Cheer.

1062
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:22,081
There's always next year.

1063
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:25,685
I only have 3 friends.

1064
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:28,484
I wouldn't do that if I were her.

1065
01:17:37,296 --> 01:17:40,097
Do you wanna come over later to do the report?

1066
01:17:40,098 --> 01:17:42,692
Why don't you write report with your new gang?

1067
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:06,977
Top's not here yet?

1068
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:13,291
He told me to tutor a sophomore.

1069
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:15,193
He's not here yet, he said

1070
01:18:15,194 --> 01:18:19,153
he was going to borrow a book for the sophomore.

1071
01:18:23,368 --> 01:18:27,361
That day, I was in the hospital.

1072
01:18:30,474 --> 01:18:33,175
Which day?

1073
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:36,979
The day my dad missed the penalty kick,

1074
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:40,982
I was born on that day.

1075
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,784
My dad never played soccer again

1076
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,778
after I was born.

1077
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:51,790
I'm such a bad luck.

1078
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:55,750
Our team never made it to the finals again.

1079
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:02,166
Are you okay?

1080
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:09,373
I'm used to all the teasing.

1081
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:11,574
My last name is

1082
01:19:11,575 --> 01:19:15,568
Shone, the son of the guy who missed the goal.

1083
01:19:16,879 --> 01:19:18,680
But it's okay,

1084
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:22,083
I'm in the team now.

1085
01:19:22,084 --> 01:19:25,386
Are you thinking of playing professional soccer?

1086
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:27,548
I don't know.

1087
01:19:29,257 --> 01:19:33,250
Right now, I just wanna have someone.

1088
01:19:39,465 --> 01:19:43,968
Nam, I still can't find the book.

1089
01:19:43,969 --> 01:19:46,563
Can you come help look for it?

1090
01:19:53,277 --> 01:19:56,075
We won't take long, Shone!

1091
01:20:09,157 --> 01:20:13,150
What's the surprise for Ake's birthday?

1092
01:20:14,361 --> 01:20:16,352
You'll see.

1093
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:44,443
Time for our special show for tonight.

1094
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:51,559
The story happened when we were in 5th grade.

1095
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,761
We happened to like the same girl.

1096
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:57,263
Her name is Bo, she's in 4th grade.

1097
01:20:57,264 --> 01:20:58,765
So we both practiced dancing

1098
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:02,768
hoping to be her partner in the event.

1099
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:05,470
And when the day comes,

1100
01:21:05,471 --> 01:21:07,939
Shone...

1101
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,842
got chicken pox,

1102
01:21:10,843 --> 01:21:14,836
so I got to be her dance partner.

1103
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:20,249
But Top backed out on that day,

1104
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,652
so we both didn't get her anyway.

1105
01:21:21,653 --> 01:21:27,155
He threatened to not be friends with me

1106
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:28,357
so we promised each other

1107
01:21:28,358 --> 01:21:29,658
since that day...

1108
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:31,759
That we will never like the same girl.

1109
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,753
Right?

1110
01:22:03,853 --> 01:22:06,955
Happy birthday to you.

1111
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:10,758
Happy birthday...

1112
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,718
Happy birthday to you.

1113
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,541
Same time tomorrow?

1114
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:31,737
Let's go see Shone's soccer match.

1115
01:22:32,745 --> 01:22:36,346
You don't have to pick me up anymore.

1116
01:22:36,347 --> 01:22:38,549
Why not? Are you busy?

1117
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,050
No,

1118
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:41,951
I mean...

1119
01:22:41,952 --> 01:22:44,250
you don't have to pick me up ever again.

1120
01:22:47,725 --> 01:22:51,718
Are you upset because I kissed you?

1121
01:22:51,928 --> 01:22:55,429
But you're my girlfriend, aren't you?

1122
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:59,423
I never said I was your girlfriend.

1123
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:03,236
After all these?

1124
01:23:03,237 --> 01:23:07,039
I'm sorry,

1125
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,641
but I have someone I like.

1126
01:23:09,642 --> 01:23:13,644
Who is it?

1127
01:23:13,645 --> 01:23:17,638
Who...

1128
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:26,222
This is the worse ever

1129
01:23:26,223 --> 01:23:30,126
in the history of my love life.

1130
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:32,322
Can I ask you a favor?

1131
01:23:35,131 --> 01:23:38,032
Could you not ask her out

1132
01:23:38,033 --> 01:23:39,933
no matter what happens?

1133
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:44,037
Do you think she broke up with you because of me?

1134
01:23:44,038 --> 01:23:45,938
No,

1135
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:48,241
I just can't take

1136
01:23:48,242 --> 01:23:51,244
if my best friend

1137
01:23:51,245 --> 01:23:53,213
is seeing the girl I love.

1138
01:23:55,314 --> 01:23:59,216
There's not much I can do, can I?

1139
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:01,117
Are you okay with that?

1140
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,213
Yeah.

1141
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,607
Thanks mom.

1142
01:25:58,919 --> 01:26:01,019
I've spoken to the manager

1143
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,621
of Bangkok Glass team, son.

1144
01:26:02,622 --> 01:26:04,222
What did he say?

1145
01:26:04,223 --> 01:26:05,523
He said,

1146
01:26:05,524 --> 01:26:07,691
maybe he'll accept you for training camp

1147
01:26:07,692 --> 01:26:10,194
of Bangkok Glass League.

1148
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:12,896
Hope he's not kidding about this?

1149
01:26:12,897 --> 01:26:15,298
Nobody jokes about things like that.

1150
01:26:15,299 --> 01:26:17,100
Just be ready,

1151
01:26:17,101 --> 01:26:18,502
maybe you'll have to move

1152
01:26:18,503 --> 01:26:22,495
to Bangkok after high school.

1153
01:26:23,806 --> 01:26:25,706
Dad.

1154
01:26:25,707 --> 01:26:27,299
Thank you.

1155
01:26:42,088 --> 01:26:45,089
You should've told me,

1156
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:49,083
I would've applied for the grant to go with you.

1157
01:26:49,595 --> 01:26:51,194
Sorry,

1158
01:26:51,195 --> 01:26:55,188
I was really preoccupied.

1159
01:26:57,101 --> 01:26:58,501
I think the director

1160
01:26:58,502 --> 01:27:01,203
has found a new P.E. Replacement.

1161
01:27:01,204 --> 01:27:05,507
You're just irreplaceable,

1162
01:27:05,508 --> 01:27:07,709
I can confirm that.

1163
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:12,680
May I ask for something from you before you leave?

1164
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:15,282
What can I do for you?

1165
01:27:15,283 --> 01:27:18,885
This...

1166
01:27:18,886 --> 01:27:20,786
Maybe too much to ask from you?

1167
01:27:27,593 --> 01:27:31,896
I asked for you heart but got a whistle.

1168
01:27:31,897 --> 01:27:33,798
There's...

1169
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:35,699
the new P.E. Teacher.

1170
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:45,774
I think you should hurry and be on your way,

1171
01:27:45,775 --> 01:27:48,077
you might miss your flight.

1172
01:27:48,078 --> 01:27:51,980
I feel occupied all of a sudden. Bye now.

1173
01:28:02,089 --> 01:28:05,891
You don't waste your time at all.

1174
01:28:05,892 --> 01:28:07,093
Hello...

1175
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:08,294
Aren't you the new P.E. Teacher?

1176
01:28:08,295 --> 01:28:09,995
Yes.
What's your name?

1177
01:28:09,996 --> 01:28:11,796
I'm Boat.

1178
01:28:11,797 --> 01:28:14,598
I'd love a boat ride.

1179
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:18,302
"Bye bye Junior. Hello Senior!"

1180
01:28:18,303 --> 01:28:20,770
"It's summer break again."

1181
01:28:20,771 --> 01:28:24,374
Why won't you stay for high school?

1182
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:25,875
I just love the pink uniform

1183
01:28:25,876 --> 01:28:29,578
of the technical school I applied for.

1184
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:31,179
Very very pretty.

1185
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:35,173
So the whole school's in pink?

1186
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:02,873
Monday, I wait.

1187
01:29:02,874 --> 01:29:09,677
Tuesday I still wait for you.

1188
01:29:11,381 --> 01:29:16,684
Wednesday, you never show up.

1189
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:20,387
Thursday, all are empty.

1190
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:25,091
Friday, Saturday or Sunday,

1191
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:29,662
not a day goes by without missing you.

1192
01:29:29,663 --> 01:29:32,663
We can never turn back time.

1193
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:45,175
To the day we met, the day we got closer,

1194
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:50,879
the day we held hands,

1195
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,185
the day I love you, the day I told you,

1196
01:29:56,186 --> 01:29:59,954
the day you dream.

1197
01:29:59,955 --> 01:30:03,957
No matter how long,

1198
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:08,361
how many months or years,

1199
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:16,667
my memories of you shall remain.

1200
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,370
Cheer,

1201
01:30:19,371 --> 01:30:23,273
I'm sorry.

1202
01:30:23,274 --> 01:30:29,178
Your song is so cheesy.

1203
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:30,780
Why did you sing along?

1204
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:34,740
We're laughing at your song.

1205
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:39,254
Friday, Saturday or Sunday

1206
01:30:39,255 --> 01:30:43,057
not a day goes by without missing you.

1207
01:30:43,058 --> 01:30:50,965
We can never turn back time...

1208
01:30:53,767 --> 01:30:55,267
Nam.

1209
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:57,069
We heard from Prof.

1210
01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:04,876
In while we were buying ice cream
at the market that your...

1211
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:07,444
your exam result...

1212
01:31:07,445 --> 01:31:09,646
What about my exam result?

1213
01:31:09,647 --> 01:31:11,848
That you are the top of the class.

1214
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:15,251
I thought so...

1215
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,853
Right.
I'm the top of the class.

1216
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:23,558
Mom, I'm top of the class this semester.

1217
01:31:23,559 --> 01:31:28,462
You'll get to see your dad now.

1218
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:29,964
I'll get to see dad, get to see dad.

1219
01:31:29,965 --> 01:31:33,366
Dad...

1220
01:31:33,367 --> 01:31:34,867
I'll get to see dad.

1221
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,358
Can I kiss you for him?

1222
01:31:39,839 --> 01:31:44,743
I ranked 8 in my class, can I come too?

1223
01:31:44,744 --> 01:31:46,443
Sure.

1224
01:31:46,444 --> 01:31:50,047
I'll bring you some toys and sweets.

1225
01:31:50,048 --> 01:31:52,248
I'm going to the states.

1226
01:31:52,249 --> 01:31:56,242
Bring us back some snow please.

1227
01:32:01,858 --> 01:32:04,559
You got it?

1228
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,160
Is 50 Baht, okay?

1229
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,963
It's a 100 Bath, take it or leave it.

1230
01:32:08,964 --> 01:32:12,632
I had to sneak in, almost got bitten by stray dogs.

1231
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:14,834
70 Baht?

1232
01:32:14,835 --> 01:32:18,137
Leave it then.

1233
01:32:18,138 --> 01:32:22,131
No, give it to me.

1234
01:32:26,745 --> 01:32:28,746
He's cute.

1235
01:32:28,747 --> 01:32:30,347
Is he your boyfriend?

1236
01:32:30,348 --> 01:32:33,050
It's Bam's girlfriend.

1237
01:32:33,051 --> 01:32:38,054
No, I just took the photo for her.

1238
01:32:38,055 --> 01:32:42,048
Please don't tell mom.

1239
01:32:45,728 --> 01:32:47,729
Mom, Pang's...

1240
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:48,730
Nam.

1241
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:50,631
Yes?

1242
01:32:50,632 --> 01:32:56,035
Pang's hungry, is the food ready?

1243
01:32:56,036 --> 01:32:59,631
Almost done, dear.

1244
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:04,443
Just be a good girl, okay?

1245
01:33:04,444 --> 01:33:07,045
What about you?

1246
01:33:07,046 --> 01:33:09,447
What about my money?

1247
01:33:09,448 --> 01:33:11,249
Come on have some snacks, kids.

1248
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,550
Thank you...

1249
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:14,951
Snack on these first, okay?

1250
01:33:17,054 --> 01:33:21,013
Does Shone knows how you feel about him?

1251
01:33:23,226 --> 01:33:26,829
You've like him since first year.

1252
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:28,930
I don't think you should tell him,

1253
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:32,533
so it can be a world record that a silly girl

1254
01:33:32,534 --> 01:33:35,335
has been in love with him for 3 years

1255
01:33:35,336 --> 01:33:37,531
without him knowing.

1256
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:46,245
Maybe you'll never
see him again for the rest of your life.

1257
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,840
Aren't you going to anything about it?

1258
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:56,520
I've done everything the book says, haven't I?

1259
01:33:56,521 --> 01:34:00,823
We're here to support you, what are you afraid of?

1260
01:34:00,824 --> 01:34:03,626
You pretty, smart,

1261
01:34:03,627 --> 01:34:09,331
nice and cheesy.

1262
01:34:09,332 --> 01:34:11,133
How can he not fall for you?

1263
01:34:11,134 --> 01:34:13,932
Is that a compliment?

1264
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:18,539
Tip No. 10 from Thailand is probably

1265
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,531
the best and straight to the point.

1266
01:34:27,514 --> 01:34:29,515
This is for you, sign here.

1267
01:34:29,516 --> 01:34:31,916
Thank you.
Sign here...

1268
01:34:33,018 --> 01:34:37,011
Take my photo...

1269
01:34:38,723 --> 01:34:42,025
Love...

1270
01:34:42,026 --> 01:34:45,518
Write on top right there.

1271
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:50,923
Thank you.

1272
01:34:53,135 --> 01:34:55,433
"On top"

1273
01:35:11,818 --> 01:35:14,218
Go, girl.

1274
01:35:36,805 --> 01:35:39,607
The pool's out of order, sorry.

1275
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:43,601
Hey, you haven't signed my shirt.

1276
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:50,316
Shone...

1277
01:35:50,317 --> 01:35:52,512
I have something to tell you.

1278
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:58,423
I really like you. I've liked you for 3 years.

1279
01:35:58,424 --> 01:36:01,325
I've done everything I could for you to notice me.

1280
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:02,926
I...

1281
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:05,028
I've tried out for a dancer,

1282
01:36:05,029 --> 01:36:06,897
been in a play, a drum major

1283
01:36:06,898 --> 01:36:09,799
and even studied harder.

1284
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,201
But I realized that I shouldn't have been

1285
01:36:11,202 --> 01:36:14,803
straightforward with you
about my feelings a long time ago.

1286
01:36:14,804 --> 01:36:20,401
I just want to tell you that I like you.

1287
01:36:42,694 --> 01:36:46,186
"Pin loves Shone"

1288
01:36:54,304 --> 01:36:58,297
Pin and you...

1289
01:37:07,715 --> 01:37:10,918
Since when?

1290
01:37:10,919 --> 01:37:13,183
Just last week.

1291
01:37:17,891 --> 01:37:21,893
You two are together.

1292
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:24,196
What a perfect match.

1293
01:37:24,197 --> 01:37:26,097
You guys make a great couple.

1294
01:37:30,502 --> 01:37:35,004
I wish you both good luck.

1295
01:37:35,005 --> 01:37:35,494
Nam!

1296
01:37:38,308 --> 01:37:41,810
Nam.

1297
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:46,080
I'm okay...

1298
01:37:46,081 --> 01:37:48,572
Nam.

1299
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:00,693
You guys are perfect.

1300
01:38:00,694 --> 01:38:05,296
Nam, are you all right?

1301
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:07,492
Nam.

1302
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:19,573
Let her go.

1303
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:30,876
What wrong?

1304
01:38:34,589 --> 01:38:36,079
Pin.

1305
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,884
Hi dad.

1306
01:39:09,885 --> 01:39:13,082
Welcome to Glass Rabbit Junior Team.

1307
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,590
Thank you dad.

1308
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:21,093
This is Uncle Neng, Bangkok Glass Team Manager.

1309
01:39:21,094 --> 01:39:23,296
Hello...

1310
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:26,765
This is Uncle Nguan, the coach.

1311
01:39:26,766 --> 01:39:29,963
Thank you all.

1312
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:32,770
Yeah!

1313
01:39:32,771 --> 01:39:34,471
He's happy!

1314
01:39:34,472 --> 01:39:37,669
Congratulations, son.

1315
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:47,182
Pack your things, you're leaving tonight with them.

1316
01:39:47,183 --> 01:39:48,384
The training camp starts tomorrow.

1317
01:39:48,385 --> 01:39:50,485
Tonight?

1318
01:39:50,486 --> 01:39:52,477
What are you waiting for, son?

1319
01:40:35,157 --> 01:40:39,651
"This scrap book is funny, it shows how hard you try."

1320
01:40:41,563 --> 01:40:43,360
Home safe.

1321
01:40:47,368 --> 01:40:51,668
"Just want to let you know that,
you had my heart since we met."

1322
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,279
She looks the same,

1323
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,581
a Snow white in braces.

1324
01:41:04,582 --> 01:41:06,948
"I told Pin that you look the same."

1325
01:41:09,152 --> 01:41:11,848
"You look cute as usual."

1326
01:41:15,157 --> 01:41:16,657
"I held your hand for the first time,"

1327
01:41:16,658 --> 01:41:18,058
"but had to let go, so no one would suspect."

1328
01:41:26,968 --> 01:41:30,267
"I tasted an apple I gave you."

1329
01:41:48,452 --> 01:41:49,653
"You're doing much better now. Keep it up."

1330
01:41:49,654 --> 01:41:52,645
Throw it up!

1331
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:07,667
"Love conquers all, especially fears."

1332
01:42:07,668 --> 01:42:10,770
"Planting a rose is a tough job."

1333
01:42:10,771 --> 01:42:13,137
It's from a friend of mine.

1334
01:42:19,244 --> 01:42:21,346
"I gave you a rose today,
but told you it was from a friend."

1335
01:42:21,347 --> 01:42:23,541
"I couldn't tell you the truth."

1336
01:42:33,657 --> 01:42:35,759
"Do you know it hurts me
to see Top said he loved you?"

1337
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,956
"How come we never have our moments?"

1338
01:42:50,638 --> 01:42:54,631
"I wish you could ride on my back."

1339
01:43:03,049 --> 01:43:05,750
Nam.

1340
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:07,446
Would you be my girlfriend?

1341
01:43:57,327 --> 01:44:00,730
Can I ask you a favor?

1342
01:44:00,731 --> 01:44:03,825
Could you not ask her out?

1343
01:44:58,646 --> 01:45:01,246
"9 years later"

1344
01:45:16,328 --> 01:45:19,525
There's a window on that side.

1345
01:45:22,533 --> 01:45:25,234
Kai, could you take the customer?

1346
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:27,032
I'll be right back.

1347
01:45:33,408 --> 01:45:37,401
Hello, handsome.

1348
01:45:39,814 --> 01:45:41,615
You're sleepy aren't you?

1349
01:45:41,616 --> 01:45:44,016
Sorry to bother you every time.

1350
01:45:44,017 --> 01:45:48,010
No problem, your kid is like mine.

1351
01:45:51,323 --> 01:45:53,524
Come on, don't be a cry baby.

1352
01:45:53,525 --> 01:45:56,027
Don't mess up my hair.

1353
01:45:56,028 --> 01:45:58,729
Gotta go now.

1354
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:00,425
Bye kiddo.

1355
01:46:02,133 --> 01:46:05,234
I wish his real dad would love him like this.

1356
01:46:05,235 --> 01:46:07,803
Come on now.

1357
01:46:07,804 --> 01:46:10,005
Call me.

1358
01:46:10,006 --> 01:46:12,707
Shone.

1359
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:17,811
Are you going to that TV show?

1360
01:46:17,812 --> 01:46:21,215
I don't know yet.

1361
01:46:21,216 --> 01:46:26,017
Bye Shone, say bye!

1362
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:31,810
Please hurry up!

1363
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:35,790
Continue to Break 2, are you ready?
-A min

1364
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,690
OK

1365
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:40,790
Clothing staffs ready?
- Yes

1366
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:43,720
No worry, it will be perfect!

1367
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,970
I'm ready now!

1368
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:54,430
Please relax.
Our show isn't formal.

1369
01:46:54,430 --> 01:46:54,930
Yes

1370
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,580
- You're so beautiful
-Thank you

1371
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:05,860
It's good that Nam is fashionable.

1372
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:09,210
If Nam was beautiful as mom like me....

1373
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,360
Teacher Boat!

1374
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,390
Hello

1375
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:23,070
Since that time,
I've rode the boat all this time.

1376
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,930
So envious!

1377
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:28,590
He likes to do sweet things

1378
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:33,750
I'm jealous

1379
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,390
He always surprises me

1380
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,060
Surprise again

1381
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:58,000
Uh.. That.. That is a rose

1382
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:01,020
I have to eat, if not he will sulk

1383
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:04,590
5..4..3..2..

1384
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,460
Now, we're here with Nam

1385
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,250
The designer of the beautiful clothes that we've just watched

1386
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:19,060
Hello

1387
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:28,940
Our fans may know her well
cause she is the designer in only a few of Thais that are famous in New York

1388
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,940
and this is the evidence

1389
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:50,390
This is only a part of her work

1390
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:55,830
Nam, do you know that...

1391
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,190
In Thailand, you're also well-known

1392
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:04,560
I still have to develop my skill

1393
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:09,250
So, what work will you do as you came back to Thailand?

1394
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:14,250
There's a brand that would like to organize a fashion show

1395
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:19,580
I think it's interesting, so I agree to do

1396
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:23,120
and because I want to come back

1397
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,290
I miss my mom

1398
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:28,690
Nam used to tell reporters that....

1399
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:31,490
When you were young
Umm... I'm sorry

1400
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:35,260
You were so ugly and had bad sense of fashion

1401
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:37,730
That's totally different from now

1402
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:42,560
What make you've changed yourself this much?

1403
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,290
Because, I fell in love some one

1404
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:48,290
falling in love?

1405
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:51,370
Could you tell the story?

1406
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:55,160
Yes, he was my senior

1407
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,280
M.4 senior

1408
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,790
He was a football player

1409
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:01,700
and very cute

1410
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,110
At that time, I.........

1411
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,560
Had bug face studying M.1

1412
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,950
Developed myself a lot

1413
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:13,780
If It could make me to be beautiful, to be better
I tried to do it

1414
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:18,090
and tried to study better so he might interest in me

1415
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:23,140
Did he know it, in the end?

1416
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:26,580
He knew but it didn't have a happy ending

1417
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:32,640
I went to study in the US

1418
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,920
to stay with my dad

1419
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,860
It's bad

1420
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:42,030
but when I think about it.
He is like....

1421
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:44,030
my inspiration

1422
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:47,550
He made me use the love in good way

1423
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:49,280
He is like....

1424
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,740
The power that support me to be better and better

1425
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,270
Till I am today's Nam

1426
01:50:55,270 --> 01:51:01,340
Khun Nam, you remember this notebook?

1427
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,480
You may recall it?

1428
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,140
Yes, I remember

1429
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:17,040
If so, let's welcome the owner of this book

1430
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:22,430
Shone, the former footballer of Bangkok glass

1431
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:39,200
Now, he's changed his career to be a pro-photographer

1432
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:43,600
I want to give it to Nam

1433
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,250
Nam???

1434
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:49,250
It's Nam's

1435
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:05,120
Please sit

1436
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:14,320
Shone, after you've never met Nam for 9 years.....

1437
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:17,950
Do you have something to tell Nam?

1438
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:22,780
I want to tell you that......

1439
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,930
This button

1440
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,930
is not mine

1441
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,230
It may be Ding's

1442
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:51,470
How about you Nam?
Do you have something to tell him?

1443
01:52:55,890 --> 01:53:00,810
I want to ask Shone that......

1444
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,280
Have you been married?

1445
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,490
Umm.........

1446
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,450
Um...I

1447
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:33,920
I have been waiting for someone to come back from the US

33
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:54,428
I'm fond of close up photos

34
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,332
because they reveal something more of

35
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,735
what we are unable to see in larger perspective.

36
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:05,037
When you take portrait photos,

37
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:08,406
what do you focus on?

38
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:12,400
I think I focus on the eyes.

39
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,915
You'll have to excuse me, the little one's crying.

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,521
Gosh! He's gorgeous

41
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:27,722
but too bad he has a baby already.

42
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:31,126
Hey, why are you crying? Are you hungry?

43
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:34,828
Are you a furious little baby?

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,131
You feel better now?

45
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:42,802
Everyone has special someone in their hearts.

46
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:50,008
The heart tinkles every time we think about them,

47
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,611
but they will always remain in our hearts.

48
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:55,013
Even though, I don't know...

49
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:59,016
how he's doing or where he is now.

50
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:06,222
At least, he has taught me about

51
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:08,824
my first love.

52
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,419
"A CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE"

53
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:47,090
No wonder why you wanna come here everyday.

54
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:51,084
What? He's got really weird scooter.

55
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:55,697
Hey look...

56
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:59,691
she's a very pretty thing!

57
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:09,009
He's gorgeous, no doubt you're so into him.

58
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm not into him at all.

59
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,513
"James Bean."

60
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,483
Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.

61
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,492
Follow me.
Okay.

62
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,188
This way please.

63
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,599
Hello...

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,201
I wondering if you have a room for tonight.

65
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,902
Yes, how long are you gonna stay here?

66
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:42,804
I think 3 nights.

67
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,705
American breakfast.

68
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:47,607
Fried rice and breakfast for this table, mom.

69
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,681
After you're done with that table,

70
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,182
can you go to the market for me?

71
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,383
Sure, mom.

72
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,578
Good girl.

73
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:04,388
How's school dear?

74
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,691
It's going well. I'm hanging out

75
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,191
with my old gang, Cheer, Kie and Nim.

76
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,792
You've been with them since first grade.

77
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,595
Aren't you sick of each other already?

78
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,396
Well, you wouldn't have
anyone else to hang out with,

79
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,799
even if you wanted to.

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,301
You guys are ugly ducklings.

81
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,291
There...

82
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,706
Let me tell you something,

83
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:25,807
who we hang out with

84
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,275
is not all about looks you know.

85
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:31,178
But how you look is the first impression.

86
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,080
Good that I took after you,

87
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,182
if I looked like dad,

88
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:39,085
I'll never have a boyfriend.

89
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,383
There!

90
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:44,889
Enough you two,

91
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,692
you're too old to fight.

92
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:53,696
Don't talk like that about your father,

93
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:57,100
if he hears you he'll be upset.

94
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,060
Now go, be on your way.

95
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,971
He's in the states. He can't hear me.

96
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,177
You want some mangoes?

97
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:40,559
Mangoes?

98
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:47,075
The new seniors are so cute.

99
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:50,878
Yes, I was in all girls school since kindergarten,

100
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,479
so sick of that.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,081
Have you got it?

102
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:57,083
Yes, mine adds up to 28.

103
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,085
25-35,

104
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:01,487
you're compatible with men who're leaders,

105
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,188
warm and kind.

106
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,148
Must be Tong, the Chairman of Buddhist Club.

107
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:09,860
Cheer got 15.

108
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,462
15-25

109
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:15,965
you're compatible with athletes, just and fair.

110
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:18,662
Must be Ken, the basketball player over there.

111
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:29,777
Couldn't be him.

112
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:32,576
Mine must be a bad boy.

113
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,482
That's quite right.

114
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,884
It must be...

115
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,486
Meaw,

116
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,148
tough guy.

117
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,257
Kie.

118
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:48,560
30, Nam got 30

119
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,262
30, you're compatible with artists,

120
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:53,465
unique and artistic.

121
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,661
Who must he be?

122
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:06,966
You seem a little down for English class.

123
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,873
Could you be a little more active like during lunch?

124
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,751
Don't smile just yet.

125
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,853
You seem to be doing well only in English.

126
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:23,656
Other subjects are so bad.

127
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:25,358
You little ugly duckling!

128
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:29,962
Today, we'll be studying grammar from song lyrics,

129
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,064
please pass on the paper.

130
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:37,869
His name is Shone, he's a junior.

131
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,863
He has quite a reputation.

132
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:46,166
Maybe it's just a rumor.

133
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:51,346
Students, if we change A to E

134
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,548
in the word 'inspiration',

135
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:57,542
it becomes a verb 'inspire'.

136
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:00,654
Two girls left the school because of him.

137
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,156
So better stay away from him.

138
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,657
You know?

139
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:05,658
Yes...

140
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,461
My friend's sister went to the same school as Shone.

141
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:08,461
Really?
Yes.

142
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:09,759
Do you think the story is true?

143
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:12,854
What are you guys talking about?

144
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,630
But I'm teaching...

145
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:28,144
Cheer.

146
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,646
Stand up.

147
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:34,640
What does 'You are the inspiration' means?

148
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:38,753
What does it mean?

149
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,755
Just moment.

150
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:43,857
You inspire me.

151
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,258
Yes...

152
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,160
You're the inspiration.

153
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,433
You're the inspiration.

154
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,535
Everyone is inspired by someone.

155
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:00,038
Even I'm inspired

156
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,740
by someone...

157
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,142
Sit down.

158
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,443
Thank you teacher.

159
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,945
All right.

160
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:11,948
Let's read all together now.

161
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,851
You are the inspiration...

162
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,251
Again.

163
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:39,828
Akarin, would you solve this equation, please?

164
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,837
Who did this?

165
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,042
Prof. Orn.

166
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,843
It's in.

167
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:07,112
You're good. When are you going

168
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,813
to try out for school team.

169
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:10,914
Playing just for fun is much better.

170
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:13,617
You're still scared? Come on let's play.

171
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:16,218
Shone...

172
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,220
Hey, I'll be right back.

173
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:20,122
Who is that girl?
Who?

174
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:23,320
Why is Shone talking to her?

175
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,030
Or maybe she's his ex?

176
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:33,534
That's not true!

177
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,332
Sorry.

178
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,520
Uncle Chang!

179
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,823
Mom, Nam, Uncle Chang's here.

180
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,224
Hello, we miss you so much.

181
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:05,127
Uncle Chang...

182
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:06,720
Hello, Chang.

183
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,033
Hey, Pang, long time no see,

184
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:13,900
you head still smells funky.

185
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,703
Oh, Nam? You're all grown up now,

186
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,005
I hardly recognize you.

187
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:22,108
Hey Pim, oh...

188
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,910
Hey, uncle.

189
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,710
Are you that sleepy?

190
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,912
I think it's jet lag.

191
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,614
I haven't adjusted to Thailand's time yet.

192
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,915
Here we go again.

193
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,315
Hey, hold it!

194
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,821
Is my dad as fat as you are?

195
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:40,523
Your dad is working as a sous chef.

196
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,925
He's doing all the heavy jobs,

197
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:45,627
he's very buff right now.

198
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:47,789
I have a photo from him to show you.

199
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, let me see.

200
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,696
Hey... wait.

201
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:00,206
Pim,

202
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:04,701
your man said he'll transfer more money this month.

203
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:10,205
He told me to tell you that...

204
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,518
I promise,

205
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,522
I'll pay off the mortgage of this house,

206
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:21,191
you and kids hang in there.

207
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:25,185
He should visit us sometimes.

208
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,199
He said that if one of you

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,100
can be top of the class,

210
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:36,094
he'll send to a ticket to visit him in the states.

211
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:40,908
The airfare is quite expensive.

212
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,409
Do you think he'll keep his promise, mom?

213
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,113
He knows that being top of class

214
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:51,107
is quite difficult, dear.

215
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:55,787
You'll see.

216
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:58,189
I will be the top of my class,

217
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,987
so he knows I can do it.

218
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,586
You're going to the top from the rank 30?

219
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,294
2 strawberry soda and 2 orange soda please.

220
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:18,297
Hey, 2 Pepsi, I'm so thirsty.

221
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,008
How can you do this?

222
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,010
I'm just really thirsty,

223
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:26,213
do you have a problem with that?

224
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:29,481
Haven't you heard that men, children,

225
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,584
and basketball players get the privileges

226
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,786
at this school.

227
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:35,187
And I'm a basketball player.

228
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:39,180
Can I have 4 sodas for the soccer players please?

229
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,001
Will Pepsi do?

230
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:53,594
Yes...

231
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,065
Darn it!

232
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,579
Hey, don't kick at me.

233
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,174
Sorry... don't you get it?

234
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:16,887
Hey!

235
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:24,585
Hey... I can handle this.

236
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,099
Nam, Shone and Ding

237
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,902
are having a fight behind the school.

238
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:33,202
Stop...

239
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,471
Where are you going?

240
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:38,464
Let's take the scooter, it's faster, come on.

241
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,569
Hurry!

242
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,179
I think you can handle him.

243
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,589
So you want to be hero like your dad?

244
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,592
He was a loser and cost us National Championship.

245
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,494
Did you guys know

246
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,488
that he missed the penalty kick?

247
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,466
It took ages to make it to National Championship.

248
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,765
Darn it...

249
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:37,280
We just missed seeing Ding getting beat up.

250
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,559
Let's go.

251
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:48,166
Do you still want this soda he gave us?

252
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,267
If you're not going to drink it,

253
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,962
can I throw it away?

254
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,171
Do not drink.

255
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,572
Why is it in the freezer if you can't drink it?

256
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:38,274
All right students,

257
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:41,877
I have 2 announcements today.

258
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,179
Our school has become filthy due to littering,

259
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,048
and the students are ignorant.

260
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,051
So from now on,

261
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,454
anyone who litters will be fined 1 baht per piece.

262
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:55,255
I have a promotion if you think this is too expensive,

263
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,758
this is a great deal.

264
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,760
Pay 50 baht per day

265
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,762
and you can litter anytime and anywhere,

266
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:06,064
I'll just clean up after you.

267
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:10,368
Students with the following names

268
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:13,370
please proceed to Disciplinary Office,

269
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,672
Jakawan Class 4/5

270
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:18,275
and Achawin Class 4/7.

271
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:22,045
Everybody understand?

272
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,646
Understand?

273
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,247
Yes...

274
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:27,648
Thank you. I love you.

275
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:36,751
Cross your arms.

276
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,963
If you get into fights again,

277
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,365
I'll inform your parents, do you hear me?

278
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,067
Shone, you have great talent,

279
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:50,269
in photography.

280
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,071
Why don't you enter
the provincial photography contest?

281
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:54,639
I think you should apply for it.

282
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,740
Maybe you can do something for our school,

283
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,441
instead of wasting your time fighting.

284
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,644
Do you understand me?

285
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,244
Yes, sir.
You may go now.

286
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:03,046
Thank you.

287
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,344
Next.

288
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:15,557
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

289
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,357
I'm really sorry.

290
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,759
It's okay.

291
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,261
It's not your fault.

292
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:25,665
Band aids for you.

293
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,429
Get well soon.

294
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,233
Nam.

295
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,637
Thank you.

296
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,449
Yes, he knows my name.

297
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,152
He actually knows my name.

298
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:52,849
He knows my name.

299
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,660
What?

300
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:01,429
They actually have books like this?

301
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,422
Oh... 20 ways to get your guy.

302
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,632
There goes the 'White Ribbon' girls.

303
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,641
I'll be right back.

304
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,042
Look at her,

305
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,944
since when is she friends with them?

306
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,550
Is she for real?

307
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,951
I miss my dad,

308
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:32,754
I haven't seen him for 5 years now.

309
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,322
Earn,

310
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,424
Kai's now in love with me,

311
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,226
because of this book.

312
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:41,729
Really? This book really works?

313
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,732
Yeah, Pooh also bought this book

314
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,432
before she got together with Toh.

315
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,334
9 love tips really works.

316
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,139
You're not going with them anymore?

317
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,133
No, they're saying I outshine them.

318
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,317
Tip No. 1.

319
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:11,311
Greek belief on how to win someone's heart,

320
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:15,024
look at the stars in the sky,

321
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,326
connect the stars with your fingers

322
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,527
to make the name of someone you love in Latin.

323
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,031
Hey, wait up!

324
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,432
Hey, I can't do it.

325
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:27,935
Nam, why don't you join us?

326
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,929
No, I think it's nonsense.

327
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,241
Gotta get this right.

328
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,436
I'm going to do it at home.

329
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:41,605
We're going, Nam. Later!

330
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,317
You're practicing real hard.

331
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:27,820
Do you have a soccer match somewhere?

332
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:29,419
Just around here.

333
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,513
Hey, I can't!
Catch!

334
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:37,026
I told you I can't, watch where you kick.

335
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,929
I though you were Chinese?

336
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,923
My ancestral accent comes out every time I'm upset!

337
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,701
Come on.

338
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:51,005
Look at this, Shone.

339
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:52,506
How about it?

340
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:55,008
A poster of the 3rd Photography Contest

341
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,609
that you asked about.

342
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,907
I see.

343
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,315
Look at him. He can play soccer day

344
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,117
and night on the streets

345
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:08,419
but refuses to join his school team.

346
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,920
He's just having fun,

347
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,023
I don't think he's taking soccer seriously.

348
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,515
Even if he is, he wouldn't join the team.

349
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,797
I should've scored that penalty kick.

350
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:25,900
Here you go again, don't blame yourself.

351
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,803
Maybe he's not really feeling ashamed

352
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,704
about what you did.

353
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:34,308
Or even if he is, he has to get over it by himself.

354
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,302
Look at you now, how far you've come.

355
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:49,321
You look a bit strange.

356
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:53,590
Look, I have new braces for my teeth,

357
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,292
do you like them?

358
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,694
They don't look anything special to me.

359
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,997
Hey, here, look here.

360
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,091
I still don't like them.

361
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:08,303
Hey, you picked Ken?

362
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:09,705
Yes,

363
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:12,907
eat now,

364
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:15,609
eat now.

365
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,812
Yes, he ate.

366
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:21,715
Are you crazy? He's in the middle of his lunch.

367
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,216
This is not hypnotizing.

368
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:27,486
What are you guys doing?

369
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:29,687
Tip no. 2,

370
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:31,889
from Mayan, the indigenous people,

371
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,691
concentrate

372
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:35,393
and look at the one you love,

373
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:37,194
try to hypnotize him

374
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,795
to do what you want.

375
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:41,098
If he acts as you ordered,

376
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,000
it means that he is your soulmate.

377
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,809
Hey, he turned around.

378
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,510
Who...

379
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,113
Oh, no one.

380
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,482
Are you hypnotizing Shone?

381
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:01,681
No...

382
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:03,383
I didn't do anything.

383
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:07,377
I though you said this book is nonsense.

384
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:13,191
Well, taking beliefs from different culture

385
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,693
and various islands is kinda weird.

386
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:16,495
Then why are you following the book?

387
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:18,195
I... hey!

388
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:21,898
You can tell us the truth.

389
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't wanna be teased.

390
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,902
Don't you worry about that.

391
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:29,896
Because we will definitely tease you.

392
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,307
Tip No. 3.

393
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:34,375
Scottish way of saying you love someone.

394
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:38,079
Give a gift to someone anonymously,

395
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
just for the person to know

396
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:43,678
that someone has a crush on him.

397
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:46,786
This jelly is mine.

398
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:50,279
How can you drop it?

399
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:57,695
Thank you so much, Prof. Pol.

400
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,296
Salted eggs.

401
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,598
Oh, I must be on your mind

402
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,902
when you were travelling.

403
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:08,070
I'll finish it all,

404
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,072
thank you so much.

405
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:13,074
Thank you.

406
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:15,677
Prof. Pol's eggs.

407
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:18,079
Prof. Pol's eggs and some salts.

408
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,881
Prof. Pol's salted eggs, it's correct.

409
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:23,083
Prof. Pol brought me eggs.

410
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:27,077
Prof. Pol's salted eggs...

411
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,594
Oh, don't tell me...

412
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,395
Yes, there's from Prof. Pol.

413
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,297
How many boxes have you got?

414
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:42,063
4 boxes.
4 boxes?

415
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,263
Salted eggs.

416
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,867
Hope you can finish them all.

417
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,865
See you.

418
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:59,872
Oh, no!

419
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:02,885
My scooter's ruined!

420
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:06,878
I forgot we live in a tropical country.

421
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:15,058
Mangoes?

422
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:17,964
People give flowers and handkerchiefs,

423
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:21,266
what's so romantic about mangoes?

424
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:25,260
Hey, look over there.

425
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:29,864
Cool dude! Go...

426
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:35,568
Mango cake, I made it myself.

427
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,382
Thank you, looks delicious.

428
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:42,683
Are you okay?

429
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,385
I'm all right.

430
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:48,345
Okay, we're dead.

431
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:52,158
She only has to do that.

432
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,662
She's adorable and she bakes.

433
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:59,965
How can you beat that?

434
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,957
Better find another boy.

435
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:10,374
Actually I already have a date,

436
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,876
but if you invite me over for dinner

437
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:13,176
at your place,

438
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:16,578
and this is would be our first date...

439
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:20,749
If you're not free, that's okay.

440
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,052
Next semester then.

441
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,253
Oh, wait,

442
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:30,247
actually I'm free, I accept your invitation.

443
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,553
See you later this evening.

444
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:45,670
This dinner is not just for the two of us?

445
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:47,072
It's not actually a dinner,

446
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,473
it's a party for the end of semester,

447
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,875
a lot of our colleagues are coming,

448
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,343
it'll be fun.

449
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,936
Oh, okay.

450
00:28:58,448 --> 00:28:59,548
Prof. Orn.

451
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:02,151
Prof.

452
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:05,553
I never give up.

453
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:07,855
This time it's war.

454
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:11,155
That's my answer sheet.

455
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,162
Higher...

456
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,663
Prof.

457
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,655
Lift me higher, Nam.

458
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,767
I got it.

459
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:25,170
We have to make Shone give Nam a lift home.

460
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,638
Yes...

461
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,641
It's your once in a lifetime wish isn't it?

462
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:32,142
Yeah.

463
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:39,248
He gives you mangoes after he drives you,

464
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,342
how romantic is that.

465
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:47,055
You have to pretend your scooter's broken.

466
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:48,857
How?

467
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:51,559
He'll know once he tries to fix it.

468
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,660
That's true.

469
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,362
You must lose your keys.

470
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:56,863
How?

471
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,533
It's here.

472
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:01,735
Hey...

473
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,636
It's gone.

474
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:07,630
Hey, there he is.

475
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,245
Mango cake girl, what's wrong?

476
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,448
I tripped and must have sprained my ankle.

477
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,051
Come, I'll give you a lift.

478
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,952
That's all right!

479
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,857
Come on, let me take you home.

480
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:31,656
I'm a little clumsy.

481
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:44,837
What a show!

482
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,039
She went to acting school or what?

483
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,344
"Bye Bye Grade 7. See you all Grade 8."

484
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:56,347
Mom, come see this.

485
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:57,648
Pang, you little brat.

486
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:01,642
Mom, Nam has a boyfriend.

487
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:07,222
Nam, I think this can wait until you grow up.

488
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:10,125
You're going away to see your dad,

489
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:14,119
concentrate on your school, dear.

490
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:31,843
Hey, Cheer.

491
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,645
Your little sister said

492
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:35,147
you've been depressed for weeks now.

493
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,449
Listening to sad tunes all week.

494
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,409
I thought you must have gotten over Shone by now.

495
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,321
Keep your voice down, mom might hear us.

496
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:49,315
She's off to the market already.

497
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:52,922
Don't push me.

498
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,832
When's your mom going to expand these stairs?

499
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,427
Hey, Nam, hear one more tip okay?

500
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,837
Tip no. 7

501
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,841
is from the Gypsies, let love inspire you.

502
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,642
The power of love shall make you smarter,

503
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:13,712
prettier and better in every way,

504
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:16,415
then that person will finally notice you.

505
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,008
Hey what?

506
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:28,225
Shone is gorgeous so Nam should be beautiful...

507
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:31,127
Okay, do that later, my skin's coming off now.

508
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,132
What is this?

509
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,031
Turmeric.

510
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,092
Let's go.

511
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:32,312
Hey, hello girls.

512
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:34,713
Let me know how I can help you okay?

513
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:37,706
Have a look around.

514
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,029
"Pornchai missed PK."

515
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,298
"Failed to hand Provincial cup."

516
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,900
I don't see him anywhere.

517
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,601
Maybe he's not home.

518
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:03,905
He's probably out. I don't see his scooter.

519
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:07,908
Have you found what you're looking for?

520
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:11,902
Yes, this one.

521
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,709
What are you buying?

522
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:26,885
You guys play table tennis?

523
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:33,190
Why are you so yellow?

524
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:39,501
Do you have jaundice?

525
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,704
Shone.

526
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,005
Mango cake girl.

527
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:44,004
Are you here to buy something?

528
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,507
I need a dozen of table tennis balls.

529
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:47,600
Come, I'll get them for you.

530
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:58,017
Come on kids, join my Drama Club.

531
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,219
Drama Club, anyone?

532
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,786
We have a lot of plays for you.

533
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,089
You can be a princess or a prince.

534
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,289
You can star in our plays.

535
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,992
The lords of comedy were in my club.

536
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:09,094
Anyone interested?

537
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:10,594
Join us?

538
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:13,297
Father of talk show was also in our club.

539
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:15,100
Really?
If you wanna make it in the business,

540
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,400
this is your chance.

541
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:20,393
Join us, dear? Don't pass over me.

542
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:27,209
Take off your glasses.

543
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,111
Your glasses.

544
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:30,912
Hey, but I feel awkward without them.

545
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:33,014
I think we totally don't fit with that

546
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:35,482
pretty-polis-posh concept

547
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,684
of that Dancing Arts Club.

548
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:41,987
Prof. Orn always selects the smartest and prettiest

549
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:43,189
for her club and when they perform,

550
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,190
the whole school goes to see them.

551
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:50,094
Unlike those weirdos in Drama Club,

552
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:52,196
no one ever watches their plays.

553
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:55,198
Well, it's worth giving it a try.

554
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,502
We maybe a little dark,

555
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:01,404
a little dorky but pretty in our own ways.

556
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,776
Shone,

557
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:09,978
which club are you joining?

558
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:12,280
Photography.

559
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:16,274
Whenever you need a model, just let me know.

560
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,683
I like photographing landscapes, not people.

561
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,990
Are you kidding me?

562
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,291
If you say so.

563
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,988
Come on, get in the frame.

564
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
You're not yellow anymore,

565
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:54,882
your skin seems lighter?

566
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:56,484
Maybe...

567
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:58,783
a little.

568
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:04,681
I'll be watching your performance okay?

569
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,968
You see, Nam,

570
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,669
he said you look prettier,

571
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,271
keep up head high okay?

572
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,574
If we get to do dance performance,

573
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:25,274
would be fantastic!

574
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:28,277
We'll be so pretty and fabulous.

575
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:30,779
If you're not sure that you're pretty enough,

576
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,782
you're always welcome in other clubs, you know?

577
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,884
Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.

578
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:39,887
I wasn't talk to you, I was talking to Funn, right?

579
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:41,589
Liar,

580
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,581
you said it to us.

581
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:52,564
Stop it, girls.

582
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:55,363
I don't want any troublemakers in my club.

583
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:59,670
Wait...

584
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:03,664
Faye and Funn, stay behind.

585
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,860
Nam...

586
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:30,363
I'm sorry about earlier.

587
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:31,764
I have to apologize too.

588
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,164
Yeah.

589
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:39,861
I bought extra drink, you can have it.

590
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:43,974
Wait,

591
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:46,976
let her drink it first.

592
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:50,680
Why won't you drink it.

593
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:51,581
Go.

594
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,449
If you don't want a drink spiked

595
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,443
with fish sauce, throw it away.

596
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:03,050
How can she do that?

597
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:09,863
There you are, I was looking all over for you.

598
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:11,665
Look at me

599
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,665
and smile...

600
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,567
Frown...

601
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,870
Laugh,

602
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,070
oh perfect!

603
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,873
See you tomorrow at the auditorium okay?

604
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:23,475
Professor.

605
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:24,776
Keep your voice down,

606
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:26,743
I'm only accepting a few students.

607
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,541
Understand?

608
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:34,341
Can I have some?

609
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:40,155
Prof. In,

610
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:42,958
oh, what's wrong?

611
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,658
Are you okay?

612
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:46,260
Are you all right?

613
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,463
Are you okay?

614
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:53,266
Prof. In.

615
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,268
How can I help you, sir?

616
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,270
Nothing, how are you?

617
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm fine.

618
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,941
See you tomorrow.

619
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:06,035
I'm fine.

620
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:08,547
Water, need water.

621
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,747
No...

622
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:13,450
It's a perfect match and I mean it.

623
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:15,552
Prof. In.

624
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:17,354
Maybe I shouldn't let you do the play,

625
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:18,854
if you're this late.

626
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:19,655
Okay...

627
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:23,158
Oh, wait!

628
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,260
I was just joking!

629
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:28,663
We meant to tell you that...

630
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:30,564
No worries,

631
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,366
I'll give you the best parts.

632
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:35,135
We meant to tell you...

633
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,636
Come on, help me out...

634
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:39,438
We want to dance...

635
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,432
dance...

636
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:46,044
in you play,
dance...

637
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,037
because we're so happy to be in your play.

638
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,554
This year, I proudly present the play called

639
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:03,858
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"

640
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:09,030
Nam, your English is better than the rest.

641
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,232
You play Snow white okay?

642
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:13,734
Me?

643
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:18,638
Yes... ready! Oh, a rabbit,

644
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,440
what are you doing here?

645
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,841
I'm here to paint.

646
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:25,244
Then what are you doing inside the box?

647
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:28,646
I bought interior paint.

648
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:31,047
Go paint elsewhere.

649
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,751
Wait a second,

650
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:37,154
get me all phone numbers of those

651
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:38,850
in Art Production.

652
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:43,426
My students are so gifted in acting,

653
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:46,127
I'm sure it's gonna be a great play.

654
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,830
Are you all right? Are you sick?

655
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:50,232
No.

656
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,334
I feel fine.

657
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:56,937
Oh, maybe you're not used to my natural beauty.

658
00:41:56,938 --> 00:42:00,039
Lipsticks are waste of money.

659
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,641
And most importantly,

660
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:05,644
I just wanna give someone a head start.

661
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:09,948
Perhaps you went a little too far?

662
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,550
Let's compete with our work.

663
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:12,651
Because judging from our looks,

664
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:14,118
we're neck and neck.

665
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,822
I've trained the students to put make up on

666
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:19,814
like my natural style.

667
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:25,919
And this is how you get the natural look.

668
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:34,126
Are you sure you've trained them?

669
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:39,130
It this a play or a circus?

670
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:41,942
Could be a circus, Prof. Orn.

671
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:45,936
This is the kids' creativity.

672
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:02,126
You're going home?

673
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:03,219
Yes.

674
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,932
Shone.

675
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,405
Home safe.

676
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:28,814
She was walking fine

677
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,215
when she got here wasn't she?

678
00:43:41,225 --> 00:43:42,926
Professor.
Yes.

679
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:44,827
Would you like some water?
Thank you.

680
00:43:57,707 --> 00:44:02,309
My football's going to be out of air.

681
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,612
Sorry about that.

682
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,513
This is Pin, a junior,

683
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:09,015
she'll be taking care of

684
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,817
costumes and make-up for our play.

685
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:13,309
May I have a round of applause for Pin.

686
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,022
Please take care of this for me, Pin.

687
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,424
I think we should get started.

688
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:22,827
Okay, let's get started with me.

689
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,529
I forgot I'm not in the play.

690
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,997
Let's start with Snow white then.

691
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,399
Start with me?

692
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,994
Yes, you first.

693
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:30,917
What do you think?

694
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:34,087
She looks the same to me.

695
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:36,079
Snow white with braces.

696
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:52,402
I don't want braces anymore.

697
00:45:52,403 --> 00:45:54,701
I wanna take them out.

698
00:45:57,407 --> 00:45:59,108
Nam, are you there?

699
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:02,110
Okay, ready. Stand by.

700
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:04,712
Where's the Prince?

701
00:46:04,713 --> 00:46:06,014
He has diarrhea.

702
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:09,974
On a final rehearsal? Is he crazy?

703
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:15,688
You... the painter.

704
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,690
Can you fill in for the Prince please?

705
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,791
Me?

706
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,885
Yes, be a Prince, it'll be quick.

707
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:27,098
Closer, get closer.

708
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:31,402
When I say action, lean towards her to kiss okay?

709
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:32,802
Action.

710
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:39,098
You so beautiful, I have to kiss you.

711
00:47:05,098 --> 00:47:07,396
Hey, Nam...

712
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:26,172
You're going to break you neck there.

713
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:31,877
Hey, too long already, go back to painting.

714
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:34,788
Nam standby. Koi, ready.

715
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,780
What?

716
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:43,591
Ready, action.

717
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:03,270
Hello, this is Pornchai Sports Shop.

718
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:10,585
May I please speak to Shone?

719
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,986
Shone speaking.

720
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:20,950
Hello...

721
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:35,368
He hung up.

722
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:05,365
Mirror mirror on the wall,

723
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:09,359
who is the most beautiful one of all?

724
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:16,274
Where are you going? Toilet?

725
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:17,875
The witch is here,

726
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:19,078
this is the climax of the play.

727
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,178
There's the witch.

728
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:24,481
Yes, eat.
Apple?

729
00:49:24,482 --> 00:49:26,643
Eat.

730
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,161
Look...

731
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:42,463
She's not dead.

732
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:45,366
She's gonna solve her problem, you'll see.

733
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:48,666
Death snow white... death.

734
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:57,366
No one informed me about our student

735
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,344
who won the provincial photography contest.

736
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:02,446
They just called to inform us now, sir.

737
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:05,849
Try to keep up with the performance

738
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,651
of our students okay?

739
00:50:07,652 --> 00:50:09,152
Hurry up.

740
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:10,453
Yes... I'm trying.

741
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:14,447
The iron's not working so well, sir.

742
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:19,558
Prof. Rabue, this is why.

743
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:25,456
Could you plug it for me?

744
00:50:26,968 --> 00:50:29,770
Will you marry me?

745
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,071
Yes, I will.

746
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:35,841
And so snow while and the prince

747
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:39,835
lives happily ever after.

748
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:46,350
Well done, students, great job!

749
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:49,553
You can still see the footprints.

750
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:51,155
I ironed, I didn't wash his shirt, sir.

751
00:50:51,156 --> 00:50:53,056
Do you want me to wash it?

752
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:55,458
We don't have time.

753
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:57,359
Don't forget your bag.

754
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:02,663
Get going now. Go.

755
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,256
Well done!

756
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:10,728
Dinner's on me tonight.

757
00:51:13,441 --> 00:51:14,942
"For Snow White, I tasted it for you,"

758
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,742
"it's not poisoned."

759
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,343
Hold on.

760
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:21,747
One more time, eat your heart out tonight,

761
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,841
my treat!

762
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:28,649
Let's pack up now.

763
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,255
For Snow white.

764
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,558
Who is it from? A bitten apple.

765
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,460
Must be from Shone.

766
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,061
You really think so?

767
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,329
You ugly thing!

768
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,322
Nam, maybe it's from that guy...

769
00:51:48,837 --> 00:51:50,637
Prince Frog.

770
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:54,631
Princess Frog and Prince Frog.

771
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:58,745
What a jerk, why didn't you come see the play?

772
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:02,739
I bet you were watching those dancers.

773
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:19,018
What a jerk!

774
00:52:25,535 --> 00:52:27,935
Mac doesn't feel a thing.

775
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,037
Hey, how's my little boy?

776
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:33,240
Hey, what brings you here?

777
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:34,441
Hello.

778
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:38,435
Guys, this is Top, my friend since kindergarten.

779
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:41,447
Hello...

780
00:52:41,448 --> 00:52:43,040
Hello.

781
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:46,812
He's cute.

782
00:52:51,623 --> 00:52:52,817
Hey!

783
00:52:56,528 --> 00:52:58,427
Let's go.

784
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,330
How long are you going to stay this time?

785
00:53:00,331 --> 00:53:02,431
Probably until my dad retires.

786
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,933
But if I can get into university,

787
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,234
I'll move to Bangkok with my mom.

788
00:53:05,235 --> 00:53:07,335
Cute!

789
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:09,031
Let's go see the cafeteria.

790
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,541
Hey, pretty girl,

791
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:15,242
what's your name?

792
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:18,344
Yes, you. What's your name?

793
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:24,416
Don't be shy. Going already?

794
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,408
You wanna a little fight with me, girl?

795
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,221
I think Prof. In put it on.

796
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:33,024
It's probably been showing all day.

797
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:34,515
Let's go.

798
00:53:35,928 --> 00:53:39,329
Hey, that's Snow white on TV.

799
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:43,232
She's cute. Does she have a boyfriend?

800
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,134
I don't think so but I don't think

801
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:47,136
you should ask her out.

802
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,137
Why not?

803
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:51,239
Isn't she too young?

804
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,199
Hey, I've asked for numbers of 5th graders before.

805
00:53:56,711 --> 00:54:00,013
"Bye Sophomore. Hello Junior!"

806
00:54:00,014 --> 00:54:02,005
"2 more subjects to make up for"
"Will follow you to Junior year!"

807
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:10,622
Shone, this is yours.

808
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,824
I thought so. Every time we play soccer,

809
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:15,626
you'll always have give me a penalty kick.

810
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,528
You do it.

811
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:20,030
Hey, you're still not over it?

812
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:21,532
Your dad must have forgotten about it by now.

813
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:24,734
It's not that. That was too easy.

814
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:27,003
Yeah right, Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo.

815
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:29,905
Top, can I take a photo with you?

816
00:54:29,906 --> 00:54:30,906
Yeah, sure.

817
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:32,407
Can I have one too?

818
00:54:32,408 --> 00:54:34,009
Then who's going to the photo for me?

819
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,010
Will you take one for me first?

820
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:37,912
I can take it for you.

821
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:40,108
Thank you...

822
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:42,916
A bit closer.

823
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,417
Okay...

824
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:48,411
1... 2... 3...

825
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:02,499
Hey, why are you stealing my scene?

826
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,493
I asked him first, you know?

827
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,507
Stop...

828
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,309
All of you stop it!

829
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,812
Stop it right now!

830
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:21,015
Isn't this too much?

831
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:23,109
I have no idea.

832
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:26,319
Stop now. Stop!

833
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:38,796
I was the referee, sir.

834
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,999
How many days to district sports day?

835
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,001
About 2 weeks, sir.

836
00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:48,004
The athletes and cheer squad are practicing hard.

837
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:50,906
Who's going to be drum major now?

838
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:52,408
I think...

839
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:54,410
I have to ask Prof. Orn for some help,

840
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:56,902
see if she can find someone.

841
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,094
Don't worry about that, sir.

842
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:17,188
I got it.

843
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,092
It's nothing.

844
00:56:27,505 --> 00:56:31,007
Nam,

845
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:33,509
in my entire being,

846
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,511
I've never met anyone so perfect

847
00:56:36,512 --> 00:56:38,113
and excellent like you.

848
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:41,583
You look incredible and fabulous.

849
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:43,084
Please get straight to the point.

850
00:56:43,085 --> 00:56:47,078
What can I do for you, Prof. In?

851
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:51,191
I was wondering if you could be the school's

852
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:54,094
drum major for the District Sports Day?

853
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:54,694
What?

854
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:56,895
I'm not looking for anyone else.

855
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:59,298
You're perfect for it.

856
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:02,200
But that's in 2 weeks.

857
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:05,303
I don't think I can do it.

858
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:09,297
I can not find anyone else.

859
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:14,877
I promise I'll make it up to you in a religious way.

860
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:16,479
In a religious way?

861
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,482
I can pray for you for 6 months...

862
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:24,476
or forever. I can definitely do that.

863
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:36,896
Hold the baton upright then throw it up,

864
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:42,100
keep your eyes on the baton then catch it

865
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:43,702
then continue marching.

866
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:45,003
See?

867
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,772
As easy as that.

868
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:49,073
Can you show me?

869
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:51,275
I have my own baton.

870
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,777
You can do it. That's yours, this is mine.

871
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:56,279
Focus on how high you want to throw it,

872
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,381
then throw it up when you're ready,

873
00:57:59,382 --> 00:58:02,476
123, up!

874
00:58:12,794 --> 00:58:14,094
This is difficult.

875
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:16,586
Why didn't she pick someone else?

876
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:21,557
Don't give up just yet, it's only been a few days.

877
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:25,770
The most important tip

878
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:27,572
in 9 Love Tips

879
00:58:27,573 --> 00:58:31,375
says that you should give it your best shot in love,

880
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:33,377
wholeheartedly give it all you've got,

881
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:37,371
then the person you love will find you.

882
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:44,986
Hey, you've come this far,

883
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:47,289
you have to keep fighting.

884
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,691
This is not only for school,

885
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,393
you're representing our town.

886
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:54,055
You can do it.

887
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:30,749
Top, pass the ball.

888
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:36,163
Hey, you're distracted by girls again.

889
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:42,368
I promise you that our marching band

890
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:44,670
will be the best in town this year, sir.

891
00:59:44,671 --> 00:59:45,971
What about the drum major?

892
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:47,174
You need not worry.

893
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:49,875
She's pretty, tall and fabulous.

894
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:53,278
She's just perfect.

895
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:56,771
Watch out!

896
01:00:06,257 --> 01:00:07,952
Sorry.

897
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:12,261
Don't tell me that's our drum major.

898
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:16,255
Oh, yes. But she's been doing well, sir.

899
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:18,866
It's the first time she messed up.

900
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:20,766
She's throwing her baton like a boomerang.

901
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,470
What happens if she mess up on the sports day?

902
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:26,463
No incident like that will happen, sir.

903
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:35,847
Get a new drum major

904
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:37,148
or I'll be after you.

905
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:39,049
Oh, sir. But,

906
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,753
we only have 1 week to practice, sir.

907
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:44,551
This is not looking too good.

908
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:51,459
The director confiscated the baton?

909
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,562
Who's going to be our drum major now?

910
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:56,464
I don't know. Serves Prof. In right.

911
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:59,166
She should've picked one of us, pretty girls.

912
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:01,269
I don't know how she could pick such ugly student.

913
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,671
Her students are always losers.

914
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:06,339
I'm glad she didn't pick us,

915
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:10,343
would be bad for our reputation.

916
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:11,843
How can you say that?

917
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:14,046
It's true.

918
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:15,844
Bug face.

919
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:21,852
I'm going to prove them wrong.

920
01:01:21,853 --> 01:01:25,846
Students of Prof. In are not always a loser.

921
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:31,160
You're going use a broomstick?

922
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:32,962
Where did you get that?

923
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:34,964
I borrowed from the janitor.

924
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:38,958
It's a bit light, but it'll do.

925
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:47,631
I will not let anyone look down on us and Prof. In.

926
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:02,351
Everyone, I'm asking for 100% from you today.

927
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:09,649
There...

928
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:16,522
Hey, that's a foul. Hey!

929
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:32,539
You're going to take the penalty kick?

930
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:36,348
Hey, my son's going take the penalty kick.

931
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:37,850
Let's leave.

932
01:02:37,851 --> 01:02:39,752
Wait, hold on.

933
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:42,754
Unbelievable, Shone's going kick a penalty goal.

934
01:02:42,755 --> 01:02:44,055
I can't believe my eyes,

935
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:48,015
come on, he's going to kick now.

936
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:04,239
Do you guys know why

937
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,340
we lost the National Championship?

938
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:08,942
It's because of his dad.

939
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:12,936
Wait...

940
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:16,450
That was just a warm up kick.

941
01:03:16,451 --> 01:03:20,409
Have another go.

942
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,522
Is there such thing as a warm up penalty kick?

943
01:03:22,523 --> 01:03:24,523
In my book, there is.

944
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:26,424
In my book too.

945
01:03:26,425 --> 01:03:27,925
Mine too.

946
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:31,428
And I haven't blown my whistle.

947
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:33,124
Yes, sir.
One more time.

948
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:42,132
Why?
He's going have another go at it.

949
01:03:52,347 --> 01:03:54,008
Come here.

950
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:12,721
He's gonna do it.

951
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:24,139
If you kick like that,

952
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,508
you're ready to join our school team.

953
01:04:26,509 --> 01:04:27,203
Yes.

954
01:04:30,312 --> 01:04:37,616
Yes, Shone did it...

955
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,321
He's all smile now.

956
01:04:41,322 --> 01:04:43,813
I get it now.

957
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:29,419
Very good, perfect, dear.

958
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:34,899
My goodness, excuse me Prof. Orn,

959
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,901
I was wondering whether your students

960
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:40,003
can throw their headdress that high and catch it?

961
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:43,997
So high, very good!

962
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,209
So, your sister is as pretty as I am now?

963
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,203
She much prettier.

964
01:06:31,214 --> 01:06:33,614
Fabulous, Nam.

965
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:43,289
I don't wanna move anywhere.

966
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:47,283
You say that every time.

967
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:02,405
You're way to hot, Nam.

968
01:07:02,406 --> 01:07:06,109
Last Valentine's day, she was still very dark.

969
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,612
I'm gonna take Kai's gift for her.

970
01:07:08,613 --> 01:07:10,012
Have you asked Nam?

971
01:07:10,013 --> 01:07:11,413
I don't know.

972
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:15,373
Can I have this pink chocolate Nam?

973
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:21,589
What's wrong with her? She looks a bit down.

974
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:22,790
She's been waiting for him all day

975
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,492
and he hasn't shown up.

976
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:29,486
Hey, Nam, come here... hurry.

977
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,597
Go ahead.

978
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:48,470
Here,

979
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:58,283
it's from a friend of mine.

980
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:53,166
See you tomorrow at 4,

981
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:55,868
on 3rd floor staircase.

982
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:58,269
I have something to tell you.

983
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:24,192
Do you wanna leave together, Shone?

984
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,194
You haven't left yet?

985
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:28,254
You can go ahead.

986
01:09:39,172 --> 01:09:41,072
Nam.

987
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:46,874
I knew you'd come.

988
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,873
This letter was from you, Top?

989
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:58,888
Yes, it's from me.

990
01:09:58,889 --> 01:10:02,848
Did you want anything?

991
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:09,063
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

992
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:13,057
What were you going to tell me, Shone?

993
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:18,062
I was just going to ask why you're here.

994
01:10:18,272 --> 01:10:22,265
But now I know.

995
01:10:30,282 --> 01:10:33,051
So what do you say?

996
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,952
Silence means yes to me.

997
01:10:35,953 --> 01:10:36,953
What?

998
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:41,357
Top? Where did he come from?

999
01:10:41,358 --> 01:10:44,156
And that's what all Shone said?

1000
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:48,463
What was your answer?

1001
01:10:48,464 --> 01:10:51,566
I didn't say anything.

1002
01:10:51,567 --> 01:10:54,768
What should I do?

1003
01:10:54,769 --> 01:10:56,870
You have to think twice

1004
01:10:56,871 --> 01:10:58,772
since he's Shone's best friend.

1005
01:10:58,773 --> 01:11:01,474
If you make a wrong move,

1006
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:03,773
Shone's going to kill you.

1007
01:11:07,046 --> 01:11:09,548
Mistake.

1008
01:11:09,549 --> 01:11:11,750
Are you free today? Wanna go see a soccer game?

1009
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:14,051
No, I'm not free.

1010
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,554
It'll only take a while.

1011
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:20,156
Shone's playing for the team first time today.

1012
01:11:20,157 --> 01:11:21,558
Do you wanna go?

1013
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:23,151
Okay, I'll go.

1014
01:11:28,765 --> 01:11:30,866
Nam.

1015
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:32,357
Get on.

1016
01:11:40,141 --> 01:11:41,541
Some water.

1017
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,343
Thank you.

1018
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:44,844
Do you have some water?

1019
01:11:44,845 --> 01:11:46,642
No.

1020
01:11:56,655 --> 01:11:58,953
Let's go to plan B.

1021
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,354
Faster...

1022
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:34,743
Dear button, I really wanna ride with Shone.

1023
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,558
"Summer Holiday!"

1024
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:45,051
"See you in Junior Year."

1025
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:47,731
What kind of cake would you like

1026
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:50,633
for your birthday this year? Go pick one.

1027
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:52,835
Vanilla cake,

1028
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,736
Nam loves it.

1029
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,044
Hello, where are you?

1030
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,847
We're picking a cake for Cheer's birthday right now.

1031
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:09,248
I'm at the Dam with Shone and his friends,

1032
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,050
I won't make it back in time.

1033
01:13:11,051 --> 01:13:13,952
I called Cheer this morning but she didn't pick up,

1034
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:16,354
please tell her Happy Birthday for me.

1035
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:17,656
Sorry guys.

1036
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:20,125
Okay... we'll tell her.

1037
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,621
We'll take this one.

1038
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:43,042
Grilled squids.

1039
01:13:44,746 --> 01:13:47,146
I'll be right back.

1040
01:14:14,137 --> 01:14:18,130
What are you doing here all alone?

1041
01:14:18,741 --> 01:14:22,734
It's a great view here.

1042
01:14:28,316 --> 01:14:32,309
Would you like some grilled squid?

1043
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,923
Have you heard a story about squids?

1044
01:14:37,924 --> 01:14:40,017
No.

1045
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:43,427
I'll tell you.

1046
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,833
Once upon the time,

1047
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:51,534
two squids met

1048
01:14:51,535 --> 01:14:57,940
and fell in love with each other,

1049
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:01,310
they decided to be together

1050
01:15:01,311 --> 01:15:05,304
and eventually got married.

1051
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:10,417
On their wedding day,

1052
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:14,721
the reverend squire told them to hold hands

1053
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:18,324
so they held hands,

1054
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:20,325
held hands...

1055
01:15:29,634 --> 01:15:33,593
You're so silly.

1056
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:36,506
But that's sweet.

1057
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:37,706
The story teller or the story?

1058
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:38,809
The story teller.

1059
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,810
Oh, the story.

1060
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:44,713
I'm all confused now.

1061
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:47,114
No more appetite for squids?

1062
01:15:47,115 --> 01:15:51,108
I never ate squids again after I heard that story.

1063
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:58,425
Have you ever held

1064
01:15:58,426 --> 01:16:02,428
someone's hand like the squids?

1065
01:16:02,429 --> 01:16:07,699
Once I held hand of a clumsy girl

1066
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,101
who was about to fall off the stage,

1067
01:16:10,102 --> 01:16:11,602
so I grabbed her hand.

1068
01:16:11,603 --> 01:16:15,305
Nam...

1069
01:16:15,306 --> 01:16:17,407
Why don't you eat the squids?

1070
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:20,109
They're really delicious.

1071
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,511
Don't...

1072
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:26,014
Why? They're yummy.

1073
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,816
Seriously,

1074
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,417
do you like Nam?

1075
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,219
You're going out with her,

1076
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,821
why are you asking me this?

1077
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,723
Oh, it's nothing.

1078
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:42,996
Are you all right?

1079
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,896
I'm fine, just hurts a bit.

1080
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:48,400
Can you try to walk?

1081
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:50,699
Come on, get on my back.

1082
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,003
Dear button, Shone carried my bag today.

1083
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,190
Happy Birthday...
Is that you Nam?

1084
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:18,992
Cheer's not here.

1085
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:20,994
She went with Kie and Nim.

1086
01:17:20,995 --> 01:17:23,596
You didn't go with them?

1087
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,997
No.

1088
01:17:24,998 --> 01:17:28,991
Give them a call okay?

1089
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:42,311
I miss the old times,

1090
01:17:42,312 --> 01:17:46,682
when we would do reports together, don't you?

1091
01:17:46,683 --> 01:17:48,683
Angels should be in heaven,

1092
01:17:48,684 --> 01:17:50,886
not in hell like us.

1093
01:17:50,887 --> 01:17:53,088
Take it easy, Cheer.

1094
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:55,689
There's always next year.

1095
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:59,293
I only have 3 friends.

1096
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:02,092
I wouldn't do that if I were her.

1097
01:18:10,904 --> 01:18:13,705
Do you wanna come over later to do the report?

1098
01:18:13,706 --> 01:18:16,300
Why don't you write report with your new gang?

1099
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,585
Top's not here yet?

1100
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:46,899
He told me to tutor a sophomore.

1101
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,801
He's not here yet, he said

1102
01:18:48,802 --> 01:18:52,761
he was going to borrow a book for the sophomore.

1103
01:18:56,976 --> 01:19:00,969
That day, I was in the hospital.

1104
01:19:04,082 --> 01:19:06,783
Which day?

1105
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:10,587
The day my dad missed the penalty kick,

1106
01:19:10,588 --> 01:19:14,590
I was born on that day.

1107
01:19:14,591 --> 01:19:17,392
My dad never played soccer again

1108
01:19:17,393 --> 01:19:21,386
after I was born.

1109
01:19:22,197 --> 01:19:25,398
I'm such a bad luck.

1110
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:29,358
Our team never made it to the finals again.

1111
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,774
Are you okay?

1112
01:19:35,775 --> 01:19:42,981
I'm used to all the teasing.

1113
01:19:42,982 --> 01:19:45,182
My last name is

1114
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:49,176
Shone, the son of the guy who missed the goal.

1115
01:19:50,487 --> 01:19:52,288
But it's okay,

1116
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:55,691
I'm in the team now.

1117
01:19:55,692 --> 01:19:58,994
Are you thinking of playing professional soccer?

1118
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:01,156
I don't know.

1119
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:06,858
Right now, I just wanna have someone.

1120
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:17,576
Nam, I still can't find the book.

1121
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:20,171
Can you come help look for it?

1122
01:20:26,885 --> 01:20:29,683
We won't take long, Shone!

1123
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:46,758
What's the surprise for Ake's birthday?

1124
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,960
You'll see.

1125
01:21:14,058 --> 01:21:18,051
Time for our special show for tonight.

1126
01:21:22,165 --> 01:21:25,167
The story happened when we were in 5th grade.

1127
01:21:25,168 --> 01:21:28,369
We happened to like the same girl.

1128
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,871
Her name is Bo, she's in 4th grade.

1129
01:21:30,872 --> 01:21:32,373
So we both practiced dancing

1130
01:21:32,374 --> 01:21:36,376
hoping to be her partner in the event.

1131
01:21:36,377 --> 01:21:39,078
And when the day comes,

1132
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,547
Shone...

1133
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:44,450
got chicken pox,

1134
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:48,444
so I got to be her dance partner.

1135
01:21:49,355 --> 01:21:53,857
But Top backed out on that day,

1136
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:55,260
so we both didn't get her anyway.

1137
01:21:55,261 --> 01:22:00,763
He threatened to not be friends with me

1138
01:22:00,764 --> 01:22:01,965
so we promised each other

1139
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:03,266
since that day...

1140
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:05,367
That we will never like the same girl.

1141
01:22:05,368 --> 01:22:09,361
Right?

1142
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:40,563
Happy birthday to you.

1143
01:22:40,564 --> 01:22:44,366
Happy birthday...

1144
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:48,326
Happy birthday to you.

1145
01:23:00,848 --> 01:23:03,149
Same time tomorrow?

1146
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,345
Let's go see Shone's soccer match.

1147
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:09,954
You don't have to pick me up anymore.

1148
01:23:09,955 --> 01:23:12,157
Why not? Are you busy?

1149
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:13,658
No,

1150
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:15,559
I mean...

1151
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,858
you don't have to pick me up ever again.

1152
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:25,326
Are you upset because I kissed you?

1153
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:29,037
But you're my girlfriend, aren't you?

1154
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:33,031
I never said I was your girlfriend.

1155
01:23:33,643 --> 01:23:36,844
After all these?

1156
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,647
I'm sorry,

1157
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,249
but I have someone I like.

1158
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:47,252
Who is it?

1159
01:23:47,253 --> 01:23:51,246
Who...

1160
01:23:56,428 --> 01:23:59,830
This is the worse ever

1161
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:03,734
in the history of my love life.

1162
01:24:03,735 --> 01:24:05,930
Can I ask you a favor?

1163
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:11,640
Could you not ask her out

1164
01:24:11,641 --> 01:24:13,541
no matter what happens?

1165
01:24:15,144 --> 01:24:17,645
Do you think she broke up with you because of me?

1166
01:24:17,646 --> 01:24:19,546
No,

1167
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:21,849
I just can't take

1168
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:24,852
if my best friend

1169
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:26,821
is seeing the girl I love.

1170
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:32,824
There's not much I can do, can I?

1171
01:24:32,825 --> 01:24:34,725
Are you okay with that?

1172
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:37,821
Yeah.

1173
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:04,215
Thanks mom.

1174
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:34,627
I've spoken to the manager

1175
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:36,229
of Bangkok Glass team, son.

1176
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,830
What did he say?

1177
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:39,131
He said,

1178
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:41,299
maybe he'll accept you for training camp

1179
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,802
of Bangkok Glass League.

1180
01:26:43,803 --> 01:26:46,504
Hope he's not kidding about this?

1181
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:48,906
Nobody jokes about things like that.

1182
01:26:48,907 --> 01:26:50,708
Just be ready,

1183
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:52,110
maybe you'll have to move

1184
01:26:52,111 --> 01:26:56,103
to Bangkok after high school.

1185
01:26:57,414 --> 01:26:59,314
Dad.

1186
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00,907
Thank you.

1187
01:27:15,696 --> 01:27:18,697
You should've told me,

1188
01:27:18,698 --> 01:27:22,691
I would've applied for the grant to go with you.

1189
01:27:23,203 --> 01:27:24,802
Sorry,

1190
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:28,796
I was really preoccupied.

1191
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:32,109
I think the director

1192
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,811
has found a new P.E. Replacement.

1193
01:27:34,812 --> 01:27:39,115
You're just irreplaceable,

1194
01:27:39,116 --> 01:27:41,317
I can confirm that.

1195
01:27:41,318 --> 01:27:46,288
May I ask for something from you before you leave?

1196
01:27:46,289 --> 01:27:48,890
What can I do for you?

1197
01:27:48,891 --> 01:27:52,493
This...

1198
01:27:52,494 --> 01:27:54,394
Maybe too much to ask from you?

1199
01:28:01,201 --> 01:28:05,504
I asked for you heart but got a whistle.

1200
01:28:05,505 --> 01:28:07,406
There's...

1201
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,307
the new P.E. Teacher.

1202
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:19,382
I think you should hurry and be on your way,

1203
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:21,685
you might miss your flight.

1204
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:25,588
I feel occupied all of a sudden. Bye now.

1205
01:28:35,697 --> 01:28:39,499
You don't waste your time at all.

1206
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,701
Hello...

1207
01:28:40,702 --> 01:28:41,902
Aren't you the new P.E. Teacher?

1208
01:28:41,903 --> 01:28:43,603
Yes.
What's your name?

1209
01:28:43,604 --> 01:28:45,404
I'm Boat.

1210
01:28:45,405 --> 01:28:48,206
I'd love a boat ride.

1211
01:28:48,207 --> 01:28:51,910
"Bye bye Junior. Hello Senior!"

1212
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:54,378
"It's summer break again."

1213
01:28:54,379 --> 01:28:57,982
Why won't you stay for high school?

1214
01:28:57,983 --> 01:28:59,483
I just love the pink uniform

1215
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:03,186
of the technical school I applied for.

1216
01:29:03,187 --> 01:29:04,787
Very very pretty.

1217
01:29:04,788 --> 01:29:08,781
So the whole school's in pink?

1218
01:29:33,178 --> 01:29:36,481
Monday, I wait.

1219
01:29:36,482 --> 01:29:43,285
Tuesday I still wait for you.

1220
01:29:44,989 --> 01:29:50,292
Wednesday, you never show up.

1221
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:53,995
Thursday, all are empty.

1222
01:29:53,996 --> 01:29:58,699
Friday, Saturday or Sunday,

1223
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:03,270
not a day goes by without missing you.

1224
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,271
We can never turn back time.

1225
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,783
To the day we met, the day we got closer,

1226
01:30:18,784 --> 01:30:24,487
the day we held hands,

1227
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:29,793
the day I love you, the day I told you,

1228
01:30:29,794 --> 01:30:33,562
the day you dream.

1229
01:30:33,563 --> 01:30:37,565
No matter how long,

1230
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:41,969
how many months or years,

1231
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:50,275
my memories of you shall remain.

1232
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:52,978
Cheer,

1233
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:56,881
I'm sorry.

1234
01:30:56,882 --> 01:31:02,786
Your song is so cheesy.

1235
01:31:02,787 --> 01:31:04,388
Why did you sing along?

1236
01:31:04,389 --> 01:31:08,348
We're laughing at your song.

1237
01:31:09,159 --> 01:31:12,862
Friday, Saturday or Sunday

1238
01:31:12,863 --> 01:31:16,665
not a day goes by without missing you.

1239
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:24,573
We can never turn back time...

1240
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:28,875
Nam.

1241
01:31:28,876 --> 01:31:30,677
We heard from Prof.

1242
01:31:30,678 --> 01:31:38,484
In while we were buying ice cream
at the market that your...

1243
01:31:38,485 --> 01:31:41,052
your exam result...

1244
01:31:41,053 --> 01:31:43,254
What about my exam result?

1245
01:31:43,255 --> 01:31:45,456
That you are the top of the class.

1246
01:31:45,457 --> 01:31:48,859
I thought so...

1247
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,461
Right.
I'm the top of the class.

1248
01:31:51,462 --> 01:31:57,166
Mom, I'm top of the class this semester.

1249
01:31:57,167 --> 01:32:02,070
You'll get to see your dad now.

1250
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:03,572
I'll get to see dad, get to see dad.

1251
01:32:03,573 --> 01:32:06,974
Dad...

1252
01:32:06,975 --> 01:32:08,475
I'll get to see dad.

1253
01:32:08,476 --> 01:32:09,966
Can I kiss you for him?

1254
01:32:13,447 --> 01:32:18,351
I ranked 8 in my class, can I come too?

1255
01:32:18,352 --> 01:32:20,051
Sure.

1256
01:32:20,052 --> 01:32:23,655
I'll bring you some toys and sweets.

1257
01:32:23,656 --> 01:32:25,856
I'm going to the states.

1258
01:32:25,857 --> 01:32:29,850
Bring us back some snow please.

1259
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:38,167
You got it?

1260
01:32:38,168 --> 01:32:39,768
Is 50 Baht, okay?

1261
01:32:39,769 --> 01:32:42,571
It's a 100 Bath, take it or leave it.

1262
01:32:42,572 --> 01:32:46,240
I had to sneak in, almost got bitten by stray dogs.

1263
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:48,442
70 Baht?

1264
01:32:48,443 --> 01:32:51,745
Leave it then.

1265
01:32:51,746 --> 01:32:55,739
No, give it to me.

1266
01:33:00,353 --> 01:33:02,354
He's cute.

1267
01:33:02,355 --> 01:33:03,955
Is he your boyfriend?

1268
01:33:03,956 --> 01:33:06,658
It's Bam's girlfriend.

1269
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:11,662
No, I just took the photo for her.

1270
01:33:11,663 --> 01:33:15,656
Please don't tell mom.

1271
01:33:19,336 --> 01:33:21,337
Mom, Pang's...

1272
01:33:21,338 --> 01:33:22,338
Nam.

1273
01:33:22,339 --> 01:33:24,239
Yes?

1274
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:29,643
Pang's hungry, is the food ready?

1275
01:33:29,644 --> 01:33:33,239
Almost done, dear.

1276
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:38,051
Just be a good girl, okay?

1277
01:33:38,052 --> 01:33:40,653
What about you?

1278
01:33:40,654 --> 01:33:43,055
What about my money?

1279
01:33:43,056 --> 01:33:44,857
Come on have some snacks, kids.

1280
01:33:44,858 --> 01:33:46,158
Thank you...

1281
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,559
Snack on these first, okay?

1282
01:33:50,662 --> 01:33:54,621
Does Shone knows how you feel about him?

1283
01:33:56,834 --> 01:34:00,437
You've like him since first year.

1284
01:34:00,438 --> 01:34:02,538
I don't think you should tell him,

1285
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:06,141
so it can be a world record that a silly girl

1286
01:34:06,142 --> 01:34:08,943
has been in love with him for 3 years

1287
01:34:08,944 --> 01:34:11,139
without him knowing.

1288
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:19,853
Maybe you'll never
see him again for the rest of your life.

1289
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:22,448
Aren't you going to anything about it?

1290
01:34:25,158 --> 01:34:30,128
I've done everything the book says, haven't I?

1291
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:34,431
We're here to support you, what are you afraid of?

1292
01:34:34,432 --> 01:34:37,234
You pretty, smart,

1293
01:34:37,235 --> 01:34:42,939
nice and cheesy.

1294
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,741
How can he not fall for you?

1295
01:34:44,742 --> 01:34:47,540
Is that a compliment?

1296
01:34:49,345 --> 01:34:52,147
Tip No. 10 from Thailand is probably

1297
01:34:52,148 --> 01:34:54,139
the best and straight to the point.

1298
01:35:01,122 --> 01:35:03,123
This is for you, sign here.

1299
01:35:03,124 --> 01:35:05,524
Thank you.
Sign here...

1300
01:35:06,626 --> 01:35:10,619
Take my photo...

1301
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:15,633
Love...

1302
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:19,126
Write on top right there.

1303
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,531
Thank you.

1304
01:35:26,743 --> 01:35:29,041
"On top"

1305
01:35:45,426 --> 01:35:47,826
Go, girl.

1306
01:36:10,413 --> 01:36:13,215
The pool's out of order, sorry.

1307
01:36:13,216 --> 01:36:17,209
Hey, you haven't signed my shirt.

1308
01:36:21,523 --> 01:36:23,924
Shone...

1309
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:26,120
I have something to tell you.

1310
01:36:28,628 --> 01:36:32,031
I really like you. I've liked you for 3 years.

1311
01:36:32,032 --> 01:36:34,933
I've done everything I could for you to notice me.

1312
01:36:34,934 --> 01:36:36,534
I...

1313
01:36:36,535 --> 01:36:38,636
I've tried out for a dancer,

1314
01:36:38,637 --> 01:36:40,505
been in a play, a drum major

1315
01:36:40,506 --> 01:36:43,407
and even studied harder.

1316
01:36:43,408 --> 01:36:44,809
But I realized that I shouldn't have been

1317
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:48,411
straightforward with you
about my feelings a long time ago.

1318
01:36:48,412 --> 01:36:54,009
I just want to tell you that I like you.

1319
01:37:16,302 --> 01:37:19,794
"Pin loves Shone"

1320
01:37:27,912 --> 01:37:31,905
Pin and you...

1321
01:37:41,323 --> 01:37:44,526
Since when?

1322
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:46,791
Just last week.

1323
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:55,501
You two are together.

1324
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:57,804
What a perfect match.

1325
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:59,705
You guys make a great couple.

1326
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:08,612
I wish you both good luck.

1327
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:09,102
Nam!

1328
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:15,418
Nam.

1329
01:38:15,419 --> 01:38:19,688
I'm okay...

1330
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:22,180
Nam.

1331
01:38:30,498 --> 01:38:34,301
You guys are perfect.

1332
01:38:34,302 --> 01:38:38,904
Nam, are you all right?

1333
01:38:38,905 --> 01:38:41,100
Nam.

1334
01:38:51,316 --> 01:38:53,181
Let her go.

1335
01:39:02,391 --> 01:39:04,484
What wrong?

1336
01:39:08,197 --> 01:39:09,687
Pin.

1337
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:43,492
Hi dad.

1338
01:39:43,493 --> 01:39:46,690
Welcome to Glass Rabbit Junior Team.

1339
01:39:48,998 --> 01:39:50,198
Thank you dad.

1340
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:54,701
This is Uncle Neng, Bangkok Glass Team Manager.

1341
01:39:54,702 --> 01:39:56,904
Hello...

1342
01:39:56,905 --> 01:40:00,373
This is Uncle Nguan, the coach.

1343
01:40:00,374 --> 01:40:03,571
Thank you all.

1344
01:40:04,978 --> 01:40:06,378
Yeah!

1345
01:40:06,379 --> 01:40:08,079
He's happy!

1346
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,277
Congratulations, son.

1347
01:40:16,188 --> 01:40:20,790
Pack your things, you're leaving tonight with them.

1348
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,992
The training camp starts tomorrow.

1349
01:40:21,993 --> 01:40:24,093
Tonight?

1350
01:40:24,094 --> 01:40:26,085
What are you waiting for, son?

1351
01:41:08,765 --> 01:41:13,259
"This scrap book is funny, it shows how hard you try."

1352
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:16,968
Home safe.

1353
01:41:20,976 --> 01:41:25,276
"Just want to let you know that,
you had my heart since we met."

1354
01:41:35,188 --> 01:41:36,887
She looks the same,

1355
01:41:36,888 --> 01:41:38,189
a Snow white in braces.

1356
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:40,556
"I told Pin that you look the same."

1357
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,456
"You look cute as usual."

1358
01:41:48,765 --> 01:41:50,265
"I held your hand for the first time,"

1359
01:41:50,266 --> 01:41:51,666
"but had to let go, so no one would suspect."

1360
01:42:00,576 --> 01:42:03,875
"I tasted an apple I gave you."

1361
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,261
"You're doing much better now. Keep it up."

1362
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:26,253
Throw it up!

1363
01:42:38,074 --> 01:42:41,275
"Love conquers all, especially fears."

1364
01:42:41,276 --> 01:42:44,378
"Planting a rose is a tough job."

1365
01:42:44,379 --> 01:42:46,745
It's from a friend of mine.

1366
01:42:52,852 --> 01:42:54,954
"I gave you a rose today,
but told you it was from a friend."

1367
01:42:54,955 --> 01:42:57,149
"I couldn't tell you the truth."

1368
01:43:07,265 --> 01:43:09,367
"Do you know it hurts me
to see Top said he loved you?"

1369
01:43:09,368 --> 01:43:12,564
"How come we never have our moments?"

1370
01:43:24,246 --> 01:43:28,239
"I wish you could ride on my back."

1371
01:43:36,657 --> 01:43:39,358
Nam.

1372
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:41,054
Would you be my girlfriend?

1373
01:44:30,935 --> 01:44:34,338
Can I ask you a favor?

1374
01:44:34,339 --> 01:44:37,433
Could you not ask her out?

1375
01:45:32,254 --> 01:45:34,854
"9 years later"

1376
01:45:49,936 --> 01:45:53,133
There's a window on that side.

1377
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,842
Kai, could you take the customer?

1378
01:45:58,843 --> 01:46:00,640
I'll be right back.

1379
01:46:07,016 --> 01:46:11,009
Hello, handsome.

1380
01:46:13,422 --> 01:46:15,223
You're sleepy aren't you?

1381
01:46:15,224 --> 01:46:17,624
Sorry to bother you every time.

1382
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:21,618
No problem, your kid is like mine.

1383
01:46:24,931 --> 01:46:27,132
Come on, don't be a cry baby.

1384
01:46:27,133 --> 01:46:29,635
Don't mess up my hair.

1385
01:46:29,636 --> 01:46:32,337
Gotta go now.

1386
01:46:32,338 --> 01:46:34,033
Bye kiddo.

1387
01:46:35,741 --> 01:46:38,842
I wish his real dad would love him like this.

1388
01:46:38,843 --> 01:46:41,411
Come on now.

1389
01:46:41,412 --> 01:46:43,613
Call me.

1390
01:46:43,614 --> 01:46:46,315
Shone.

1391
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:51,419
Are you going to that TV show?

1392
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:54,823
I don't know yet.

1393
01:46:54,824 --> 01:46:59,625
Bye Shone, say bye!

1394
01:47:03,378 --> 01:47:05,418
Please hurry up!

1395
01:47:05,798 --> 01:47:09,397
Continue to Break 2, are you ready?
- A min

1396
01:47:09,398 --> 01:47:10,297
OK

1397
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:14,397
Clothing staffs ready?
- Yes

1398
01:47:14,398 --> 01:47:17,328
No worry, it will be perfect!

1399
01:47:20,568 --> 01:47:22,577
I'm ready now!

1400
01:47:22,578 --> 01:47:28,037
Please relax.
Our show isn't formal.

1401
01:47:28,038 --> 01:47:28,538
Yes

1402
01:47:29,248 --> 01:47:32,188
- You're so beautiful
- Thank you

1403
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:39,467
It's good that Nam is fashionable.

1404
01:47:39,468 --> 01:47:42,818
If Nam was beautiful as mom like me...

1405
01:47:49,618 --> 01:47:50,967
Teacher Boat!

1406
01:47:50,968 --> 01:47:52,997
Hello

1407
01:47:52,998 --> 01:47:56,678
Since that time,
I've rode the boat all this time.

1408
01:47:57,808 --> 01:47:59,537
So envious!

1409
01:47:59,538 --> 01:48:02,198
He likes to do sweet things

1410
01:48:05,718 --> 01:48:07,358
I'm jealous

1411
01:48:12,308 --> 01:48:14,998
He always surprises me

1412
01:48:19,058 --> 01:48:21,668
Surprise again

1413
01:48:28,228 --> 01:48:31,608
Uh.. That.. That is a rose

1414
01:48:31,908 --> 01:48:34,628
I have to eat, if not he will sulk

1415
01:48:35,778 --> 01:48:38,198
5..4..3..2..

1416
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,067
Now, we're here with Nam

1417
01:48:47,068 --> 01:48:50,858
The designer of the beautiful clothes that we've just watched

1418
01:48:51,268 --> 01:48:52,667
Hello

1419
01:48:52,668 --> 01:49:02,547
Our fans may know her well
cause she is the designer in only a few of Thais that are famous in New York

1420
01:49:02,548 --> 01:49:04,548
and this is the evidence

1421
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:23,998
This is only a part of her work

1422
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:29,437
Nam, do you know that...

1423
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:33,797
In Thailand, you're also well-known

1424
01:49:33,798 --> 01:49:38,167
I still have to develop my skill

1425
01:49:38,168 --> 01:49:42,858
So, what work will you do as you came back to Thailand?

1426
01:49:42,918 --> 01:49:47,858
There's a brand that would like to organize a fashion show

1427
01:49:48,078 --> 01:49:53,187
I think it's interesting, so I agree to do

1428
01:49:53,188 --> 01:49:56,727
and because I want to come back

1429
01:49:56,728 --> 01:49:58,898
I miss my mom

1430
01:49:59,228 --> 01:50:02,298
Nam used to tell reporters that...

1431
01:50:02,578 --> 01:50:05,097
When you were young
Umm... I'm sorry

1432
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:08,867
You were so ugly and had bad sense of fashion

1433
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:11,337
That's totally different from now

1434
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:16,167
What make you've changed yourself this much?

1435
01:50:16,168 --> 01:50:19,897
Because, I fell in love some one

1436
01:50:19,898 --> 01:50:21,897
falling in love?

1437
01:50:21,898 --> 01:50:24,977
Could you tell the story?

1438
01:50:24,978 --> 01:50:28,767
Yes, he was my senior

1439
01:50:28,768 --> 01:50:30,887
M.4 senior

1440
01:50:30,888 --> 01:50:32,397
He was a football player

1441
01:50:32,398 --> 01:50:35,307
and very cute

1442
01:50:35,308 --> 01:50:37,717
At that time, I...

1443
01:50:37,718 --> 01:50:40,168
Had bug face studying M.1

1444
01:50:41,068 --> 01:50:42,557
Developed myself a lot

1445
01:50:42,558 --> 01:50:47,387
If It could make me to be beautiful, to be better
I tried to do it

1446
01:50:47,388 --> 01:50:51,697
and tried to study better so he might interest in me

1447
01:50:51,698 --> 01:50:56,747
Did he know it, in the end?

1448
01:50:56,748 --> 01:51:00,187
He knew but it didn't have a happy ending

1449
01:51:00,188 --> 01:51:06,247
I went to study in the US

1450
01:51:06,248 --> 01:51:08,527
to stay with my dad

1451
01:51:08,528 --> 01:51:11,467
It's bad

1452
01:51:11,468 --> 01:51:15,637
but when I think about it.
He is like...

1453
01:51:15,638 --> 01:51:17,637
my inspiration

1454
01:51:17,638 --> 01:51:21,157
He made me use the love in good way

1455
01:51:21,158 --> 01:51:22,887
He is like...

1456
01:51:22,888 --> 01:51:26,347
The power that support me to be better and better

1457
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:28,877
Till I am today's Nam

1458
01:51:28,878 --> 01:51:34,948
Khun Nam, you remember this notebook?

1459
01:51:39,448 --> 01:51:42,087
You may recall it?

1460
01:51:42,088 --> 01:51:44,747
Yes, I remember

1461
01:51:44,748 --> 01:51:50,648
If so, let's welcome the owner of this book

1462
01:51:51,148 --> 01:51:56,038
Shone, the former footballer of Bangkok glass

1463
01:52:05,648 --> 01:52:12,808
Now, he's changed his career to be a pro-photographer

1464
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:17,208
I want to give it to Nam

1465
01:52:19,178 --> 01:52:20,857
Nam???

1466
01:52:20,858 --> 01:52:22,858
It's Nam's

1467
01:52:36,148 --> 01:52:38,728
Please sit

1468
01:52:43,038 --> 01:52:47,928
Shone, after you've never met Nam for 9 years...

1469
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:51,557
Do you have something to tell Nam?

1470
01:52:51,558 --> 01:52:56,388
I want to tell you that...

1471
01:53:02,348 --> 01:53:04,537
This button

1472
01:53:04,538 --> 01:53:06,538
is not mine

1473
01:53:06,848 --> 01:53:09,838

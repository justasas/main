Siam Museum

00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,770
Why do you like to take this kind of photos?

5
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,520
I like close-up photos because

6
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,140
They lead us to see something...
that we cannot see if we look widely

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,820
So When you shoot face close-up picture...

8
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,380
Where is your focal point?

9
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,760
They maybe eyes

10
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,940
Excuse me, my little baby is crying

11
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,130
So handsome

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,300
Too bad he's already had a baby

13
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
How are you my son? Why are you crying?

14
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,790
You must have been hungry

15
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,410
You look so angry

16
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,210
Haaeee Don't be mad at me

17
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,230
"All of us"

18
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,180
"have someone who is hidden in the bottom of the heart"

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,600
"When we think of him, we will feel like umm.."

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,580
"Always feel a little pain inside"

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,250
"But we still want to keep him"

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,750
"Even though I don't know where he is today.."

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,690
"What is he doing"

24
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,480
"But he is the one who makes me know this"

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,060
"A little thing called LOVE"

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,780
I get it, why you ask us to visit this shop everyday is because of this

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,070
Because of what!!!
His motorbike is so strange

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:13,070
Hey...Look at her, she is this beautiful

31
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,790

32
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,400
He is super smart, it's not weird that you would crazy about him

33
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,990
Are you non-sense? I don't

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,190
Mom, Fried rice and breakfast at this table

35
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,180

How are things at School?

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,870
Good, I'm still with Cheer Gie Nim

40
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,980
Aren't you bored with each other? You've been with them since Grade 1

41
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:30,650
She has no choice, The appearance like P'Nam and the gang,
No one would like to be with

42
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,560
Friends are friends not because of only appearance

43
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,280
But it should be the first thing to consider

44
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,650
I'm lucky that I look like mom

45
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,090
If I looked like dad like P'Nam....

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
I surely couldn't have boyfriend when I grow up

47
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,380
Hey.... Stop Stop

00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,440

Pang you too, Don't speak about dad like this
If he know, he will be sad

50
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,920
Go to where you want

51
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,470
Dad is in America, he cannot hear us

52
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,310
Mangoes?

53
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,860
You want mangoes?

54
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,380

Don't smile Nam

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,470

But his past is so terrible, he's wicked

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,300

85
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,830
Two girls had to resign from school because of him, a danger boy

86
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,100
Don't meddle with him

87
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,110
You know? You know?

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,330

Who did this?

106
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,830
"It's because of you that come to me"

107
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,900
"To stay in my heart every night and day"

108
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,390
"The world has pathway"
"This world has stairs"

109
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,000
"Has love and heart"
"That lead us to meet each other"

110
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,700
"In this world"

111
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,930
"Has two of us"

112
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,970
You're good

113
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,250

Where?

120
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,310
What she's thinking she is, P'Shone has to go for her

121
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,000
It may be the girl whose P'shone used to...

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,680
No way!!!

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,890
No

136
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,910
Is my dad fat like you?

137
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,930
He works as a chef assistant

138
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,350
He has to lift food tray, he has muscle

139
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,180

Your husband...

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,450
want to tell you that he will send money at the end of this month

144
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,490

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,960
Dad should come to visit us

149
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,260
(normal voice) Your dad told me that
If one of you get the 1st result in the exam

150
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,000
He will send a plane ticket from the US

151
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,480
but the ticket is expensive

152
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,840
Will he really send it to us?

153
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,960
because he know that this is very difficult for Pang and Nam

154
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,650
Let's see

155
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,910

You want to be the province hero like your father?

183
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,000
You dad couldn't kick the penalty goal successfully

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,560
Hey you guys know what...

185
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,110
our province didn't get the national trophy

186
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,110
because of his Father!

187
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,030
We couldn't find the opportunity like this anymore

188
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,030
Damn his father

189
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,220
Unfortunately they're gone, I want to see P'ding get punched

190
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,400
Let's go back

191
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,460
Will you drink this pepsi that P'shone give you?
Why not throw away if you won't drink

192
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,810
(Don't Drink!!)

193
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,640
If that so, why put it in the refrigerator

194
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,670
Ok students, today I have two things to announce

195
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,640
Our school is so dirty because
students don't drop garbage in cans

196
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,280
From now on, you will have to pay fees

197
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,800
1 piece, 1 Baht

198
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,420
You think it's too expensive?

199
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,830
I give you a new promotion package

200
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,340
throw all day, throw anywhere, do it

201
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,130
Pay for all the pieces, 50 Baht

202
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,260
Throw it scatteringly, I will clean it up

203
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,450

209
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,890

210
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,890
I will call your parents

211
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,960

212
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,740
Especially you, Shone

213
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,070
You have some skill for taking pictures

214
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,010
Now, The province has pictures contest

215
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,630
You should go to register
Maybe you will make some reputation to school

216
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,420
It's better than a quarrel

217
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,270
Understand?

218
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,040
Yes

219
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,560
You can go now

220
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,560

It's ok

226
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,750
It's not because of you

227
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,280
Plaster...

228
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,670

(Get to the 1st in exam)

241
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,030
Are you for real?

242
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,480
Yes

243
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,480
I miss my dad

244
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,350
Never seen him for 5 years

245
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,840
Earn

246
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,390
P'Kai has confessed love to me

247
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,900
Because of this book!

248
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,240
Is it true?

249
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,610
This book works?

250
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:54,900
Yes

251
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,820
before Pooh becomes P'Tor girlfriend

252
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,840
she also bought this book
"9 recipe of love (for students)"

253
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,240
It really worked for her

254
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,640
Aww, don't you go with that gang?

255
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,200
No

256
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,160
I walked with them
but they blamed me that I stole the scene

257
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,700
The 1st method

258
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,380
win his heart by The Greek's belief

259
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,890
Go to the place where you can see many stars on the sky

260
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,890
Then, use your finger draw the line connecting stars

261
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,550
as the abbreviation of your man

262
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,840
Get out of my way

263
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Look at them, wow

264
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
I won't step there then, the area is full!!

265
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,280
Hey, Nam

266
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,790
Don't you want to draw with us?

267
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,810
No, I won't

268
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,850
I think, it looks non-sense

269
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,270
Um, they are clearly seen

270
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,510
I will go to draw it at my home

271
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I'll go, Nam
See you

272
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,710
"The only star"

273
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,070
"that I always wait to see everyday"

274
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,780
"I want it to be the same star..."

275
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,530
"that you also keep an eye on"

276
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,430
"that only star"

277
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,410
Oh! You guys are diligent

278
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,840
Where are you going to compete?

279
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,970
compete around here

280
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,340
You catch it!

281
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
Hey, my hands are not free

282
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,820
I told you, my hands not free
kick for what(E-san's accent)

283
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,280
You are Chinese?

284
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,720
Uh, I'm sorry

285
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,720
When I'm angry, I think about my ancestors

286
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,990
Hey, look at this

287
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,220
Look at this
come on Shone

288
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,260
The poster for the 3rd photo contest that you asking for

289
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,150
Look at him

290
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,640
He always Play
Play can play all day

291
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,440
But he doesn't dare to play for the school

292
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,610
He plays for fun, he's not serious

293
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,520
If he's serious, He will not dare

294
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,290
If only I could score that penalty kick

295
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,230
Again, you blame yourself again

296
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,650
Our son may not afraid of taking penalty kick

297
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,210
even though, his friends tease him about it

298
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,550
Or, if he's really afraid

299
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
He will pass the fear one day

300
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,240
Look at the real person who missed the kick

301
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,920
He can pass that bad time till today

302
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,610
Why you look strange today?

303
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,130
This

304
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,750
My doctor suggested me

305
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,430
He want me to use this new dental brace

306
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,990
Beautiful right?

307
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,260
Eh You think it's beautiful?

308
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,250
It's not beautiful at all

309
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,010
Hey, look at it again

310
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,710
I don't see it's beautiful

311
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,090
Hey, you intend to do it with P'Ken

312
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,940
Yes

313
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,980
YOU HAVE TO EAT, EAT

314
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,300
EAT,EAT,EAT

315
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,400
Yeah, P'Ken has eaten the rice

316
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,980
You're crazy

317
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,440
It's because he's eating

318
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
How can you call it hypnotization

319
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,440
What are you two doing?

320
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,570
This, The 2nd method

321
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,900
It's the old method from Mayan

322
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,490
we have to concentrate our mind

323
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,280
Then, look at our beloved

324
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Try to control his mind

325
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,010
Tell him to do things we want

326
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,850
If he follows our command

327
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,670
it means that he is our soul mate
(Turn this way, Turn this way)

328
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,410
(Turn, Turn)

329
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,910
Hey, P' has turned to me

330
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,830
Who? Who's turned? Nam?

331
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,590
No, It's nothing

332
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,680
Did you hypnotize P'Shone?

333
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,010
Hey No, are you crazy?
I didn't

334
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,840
So, why did you tell us
This book is non-sense?

335
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,540
because, it takes beliefs from
many countries, that island, this island

336
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,780
It surely cannot be trusted

337
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,520
Then, did you follow the methods?

338
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,210
Yes, I did

339
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,810
Eyy

340
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,320
You shouldn't disclose this little matter

341
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm afraid that I will be teased

342
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,940
You don't have to worry about being tease

343
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,230
Because We...

344
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,230
Will definitely tease you

345
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,030
The 3rd method

346
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,200
This comes from Scotland

347
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,160
sneaking to bring things
that have the meaning of heart to him

348
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,380
and he must not know who gives the gifts

349
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,510
so the target will know that
there's somebody who interested in him

350
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,190
that's My jelly, be careful

351
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,330
How could you make it fall?

352
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,400

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,560

Yes

355
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,160
It means that when you're traveling
you thought of me all the time

356
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,850
I will eat them till they're all gone

357
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,680
Thank you very much

358
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,430
You're not going to tell me that....

366
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,430
Yes, Teacher Pon bought these from the trip

367
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,450
How many of the boxes?

368
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,090
4 ka

369
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,510
4 boxes?

370
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,120
Damn it, Salted egg!!

371
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,930
Maybe, you cannot finish all of them, be careful then

372
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,770
We forgot one thing

373
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,410
our country is tropical

374
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,930
Mangoes?

375
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,560
Yes

376
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,900
Other people give flower or handkerchief
but you would give him mangoes?

377
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,770
How is it romantic?

378
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,530
Hey, Hey

379
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,530
That's him

380
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh!! He's so handsome haha

381
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,500
Let's go, go, go

382
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,850
Mango cake ka

383
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,850
I did it myself

384
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,870
Thank you

385
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,550
It looks delicious

386
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,940
Are you ok?

387
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,670
I'm ok

388
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,320
It's The end

389
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,320
We totally lost

390
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,260
She only did a little

391
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,040
but it works

392
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,360
yes

393
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,790
She's cute

394
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,790
good future housewife

395
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,790
How can we compete with?

396
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,520
Change the one you love, then

397
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,020
Actually

398
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,110
I have another appointment

399
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,240
But teacher Pon invites me to your house for dinner

400
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,740
Importantly, It's the first time

401
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,390
Umm...................

402
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,110
If you are really not free, it's ok

403
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,410
We can meet next term

404
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,010
Ohhhh, wait wait ka

405
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,430

Teacher Pon Ka

408
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,740
See you this evening

409
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,400
But, teacher Pon

410
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,790
This dinner is not for the two of us?

411
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,960
Oyy, please don't call it dinner

412
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,960
It's better to call it summer celebration party

413
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,410
Many teachers will come to the party

414
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,360
I guarantee it will be fun

415
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Uhh, ok

416
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,450
Teacher Orn!!!

417
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,660
Teacher In....

418
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,780
I've never surrendered to whoever

419
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,000
This war..

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,180
is very important!!!

421
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,290
Teacher!! That's my answer sheet

422
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,060
Ouyy!

423
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,500
Higher, Higher

424
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,780
Teacher

425
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Lift it more, more, Nam

426
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,690
I get an idea

427
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,060
P'Shone must ride Nam to home

428
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,360
Yes

429
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,660
Nam must have dreamed about it
for once in a lifetime

430
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,320
It is right?

431
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,050
When P'Shone ride Nam to home

432
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,700
When getting off the motorbike

433
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,460
When giving mangoes

434
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,730
So romantic

435
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,730
Eyyyyy!!!

436
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,130
Try to look like your motorbike is breaking down

437
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,610
How can it break?

438
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,480
When he try to start...

439
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,010
He will know it

440
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,750
Uh yes

441
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,750
How about losing the key?

442
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,710
How comes it will be missing?

443
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,820
It's here

444
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,730
Hey

445
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,800
It has lost

446
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,800
Hey

447
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,150
P' Shone

448
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,150
He's there

449
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,780
Oops

450
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,920
Oww, N' Mango cake

451
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,320
How is your leg?

452
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,850
I just stumbled on the ground maybe my leg is twist

453
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,850
Come on, I will ride for you

454
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,550
Never mind, I'm ok

455
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,780
Oops

456
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,740
Come on, you better come with me

457
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,000
How clumsy I am

458
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,010
Oh, This is so drama

459
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,740
Did she graduate from acting school?

460
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,740
Bye Bye M.1(Grade 7)
Good luck my friends

461
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,050
See you at M.2 class

462
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,110
Mom, Mom

463
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,730
Look at this mom

464
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,380
Pang, stop, Pang!!

465
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,040
Mommy, P'Nam has a boy friend

466
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,310
Nam

467
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,310
If that so, how can you go to see dad?

468
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,100
For this matter, I think you should grow up more before you can involve with it

469
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,560
For today

470
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,480
You should think about studying only

471
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,520
Owww

472
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,220
Cheer, you come here?

473
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,420
Pang called me that her sis is being heart-broken

474
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Have been listening to music for a weak

475
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,050
I think you can forget about P'Shone

476
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,590
Ha Ha Ha

477
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,290
Lower the voice!

478
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,420
My mom will hear

479
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,350
Your mom's not home, she went to the market

480
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,270
Cheer, it's crowd

481
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,000
Nam, when will your mom broaden out the stairs?

482
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,350
Hey Nam, Let's look at another method?

483
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,580
Listen carefully

484
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,730
The 7th method

485
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,730
It's the Gypsy's method

486
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,120
The love must build up our self

487
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,870
Use the power of love to make us smarter

488
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,080
More beautiful

489
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,810
and be better in everything

490
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,030
He will look back at us finally

491
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,530
Ehh, What're you doing?

492
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,080
P'Shone is handsome

493
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,390
So Nam must be beautiful
Awww!!!

494
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,300
Umm, her skin is almost strip out

495
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,940
"Monday, I'm waiting"

496
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,940
"Tuesday, I'm still waiting to see"

497
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,610
"see..see...if you are fine"

498
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,630
"Wednesday, you're still not here"

499
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,630
"Neither in the morning, nor later"

500
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,160
"Thursday is also empty"

501
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,730
"Friday or Saturday or even Sunday"

502
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,520
"None of the day that I don't miss you"

503
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,240
"None of the day that you will come back"

504
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,640
"To be in our old days"

505
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,490
"How long it will be like this? I don't know"

506
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,500
"How many months or years?"

507
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,950
"How many billions of our past memory?"

508
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,900
-Eh what is it?

509
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,020
It's Kamin (wipe for brighter skin)

510
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,810
"I never don't miss you"

511
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,920
Heyyy

512
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,340
Hello, girls

513
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,860
Tell me if you want something

514
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,480
Take it easy

515
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,450
(Shock!! Pornchai made the team lose to the champion cup)

516
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,360
Nam

517
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,010
We cannot find

518
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,010
Maybe he's out

519
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,470
Maybe he's not home

520
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,010
I don't see his motorbike

521
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,120
Hey, girls

522
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,330
Have you found it?

523
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,760

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,240
Aww, what do you come to buy?

527
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,620
You play table-tennis?

528
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,440
Why do you look yellow?

529
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,890
Do you have Jaundice?

530
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,870
P'Shone

531
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,130
Aww, N' Mango cake

532
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,030
What do you come to buy?

533
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,710

534
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,460
Ok, follow me

535
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,370
Ayyyyyyy

536
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,420
Come over hear boys and girls

537
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,530
register to drama club with teacher In??

538
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,710
Drama club is here

539
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,250
We have many stories to play

540
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,680
you can be princess, prince

541
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,570
Hero, heroine, it's up to you my children

542
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,510

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,340
Are you interested?

545

Uh, Khun Panya Nirankun also used to be in our club

546
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,540
Is it true?

547

If you want to be famous, come to our club

548
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,730
Come on children

549
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,340
(Thai classical dance club)

550
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,330
It's the place to register, not walking pass

551
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,430
You should take of your glasses, Nam

552
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,570
I'm not used to..

553
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,360
I think

554
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,470
We are not suitable for this concept at all

555
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,040
White skin, Beautiful, Chinese-look alike

556
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
whatever quality of that classical dancers

557
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,870
Yes, it's true.

558
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,240
Every year, teacher Orn selects only
good and beautiful children

559
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,210
and when they're dancing
the whole school students come to see them

560
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,360
Umm, that's right

561
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,170
it's not like those drama club students

562
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,680
They are all ugly

563
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,380
Nobody wants to see them performing

564
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,610
Huyyy

565
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,610
but we should try it

566
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,180
The four of us may be

567
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,720
not white, not look Chinese

568
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,870
but beautiful, dark skin

569
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,240
pioneer generation

570
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,590
Heayyy, P'Shone

571
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,590
P'Shone

572
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,000
Which club do you want to register?

573
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,180
Photography

574
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,470
You can tell me, if you want a model for pictures

575
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,560
I like to take scenery pics, not people

576
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,010
Hey, are you kidding me?

577
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,630
Ok, I'm kidding then

578
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,330
Come on

579
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,700
I will take it

580
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,450
So, you already aren't yellow?

581
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,330
Do you get brighter?

582
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,300
May be a little..

583
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,230
I will wait for you guys

584
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,850
on the school festival day

585
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,250
You see? Nam

586
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,920
You got good feedback from P'Shone

587
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,590
that you're brighter
You have to be confident

588
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,550
If we can perform the dancing
We must be famous

589
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,180
Must be good and beautiful
Remember it

590
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,100
If not sure about the beautifulness
you can go to other clubs

591
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,780
Hey Faye, why did you speak like that?

592
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,230
No, I didn't
I spoke with Kwan

593
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,330
Did I? Kwan?

594
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,330
Liar

595
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,330
You criticize us!!

596
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,710
Hey, you must stop

597
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,980
The ones who make problems, Go out!

598
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,030
Wait

599
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,400
Faye and Kwan

600
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,500
Stay here

601
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,040
Nam

602
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,030
I'm sorry for that matter

603
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,170
I have to apologize you too.

604
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,890
I bought a surplus drink

605
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,400
You can take it
I give you

606
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,730
Wait!! Stop it

607
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,970
Let this girl drink first

608
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,300
Why don't you drink

609
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,570
You should leave

610
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,520
If you don't want to drink water with fish sauce

611
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,080
then, don't forget to pour it away

612
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,670
Look at that girl's behavior

613
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,130
You're here!!
I've been searching for long

614
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,530
Look at my face

615
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,930
Smile

616
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,220
be sullen

617
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
Laugh

618
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,490
It's perfect

619
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,390
See me at the auditorium tomorrow,then

620
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,290
OK

621
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,170
Teacher ka

622
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,170
Don't speak out loud

623
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,720
cause I offer limited students

624
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,280
Understand?

625
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,320
Teacher In

626
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,500
Teacher In

627
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,030
Ouyy, why do you stretch your mount like that?

628
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,170
Teacher In, Teacher In!! How are you?

629
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,790

Teacher In, are you alright?

631
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,660
Teacher In

632
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,890
Do you need something? Head master

633
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,230
No, Nothing

634
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,390
Are you fine?

635
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,640

636
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,820

643
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,880
Teacher

644
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,430
Oh, you come too late

645
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,910
I won't let you play huh?

646
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,290

662
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,520
For the stage drama that I will proudly present..

663
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,300

664
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,990

00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,290
So.....

670
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,630

675
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,440
What are you doing here?

676
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,140
Paint color

677
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,650
Paint color 'inside' the box?

678
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,860
I bough interior painting color

679
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,280
Go paint other place

680
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,490
Wait Wait

681
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,470
You, go jot down tel number of all art students

682
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,760
Must not miss any

683
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,470
Teacher Pon ka

684
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,900
My students...

685
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
have a gift for acting

686
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,160
I'm guarantee that...

687
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,060
Uhh... Teacher In krab

688
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,060
Are you sick?

689
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,320
No....

690
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,050
I'm ok

691
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,280
Orhhhhhhhh

692
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,000
Teacher Pon may not used to my natural face

693
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,750
For the lipstick...

694
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,450
it's wasted to apply it

695
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,550
More importantly

696
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,490
I give an advantage to 'someone'

697
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,020
So

698
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,240
Teacher In give an advantage too much?

699
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,280
Oyyyy!!

700
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,930
better measure with work result

701
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,400
cause about the beautifulness
I think they are about the same

702
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,770
and now, I taught my students

703
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,360
wear make up in my style

704
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,140
When they grow up
they will be natural beautiful

705
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,230
And now!!!!

706
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,540
This is the natural beauty!!

707
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
suit their age

708
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,030
Are you sure that...

709
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,710
You've already taught them?

710
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,470
Is this stage drama or...

711
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,390
stage comedy Teacher In?

712
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,720
It may be Monkey drama then, Teacher Orn

713
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,360
This is children's creativity

714
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,070
(9 recipe of love book)

715
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,740
Aww, you're going home?

716
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,360

717
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,460
(P'Shone 086-xxxxxxx)

718
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,480
Be careful

719
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,180
She walked normally when coming in

720
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,260
Why claudication when going back?

721
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,330

722
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,010

727
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,900
My football will become flat

728
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,690
I'm sorry

729
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,080
This is P' Pin, M.5 senior

730
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,210
She will take care of clothes and make up
for our drama

731
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,210

732
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,390
I'm counting on you Pin

733
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,930
I think we should start

734
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,220
Ok let's start..

735
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,440
So, start with me first.

736
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,120

737
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
I don't play the drama

738
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Let's start with Snow white

739
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,660
begin with Nam first??

740
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,000
Yes, Nam first

741
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,290
How about it, my make up skills?

742
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,050
She looks the same

743
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:49,530
Snow white with dental braces

744
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,800
Doctor!!

745
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,970
I don't want to wear dental braces anymore

746
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,510
Will get them out

747
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,480

748
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,420

He's too bad

823
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,550
Why you didn't come to see the drama?

824
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,910
You went to see those dancers, right?

825

00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,890
But If I can entrance to uni in Bangkok, I will go

843
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,970
He's cute like P' Shone

844
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,040
Let's go to the school cafeteria

845
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,550
Wow, Wow!!

846
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,060
Beautiful girl

847
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,930
Hey girl!
What's your name?

848
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,520
It's you.. What's your name?

849
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,490
Hmm, embarrassed. You're shy

850
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,490
Oww, where're you going? going? Hey Hey

851
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,490
N' come to fight with me?

852
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,490
Maybe Teacher In projects it.

853
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,200
Already shown here all day?

854
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,480
Hey Hey Hey

855
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,650
That's N' Snow white that is in the TV

856
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,140
She's cute

857
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:54,780
Does she has boy friend?

858
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,780
Might not

859
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,490
but I think you shouldn't court her

860
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,490
Hey Why?

861
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,800
Is she too young?

862
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,170
I used to ask for Tel. number of grade 5 girl.

863
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,210

866
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,260
Again, every times that I play football...

867
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,080
You always give me to kick penalty

868
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,490
Kick it by yourself, then

869
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,350
You still don't recover from it?

870
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,160
Till now, your dad may have forgotten it

871
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,300
No, it's not that
it's because the kick is too easy

872
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,620
So I don't want to kick

873
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,380
Oh ho, Christiano Ronaldo

874
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,840
P' Top ka, Could we take pictures with you?

875
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,810

876
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,170

877
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,520
So, who will take it for me?

878
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,160

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,920

880
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,590

Thank you ka

882
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,360
Stand close more

883
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,060
One... two

884
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,300
three

885
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,330
Oh, What!!

886
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,280
What!! Why you're doing like this?

887
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,280
You must apologize!

888
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,220
What's going on? STOP STOP

889
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,580
Stop

890
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,840
Hey, You could make something like this?

891
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,510
I don't know

892
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,220
I'm the referee, head master

893
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:54,170
How many days left for the region sport competition?

894
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,420
about 2 weeks ka

895
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,300
but athletes and cheer students have practiced so hard

896
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,300
Who will be the drum major, then?

897
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,750
Look like I have to consult with teacher Orn

898
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,750
Maybe she can help

899
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,400
Don't worry, head master

900
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,400
I will get it done

901
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,070
My mouth is hurt

902
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,030
Nam!!!

903
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,960
Since I was born till I am fully adult

904
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,520
I've never seen anyone who are perfect and excellent as much as you

905
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
You're good looking very much

906
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,050
Teacher In, you should speak straightly

907
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,190
Do you have something?

908
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,310
Umm......I....

909
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:06,390
I want you to be a drum major for our school
In the region sport day

910
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,270
Ha!!!

911
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,630
Don't need to Ha!! anymore
It's you

912
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,330
You're the most suitable girl

913
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,630
but, it's only 2 weeks

914
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,630
I don't think I could do

915
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,850
but I don't see anyone who could help
Except you, Nam

916
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,690
Ok, I promise

917
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,090
I will become a nun for your favor

918
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,570
Become a nun?

919
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,060
How about two years?

920
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,160
or all of my life?

921
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,920
I can do it, Nam

922
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,030
be perpendicular

923
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,400
Look up

924
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,220
Throw

925
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,420
Just after throwing, look at the spear

926
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,960
After that, when it's near ourselves

927
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,280
Grab it

928
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,120
Then continue to walk

929
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,190
Is it difficult?

930
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,190
It's not hard at all

931
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,520
Can you try?

932
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,670
I've already had my spear

933
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,060
You just have to do it, that's yours
This is mine

934
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,500
Ready? Aim at the target

935
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
If you're ready, throw!!!

936
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,240
One Two Three, Throw!

937
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,480
It's hard

938
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Why doesn't she find other girls?

939
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,250
Hey, don't get discouraged

940
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,250
These are only a few days

941
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,600
Here, this method is important

942
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,240
In the 9 recipe of love book

943
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
The last method was written that..

944
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,900
If you want to do because of love
Do it all-out with your heart

945
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,110
Your beloved will come to you finally

946
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,890
Heayy, Nam

947
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,490
You've come this far
Fight with all your might

948
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,370
It's not only for school drum major

949
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,490
You will be the leading drum major for our province

950
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,490
Fight

951
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,850
"Far.. Far away"

952
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,870
"Too far left... Too far"

953
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,770
Top, pass to me
Top!

954
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,750
"Far...Too far"

955
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,150
Hey

956
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,700
Again, you glance at  girls again

957
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,680
Head master

958
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:54,930
I can guarantee that our marching band will be the most remarkable

959
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,250
How about drum major?

960
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:00,390
Oh don't worry at all
Beautiful, Tall, White skin

961
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,620
Overall, she's wonderful

962
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,980
Teachers, Be careful!!

963
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,970
I'm sorry

964
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,210
Don't tell me she is our leading drum major

965
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,720
Yes but she has been doing well in all the past-time

966
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,310
Today, it may be her first failure

967
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,310
Throwing like a boomerang like this?

968
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,630
If she also fail in the real day, what're we going to do?

969
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,930
It may not happen

970
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,810
replace her

971
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,810
or else I will replace you!

972
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,210
but we only have 1 week left, head master

973
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,640
I am in trouble

974
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,540
The head master get hold of the spear?

975
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,800
Who will be the school drum major?

976
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,600
I don't know, serve Teacher In right

977
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,340
She didn't select beautiful and skillful like us

978
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,040
She insisted on that whoever girl

979
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,920
Each of Her students are so terrible

980
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,490
It's good we're not her students
If so, we would have low profile

981
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,890
How can you speak like this?

982
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,400
Because It's true

983
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,680
Bug face

984
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:37,240
I will make those girls see that
Teacher In students are not terrible

985
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,880
Use Broom?

986
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,840
Where did you get it from?

987
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
I borrowed from the janitor

988
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,140
Even though it's light, it's ok to use

989
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,260
I won't let anyone look down on us and Teacher In

990
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,050
Everyone

991
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,480
Today

992
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,480
Play at the utmost of your strength

993
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,060
That That

994
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,990
Will you do it?

995
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,160
My son is going to kick the penalty goal?

996
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Let's get back

997
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,060
Wait Wait!

998
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,050
What a surprise, he's going to kick the penalty?

999
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,830
Uh, Am I deceptive?

1000
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,140
It's ok
It's ok

1001
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,140
Do you know?

1002
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,230
It's because of his dad, our province couldn't get the national trophy

1003
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,630
Hey, I will let you kick the penalty again
The previous kick was just a warm up

1004
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,590
Your aunt's house set this rule?

1005
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,760
Yes, it's from my aunt's house

1006
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,760
My uncle's house also has this rule

1007
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,360
My house too

1008
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,530
More importantly, I haven't blown the whistle

1009
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,840
He'll kick again

1010
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:38,080
You can play as a forward player for our school now

1011
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,390
Yes

1012
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:46,480
Shone is good!
Shone is good

1013
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,600
Hmm, sweet smile huh?

1014
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,590
I understand

1015
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:14,840
"Far It's too far"

1016
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,580
"Far It's too far"

1017
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,080
"Even though, It's too far from here"

1018
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,670
"I will reach there"

1019
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,000
It's perfect, my daughter

1020
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,440
Aha, OMG

1021
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,160
Umm, excuse me Teacher Orn

1022
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,310
I'd like to know that Did your dancers
use to throw headdress and catch it like her?

1023
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,210
Higher Higher

1024
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,210
Great

1025
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,540
How's your sister?
Is she beautiful like the mom?

1026
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,540
Alas! She's more beautiful than mom

1027
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,350
Very beautiful, Nam

1028
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,130
I don't want to move anywhere

1029
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,540
I see you speak like this every time

1030
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,150
Nam, your beautifulness is too much huh?

1031
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,720
On the last year Valentine, She still had dark face
haha

1032
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,770
It's from P'Kai, It will be mine

1033
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,550
Did Nam give you?

1034
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,380
I don't know

1035
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,420
Nam, I'll take this pink chocolate?

1036
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,140
Yes

1037
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,400
How is Nam?
She looks lonely

1038
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,500
She's waiting for the only one
And he haven't come

1039
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,600
Nam, Come on

1040
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,090
Hurry

1041
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,100
Go on

1042
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,760
Here

1043
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,420
It's from a friend of mine

1044
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:02,910
Nam

1045
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,470
See you tomorrow 4PM

1046
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,740
In front of 3rd floor stairs

1047
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,330
I have something to tell you

1048
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:37,700
Hey Shone
Going home with us?

1049
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,620
I'll go afterward

1050
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,270
Nam

1051
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,400
I'm certain that you would come

1052
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,780
Is this letter from P'Top?

1053
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:08,890
Yes, That's mine

1054
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,900
Do you have something to tell?

1055
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,810
Will you be my girl friend?

1056
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,300
Uh, Did P'Shone has something to talk with me?

1057
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,790
Orhh I just wanted to ask..

1058
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,490
Why did you come up here

1059
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:33,470
Now, I know the reason

1060
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,150
What is the answer?

1061
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,420
If you don't answer
I will think you're ok with it?

1062
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,150
Ha!! P'Top?

1063
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,150
How come?

1064
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,930
P'Shone only spoke like that?

1065
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,520
Yes

1066
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,350
How about you, Nam?
What did you tell him?

1067
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:02,350
I didn't answer

1068
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,230
What am I going to do now, Cheer?

1069
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,810
You should wait and see

1070
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:13,170
P'Top is P'Shone best friend
If you do something without considering

1071
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,170
P'Shone will surely be angry at you

1072
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,610
Are you free today?
Let's go to see football match

1073
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,160
Uh I'm not free today

1074
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,350
It's not long
Shone will play as a real player for the first time

1075
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,140
I can go

1076
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,360
Nam

1077
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,170
Water
- Thank you

1078
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,970
Hey, do you have some drink?

1079
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,510
No, I don't

1080
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,150
Plan B

1081
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,820
Run more

1082
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,250
You know it, mr button?

1083
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,500
I want to sit behind P'Shone on his motorbike

1084
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,210
(The first semester has end)
(See you M.3)

1085
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:01,200
Cheer, which cake do you like to eat in your birthday?
Choose it by yourself

1086
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,380
Vanilla cake

1087
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,910
Nam likes it

1088
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,790
Hello, Nam?

1089
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,460
Where are you?

1090
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,990
We're choosing birthday cake for Cheer

1091
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,540
I come to a dam with P'Shone and friends

1092
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,130
I can't go on time

1093
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,040
I called Cheer this morning but no one hung up

1094
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,350
Happy birthday to Cheer for me then

1095
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,160
Yes, I'm sorry

1096
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,160
Ok Ok
I will tell Cheer

1097
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,730
P' Ka, This piece ka

1098
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,720
Squid

1099
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,750
I'll be back

1100
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:28,380
What are you doing here?

1101
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,610
Uh, I think this area is beautiful

1102
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,480
Do you want to eat Squid?

1103
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,470
Have you heard of the squid's story?

1104
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,140
No

1105
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:55,560
I will tell you

1106
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:00,610
Once upon a time

1107
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,810
There were two squids

1108
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,940
They had traveled till they met each other

1109
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,050
Then, they fell in love

1110
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:12,170
They became a couple

1111
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,000
Finally

1112
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
They got married

1113
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,770
On the day of marriage

1114
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:26,420
Squid priest told them to hold hands

1115
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,590
So, they held each other hands

1116
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:31,860
held the hands

1117
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,640
held hands

1118
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,210
held hands

1119
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,570
held hands, held hands

1120
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:43,360
Ha, P'Shone

1121
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:44,710
Crazy

1122
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,330
But cute

1123
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,090
The teller or the squids?

1124
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,020
The teller

1125
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,020
Eh the squids

1126
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,610
Umm, I'm confused

1127
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,360
I kinda don't want to eat them

1128
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,110
I've never eaten squids for so long
Since I heard this story

1129
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,610
So...

1130
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,210
Did you use to hold someone hand like the squids?

1131
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,400
Once

1132
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,090
An awkward-face girl

1133
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,610
was falling down from the stage

1134
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,810
So, I held her hand

1135
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,050
Nam!

1136
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,710
Why don't you eat squids?

1137
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,990
I prepared it myself, it looks delicious

1138
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,450
No!!

1139
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,260
No!!

1140
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,290
Why? It's delicious

1141
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,540
I'm asking you straightly

1142
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,540
Do you like Nam

1143
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,650
Uh, You be with her
Why asking me?

1144
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,600
It's noting
kidding nah

1145
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,030
Are you alright?

1146
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:57,340
I'm Ok, just a little hurt

1147
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,630
Let's stand up

1148
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,310
Come on, ride piggyback me

1149
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,690
Mr Button

1150
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,130
Today, P'Shone carries the bag for me

1151
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,350
Nam??

1152
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:33,060
Cheer's not home
went with Gie and Nim

1153
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,260
Nam didn't go with them?

1154
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,180
No ka

1155
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,180
Try to call them

1156
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:54,260
I miss the old days

1157
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,880
When we're doing home work altogether

1158
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,960
An angel must be in heaven

1159
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,150
Who want to be in hell like us

1160
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,430
Cheer calm down

1161
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,740
we still have birth day again in the next year

1162
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:11,170
Nim, I only have 3 friends

1163
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,450
If I were her, I wouldn't do like this

1164
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,830
Cheer, will you come to do home work at my house?

1165
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,560
Why don't you ask P'Shone and friends?

1166
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,220
Top has not come yet?

1167
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:58,650
He appoint me to teach a M.3 student

1168
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,430
He hasn't come

1169
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,710
He go to borrow books to do project work

1170
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,710
for a M.3 student

1171
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,260
that day

1172
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,260
My mom stayed in the hospital

1173
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:17,760
Which day?

1174
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:21,220
The day that my dad missed the penalty kick

1175
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,130
I was born that day

1176
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,850
So, my dad gave a birth day gift to me

1177
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,230
by quitting playing football  his entire life

1178
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,240
I'm the one who brings bad luck

1179
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,960
Look at it

1180
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,920
The province had never come that far till that day

1181
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,640
Are you ok?

1182
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,610
For me being teased?

1183
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:51,610
I'm ok

1184
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,610
I'm used to it

1185
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,050
It becomes my surname

1186
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,640
Shone

1187
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,500
whose dad couldn't score penalty kick

1188
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,970
But it's ok

1189
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,140
I am a football player

1190
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,400
Do you want to become a footballer?

1191
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,920
I don't know

1192
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:16,080
For now

1193
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,080
I need somebody

1194
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,540
Nam

1195
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:29,560
I couldn't find the books

1196
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,560
Help me find?

1197
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,980
Wait a bit, Shone

1198
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:53,400
Love you but you don't know
Only conceal it withing my heart

1199
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:59,440
P'Shone, I've heard that there will be a surprise for P' Ake birthday

1200
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,240
Let's wait and see

1201
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:08,060
Want us to be together

1202
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,350
Love you but you don't know

1203
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:15,770
Love you, only if you know

1204
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:22,860
Love you but you don't know

1205
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:30,460
It's the time for our special show tonight

1206
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,590
It happened when we studied grade 5

1207
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:39,090
That time, both of us

1208
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,730
secretly loved the same girl

1209
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,070
Her name is Boe, a grade 4

1210
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,400
We tried to compete each other by practicing dancing

1211
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,030
So one of us could dance with her in the school party

1212
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,980
But when the real day came

1213
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:56,690
Our P'Shone had chickenpox

1214
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,270
So the right to dance with her was mine

1215
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,440
But finally...

1216
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,440
Khun Top gave up his right

1217
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,530
So, we both failed

1218
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:11,650
Aww, That's because our P'Shone
Intimidated that he would break up with me

1219
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:15,520
After that, we promised each other...

1220
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,610
We will not like the same girl

1221
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:19,310
That's right

1222
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,820
Come on

1223
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,640
Islander's dance

1224
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:55,610
Happy birthday to you

1225
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,470
Nam, tomorrow I will come here the same time

1226
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,470
Let's watch P'Shone play football

1227
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:21,090
P'Top doesn't need to pick me up anymore

1228
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:24,280
Why? You will not be free?

1229
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,680
No, I mean that....

1230
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:31,170
Don't involve with me anymore

1231
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:37,100
You're angry at me that I kissed your cheek?

1232
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,340
But you're my girl friend?

1233
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,760
P' Top ka

1234
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,450
I've never accepted that I'm your girl friend

1235
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,440
So, what's the meaning of all these time

1236
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,910
I'm sorry

1237
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,420
I have the one I love

1238
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,670
Who?

1239
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:01,160
Nam, who is he?

1240
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,160
Nam

1241
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:11,430
Since I've been with girls

1242
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:14,280
She is the most painful

1243
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,700
I beg you one thing, Shone

1244
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,420
No matter what

1245
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,360
you won't hit on Nam?

1246
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:30,070
Do you think that the reason she broke up with you is me?

1247
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:32,070
No

1248
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,070
It's just unbearable

1249
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,490
That my best friend

1250
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,410
be with the girl I love

1251
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,730
You said like this

1252
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:44,730
I cannot deny

1253
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,950
Are you ok with it?

1254
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:49,950
Yes

1255
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,420
"I don't understand"

1256
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,760
Thank you mom

1257
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:22,540
"Why it must be you.."

1258
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,370
"To be the one in my heart"

1259
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:29,900
"I have met many people"

1260
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,400
"But It must be you eventually"

1261
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,100
"Who are in my heart"

1262
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,100
"Love"

1263
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:43,930
"Is not a coincidence"

1264
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:45,280
"Love"

1265
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:49,920
"Can connect you with me"

1266
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,420
"There's only the heart that knows"

1267
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:55,490
"Who is the one in my dream"

1268
01:25:55,490 --> 01:26:00,350
"You're the one that I've been waiting"

1269
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:04,200
"Because the heart is begging"

1270
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,160
"Cause the heart is calling for"

1271
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:12,740
"Born to be your forever"

1272
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,700
"It's because my heart"

1273
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,640
"Never confused"

1274
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,970
"It's certain that you are the only one"

1275
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:30,470
"There are not many reasons"

1276
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:35,550
"It just because my heart chooses you"

1277
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:48,570
Hey, I've called my friend who is the manager of Bangkok glass team

1278
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,860
and?

1279
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,510
He told me that

1280
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:55,300
He would accept you to practice in Bangkok Glass club

1281
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,600
You cheated me to lose the ball?

1282
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,900
For this important matter, who are willing to lie

1283
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,900
You should prepare yourself

1284
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,730
Maybe after you have finished this year's exam

1285
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,500
You might have to go study in Bangkok

1286
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,330
Dad!!

1287
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,330
Thank you krab

1288
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,990
Teacher Pon should tell me sooner

1289
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:35,000
so I could get a scholarship to go with you

1290
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:37,170
I'm sorry

1291
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,820
I was busy so I didn't tell you

1292
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,250
but there will be a new sport teacher

1293
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:49,530
Oh! At this point of time

1294
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:53,210
No one can replace you
I confirm

1295
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,600
Before you go

1296
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:58,310
I beg you one thing

1297
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,310
What is it?

1298
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,650
This

1299
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,550
It's shame

1300
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,980
Uh, I asked for the heart

"Every time you turn to me"

1483
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:37,770
(I want to tell you that you had succeeded since you began to do)

1484
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,640
"that I pretend to be still"

1485
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:43,240
"Do you know how much I have to force myself"

1486
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,740
"Can you hear that?"

1487
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,710
"My heart...."

1488
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:50,900
"Is telling you I love you"

1489
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,410
She looks the same

1490
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:50,730
Snow white with dental braces

1491
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:54,960
(Answered Pin that she looked the same)

1492
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:58,120
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1493
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,060
(She looked the same, cute as always)

1494
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,700
"Can you hear that?"

1495
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:02,430
"My heart..."

1496
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:09,320
(Touched her hand for the first time)
But I had to release it cause others would curious)

1497
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:09,270
"Is waiting there for you to open"

1498
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:12,640
"Can only hope you will know it"

1499
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:16,100
"Some day"

1500
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:16,080
(Gave her an apple but I bit it)

1501
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:23,490
"Though I love you"

1502
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,330
"Though I feel it"

1503
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:34,340
"But deep inside isn't brave enough"

1504
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:37,410
(You've been better, Fight! Nam)

1505
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:39,580
"Every time we meet"

1506
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,160
"Every time you turn to me"

1507
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,580
"That I pretend to be still"

1508
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:49,410
"Do you know how much I have to force myself"

1509
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,960
"Can you hear that?"

1510
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:53,860
(Love can win everything especially fear)

1511
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:54,130
"My heart....."

1512
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:57,950
"Is telling you I love you"

1513
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:57,790
(The first day)
(It was very difficult to grow)
(One worm)

1514
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:59,080
It's from a friend of mine

1515
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:04,930
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1516
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,960
"Can you hear that my heart.."

1517
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:11,380
(Today, I gave the rose to Nam)
(I said it was from my friend)
(It's because I am tight-lipped)

1518
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:16,290
"Is waiting there for you to open"

1519
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:19,180
"Can only hope you will know it"

1520
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:25,270
"Some day"

1521
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:27,390
(Today, I saw Top confessed...)
(You know I'm hurt)
(Why our time never match?)

1522
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:40,290
(Me too, wanted you to ride on my back)

1523
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:50,260
Nam

1524
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,330
Will you be my girl friend?

1525
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,810
"Can you hear that..?"

1526
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:57,400
"my heart..."

1527
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,940
"is telling you I love you"

1528
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:08,380
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1529
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,380
"Can you hear that....?"

1530
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,380
"My heart..."

1531
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:22,140
"Is still waiting there for you to open"

1532
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,370
I beg you one thing Shone

1533
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,220
You won't hit on Nam?

1534
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:53,770
"Can only hope you will know it"

1535
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:57,670
"That I'm the one here to love you"

1536
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:04,810
"I'm begging you please know it"

1537
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:09,090
"Some day"

1538
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:54,320
9 years later

1539
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,340
This side has windows

1540
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:11,340
Kai, take care of the customers for me?

1541
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,790
A moment

1542
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:22,160
Hi, handsome boy

1543
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,680
Do you feel asleep?

1544
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,200
I'm sorry to bother your time, Shone

1545
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,410
Never mind

1546
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,410
Your son is like my son

1547
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:39,400
You're a cry baby again

1548
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:41,080
My hair is messing

1549
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,470
Pin I have to go now

1550
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:47,120
See you boy

1551
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,590
If only his real father would love him like you do

1552
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:52,690
Speak like this again

1553
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,470
Call me later?

1554
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,940
Shone

1555
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,900
How about the TV show that called you?

1556
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,190
Will you go?

1557
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:06,120
I don't know

1558
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,830
Bye Bye Shone

1559
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,740
Bye Bye, you yawn

1560
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:17,490

Clothing staffs ready?

1564
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:29,400
No worry, It will be perfect

1565
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,650
I'm ready

1566
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:40,110
Please be relax

1567
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:40,610
Yes

1568
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:44,260
You're beautiful
-Thank you ka

1569
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:51,540
It's good that P' Nam is fashionable

1570
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:54,890
If P'Nam is beautiful as mom like me....

1571
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:57,820
Dare to speak

1572
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:03,040
Teacher Boat

1573
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,070
Sawaddee krab

1574
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:08,750
Since then, I've rode this boat all the time

1575
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,610
I'm jealous

1576
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:14,270
He likes to do sweet things

1577
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,430
I'm jealous

1578
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:27,070
He always surprises me

1579
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:33,740
Surprise again

1580
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:43,680
Uh.. That.. That is a rose

1581
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,700
I have to eat, if not he will sulk

1582
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:50,270
5..4..3..2..

1583
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,140
Now, we're here with Khun Nam

1584
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:02,930
The designer of the beautiful clothes that we've just watched

1585
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,740
Sawaddee ka

1586
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:14,620
Our fans may know her well
cause she is the designer in only a few of Thais that are famous in New York

1587
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:16,620
and this is the evidence

1588
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:36,070
This is only a part of her work

1589
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:41,510
Khun Nam, do you know that...

1590
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:45,870
In Thailand, you're also well-known

1591
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:50,240
I still have to develop my skill

1592
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:54,930
So, what work will you do as you came back to Thailand?

1593
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:59,930
There's a brand that would like to organize a fashion show

1594
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:05,260
I think it's interesting, so I agree to do

1595
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:08,800
and because I want to come back

1596
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,970
I miss my mom

1597
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:14,370
Khun Nam used to tell reporters that....

1598
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:17,170
When you were young
Umm... I'm sorry

1599
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:20,940
You were so ugly (bug face) and had bad sense of fashion

1600
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:23,410
That's totally different from now

1601
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:28,240
What make you've changed yourself this much?

1602
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,970
Because, I fell in love some one

1603
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:33,970
falling in love?

1604
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:37,050
Could you tell the story?

1605
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:40,840
Yes, He was my senior

1606
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,960
M.4 senior

1607
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,470
He was a football player

1608
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:47,380
and very cute

1609
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:49,790
At that time, I.........

1610
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:52,240
Had bug face studying M.1

1611
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:54,630
Developed myself a lot

1612
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:59,460
If It could make me to be beautiful, to be better
I tried to do it

1613
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:03,770
and tried to study better so he might interest in me

1614
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:08,820
Did he know it, in the end?

1615
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:12,260
He knew but it didn't have a happy ending

1616
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:18,320
I went to study in the US

1617
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,600
to stay with my dad

1618
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,540
It's bad

1619
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:27,710
but when I think about it
He is like....

1620
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:29,710
my inspiration

1621
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:33,230
He made me use the love in good way

1622
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,960
He is like....

1623
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,420
The power that support me to be better and better

1624
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:40,950
Till I am today's Nam

1625
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:47,020
Khun Nam, you remember this notebook?

1626
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,160
You may recall it?

1627
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,820
Yes, I remember

1628
01:51:56,820 --> 01:52:02,720
If so, let's welcome the owner of this book

1629
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:08,110
Khun Shone, the former footballer of Bangkok glass

1630
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:24,880
Now, he's changed his career to be a pro-photographer

1631
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:29,280
I want to give it to Nam krab

1632
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,930
Nam???

1633
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:34,930
It's Nam's

1634
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,800
Please sit

1635
01:52:55,110 --> 01:53:00,000
Khun Shone, after you've never met Khun Nam for 9 years.....

1636
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:03,630
Do you have something to tell Khun Nam?

1637
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:08,460
I want to tell you that......

1638
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:16,610
This button

1639
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:18,610
is not mine

1640
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,910
It may be Ding's

1641
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:37,150
How about you Khun Nam?
Do you have something to tell him?

1642
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:46,490
I want to ask P' Shone that......

1643
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,960
Have you been married?

1644
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,170
Umm.........

1645
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:03,130
Um...I have

1646
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:19,600
I have been waiting for some one to come back from the US

1647
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:21,860
"Can you hear that?"

1648
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,860
"My heart.."

1649
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:27,150
"Is telling you I love you"

1650
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:34,130
"But I cannot reveal my true feeling to anyone"

1651
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:36,820
"Can you hear that?"

1652
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:38,390
"My heart......"

1653
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:45,630
"Is still waiting there for you to open"

1654
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,470
"And I can only hope you will know it"

1655
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:56,750
"That I'm the one here to love you"

1656
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:02,930
"I'm begging you please know it"

1657
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:07,490
"Some day"

1
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,024
Jesus.

2
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,151
Where's the nearest
good restaurant?

3
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,780
Depends... If you you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

4
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,242
But if you're a gator,
it could be right where we land.

5
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,205
Thank your lucky stars
you're coming in at the end of this.

6
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,864
Holland insisted
on building it all out here.

7
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,325
<i>He said this is
where the life is.</i>

8
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,287
One of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

9
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,419
What, they sent
a woman out here?

10
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,796
Where the hell are you going?

11
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,173
Couldn't take it anymore.

12
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,926
Well, he lasted longer than most.

13
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,298
Boo.

14
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,312
<i>Don't shoot.</i>

15
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,318
<i>Watch your step.</i>

16
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,965
No!

17
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,557
Weird, isn't it?

18
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,809
The local fishermen say
this place is haunted.

19
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,437
I don't know where
we are, Toto,

20
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,813
but it sure isn't Kansas.

21
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:55,857
What?

22
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,151
Nothing.

23
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,246
Used to be a church
until about 50 years ago.

24
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,123
Then the levee broke.

25
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,835
Just been us and the deer flies
the last ten weeks.

26
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,629
Welcome back, sir.

27
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,297
What'd Washington say?

28
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,465
That's confidential, Teddy.

29
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,008
<i>That's okay, miss, I got it.</i>

30
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,649
But you can start packing
your toothbrush.

31
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,220
All right.

32
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>Where's this thing go?</i>

33
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,434
<i>Give me a hand
over here with this thing.</i>

34
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,477
<i>I got ya, man.</i>

35
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,062
What does Holland think
about getting yanked

36
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,521
from the swamps
back to Washington?

37
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,106
I doubt he's even been told.

38
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,984
Ritter couldn't believe me
when I gave him the news this morning.

39
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,028
Do you think Washington's paranoid?

40
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,614
Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

41
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,450
This is your place.

42
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,880
You probably haven't seen
half this stuff.

43
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,173
It's all new.

44
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,925
Take this, for instance.
This is a la...

45
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,344
laser-induced
subsonic field generator.

46
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,680
Gives double readings
in the 3200 band, right?

47
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,057
I got a trick for fixing that.

48
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,517
Just my luck
they send me someone

49
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,477
who know what she's doin'
the week they pull us out.

50
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,521
- What's he working on anyway?
- <i>Who?</i>

51
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:18,481
Holland.

52
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,817
This thing is so hush-hush,
no one asks.

53
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,068
Something to do with plants.

54
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,528
<i>Where the hell's my man?</i>

55
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,612
<i>I thought he was back.</i>

56
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,906
<i>Hey, Charlie!</i>

57
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,450
Emperor calls. Come on.

58
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,328
Hey, you know there's a...

59
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,209
<i>What's going on here?</i>

60
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,295
<i>Get those crates
into the church!</i>

61
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,380
<i>You men in the boat,</i>

62
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,714
<i>what the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

63
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,008
Get that dumb thing outta sight!

64
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,177
<i>Lame brains!</i>

65
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,220
<i>Charlie, welcome back.</i>

66
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,972
<i>And this is Hank's replacement?</i>

67
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:54,599
Cable, Harry Ritter,
Project Field Supervisor.

68
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,852
You know one of your sensors
is reading malfunction?

69
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,437
It's not surprising.

70
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,313
They rot in a week
in these damn swamps.

71
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,525
Charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

72
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,194
No, they want him and the substance
back in Washington

73
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,612
where they can keep
their eyes on him.

74
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,947
Anything wrong
that you know of?

75
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,240
A rumor.

76
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,493
Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

77
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,661
I thought Arcane was dead.

78
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,538
He is! Who said that?

79
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,956
Who said Arcane's on to this?

80
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,501
Nobody's taken credit for it.
You know Washington.

81
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,630
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

82
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,757
and the whole project
goes to hell in a hand basket.

83
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,135
- <i>You know that?</i>
- Yes, <i>sir.</i>

84
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,929
That goes for you too.

85
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,392
Come on. Come on.

86
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,936
I keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

87
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,565
This admits the three of us
and the Hollands.

88
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,650
It was programmed
for your prints this morning.

89
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,611
Try it.

90
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,622
<i>The stuff I have
to put up with...</i>

91
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,625
<i>alligators, bugs, poisonous snakes,
and now the rumors begin.</i>

92
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:05,796
Charlie, I want to hear everything
about the Arcane business now.

93
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,259
What about that sensor out
in sector three.

94
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,678
Right, get somebody
to take you out there... take a look.

95
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,889
Me?

96
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,600
In the swamps?

97
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,656
<i>Any luck there?</i>

98
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:33,824
Wiggle your fingers.

99
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,702
Lose a contact lens?

100
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,622
Funny.

101
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,791
Well, don't just stand there,
give us a hand.

102
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,832
Right about in the middle.

103
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,170
Please.

104
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,177
I dropped a Cooper's Digger.

105
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,740
Would you look
under the rocks, please?

106
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,266
Go ahead.

107
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,021
What's a Cooper's Digger anyway,
some kind of shovel?

108
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,357
Nah.

109
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,943
Just Alessandro.

110
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,488
Got a little one-celled animal
living in his fur

111
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,865
that makes a terrific host.

112
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,285
Terrific.

113
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,329
I'll remember that
the next time I throw a party.

114
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,790
Oh, not bad, not bad.

115
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,459
You don't have to be crazy
to be around him,

116
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,628
but it helps.

117
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,338
Alice Cable,
new kid on the block.

118
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,465
You guy's part of Holland's crew?

119
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,718
I'm Linda Holland.

120
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,261
You're Doctor Holland.

121
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,222
I'm a Doctor Holland,
but not the Doctor Holland...

122
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,432
boy genius and oddball.

123
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,934
That's Alec, he's the brains
in the family.

124
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,686
I just cook up what he invents.

125
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,895
Oh, no, don't you believe her.

126
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,647
She's got an IQ
like a phone number.

127
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,024
Which reminds me,

128
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,067
I want you to run up
a new variation on the formula

129
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,819
with that little host
on Alessandro's fur.

130
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,904
Okay.

131
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,908
Hello.

132
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,870
I understand you have
a sensor out.

133
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,151
You wanna go out
and take a look?

134
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,084
Well, I guess I could
ask Charlie to give us an escort.

135
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,337
Maybe we could ask
your mother to come along too.

136
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,630
Come on.

137
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,839
The only dangerous thing out there

138
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,134
are those government agents
with their popguns.

139
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,177
It's your first day on the job.

140
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,970
I'll take you on a cook's tour.

141
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,139
I mean, Ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air.

142
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,380
He'll... he'll be tickled pink.

143
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,603
What do you say?

144
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,198
Oh, man.

145
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,324
You look like a tree.

146
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,619
Sometimes I feel like a tree.

147
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,203
Like the swamps?

148
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,579
Hate the swamps.

149
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,790
Hate bugs,
hate things without legs.

150
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,125
A neatness freak?

151
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,752
You could eat off
my kitchen floor.

152
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:51,921
You could eat off the swamps.

153
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,299
<i>Maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.</i>

154
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,094
More than likely,
the swamps'll eat off us.

155
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,346
Like, what happened to the guy
I'm replacing, for instance?

156
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,474
The gator was only following
his natural way.

157
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,768
Can't blame a guy for that.

158
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,823
I paid a fortune
for these boots.

159
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,665
You better keep moving, there's
a fair amount of quicksand around here.

160
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,995
- You better keep <i>your</i> eyes <i>open</i> too.
- For what?

161
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,417
Or one of these just might
jump out and do you in.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,460
You know there's over a hundred species
of Genus Orchia here.

163
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,212
There's so much beauty
in the swamps

164
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,463
if you just open up
your eyes to it.

165
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,842
I mean, take a look
into your own body,

166
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,552
one of God's most
magnificent creations,

167
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:41,678
and what do you see?

168
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,848
Straight lines and deodorant
and chrome and Formica?

169
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:48,017
No, no, no, you see
blood and bone, pump and flow

170
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,311
and a million messy miracles.

171
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,896
I mean, just look
at the most creative thing

172
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,356
a man and a woman
can do together

173
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,899
and you'll see
something growing.

174
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,860
Unpredictable.

175
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,027
Magical.

176
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,155
Hot.

177
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,117
Just save the malarkey
for your wife, Holland.

178
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,287
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

179
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,957
It's right over there.

180
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,131
Looks okay to me.

181
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,425
Here, let me help.

182
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,647
Well, it doesn't look
okay to me.

183
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,734
- Let's get back.
- All right.

184
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,384
Charlie?

185
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,891
Charlie.

186
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:12,977
Cable?

187
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,771
What in the hell is your story?

188
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,940
Charlie, did anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

189
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,066
You're damn right!

190
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,026
Something suspicious did happen!

191
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,404
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

192
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,324
takes a scientist
we're all supposed to be guarding

193
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,369
for an unguarded romp
in the bush!

194
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>Hold it.
Just cool it a minute, all right?</i>

195
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,830
<i>You think you're
on a picnic or something?</i>

196
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,457
Wait a minute, Ritter,
it was my idea to take her out there.

197
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,583
She was just doin her job.

198
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,252
Why do you have to be
so worried all the time for?

199
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,753
Because it's my job to worry.

200
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,713
And if I have my way,
and by God I will,

201
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,841
you'll be on the next chopper
back to Washington.

202
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:45,010
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

203
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,722
There's a cut sensor out there,
what about that?

204
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,765
Which sector?

205
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,975
<i>Sector three.</i>

206
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:55,103
Hank was working on that one
when he was bitten by the gator.

207
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,981
Needless to say, he didn't put it
all back together again

208
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,775
before we took him
to the hospital.

209
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,323
Tickled pink?

210
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,951
I'm really sorry, Cable.

211
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:14,498
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

212
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,834
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there?

213
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:18,918
Ronnie?

214
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,170
No, why?

215
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,048
We seem to have
lost contact with him.

216
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,427
<i>- Hey, what's that?
- Back off, get back.</i>

217
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,017
Linda, are you all right?

218
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,269
<i>It's okay, it's okay!</i>

219
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,187
Oh, dear God.

220
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,193
The damnedest thing.

221
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,695
You know this new batch
you had me cook up

222
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,531
with the host
from Alessandro's fur?

223
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,575
I knew we were up
to something revolutionary.

224
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,202
But this is literally dynamite.

225
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,705
Watch.

226
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,502
Incredible.

227
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,795
Weird?

228
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,047
Yeah.

229
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:07,717
Congratulations, you managed
to reinvent nitro.

230
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,929
Let's hope this project
doesn't end with a bang.

231
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,015
Oh, come on, Charlie, please.

232
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,391
I gotta write this down.

233
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,853
I thought you were working
on some sort of weapons system.

234
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,356
<i>- I</i> knew <i>it</i> wasn't just plants.
- Plants, plants.

235
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,649
The only way
lever thought my work

236
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,609
would be explosive
was social, if you believe it.

237
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,195
The stuff we've been working with
has never been this volatile before.

238
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,239
Linda, cut up a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,283
- Right.
- And be exceptionally careful with it.

240
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,368
- All right?
- Don't worry.

241
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,078
What is it you've
been doing here, Holland?

242
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,359
Come on over here,
I'll show you.

243
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,220
Now, you see those little guys?

244
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,640
DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli E. Coli.

245
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,808
Now, you see that one?

246
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,934
Another simple bacilli.

247
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,645
Plant matrix called D Complex.

248
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,773
Now, each of these organisms
have existed in the labs for years.

249
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,275
But always separately,
which isn't too surprising

250
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,777
since one is animal,
the other's vegetable.

251
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,114
But now this is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

252
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,366
You see that little guy?

253
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,951
Never existed on the face
of the Earth before.

254
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,078
That's my baby-.

255
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,082
A simple vegetable cell
with an unmistakable animal nucleus.

256
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,584
Recombinant DNA?

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,628
Hey, that's very good.

258
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,756
I'm very close
to developing a plant

259
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,885
with an animal's aggressive
power for survival.

260
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,221
A plant for the 21st century.

261
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,849
What do you want, watermelons
the size of weather balloons?

262
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,559
Or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick.

263
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,228
Well, I wouldn't mind a tomato
that could grow in the desert.

264
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,480
Or soybeans
that could thrive in Biafra.

265
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,274
Or corn that could grow
in the good old U.S. of A.,

266
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,527
say in the year 2001, when there'll be
6 1/2 billion people on this planet.

267
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,779
<i>All of them hungry.
How you doin' there, Linda?</i>

268
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,905
<i>It's all set.</i>

269
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,616
Vector 3-3-7-9.

270
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,201
Okay.

271
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,127
- It's replicating like mad.
- It certainly is.

272
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,172
Well, come on,
let's try it on something.

273
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,009
Cable, would you bring that flask
of water over here, please?

274
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,137
Thank you.

275
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,307
If it would work on plants
the way you want it to,

276
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,641
what will it do to people?

277
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,810
And what if it falls
in the wrong hands?

278
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,064
Arcane boogie man mentality?

279
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,939
Okay, now we begin.

280
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,025
I have 2,000 water.

281
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,737
One part formula.

282
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,991
<i>Two thousand water, 6:30, March 20.</i>

283
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,210
- How long before you'll know?
- What?

284
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,711
Look, what do you want it to do?

285
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,797
Jump out of the beaker
and dance a fandango?

286
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,340
I don't know, a week maybe.

287
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,383
Maybe longer.

288
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,637
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

289
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,582
Aren't there some sensors out there
you could be working on?

290
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,187
- Oops.
- Forget it.

291
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,814
He's just ridiculously sensitive.

292
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,191
Our dad was the same.

293
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,610
Your dad?

294
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,404
You've never heard of Walter Holland,
the biophysicist?

295
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,572
Nobel prize?

296
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,243
He used to throw a mean
Bunsen burner, I can tell ya.

297
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,038
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

298
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,790
Perfectionist 'til the day he died.

299
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,126
Alec's the same.

300
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,360
Oh, my God.

301
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,736
What is that?

302
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,322
Cable, I don't believe this.

303
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,909
All the places
that Linda dropped the formula,

304
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,953
the boards grew.

305
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,912
Are you kidding?

306
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,123
No, I'm not kidding.

307
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,750
- Alec.
- Linda!

308
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,170
<i>- What?</i>
- Get in here quick!

309
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,754
- This is fantastic.
- Alec.

310
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,715
This is incredible!

311
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,056
Alec, the formula?

312
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,601
Ritter, he's gotta be told
right away.

313
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,146
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realizes we've done it!

314
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,109
Ritter!

315
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,112
Ritter!

316
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,073
You guys seen Ritter?

317
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,450
<i>He's in the command shed.</i>

318
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,660
Thanks.

319
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,755
Ritter.

320
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,876
Charlie.

321
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,901
Hey!

322
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,119
Get up!

323
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:10,914
Hold it!

324
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,958
- I'm holdin'.
- It's over, lady.

325
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,587
Arcane, right?

326
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,839
Shut up.

327
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,508
Alec, watch out!...

328
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,146
Very interesting,
Doctor Holland.

329
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,189
On your feet.

330
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,817
Who are you?

331
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,944
Interesting.

332
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,611
Let go!

333
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:46,033
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like... this before.

334
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,789
Have you?

335
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,791
What the hell do you want?

336
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,753
I represent a certain party
that's...

337
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,588
interested in your formula.

338
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,215
<i>They'd give an arm
and a leg for it.</i>

339
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,009
Your arm and leg, if necessary.

340
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,802
Get out of my lab!

341
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,138
- Get out!
- Alec.

342
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,182
<i>What's the hold up?</i>

343
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,355
He's being difficult.

344
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,316
No, Ritter, not you.

345
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,777
No, Doctor Holland, not Ritter.

346
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,531
Ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

347
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,540
You have heard of,
but never seen me.

348
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,626
So, I will introduce myself.

349
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,504
My name is Arcane.

350
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,298
Linda, come here. Here.

351
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,425
Leave her alone.

352
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,887
Thank you.

353
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:55,142
All materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

354
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,311
or she dies.

355
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,941
What sort of rejuvenation will
you be able to perform on her then?

356
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,402
All right.

357
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,820
Don't Alec.

358
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,072
It's all right.

359
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,335
The actual solution as well.

360
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,262
Linda!

361
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,222
Linda!

362
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,974
Linda!

363
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,154
What is best for you
is not to be born.

364
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,029
Not to be.

365
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,532
To be nothing.

366
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,994
But the second best
for you is to die soon.

367
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,079
Nietzsche.

368
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,075
The notebooks.

369
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,237
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Look out where?

370
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,307
The notebooks... good.

371
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,523
Strip it. No bodies.

372
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,399
No witnesses.

373
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,111
Yo...

374
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,657
Survivors, no place for any.

375
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,242
You, come here a second.

376
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,284
- Burn the papers.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,370
Burn everything.
Come on, get a move on!

378
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,038
<i>Hey, somebody help Bruno
with the bodies.</i>

379
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,039
<i>He's doin' it by himself.</i>

380
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,167
<i>I want this place
clean by dawn.</i>

381
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,109
Is that the last of 'em?

382
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,195
- That's it!
- Then get the lead out!

383
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,454
The final check
and let's vacate the premises.

384
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,615
Right. Take that to the boat.

385
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,295
Hurry it up!

386
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,088
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute!</i>

387
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,090
<i>I'm finding lot's
of good stuff down here.</i>

388
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,341
What kind of stuff?

389
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,844
<i>A little of this,
a little of that.</i>

390
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,429
<i>Come on down and take a look.</i>

391
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,727
Whatcha got?

392
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,687
Found some money,
a watch, and a couple of...

393
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,565
- No, this.
- Oh, that.

394
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,774
I took it off the girl.

395
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:31,735
<i>You can have it.</i>

396
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,278
Ain't worth nothin' compared
to the watches anyway.

397
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,072
Get out in front,
we're getting out of here.

398
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,726
Ferret?

399
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,826
Plannin' on goin' somewhere?

400
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,496
Come on,
let's take a little walk.

401
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:26,914
Bastard!

402
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,291
My, have you gotten dirty.

403
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,793
My goodness.

404
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,003
- Willie, come here.
- Yeah.

405
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,214
I think this lady needs a bath.

406
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,715
Let's take her down to the dock.

407
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,425
Hey, where'd she come from?

408
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,261
Help!

409
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,433
Get the boat ready!

410
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,646
Now, move it!

411
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,189
We don't have all day
and I'm going to teach

412
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,816
this lady how to swim.

413
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,192
You know what
the first lesson is?

414
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,986
It's call the dead man's...

415
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,574
So you want to play rough?

416
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,458
<i>There she goes.</i>

417
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,129
Say hello
to your boyfriend, baby.

418
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,887
What the hell was that?

419
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,646
Willie, Tyrone,
shoot the damn thing!

420
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,038
Get it, kill it, and her!

421
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,332
You too!

422
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:36,836
Back in the swamps.

423
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,556
Willie, go that way.

424
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,975
Tyrone, cover that area.

425
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,050
So long, baby.

426
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,888
Willie?

427
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,519
Flank right.

428
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,596
What the hell
are you doing, Danny?

429
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,143
Spread out.

430
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,354
Use your head.

431
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,163
- Where's Danny?
- Where's Willie?

432
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,873
Maybe Willie's with Tyrone.

433
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,124
Danny shot Tyrone.

434
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,210
Oh, yeah.

435
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,673
Maybe we should,
maybe we should...

436
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:29,217
Get the hell outta here.

437
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,482
The work with DNA I expected.

438
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:48,277
But the combining
of plant and animal...

439
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,530
is astonishing.

440
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:53,950
Astonishing.

441
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,787
You should sleep, sir.

442
00:33:58,496 --> 00:33:59,580
I can't.

443
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:04,084
It was all so near, right there,
in the palm of my hand.

444
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,128
And...

445
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:09,924
But it's lovely not to sleep...

446
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:14,971
knowing that I'll soon make
the substance for myself.

447
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,764
Have some coffee, sir.

448
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,683
Thank you.

449
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,983
Holland had great talent.

450
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,030
But talent does only what it can.

451
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,411
Genius does what it must.

452
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,163
It is master of man.

453
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,541
The power absolute.

454
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,627
And in your hands, sir,
how magnificent.

455
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,171
<i>How beautiful.</i>

456
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,548
Yes.

457
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,052
The world will bow or starve.

458
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,636
Yes.

459
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,307
Yes.

460
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,821
Four, five... six.

461
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,199
How many notebooks were there?

462
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,533
Six, I think.

463
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:22,205
But six ends with notes
two weeks old.

464
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,332
It's unfinished.

465
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,168
There must be another.

466
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,921
A seventh notebook.

467
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,050
Ferret has just radioed, sir.

468
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,719
- Something's happened.
- What?

469
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,222
Something about a...

470
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,766
Well, you better speak
to him yourself, sir.

471
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,366
What?

472
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,117
You're not going to believe this.

473
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:01,701
Something incredible
came out of the swamps.

474
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,079
- Bruno.
- What came out of the swamps?

475
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,414
Some kinda animal or something.

476
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,249
Got the men.

477
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,002
We wouldn't even be here
if it hadn't got after the girl first.

478
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,212
Girl?

479
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,381
<i>You mean you let her get away?</i>

480
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,915
Here comes trouble.

481
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:51,878
Hi.

482
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,298
You in a plane crash?

483
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,259
Just been out walkin'.

484
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,305
You got a phone that works?

485
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,656
<i>Operations.</i>

486
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,241
This is 5-17.

487
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,993
Operation Mount Pisba.

488
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,704
Get me my next immediate superior,
please, and hurry.

489
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,122
<i>Hold on.</i>

490
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,790
<i>I'm putting you through to Ritter.</i>

491
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,168
I think he's been neutral...

492
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:41,092
Yes.

493
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,928
<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.</i>

494
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,804
<i>I have an emergency
call for you.</i>

495
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,349
Put the call through.

496
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,350
<i>Ritter, this is Cable.</i>

497
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,228
<i>We've had...
a catastrophe out here.</i>

498
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,354
What happened?

499
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:53,813
<i>There was a hit
on the compound.</i>

500
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,523
<i>Holland's dead, the lab's gone.</i>

501
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,234
<i>I thought they got you too.</i>

502
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,361
No, I was called away.

503
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,404
<i>Well, I think you were wrong
about Arcane.</i>

504
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,323
These <i>guys knew
what they were looking for.</i>

505
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,449
<i>And there's only one person...</i>

506
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,701
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later.

507
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:07,744
Where are you?

508
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:10,331
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

509
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,915
Right.

510
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,378
Did you manage
to save anything?

511
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,795
Damn right.

512
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,214
I got the last notebook.

513
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:19,965
Very good.

514
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,758
I'll be there
before you know it.

515
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,052
Turn around.

516
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,078
Doesn't anything work
around here?

517
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,205
Just me.

518
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,792
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.

519
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,086
You gotta punch it.

520
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:03,550
Thanks.

521
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,052
Nothin', name's Jude.

522
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,804
Cable.

523
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,819
Nice station.

524
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,904
Your dad own it?

525
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,908
Look like your ride's got here.

526
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,249
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

527
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,761
Don't be afraid, Jude.

528
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,362
You better say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

529
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,477
Is there a gun here?

530
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,978
What kind of place
you think this is?

531
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,189
Of course, there is.

532
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,739
Gun's a museum piece.

533
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,324
Stay here.

534
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:11,535
Took the words
right outta my mouth.

535
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,625
Hey, greaseball!

536
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:19,794
She's mine.

537
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,881
<i>She's got a gun.</i>

538
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,802
Some gun, it blew up
on the first shot.

539
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,388
<i>Let's go.</i>

540
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,069
Jam it! Jam it to the floor!

541
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:51,492
Wait a minute. There she is.

542
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,329
Go, go! Go get her, go on!

543
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:57,373
Go on!

544
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,213
Watch the tree!

545
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,090
Go, go!

546
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,300
<i>Come on,
she's gaining ground on ya!</i>

547
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,035
Hey, there she is.

548
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,875
Faster!

549
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,013
Got her in your sights.

550
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,223
It's back, stop the Jeep!

551
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,600
<i>Run her down.</i>

552
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,643
Don't stop!

553
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,025
Shoo!

554
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:53,614
Go!

555
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,599
It's okay, it's okay, it's just me.

556
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,560
Oh, Jude, what are
you doing here?

557
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,019
If you think I'm gonna stay
at the station

558
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,521
while they're pumping it
full of holes,

559
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:27,982
you're mistaken.

560
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,151
<i>What happened to that thing?</i>

561
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,779
It...

562
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,198
hit a tree.

563
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,826
Musta been one of those
hit and run kinda trees.

564
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,495
Don't seem to be there now.

565
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,334
Some tree, all right.

566
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,129
There's a trapper's cabin nearby.

567
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,673
<i>Maybe we can get you
a fresh change of clothes.</i>

568
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,426
Swamp's no place to be at night.

569
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,219
Come on.

570
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,109
The last patrol is in.

571
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,237
Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

572
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,238
Some of the men say
it's one of those

573
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,157
abdominal snowmen or something.

574
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,909
<i>I tell you, it was like hittin' a tree.</i>

575
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,746
<i>And bullets hurt it,
but they don't seem to stop it.</i>

576
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:25,913
<i>I say we forget this notebook.</i>

577
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,498
It's... it's not worth it.

578
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,168
What are we killin'
ourselves for?

579
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:32,378
Just to find the formula to some...

580
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,172
ordinary plant fertilizer?

581
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,215
Ordinary?

582
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:39,887
Something extraordinary came out
of the experiments already.

583
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,182
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of.

584
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:45,142
None!

585
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,530
Would you recognize immortality

586
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,450
if it knocked on your door,
gentlemen?

587
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,370
Obviously, you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

588
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,289
I want this swamp thing

589
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,166
and I want the notebook.

590
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,542
Now.

591
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:12,752
<i>Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.</i>

592
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,338
You will not get rid of him.

593
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,883
You will simply... get him.

594
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:26,850
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there...

595
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,436
in his veins.

596
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:33,607
But... how can we find it?

597
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,235
It... It's gone into the swamps.

598
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,322
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

599
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,366
That's right.

600
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,327
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

601
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,416
It doesn't exactly maintain
a low profile.

602
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:23,991
He was right.

603
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,951
It is beautiful.

604
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,828
Who was right?

605
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,997
A guy I knew.

606
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,124
He loved these swamps.

607
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,292
Can't you call him?

608
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,669
Maybe he can come and get you.

609
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,216
Ain't got nobody you can call?

610
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:42,885
Thought I had.

611
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,929
But when I did, those goons
showed up back there

612
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,850
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

613
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:52,269
Didn't pay your bookie
or somethin'?

614
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,229
Or somethin'.

615
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,023
Much farther?

616
00:46:58,567 --> 00:46:59,943
Little ways.

617
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,011
Stay here.

618
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:09,680
Don't worry.

619
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,975
If you hear anyone,
you give a yell.

620
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:14,935
Don't worry.

621
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:19,313
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

622
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,857
I can handle myself.

623
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:21,942
Don't worry.

624
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,485
I'm not worried.

625
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:26,613
Well, I am.

626
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,583
- What happened?
- Just go!

627
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:03,543
Go!

628
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,296
We're just gonna do our job

629
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,132
and get this notebook
back to Washington.

630
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:12,219
The rest isn't my business.

631
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:44,102
Local people say this place
is full of ghosts.

632
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,732
Well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through.

633
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,650
There she is.

634
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:56,782
Who's that?

635
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,079
Who's that?

636
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,915
That was that thing.
Let's go, come on!

637
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,384
What the heck's going on here?

638
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:22,265
Cut the engine.

639
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,982
- Units one and two.
- Roger.

640
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,068
Sector four on the double.

641
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:35,237
We got him cornered.

642
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:43,744
Where is he?

643
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,664
What is he?

644
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,089
I think I see him.

645
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,484
Unit 1 and 2,
where the hell are you?

646
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:15,819
Get over here on the double!

647
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,404
Split up. Go in the back way.

648
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:19,864
We'll come in straight.

649
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:21,116
Come here.

650
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,624
There he is, over there.

651
00:53:32,169 --> 00:53:33,420
Open up on him.

652
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,757
Hang on, I'm gonna knock
him outta there.

653
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:48,934
Jesus! Unit two,
use the grenades if you have to.

654
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,187
<i>Maybe we can stun him.</i>

655
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,913
Good hit, I think you got him.

656
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:11,290
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got.

657
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,751
Come on.

658
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:30,936
We got him now!

659
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,825
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

660
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,591
Do you see him?

661
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:04,177
Yeah, I see him everywhere.

662
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,180
Any sign of him over there?

663
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,432
<i>Nothing, we think maybe
he bought the farm,</i>

664
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,851
<i>or the vegetable patch.</i>

665
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,036
Who the hell is that?

666
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,310
Smart, that thing is smart.

667
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:57,313
Very smart, Bruno, very smart.

668
00:55:57,314 --> 00:56:00,441
This thing is
considerably intelligent.

669
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:03,068
He's like a brilliant chess player.

670
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:05,280
He anticipates every move.

671
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:10,492
A strong adversary is like
a beautiful, dangerous woman.

672
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,328
I've never been able
to resist either.

673
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:13,871
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

674
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:15,790
- We're going home.
- No, we're not.

675
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,461
Captured our knight...

676
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:22,964
exposed his queen.

677
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:27,302
Our move.

678
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,373
Awfully quiet now.

679
00:56:57,374 --> 00:56:58,624
<i>We better get outta here.</i>

680
00:56:58,625 --> 00:56:59,793
I've gotta go back and help.

681
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:06,423
You just take the notebook
and get yourself to safety.

682
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,009
<i>I'll come back for you later.</i>

683
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,011
Go on, do as I say.

684
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,492
Cable!

685
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,576
Jude, go and do what I told you.

686
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,121
It's not safe here anymore.

687
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:37,664
You hear?

688
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,041
Jude!

689
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,469
No!

690
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:54,282
Oh, shit.

691
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,242
There goes the neighborhood.

692
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:01,456
Wait a minute, you're the dude
that saved us back there, right?

693
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,626
You a friend of Cable?

694
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,921
Then I got somethin' for you.

695
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:10,924
She said I ought
to put it someplace safe.

696
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:28,274
- Where's Arcane?
- Below.

697
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,527
I'll tell him
I've captured his queen.

698
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:36,324
Walked right into our hands,
didn't you?

699
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,201
Real smart.

700
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,202
Thanks.

701
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,330
I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

702
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:45,250
What I couldn't do for you.

703
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,170
Tell you what...

704
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,297
Tell me where the notebook is

705
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,841
and I'll get you
out of the swamps.

706
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,010
Deal?

707
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:57,929
I don't mind the swamps.

708
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:00,973
It's the slime that crawls out
from under the rocks

709
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:02,307
that turns my stomach.

710
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,101
Oh, nasty mouth.

711
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:05,270
You're a pretty one.

712
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,400
What do you say to that?

713
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,860
Not much.

714
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,352
Cable!

715
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,396
Cable.

716
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,671
<i>Ferret!</i>

717
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,432
Ferret!

718
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:29,395
Ferret!

719
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:33,899
Maybe we should go
in and check.

720
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,275
No, we go home now.

721
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,070
- Sir, but...
- Home.

722
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:14,691
It's very kind.

723
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:23,741
Nice orchid.

724
01:02:25,702 --> 01:02:29,413
Family Orchidaceae.

725
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:31,791
Genus Orchis.

726
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,087
Over a hundred species here.

727
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:40,174
Much beauty in the swamp...

728
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,844
if you only look.

729
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:53,938
Alec?

730
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,201
Oh, I'm sorry.

731
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,704
It must...

732
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:11,831
hurt?

733
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,293
Does it?

734
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,841
Only when I laugh.

735
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,074
Have I gone crazy?

736
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,578
Isn't this a dream?

737
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:56,417
That's what I keep
asking myself.

738
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:02,465
Everything's a dream...

739
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,384
when you're alone.

740
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,892
Alec.

741
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:15,806
Now.

742
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:18,142
No!

743
01:06:35,952 --> 01:06:40,164
The man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

744
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:51,842
Alec.

745
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,927
Alec

746
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,096
Holland.

747
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:56,764
You knew, didn't you?

748
01:06:58,307 --> 01:06:59,725
You knew we'd be caught.

749
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,771
The only way out...

750
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,649
is through.

751
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:55,031
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

752
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:57,991
We have captured the dragon

753
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:01,203
and rescued
the damsel in distress.

754
01:08:02,038 --> 01:08:04,581
Of course, we regret the loss
of our friend, Ferret.

755
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:08,752
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

756
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,254
Nonetheless, we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

757
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,883
But to speak the truth,
which is essential,

758
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:17,260
regrets are trifles

759
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:20,680
when one considers
the grand design.

760
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:22,599
And we are here tonight
in celebration

761
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,685
of an event of profound
significance...

762
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:29,023
The duplication
of the Holland formula.

763
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:38,908
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

764
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:42,327
Dear, dear Bruno,

765
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:43,787
who won the notebook

766
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,623
from which we extracted
the final secret.

767
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:49,543
And topped it
by capturing the beast.

768
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:03,598
<i>So, I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success,</i>

769
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,267
to our conquest of the world.

770
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:08,603
To Bruno.

771
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,815
Bruno.

772
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:22,618
But sir...

773
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,954
have you tried it out
on a plant yet?

774
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:28,165
<i>I mean, when are we going
to see the results?</i>

775
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,542
Tonight.

776
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,877
<i>Tonight, dear Bruno,
immediately.</i>

777
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:34,630
<i>But not on a plant.</i>

778
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:36,423
Have you taken it?

779
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:38,551
No.

780
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:43,013
I have given the privilege of taking
the first dose of our formula

781
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:45,391
to our guest of honor.

782
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,310
<i>Who deserves
the privilege thoroughly.</i>

783
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:52,105
It is you, dear Bruno

784
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:56,152
who will tell us whether or not
the formula works.

785
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,870
Bruno, what's the matter
with you?

786
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:29,894
Calm.

787
01:10:57,755 --> 01:10:58,714
Calm.

788
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,726
You...

789
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:27,117
What have you done with Cable?

790
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,703
Holland.

791
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:31,956
Holland.

792
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:35,167
You're there.

793
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:38,254
Brain intact.

794
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:43,591
All your abilities, everything,
plus the power...

795
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:45,469
the physical strength.

796
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,473
Bring him in.

797
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,310
Some friend you are.

798
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,437
Sorry, Bruno,
it's every man for himself,

799
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:58,357
and God against all.

800
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,036
Why doesn't Bruno have
your strength?

801
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,374
We followed
the notebooks religiously.

802
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,960
There can be
no margin for error.

803
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:23,131
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

804
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:26,217
Because he never had it.

805
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,345
No riddles, please.

806
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,181
You will tell me...

807
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:33,684
or you'll Pay-

808
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:37,104
And for a very dear agent.

809
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:40,357
Bring her in.

810
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:49,115
The explanation or her.

811
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:50,409
Alec, don't!

812
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:56,789
Which?

813
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,168
You don't understand.

814
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,545
There's nothing hidden.

815
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:03,797
<i>No secrets.</i>

816
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,801
<i>The formula works
in so simple a way.</i>

817
01:13:08,844 --> 01:13:13,432
What Bruno took
was what changed me.

818
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:19,145
It only amplifies your essence.

819
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,648
It simply makes you more

820
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,027
of what you already are.

821
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:30,991
Bruno's essence was stupidity...
timidity.

822
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,287
The formula simply extended,

823
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:40,459
amplified this to ridiculous forms
and proportions.

824
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,213
He shrank.

825
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,591
<i>He shrank to what
he actually was.</i>

826
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:53,972
But if the essence is,
let us say, genius,

827
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,852
then this genius shall be
monumental in body,

828
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,062
as well as in spirit.

829
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,144
Is that what you're saying?

830
01:14:36,682 --> 01:14:37,933
Cable.

831
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:39,977
Alec.

832
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,460
Not to be the phenomenon,

833
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,630
but the thing in itself.

834
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:33,840
Eternal.

835
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:38,512
Absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power...

836
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:43,183
physical and spiritual.

837
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:48,605
To <i>be the world and own</i> it.

838
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,649
Yes?

839
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:52,818
Darling,

840
01:16:53,986 --> 01:16:57,573
tell Karen to bring me
a glass of brandy?

841
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,271
Reach for it.

842
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:33,483
You thrive on the light,
reach for it.

843
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:44,161
Alec.

844
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:03,764
Come. Come.

845
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:13,939
What's the matter with you?

846
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,066
Go.

847
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,151
Go, leave me!

848
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:34,938
Your arm.

849
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:53,517
Listen.

850
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,561
He's taken the formula.

851
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:13,453
Please, there is a way.

852
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:16,288
I can't reach it.

853
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:18,750
But you twist it to the right
and then to the left.

854
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:24,339
<i>Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.</i>

855
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:30,636
Come on, follow me.

856
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:31,888
Come on, follow me!

857
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:51,156
You'll have to trust me here

858
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,658
if you want to survive.

859
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:53,869
If you don't...

860
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,452
Tell us!

861
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,288
This is the well of the estate

862
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:59,874
fed by a... a spring from the bottom
of the great swamp.

863
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,716
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

864
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:04,629
Go!

865
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,215
Watch your step.

866
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:11,636
Have a nice trip?

867
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,640
See you in the fall.

868
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,776
Alec.

869
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,477
Alec!

870
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:27,916
Behind you.

871
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,256
I don't understand.

872
01:26:59,716 --> 01:27:00,842
It's healed.

873
01:27:09,893 --> 01:27:11,019
What is it?

874
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:16,107
It's over.

875
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:22,572
Alec, let me go with you.

876
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:25,158
You can start your work again.

877
01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:33,917
With these?

878
01:27:36,044 --> 01:27:37,420
I'll be your hands.

879
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,424
Please?

880
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,052
You need to heal.

881
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:46,930
You need to tell our story.

882
01:27:48,056 --> 01:27:49,891
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

883
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,022
Until then...

884
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:00,235
I'll always be with you.

885
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:12,330
Alec.

886
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,461
Cable.

887
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:22,799
Jude.

888
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:29,555
You Okay?

889
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:38,189
<i>He told me to come get you.</i>

890
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:41,734
He'll be back, though.

891
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,695
Right?

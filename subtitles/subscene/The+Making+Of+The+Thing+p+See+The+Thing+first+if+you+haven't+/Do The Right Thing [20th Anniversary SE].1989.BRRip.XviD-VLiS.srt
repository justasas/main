00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

362
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,000
and nobody don't bother
the Mayor but you?

363
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,000
The Mayor just tend
to his own business?

364
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
I love everybody?

365
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,900
I even love you?

366
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,500
Hold your tongue?

367
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,100
You don't have that much love?

368
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,300
One day you gonna be nice to me?

369
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,300
We may both be dead and buried,

370
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
but you gonna be nice?

371
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,900
At least civil?

372
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,800
I told you, I'm not going
to baby-sit for you,

373
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,100
and that's it!

374
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,600
What are you
talking about?

375
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,600
Yesterday you said you would?

376
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Now today
you're changing your mind?

377
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,600
No, I'm not changing...

378
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,600
¿Ay, Mommy,
que muchojota?

379
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
Get off of me, please!

380
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,000
I do everything for you?

381
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,900
You can't do shit for me!

382
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,700
Yo tengo
el derecho de salirte.

383
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,100
Right, right?
You know it's not like that, Mommy?

384
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
I can do everything for you,

385
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,700
but you won't do shit for me?

386
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Stop it!

387
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
That lady makes me sick!

388
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,000
Your father makes me sick, too?

389
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Everybody makes me sick?

390
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,400
Shit?

391
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Your father ain't no real father?

392
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
He's a bum?

393
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,500
Chump change, to-the-curb,

394
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,100
pulling no major pub, bum!

395
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,900
Mike?

396
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,500
Fuck Mike Tyson!

397
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,900
I remember when he mugged
that woman on Lexington?

398
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I remember that shit?

399
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,100
You're going to tell him?

400
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll tell him?
Fuck Mike Tyson!

401
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,000
To his face?

402
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
You goddamn right!

403
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,700
He'll knock
your goddamn ass off?

404
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
You talk shit now?

405
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,600
I'll drop him like a bad habit?

406
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,600
If Tyson dream about whippin my ass,

407
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,400
he better wake up and apologize?

408
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,400
Well, gentlemen, the way I see it,

409
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
if this hot weather continues,

410
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,400
it's going to melt the polar caps

411
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,400
and the whole wide world?

412
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
And all those parts
that ain't water already

413
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,500
will surely be flooded?

414
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
You dumb ass, simple motherfucker!

415
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
Where you read that shit, eh?

416
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,500
The polar caps?

417
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
Don't worry about it?

418
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,900
When it happens,
and I'm in my boat

419
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,500
and you black asses are drowning,

420
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,500
don't call for me
to throw you no rope,

421
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,400
no lifesaver, or no nothing?

422
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,800
You 30 cent away from a quarter?

423
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,500
How the fuck
you gonna get a boat?

424
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Here, boy?

425
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,100
Don't worry about it?

426
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
Goddamn right?
Look at you?

427
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,100
You're raggedy as a roach,

428
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,600
eat the holes out of doughnuts?

429
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,100
Raggedy motherfucker!
Don't worry about it?

430
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,700
I'm in good shape?

431
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,100
I will be?

432
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,100
I'll be back on my feet
soon enough?

433
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,600
Look, raggedy-ass shoes!

434
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,000
So run over, you gotta
lay down to put 'em on?

435
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
So, ML, ML, ML, tell me?

436
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,900
When is all this goddamn ice
supposed to melt?

437
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,800
[Vito]
Hello? Sal's Pizza?

438
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,800
Yep?

439
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
Meatball hero,
eggplant parmesan?

440
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,900
You got it?

441
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, we deliver?
Of course, we deliver?

442
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
All right? Where is that?

443
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,000
You going to pay now
or on layaway?

444
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
How much?

445
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,100
You been coming here
three times a day?

446
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,500
What are you, a retard?

447
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
It's $1? 50?

448
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Put some cheese
on that motherfucker?

449
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Extra cheese is $2? 00?

450
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,400
$2? 00?

451
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Yeah, $2? 00?

452
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,100
Hey, forget that shit?

453
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,300
Damn, Sal, you're cheap, man?

454
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,100
Yo, Mook!

455
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,700
Mookie! How come
ain't no brothers

456
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,000
up on the wall?

457
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,900
Man, ask Sal, all right?

458
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,800
Hey, Sal, how come
ain't no brothers there?

459
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,400
You want brothers on the wall?

460
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,800
Get your own place?

461
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,400
You can put your brothers and uncles,
nieces and nephews,

462
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,800
your stepfather, stepmother,
whoever you want?

463
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,800
But this is my pizzeria?

464
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,400
American-Italians
on the wall only?

465
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,600
Take it easy, Pop?

466
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,100
And you, hey, don't start
with me today?

467
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,400
What?

468
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,

469
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
but you own this?

470
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,900
Rarely do I see

471
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,900
any American-Italians eating in here?

472
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,500
All I see is black folks?

473
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,500
Since we spend much money here,

474
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
we do have some say?

475
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,300
You lookin for trouble?

476
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Are you a troublemaker,
is that what you are?

477
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker?

478
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm making trouble?

479
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,000
You're a ball-breaker?

480
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,000
You're always coming in here

481
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,000
looking for trouble, aren't you?

482
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Suppose I busted your head?
How would you??

483
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Mookie, you want to get
your friend out of here?

484
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,100
What, you gonna
kick me out now?

485
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,600
I'm not?
You're kicking yourself out?

486
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,600
We want some brothers
up on the wall...

487
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
You know, Malcolm X,
Nelson Mandela,

488
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Michael Jordan!
Tomorrow!

489
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,700
Mookie, get him out?

490
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm trying! Take your slice?

491
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,800
I know you paid for it?

492
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,800
All right, you're kicking me out?

493
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Beat me on the head
and kick me out?

494
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,400
I paid for my...

495
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,100
Look, boycott Sal's!
Boycott Sal's?

496
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
I got your boycott swinging?

497
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,900
Boycott Sal's?

498
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
Yo, what you laughin at?

499
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
Mookie, I paid for my slice?

500
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
I spend much money in there!

501
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,600
What are you trying to do?

502
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,600
I want brothers on the wall?

503
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,500
You're fucking my shit up?

504
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,900
It's between me and Sal?

505
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,000
You're fucking me up?

506
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,600
I ain't trying to fuck you up?
I'm sorry?

507
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,900
You're sorry?

508
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,000
In a week, it'll be squashed?

509
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
A week?

510
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,400
A week?

511
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,400
Yeah? Yeah?

512
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,400
All right?

513
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,400
Bet?

514
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Bet?

515
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,400
Mook??

516
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Stay black!

517
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,500
This guy's your friend, right?

518
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,100
If I'm wrong, tell me?

519
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
He's my friend?

520
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,900
If he don't behave,

521
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,700
I don't want him here anymore?

522
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,500
I can't do nothing?

523
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Talk brother talk to him?

524
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,800
Brother talk?

525
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,900
People are free to do
whatever the hell they want?

526
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,800
Free? What the hell
are you talking about?

527
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,800
Free? There's no free here?

528
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm the boss?

529
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,400
No freedom?
I'm the boss?

530
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
You want freedom?
There, that's free?

531
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
Take that order out?
He's got an order?

532
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Let's go? Come on!
Get to work!

533
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,800
You're standing here doing nothing?

534
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,800
You're afraid of the goddamn oven?

535
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,100
Hit the oven!

536
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,500
Is this the address?

537
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,900
Is that the address?

538
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Is that what he just asked me?

539
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,900
Mookie?

540
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Come here, doctor?

541
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Mayor, I got to go?

00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,500
OK, but listen up?

905
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm going to break it down?

906
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,900
Let it be broke?

907
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,300
Can you dig it?

908
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,600
It's dug?

909
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,500
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street?

910
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,600
Bet they haven't been
off the boat a year

911
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,100
before they opened
their own place?

912
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,600
Right? It's been about a year?

913
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
A motherfuckin year
off the motherfuckin boat,

914
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,100
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?

915
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,700
A good business,

916
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,100
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

917
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,500
for longer than
I care to remember,

918
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,400
and I've been here a long time?

919
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,900
Yeah, a long time?

920
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,800
Hear, boy?

921
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,100
Now, for the life of me??

922
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,900
You know, I can't
figure this out?

923
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,700
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses??

924
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,700
Or you black asses
are just plain dumb?

925
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,500
Fuck you?

926
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,500
It's got to be
because we're black?

927
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,900
Ain't no other explanation?

928
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,500
You know it's true?

929
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,600
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

930
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,100
Oh, oh! You motherfuckers
hold that shit down?

931
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,900
I'm tired of that
old excuse, that shit?

932
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,500
I swear, man,

933
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,600
I will be one happy fool

934
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,000
when we open
our own business

935
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,900
right here in our neighborhood?

936
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,600
I swear to God,

937
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,100
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?

938
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,100
You motherfuckers
are always talking

939
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,100
that old Keith Sweat shit...

940
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,600
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"

941
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
You ain't gonna do nothing?

942
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,700
You're gonna sit on this corner?

943
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,100
When you going
to get your business?

944
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,700
Just like I thought?

945
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,100
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing?

946
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,700
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

947
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,100
more of my money?

948
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,700
Out of my way?

949
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
It's Miller time, motherfuckers?

950
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,600
Old Moosehead fuckers
telling me what to do?

951
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,100
Coconut, you got nerve?

952
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,600
You got off the boat, too?
Leave me alone?

953
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Kung Fu, give me
one of them damn beers?

954
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,100
No more free beer?

955
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
No more free beer?

956
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
Don't push me, baby?

957
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,600
No more free beer?

958
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,100
Don't start no shit?

959
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,500
Mr? Sweet Dick Willie?

960
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,900
Right? That's my name?

961
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,900
It's a motherfuckin shame?

962
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,500
Man, ain't that a bitch?

963
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,100
Here, Doctor?
What's your name?

964
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,100
Eddie?

965
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,500
How old are you?

966
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,500
10?

967
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,800
What makes Sammy run?

968
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,100
My name is Eddie?

969
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,500
What makes Sammy run?

970
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,300
My name is Eddie Lovell?

971
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,100
Relax? I want you
to go to the store for me?

972
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,500
What'll it cost?

973
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,800
How would I know?

974
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,100
What am I buying?

975
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,700
Eddie, you're too smart
for your own britches?

976
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
How much do you want

977
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,100
to go to the store
for the man?

978
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,000
50 cents?

979
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,700
You got a deal?

980
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,000
I want you to get me
a quart of beer?

981
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Miller High Life?

982
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,100
Say it's for your bedridden,
old granddad?

983
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,700
Now, go? Go?

984
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,900
What is wrong with him?

985
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,700
He ain't got no money for nobody?

986
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,700
Look at this here, man?

987
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,100
Cut this shit out?

988
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,500
What makes you the Mayor
of this block?

989
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,800
Shit, he's self-appointed?

990
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,100
Leave the man alone?

991
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,100
Shut up!

992
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,600
Look, you all leave me
the hell alone?

993
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,100
I ain't going out
like that, man?

994
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,100
You walk around this block
like you own it?

995
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,100
For real?

996
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,300
You're so old,
you're like a fossil?

997
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,100
You're a bum?
You're an old drunk zero?

998
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,700
Now what do you got to say?

999
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,700
What you know about me?

1000
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,100
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you?

1001
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
What you know about anything?

1002
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,300
Unless you...

1003
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,400
Unless you done stood
in the door??

1004
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,300
And listened to your
five hungry children

1005
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,700
crying for bread,

1006
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,700
and you can't do
anything about it?

1007
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,000
Your woman standing there...

1008
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,600
You can't even look
her in the eye?

1009
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,900
Unless you done that,

1010
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,900
you don't know my pain,
my hurt, my feelings?

1011
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,300
You don't know shit!

1012
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,700
Don't call me bum?

1013
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,600
Don't call me a drunk?

1014
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,100
You don't got the sense
God give a billy goat!

1015
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,500
Don't call me nothing!

1016
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,500
It's disrespectful?

1017
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,000
Your mamas and papas
raised you better?

1018
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,800
I hope you finished
your little soliloquy

1019
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,600
'cause I been peeing straight
for years?

1020
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,900
Understand what I'm saying?

1021
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
And you're right?

1022
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,700
I wouldn't stand around

1023
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,700
listening to my children
go hungry?

1024
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
I'd be getting a job,

1025
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,900
anything to feed them?

1026
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,900
You're right?
I don't want to know your pain?

1027
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,300
I don't care?

1028
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,100
You did this to yourself?

1029
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,900
Every day I see you walk

1030
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,300
up and down this block, inebriated?

1031
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,300
Never sober, but that's
what D-A stands for...

1032
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,800
Da Mayor... drunk ass?

1033
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Come on!

1034
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,900
This mars getting me mad!

1035
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,800
He don't get no respect!

1036
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,000
You'll never get
respect here, boy!

1037
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,500
I respect those
who respect themselves!

1038
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,500
Ahmad!

1039
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,900
Come on, man!

1040
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:14,900
Tina, I know it's been four days?

1041
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm a working man?

1042
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,100
I work, too,
and I seem to make time?

1043
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,600
What do you want me
to do, huh?

1044
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,000
Spend some time
with me and Hector!

1045
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
I want you to try and make
this relationship work?

1046
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,100
If not, I'd rather not
be bothered with your ass?

1047
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,900
Mookie, you're too, too tired?

1048
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,300
OK, all right, damn?

1049
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,100
I'll be over sometime today?

1050
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,500
You always say later!

1051
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
Later when I get off work?

1052
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,500
Bring some ice cream?
I'm burning up?

1053
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
Mookie, do you love me?

1054
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,700
Do I love you?

1055
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,300
Mookie, get off the phone!

1056
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,400
Be off in a second,
all right, Sal?

1057
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,800
Do I love you?

1058
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,100
I dedicated a record

1059
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,500
on Love Daddy's show to you?

1060
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,500
So what?

1061
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,500
How's anybody going
to call in, Mookie?

1062
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,500
All right!

1063
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,500
One time?
You probably wasted??

1064
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,900
If that ain't love, you're crazy?

1065
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,900
Are you deaf or what?

1066
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,500
Pino, I'm talking on the phone?

1067
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,500
I think I see that?

1068
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,500
Tina, I got to go?

1069
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,300
Yeah, Pino's an asshole?

1070
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,300
See you later today?

1071
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,300
Later!

1072
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,300
Everybody happy?

1073
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,000
[Ring]

1074
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,100
Sal's Famous?

1075
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah? Yeah, hold it?

1076
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,000
OK, two large anchovy
and pepperoni?

1077
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,300
OK? Just hold on one second?

1078
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,800
See, Daddy? Mookie's
fucking talking on the phone,

1079
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,100
people are trying
to call in orders?

1080
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,800
He's making us lose business?

1081
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Mookie!

1082
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
20 minutes?

1083
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
How come niggers
are so stupid?

1084
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,500
If you see a nigger,
kick his ass?

1085
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,500
Fuck you?
Stay off the phone?

1086
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,700
Hey, Mookie?
Forget about it?

1087
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,700
Can I talk to you for a second?

1088
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,700
What?

1089
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,700
Magic Johnson?

1090
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,600
Who's your favorite movie star?

1091
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,600
Eddie Murphy?

1092
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Who's your favorite rock star?

1093
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Prince?

1094
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,500
You're a Prince freak?

1095
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,500
Boss? Bruce?

1096
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,800
Prince?

1097
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,900
All you talk about is
nigger this and nigger that?

1098
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,700
Your favorite people are niggers?

1099
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,800
It's different?
Magic, Eddie, Prince??

1100
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,300
Are not niggers?

1101
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,300
I mean, they're not black,

1102
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,300
I mean...
Let me explain myself?

1103
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,000
They're...
They're not really black?

1104
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,600
I mean, they're black,
but not really?

1105
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,800
They're more than black?
It's different?

1106
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,800
It's different?

1107
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,700
Yeah? To me,
it's different?

1108
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Deep down you wish
you were black?

1109
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,600
Get the fuck out of here?

1110
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,900
Go ahead, laugh?

1111
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,800
Your hair's kinkier than mine?

1112
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,300
What does that mean?

1113
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,700
And you know what they say
about dark Italians?

1114
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,300
You know, I been listening??
And reading...

1115
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,700
You been reading now?

1116
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,700
I read?

1117
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
I've been reading
about your leaders?

1118
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,800
Reverend Al
"Mister 'Do" Sharpton?

1119
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,300
Jesse "Keep hope alive"??

1120
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,700
That's fucked up?

1121
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,700
"Keep hope alive?"

1122
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,600
That's fucked?
Don't talk about Jesse?

1123
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,000
And even the other guy,
what's his name?

1124
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,600
Faraman, Fairakan...

1125
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,700
Minister Farakhan?

1126
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,700
Right? Sorry?

1127
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,000
Minister Farakhan?

1128
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Anyway, Minister Farakhan
always talks about the so-called day??

1129
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,600
When the black man will rise?

1130
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,100
What does he say?

1131
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,600
"We will one day rule the earth

1132
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,300
as we did in our glorious past"?

1133
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,300
That's right?

1134
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,100
What past?
What did I miss?

1135
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,800
We started civilization?

1136
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,100
Man, keep dreaming, man?

1137
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,700
Then you woke up!

1138
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,400
Pino, fuck you?

1139
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,700
Fuck your fucking pizza,

Take your fucking pizza piece

1154
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,900
and go the fuck back to Africa?

1155
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,400

I got good price for you,

1166
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,700
Mayor Kochie,

Ya need to cool

And that's the double truth, Ruth!

1174
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,500
Sal, can you do me a favor?

1175
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,900
That depends, Mookie?

1176
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,900
Can you pay me now?

1177
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,500
I can't do that?

1178
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,900
Sal, just this once?

1179
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,000
Can't you do me a solid, man?

1180
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,300
Not till tonight when we close?

1181
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,300
Sal, I want to get paid now?

1182
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,300
You know you get paid
tonight when we close?

1183
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,800
We're still open, OK?

1184
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,800
If l pay you now,
you won't show tonight?

1185
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,100
That's a bet?

1186
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,500
Yeah, that's a bet?

1187
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,900
I'm going to remember that?

1188
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,900
You got to do
what you got to do?

1189
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,500
I'll remember that?

1190
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,800
I want you to?

1191
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,300
Please do me a favor, hey, Mook?
Remember that?

1192
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,400
Come on, Sal?

1193
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,100
I can't?

1194
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,100
Radio Raheem!

1195
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,600
Mook?

1196
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,800
What's happening?

1197
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,300
It's your world?

1198
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,800
Where you headed to?

1199
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,800
I'm going to get a slice?

1200
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,300
You going to Sal's?

1201
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,300
I'll check you back there?

1202
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,700
On the rebound?

1203
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,700
You bet?

1204
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,100
All right?

1205
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,700
Oh, shit!

1206
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,700
Let me check it out?

1207
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,100

00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,300
Let me tell you the story
of right hand/left hand?

1210
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,800
It's a tale of good and evil?

1211
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Hate?

1212
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,900
It was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother?

1213
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,700
Love?

1214
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,700
These five fingers,

1215
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,700
they go straight
to the soul of man?

1216
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,300
The right hand...

1217
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,300
the hand of love?

1218
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,500
The story of life is this??

1219
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,700
Static?

1220
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,800
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

1221
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,700
and the left hand
is kicking much ass?

1222
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,300
I mean, it looks like the right hand...
love... is finished?

1223
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,300
But hold on?
Stop the presses?

1224
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,300
The right hand's coming back?

1225
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,800
He got the left hand
on the ropes now?

1226
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,300
That's right?
Yeah? Ooh!

1227
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,300
It's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt?

1228
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,800
Down! Ooh! Ooh!

1229
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,500
Left hand, hate,
K? O? 'd by love?

1230
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,900
If I love you, I love you?

1231
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,100
But if I hate you??

1232
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,100
There it is...
love and hate?

1233
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,700
I love you, brother?

1234
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,900
Bet?

1235
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,100

00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,600
Mookie, how come
you're not at Sal's?

1288
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm working?

1289
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,600
What's this... Another of your
patented two-hour lunch breaks?

1290
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,700
I wanted to come home
and take a quick shower?

1291
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,000
Sal's going to be mad?

1292
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,000
Sometimes I think you're more
concerned about him than me,

1293
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,600
and I'm your brother?

1294
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,100
That's real smart?
Sal pays you?

1295
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,000
That's why you should work?

1296
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,600
I work?
Slavery's over?

1297
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,600
My name ain't Kunta Kinte?

1298
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,000
I just don't want you
to lose the one job

1299
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,000
you've kept over a month?

1300
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,500
I'm carrying you as it is?

1301
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,000
I'll always get paid?

1302
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah? You always get paid?

1303
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,500
What about
your responsibilities?

1304
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,600
Why don't you
take better care of those?

1305
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,700
What responsibilities?

1306
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,100
What are you, deaf?

1307
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,700
You know what
I'm talking about?

1308
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,700
Take care of your responsibilities,
all right?

1309
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,700
Who you yelling at, anyway?

1310
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,100
I'm yelling at you?

1311
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
I'm going to take care
of this shower?

1312
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,700
I'm your big brother?
Don't be yelling at me?

1313
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,100
You're a bum?

1314
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,500
Don't call me no bum?

1315
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,500
Whew!

1316
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,900
If I want to shower
in the middle of the day,

1317
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,400
it's OK?
Fuck Sal?

1318

1370
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,700
Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking?

1371
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,500
Maybe we should sell this place?

1372
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,900
Get out while we're still ahead??

1373
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,700
And alive?

1374
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,900
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?

1375
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,500
I mean, couldn't we sell this

1376
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,500
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1377
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,900
There's too many pizzerias
already there?

1378
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,500
Maybe we could try
something different?

1379
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,500
What am I going to do?

1380
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,900
That's all I know?

1381
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,700
I been here 25 years?
Where am I going?

1382
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,900
I'm sick of niggers?

1383
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,500
It's like I come to work??

1384
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,900
It's "Planet of the Apes?"

1385
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,500
I don't like being around them?

1386
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,700
They're animals?

1387
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,300
Why you got so much anger in you?

1388
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,200
Why? I'll tell you why?

1389
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,700
My friends...
They laugh at me?

1390
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,300
They laugh right in my face?

1391
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,700
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy?

1392
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,500
Go feed the moulies?"

1393
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,600
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1394
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,200
Food on your table?

1395
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,700
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head?

1396
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,900
Huh?

1397
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,300
They're not your friends?

1398
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,300
If they were your friends,

1399
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,400
they wouldn't laugh at you?

1400
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,400
Pop, what can I say?

1401
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,800
I don't want to be here?

1402
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,800
They don't want us here?

1403
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,800
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

1404
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,900
in Bensonurst,

1405
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,500
and niggers in theirs?

1406
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,700
I never had no trouble
with these people?

1407
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,900
I sat in this window??

1408
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,900
All I see is
little kids get old?

1409
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,900
And I seen
the old people get older?

1410
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,900
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,

1411
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,300
but most of them do?

1412
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,900
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food?

1413
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,500
On my food?

1414
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,500
I'm very proud of that?

1415
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,500
You may think it's funny,

1416
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,300
but I'm very proud of that?

1417
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,300
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh??

1418
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,700
Sal's Famous Pizzeria
is here to stay?

1419
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,700
I'm sorry?

1420
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,700

1421
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,300
I'm sorry, but??

1422
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,900
But that's the way it is?

1423
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,800
Hey, S-S-Sal?

1424
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,500

If you're saying

1792
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,600
what I'm thinking
you're saying,

1793
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,700
you better not say it?

1794
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,200
You hear this?

1795
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,200
Do me a favor?
Leave Jade alone?

1796
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,700
You know, Mookie,
not for nothin,

1797
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,700
but if you were
just a little taller,

1798
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,700
I'd kick your ass
for what you're thinking?

1799
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,600
As a matter of fact,

1800
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,500
I should kick your ass
on principle alone?

1801
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,700
Here?
You got a delivery?

1802
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,200
This the right address?

1803
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,600
What is this??

1804
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,600
Yeah? It's the right address?

1805
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,200
That's the right address?

1806
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,600
I wrote it myself?

1807
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,200
Sometimes you make mistakes,

1808
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,900
and I deliver fucking pizzas

1809
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,700
to the wrong fucking address?

1810
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,300
I don't make mistakes?

1811
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,800
You don't make mistakes?

1812
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,300
Hurry back, OK?

1813
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,800
Don't get lost?
We're still open?

1814
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,700
Make a pizza, huh?

1815
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Mr? Mayor?

1816
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,500
I saw what you did?

1817
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,500
That was foolish but brave?

1818
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,900
That child owes you his life?

1819
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,500
Wasn't trying to be a hero?

1820
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,800
I just seen what was happening,

1821
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,200
and I reacted... didn't even think?

1822
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,200
Probably wouldn't have done it

1823
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,600
if l had thought?

1824
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,100
Da Mayor's getting old?

1825
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,600
Ain't run like that in years?

1826
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,100
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?

1827
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,600
Scored the winning run?

1828
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,100
Two outs?
Bottom of the ninth?

1829
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,600
August 1, 1939?
Snow Hill, Alabama?

1830
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,200
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher?

1831
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,600
He hated my guts?

1832
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,900
He come down off that mound,

1833
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,500
and I took off

1834
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,200
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?

1835
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,300
Maybe I, uh??

1836
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,900
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?

1837
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,400
Maybe you shouldn't?

1838
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,800
Don't get happy?

1839
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,600
This changes nothing
between you and me?

1840
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,500
You did a good thing?

1841
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,500
Mother Sister just thanks you?

1842
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,300
I want to thank you?

1843
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
You're welcome?

1844
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,300
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1845
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,300
Is it hot?

1846
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,900
I've never delivered a cold pizza?

1847
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,900
Come here?

1848
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,300
You think you're slick, Tina?

1849
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,900
How else could
I get you up here?

1850
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,500
I haven't seen you all week?

1851
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:33,900
I'm working?
Making money?

1852
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,500
You forgot the ice cream again?

1853
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,700
I forgot?

1854
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,300
Your memory's getting ridiculous?

1855
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,700
I got things on my mind?

1856
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,300
I really wanted some ice cream?

1857
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,700
I'll run out and get some?

1858
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,700
No, no? That's out?
You won't come back?

1859
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,700
I can't be staying long?

1860
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:52,800
How long?

1861
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,400
Long enough to do the nasty?

1862
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,400
Come on, Mookie?
That's out?

1863
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,700
First of all, it's too hot?

1864
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,500
If you think
I'll let you get some,

1865
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,800
put your clothes on and leave,

1866
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,100
and I won't see you again,

1867
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,200
you're bugging?

1868
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,700
I'll see you tomorrow?

1869
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,700
Yeah, right?

1870
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,400
So no nasty, huh?

1871
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,700
No?

1872
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,900
Something else?

1873
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,900
What?

1874
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Trust me?

1875
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,400
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son?

1876
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,400
Remember him?

1877
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,800
His name's Hector?

1878
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,300
You saying I'm a bad father?

1879
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,500
On the strength?

1880
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,400
Let me talk to you?

1881
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,500
What? What?

1882
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,900
Over here?

1883
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,300
Tina, take your clothes off?

1884
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,700
I already told you

1885
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,700
it's too fucking hot
to make love?

1886
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,200
It's too fucking hot?

1887
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,300
Why are you always cursing?

1888
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,700
I don't fucking curse that much?

1889
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,700
What the hell you mean?

1890
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,700
All you do is curse?

1891
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,700
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight?

1892
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,300
All right?
That's it?

1893
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,400
No rawness?

1894
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,800
No? No rawness?

1895
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,800
Why's it always like that

1896
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,400
when you come over?

1897
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,300
It's not always like that?

1898
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,800
It's always...
What are you doing?

1899
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,300
I'm not cursing?

1900
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,900
Mookie? Come on?

1901
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,400
I mean it?
I'm not playing?

1902
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,900
I'm not playing?

1903
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,700
Don't be so anxious?

1904
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,700
That's right?
Take it off?

1905
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,400
You're sweating?

1906
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,800
Of course I'm sweating?

1907
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,400
It's only 100 degrees in here?

1908
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,800
Look, freeze?
Don't move?

1909
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,400
I'll be right back?

1910
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,400
What do you mean
you'll be right back?

1911
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,800
Where are you going?

1912
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,400
I'll be right back?

1913
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,200
Why you got me
standing on the bed?

1914
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,700
Where you going?

1915
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,300
How's my son, Hector?

1916
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,300
Honey, do you hear that?

1917
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,300
He wants to know
how you are doing?

1918
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,200
And he has the straight face
of asking about it?

1919
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,600
Sinverguenza.

1920
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,300
Good for nothing?

1921
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,700
Callejero.

1922
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,700
Que se la pasa por la calle... -

1923
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,200
English! English!

1924
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,700
I want my son speaking English?

1925
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,700
Get out of my kitchen?

1926
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,500
Bad enough his name's Hector?

1927
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,500
Get out of my kitchen?

1928
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,900
I don't want to hear anything?

1929
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,500
Out, I said?

1930
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,600
Yes, children?

1931
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,900
This is the cool-out corner?

1932
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,600
We're slowing it down

1933
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:42,100
for all the lovers in the house?

1934
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,600
I'll be giving you
all the help you need?

1935
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,800
Musically, that is?

1936
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,400
This shit is cold?

1937
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,200
Supposed to be cold?
It's an ice cube?

1938
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,600
Later for your shit?

1939
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,300
Mira.

1940
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,600
Mira.

1941
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,700
What?

1942
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,700
You don't got a forehead?

1943
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,700
You got a eight-head?

1944
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,700
Mookie, you're full of shit?

1945
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,600
You got one of them
Sade foreheads?

1946
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,700
Fuck you?

1947
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,800
Goddamn?
Big-ass forehead?

1948
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,700
I need an iceberg??

1949
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,700
Rather than this ice cube?

1950
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,500
Thank God for lips?

1951
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,900
Thank God for the neck?

1952
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,500
Thank God for kneecaps?

1953
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,900
Thank God for elbows?

1954
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Thank God for thighs?

1955
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,700
Thank God
for the right nipple?

1956
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,700
Thank God
for the left nipple?

1957
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,700
Feels good?

1958
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,700
Ah? You likes?
You likes?

1959
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,500
You likes?

1960
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,900
Amen?

1961
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,100
I got to be going?

1962
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,600
You better come back?

1963
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,100
I'll be back tonight?

1964
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,100
You better,
'cause I'll kick your ass?

1965
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,200
Oops? I got to be back then?

1966
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,900
All right?

1967
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,500
All right?

1968
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:13,700
All right?

1969
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,300
Get out of here?

1970
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,800
I got to go?

1971
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,100
Bye?

1972

I'm not leaving yet?

1973

Get out of here?

1974
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,200
All right? Later?

1975

Later?

1976
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,300
Just out of curiosity,

1978
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,300
You mean tonight?

I mean the neighborhood?

1980
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,900
I figure about 50 years?

1981
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,400
'Cause I'm going into real estate?

1982
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,700
I'll put up a high-rise
in the neighborhood?

1983
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,600
Yeah? Lot of people
want to move here?

1984
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,600
Why not?

1985
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,900
You want a condominium?

1986
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,500
A couple of straws, Mr? Trump?

1987
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,600
Trump's Pizza?

1988
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,100
I heard of that?

1989
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,700
That's Trump's Plaza?

01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,500
Get out of here?

1991
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,100
Take care, Salvatore?

1992
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,100
Pino, take the soft drinks

1993
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,400
and load up here?

1994
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,500
OK, Pop?

1995
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,900
You want me to deliver faster,

1996
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,700
I need a rocket?? Something?

1997
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,300
I can't be running?

1998
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,300
The cheese lands on one side?

1999
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,100
Mookie, I didn't say nothing?

2000
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,900
You must have a guilty conscience?

2001
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,700
I'm not guilty of anything?

2002
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,300
You're guilty of something?

2003
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,600
Otherwise you wouldn't be saying that?

2004
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,900
Come on, Sal?

2005
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,500
Where we going?

2006
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,700
Oh, shit?

2007
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Vito, give me a hand?

2008
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,800
Come on?

2009
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,900
What the fuck's the matter?

2010
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,700
Vito, I want you to listen to me?

2011
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,300
I'm your brother?

2012
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,900
I smack you around
once in a while,

2013
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,100

2020
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,900
I said I'm listening?

2021
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,500
Vito, black?? White? No?

2022
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,100
No, no, no? No?

2023

Stop busting my balls?

I said I'm listening?

2027
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,500
Mookie's not to be trusted?

2028
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,900
I trust him, Pino?

2029
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,500
They can't be trusted?

2030
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,600
First time you turn your back??

2031
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,700
Boom? Aah!

2032
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,700
The spear in the back?

He, them??
They're not to be trusted?

2041
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,900
What do you want me to do?

2042
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,500
Be on fucking guard?

2043
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,900
Mookie has Pop conned,

You don't know everything

You think you know,
but you don't know?

2055

Mookie, he listens to me?
You don't, man?

To get my money?

2477
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,300
Don't try that shit, OK?

2478
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,300
You're going to run out,

2479
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,700
and I won't see your ass
for another week?

2480
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,100
It's not like that?

2481
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,600
You don't give
a fucking shit about me,

2482
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,600
and you don't
give a shit about your son?

2483
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:53,100
I care about you and my son?

2484
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,100
Why don't you be a man?

2485
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,500
I am a man?

2486
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:57,900
Then act like a man?

2487
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,500
Why don't you be
a fucking man, Mookie?

2488
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,500
I'm so tired of your shit?

2489
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,500
Why do we have to
go over this again?

2490
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,900
Because you don't
fucking listen, Mookie!

2491
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,500
If you listen to me,

2492
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,500
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2493
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:12,800
like a fucking radio!

2494
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,800
What kind of mother you are

2495
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,400
using fucking language like that?

2496
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,400
What kind of mother am I?

2497
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,400
Your ass isn't even here!

2498
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,100
Get another vocabulary, right?

2499
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,600
Get a fucking life?

2500
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,900
Yeah? Look??

2501
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:25,900
Look what?

2502
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:27,400
I'll be back?

2503
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,400
Don't leave, Mookie?
Don't leave?

2504
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,100
I'm tired of this shit?

2505
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
You walk out that door, that's it?

2506
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:34,500
All right?

2507
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:39,100
I have to get my money from Sal?
I'll be back?

2508
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:43,100
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired of it?

2509
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:44,500
You need to step off

2510
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,300
with your stupid-ass self?

2511
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,300
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,

2512
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,900
because the one you got
is not working!

2513
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:55,400
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2514
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,400
Shit?
Fucking ass, stupid ass,

2515
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,100
fucking pendejo.

2516
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:01,900
Shit? Fuck?
Fucking shit?

2517
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:04,700
Good morning?

2518
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,800
Is it a good morning?

2519
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,300
Yes, indeed?

2520
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,500
You almost got yourself
killed last night?

2521
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,100
I've done that before?

2522
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,900
Where did you sleep?

2523
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,300
I didn't?

2524
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:35,500
I hope the block is still standing?

2525
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,300
We're still standing?

2526
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,700
What do you want?

2527
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,100
I want my money?
I want to get paid?

2528
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,300
You don't work here no more?

2529
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,500
I want my money?

2530
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,500
Your money couldn't begin to pay

2531
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,900
for the window you broke?

2532
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,500
Motherfuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?

2533
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,900
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?

2534
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,900
He's dead because of his buddy?

2535
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,500
That cocksucker started this shit?

2536
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:39,500
He's responsible
for that kid's death?

2537
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,900
He wanted to close me,

2538
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,500
and you stood there like a fuck

2539
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,500
and watched them
burn me down!

2540
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,800
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?

2541
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,400
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?

2542
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,400
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

2543
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,700
This ain't about money?

2544
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,700
I could give a fuck
about money?

2545
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:57,900
You see this place?

2546
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,400
I built this fucking place!

2547
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,600
With my bare fucking hands!

2548
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,700
Every light socket,
every piece of tile?

2549
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,700
Me! With these fucking hands!

2550
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,700
You know what that means?

2551
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:12,300
It means pay me
my motherfucking money?

2552
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:13,900
That's what it means, Sal?

2553
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,900
OK, Mookie?

2554
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:18,300
How much do I owe you?

2555
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:21,700
My salary is 250?
250 a week?

2556
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,700
1!!

2557
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,700
That's 2!!

2558
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,100
That's 3!!

2559
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:36,900
That's 4!!

2560
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,900
And that's 5!

2561
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,600
You got $500?
You're a rich fucking man?

2562
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,800
Are you happy?
You happy?

2563
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,900
He's got 500 fucking dollars!

2564
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,500
He's a big man!

2565
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,300
He's a rich fucking man!

2566
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,600
He's never going to have
any more trouble!

2567
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:54,900
Not Mookie!

2568
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,500
He's fucking rich!

2569
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:58,000
Who the fuck you yelling at?

2570
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:59,600
You're wealthy, Mookie?

2571
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,700
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?

2572
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:06,100
You got your fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?

2573
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,100
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

2574
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,800
I owe you 50 bucks?

2575
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:13,800
Keep it?

2576
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,800
You keep it?

2577
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:15,800
You keep it?

2578
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:16,800
You keep it?

2579
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:17,800
No, you keep it?

2580
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,300
You keep it?

2581
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,900
I don't believe this shit?

2582
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,300
Believe it?

2583
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,900
Are you sick?

2584
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:33,900
I'm hot as a motherfucker?
I'm all right, though?

2585
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,700
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today?

2586
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,700
What are you going
to do with yourself?

2587
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,900
Make that money?
Get paid?

2588
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,400
Sal, I got to go see my son

2589
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,100
If it's all right with you?

2590
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,600
Hey, Mook.
It's the Mook man.

2591
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:05,500
I see you walking.
Go home to your kid.

2592
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,100
Now the news and weather.

2593
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:10,100
Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...

2594
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,100
"to get to the bottom

2595
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,400
of last night's disturbance.

2596
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,800
The City of New York

2597
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:17,400
will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."

2598
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
His Honor plans to visit
our block today.

2599
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,900
He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,

2600
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,500
buy him a beer.

2601
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:26,100
Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.

2602
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,000
The election is coming up.

2603
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:31,100
There's no end in sight
from this heat wave,

2604
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,500
so today,
the cash money word is chill.

2605
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,900
That's right. C-h-i-l-I.

2606
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,700
When you hear "chill,"
call in at 555-LOVE,

2607
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,000
and youll win
cash money, honey.

2608
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,000
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy

2609
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,900
coming at you from
what's last on your dial

2610
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,700
but first in your hearts,

2611
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,200
and that's
the quintessential truth, Ruth.

2612
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:54,100
The next record goes out
to Radio Raheem.

2613
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,700
We love you, brother.

2614
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,800
# From the heart of Bed-Stuy #

2615
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:51,500
# W-e-L -o-v-e ##

2616
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:09,700
# I was looking through
a window at my life today #

2617
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,300
# And for the first time #

2618
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:17,100
# I saw things in a different way #

2619
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:24,900
# I n the middle of my mind #

2620
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:32,300
# It was there all the time #

2621
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,400
# Never explain love #

2622
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,500
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #

2623
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:42,400
# lf it is there,
it's yours to keep #

2624
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:46,300
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #

2625
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:49,300
# Never explain love #

2626
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:53,500
# Let the experience take over you #

2627
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:56,900

# Never explain love #

2629
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,700
# I was looking for an answer #

2630
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:20,500
# And I was searching for a sign #

2631
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:28,700
#To try and understand
this relationship of mine #

2632
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:35,500
# But I didn't need to go far #

2633
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:41,700
# I was reading it all wrong #

2634
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,700
# Never explain love #

2635
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:49,900

# I almost knew it all #

2644
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,600
#Who needs to be rational #

2645
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:27,100
#When love isn't practical #

2646
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,300
# Oh, I knew this was inside #

2647
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,500
# And it's so wrong #

2648
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,500
# It's so right #

2649
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:38,500
#Whoa-oh-ho ahh #

2650
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:52,600

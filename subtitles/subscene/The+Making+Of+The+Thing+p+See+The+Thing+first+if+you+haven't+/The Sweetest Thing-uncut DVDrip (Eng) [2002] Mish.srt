1
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,390
Christina Walters?

2
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:32,623
God, l haven't heard that name in ages.

3
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:35,276
The kind of woman
who can get any guy she wants.

4
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,323
That's Christina Walters.

5
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,905
We dated briefly,
but she's not the commitment type.

6
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,546
She's a player. She just likes to have fun.

7
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,564
l met Christina at a bar. Hot piece of ass.

8
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:52,464
Totally hit it off. All night long we dance.
l buy her drinks.

9
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,629
At the end of the night, she just splits.

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,700
l lay down all that groundwork for nothing.

11
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:01,866
Lesbian.

12
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:06,188
She gave me her number. lt's been three days.

13
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,778
l saw Swingers. l know how these things work.

14
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:11,948
Hello, and welcome to AOL Moviefone.

15
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:15,694
l stay up nights trying to figure out
why she said she'd call and didn't.

16
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:20,458
Maybe she wanted to call and that's why
she said she was going to call, but....

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,413
''Christina

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,608
''Christina''

19
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:31,884
You know, there ought to be
some kind of a signal...

20
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:36,786
...to let us guys know
when we are talking to a lesbian.

21
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,562
So we don't waste our time.

22
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:44,460
Prolonged impotence is very common
after a breakup.

23
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,450
Lots of men suffer from it.

24
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:51,248
They just don't talk about it.
Not like me, gabbing away. Gab, gab.

25
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,193
But, even still,
because she said she was going to call...

26
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,488
...she should've called
to say she wasn't going to call...

27
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,171
...and l would've thanked her for calling--

28
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:02,253
All right. Okay.

29
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,262
l apologize for saying she was a lesbian.

30
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,736
lt's not true.

31
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,469
My male ego got bruised and l lashed out.
l'm sorry.

32
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,053
l'm not used to being blown off, that's all.

33
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,382
l'm sure she wasn't trying to hurt me on purpose.

34
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:23,889
l know deep down inside she's scared
and lonely just like everyone else.

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,017
She'll settle down though,
once she finds the right man.

36
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:29,867
Or woman.

37
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:33,039
Maybe has a little boxed lunch at the Y.

38
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:38,191
Jeez, l'm sorry. Did l say it again?
You're goddamn right l said it again.

39
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,454
Why don't you shave your head, Christina,
and take up women's golf?

40
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,515
Why don't you go to the Depot.
Lots of carpet you can munch on there.

41
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:55,503
At least l don't get that dizzy,
head-spinning nausea as much as l used to.

42
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,846
Hooray!

43
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:02,792
Like l said, l'm doing fine.

44
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:04,938
l am fan-fucking-tastic.

45
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,934
-Christina.
-Valerie!

46
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:34,794
Shake it if you've got it.

47
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:38,824
Miss Courtney.

48
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:42,124
Hello, Miss Christina.
How you doing? What you doing?

49
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,268
Dancing too much. How you doing?

50
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,019
Same thing. How was your day?

51
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,581
Pretty good.

52
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:52,202
l got a new account designing
a campaign for a sports line.

53
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,411
They got the right girl, didn't they?

54
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,430
Thank you.

55
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,028
So, what's up?

56
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:02,251
The usual. Defending the rights
of my broken-hearted clients.

57
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:06,125
Trying to squeeze every penny
out of their miserable, cheating spouses.

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,459
You go get them, woman.

59
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:11,272
l'll order a pizza and stay in tonight.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Okay, but if we do that,
you know what will have to happen.

61
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:18,437
Girl, l've been shaking my ass
all the way up this hill.

62
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:19,816
Which track?

63
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,676
Track three. Oh, yeah!

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,421
Koochie!

65
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,190
ls your granny here? What's going on?

66
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,814
lt's Jane. She loves this song.

67
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,000
Jane, what's up?

68
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,607
He dumped me.

69
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,877
Kevin dumped me.

70
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:59,948
lt was just three days
before our one-year anniversary.

71
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,241
-Baby.
-Maybe he just freaked out.

72
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:07,399
He will call up tomorrow when he realizes
what a huge mistake he made.

73
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,639
-He's probably going through that whole--
-No.

74
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:12,619
He says he's been wanting this for six months.

75
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,647
He says he's been dying inside
ever since l brought over my garment bag.

76
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,710
-Honey.
-What?

77
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,032
We're all guilty of it.
You made yourself too available.

78
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,499
lt's a classic mistake, sweetheart.

79
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,214
-Yeah.
-Not according to this.

80
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,486
''Commandment four.''

81
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,434
''True Love: The Ten Commandments.''

82
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:39,654
''Commandment number four:
Thou shalt be open to love's possibilities.

83
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,058
''Boundaries are the enemies of love.''

84
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,348
Sweetie, you know what?
This book is relationship propaganda.

85
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,881
Listen to me.

86
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:52,044
Dating is all about boundaries.

87
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,114
Honey, you have to protect yourself.

88
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,416
We've all had our heart stomped on
one too many times...

89
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,364
...because we served it to them
on a big old platter.

90
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,620
A good defense is the best offense.

91
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,796
l am so tired of playing games.

92
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:09,316
This is not about playing games.
This is about self-preservation.

93
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:13,442
You can't throw yourself out there
all exposed and vulnerable every time.

94
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,304
That is how you get smacked down.

95
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:16,867
Do you understand?

96
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,221
Don't go looking for Mr. Right.
Look for Mr. Right Now.

97
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,415
And, eventually, if he's worthy, then one day...

98
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:29,990
...that ''now'' part is just going to drop away.

99
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,618
Naturally, you know?

100
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:34,665
Meanwhile, you're just
going to have fun together.

101
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:38,344
Yeah. Not so serious. Shake it off a little bit.

102
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:41,541
Speaking of fun, we are going to take you out.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,249
We are taking you out.
You are going to have a good time.

104
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,848
No.

105
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,584
Oswaldo!

106
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:54,690
Hey, Christina. Courtney.

107
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,672
-Jane.
-Hello, Jane.

108
00:06:58,316 --> 00:06:59,810
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

109
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,196
Shut up!

110
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,310
Okay, girls, let's go.

111
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,966
This is it, Jane.

112
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,805
Go, baby!

113
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,695
-Right here, baby.
-Oh, my God.

114
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,510
Look at the shoulder, baby.
Bounce it, baby. Check it out, baby.

115
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,613
What's your name, baby?

116
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,136
Here we go. Circle of love, circle of love!

117
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,696
We're going to go now.

118
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,889
Bye-bye.

119
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,894
My God. lt's like Siegfried & Roy or something.

120
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:58,853
Martinis, ladies.

121
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:02,942
-Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.
-Which one?

122
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,447
Thank you, Leather Coat Guy.

123
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,657
Cheers.

124
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,239
Leather Coat Guy is looking good.

125
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,773
Shotgun!

126
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,652
Cheater.

127
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,095
What's up?

128
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,384
Nothing. What's up with you?

129
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,786
Nothing.

130
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,281
What's up with you?

131
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:36,711
Nothing. What's up with you?

132
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,301
Nothing.

133
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:39,431
You know, l am having the best time.

134
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,563
You know, l am having the best time.

135
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:43,679
Are you, sweetie?

136
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:47,648
My boyfriend dumped me. l'm at this club
where no one wants to talk to me.

137
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,021
-l want to go home.
-No.

138
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,668
No. Christina, l can't do this.

139
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,808
Yes, you can. lt's really very easy.

140
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,798
Observe.

141
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,500
l just pinched his ass.

142
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,908
l'm sorry. Hi.

143
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,724
-Hi. What's your name?
-Peter.

144
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,693
Peter, this is my friend, Jane.
Jane would love to dance.

145
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:15,199
l don't mean to be rude,
but l have some friends waiting for me.

146
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,992
Nice to meet you, though.

147
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,792
-He hated me. l suck.
-You don't suck. That guy was a dick.

148
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:25,604
l'll make sure that you have fun tonight
if it's the last thing....

149
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,518
What did you call me?

150
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,883
You just called me a dick. l heard you.
Why am l a dick?

151
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,958
Because l didn't like the way
you treated my friend.

152
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,883
l didn't do anything to your friend.

153
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,726
You barely gave her the time of day.

154
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:45,218
You tried to pawn me off on her
and l didn't go for it.

155
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:49,665
You should be so lucky to even talk
to someone as hot and sweet as Jane.

156
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:50,813
Excuse me.

157
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:55,108
l wasn't suggesting you get married.
l just thought you could get it on.

158
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,148
What? Get it on?

159
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,187
You know nothing about me.
What if l'm some psycho serial killer?

160
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:03,360
What if Jane was the girl of your dreams,
but you'll never know?

161
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:05,151
That is the sweetest thing.

162
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,255
l never thought l'd meet her
by having somebody grab me and say:

163
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:12,548
''Man, l have good woman for you.
She is very hot and sweet.

164
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,330
''Jane! Dance for the man!''

165
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,338
-Maybe that's your problem.
-What?

166
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:20,348
Maybe if you didn't play it so safe,
Mr. Safety-Poo...

167
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:23,268
...you might meet a girl you could have fun with.

168
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:27,388
This brilliant love advice comes
from one who loves to play games with men.

169
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:30,810
Always in control.
That way, she never has to get too close.

170
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,281
Nice manners, by the way.

171
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,027
Where the hell did that guy.... Jane?

172
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,402
What's up with you?

173
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,685
Nothing. What's up with you?

174
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,782
l can't believe he brought that bitch
to our bar.

175
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,786
-This is our bar.
-Forget her, she's a skeev.

176
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:58,114
-But is she prettier than me?
-Of course not, you're beautiful.

177
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,962
Oh, my God, you fucking bitch!

178
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,386
l can't believe you grabbed his ass.

179
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,907
He comes right into my face
and starts telling me all this stupid stuff...

180
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,235
...about how l like to play games
and be in control so l never get too close.

181
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,209
Can you believe him?

182
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,754
-What?
-Nothing.

183
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,683
-l've never seen you act like this before.
-Act like what?

184
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,123
They're fake.

185
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,745
All bah-jiggity about some guy.

186
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:24,505
-Bah-jiggity?
-Yeah.

187
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,684
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to stare.

188
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,144
lt's cool. lt's why l got them.

189
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,771
-l'm not bah-jiggity.
-You are so bah-jiggity.

190
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,436
They look real.

191
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,426
Thank you. You can touch it if you want to.

192
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:36,474
No.

193
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:40,472
-Touch it. She likes it.
-Go ahead. lt feels real, huh?

194
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:44,703
lf l'm bah-jiggity about this guy Peter,
it's because you're telling me l am.

195
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,233
-Oh, my God.
-What?

196
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,801
You've named the puppy.

197
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,971
-l did not.
-You just called him Peter.

198
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:53,495
-l did?
-You've got to feel these things.

199
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:56,536
l'm psychic and l knew his name was Peter.

200
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:00,092
-Knock your socks off.
-So soft.

201
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,918
Un-fucking-believable.

202
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,486
Fuck.

203
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,273
l am so getting a pair.

204
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,239
That's why chicks
always go to the bathroom together.

205
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:13,304
lt's so obvious that you like this guy.
Why are you being such a pussy about it?

206
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,517
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

207
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,903
lf you haven't noticed,
there's plenty of guys out there.

208
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,527
See you later.

209
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:27,511
-What's your problem?
-What's your problem?

210
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,922
-Hi.
-Hi.

211
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,091
Hey, Peter.

212
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,543
-Eric!
-Be right there.

213
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:46,048
You don't have to do this.

214
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,039
l know, but l want to. l spilled your drink.
Can l buy you another one?

215
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,158
Okay.

216
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,818
l want to apologize.

217
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,534
l shouldn't have been impolite to your friend.
lf l was, l didn't mean to.

218
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:02,074
My brother is waiting for me
and l got nervous, l guess. l don't know.

219
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,024
l mean, otherwise, l'd be all over your friend.

220
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,663
l'm the one who should apologize. l was rude.

221
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:13,916
No, l understand. You were protecting
your friend. Anyone would've done that.

222
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,446
l thought that was sweet.

223
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,494
Jesus.

224
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,322
-We good now?
-Yeah.

225
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,437
Good.

226
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:26,844
l should get back to my friends.

227
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,503
Okay.

228
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,878
Thanks for the drink.

229
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,533
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

230
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,570
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

231
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,925
Can you take this? l'm a total loser.
l just struck out with this guy.

232
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:49,369
One more thing.

233
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:53,529
Should l be upset that my ex-girlfriend
has her tongue down that guy's throat?

234
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,449
Oh, my God!

235
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,239
-Jane!
-l guess l blew my chance.

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,909
-That could have been you.
-lf l wasn't such a dick.

237
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,200
-Was l really a dick?
-Yeah. You were a dick.

238
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:11,067
We should start over. Why don't l walk by,
and you grab me like before?

239
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:13,023
-l didn't grab you.
-You grabbed me.

240
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,226
You grabbed me right on the ass.

241
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:18,143
l don't grab, okay?

242
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:19,318
Pete!

243
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,452
Excuse me.

244
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,045
Dude! Where you been? Everybody's waiting.

245
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,763
After-hours party back at the hotel.
These two pigs are good to go.

246
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:32,308
Did l mention that we have
the Freddie Mercury Suite?

247
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:35,545
She puked on him!

248
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:39,705
Again? God, she's like a hose.
Go help her, please.

249
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:41,207
Or not.

250
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,087
She's out. We're one short. Who's this chick?

251
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,905
-She is hot. Bring her.
-What?

252
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,583
Fuck me. You have so much....

253
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,206
You've got to come. Let me tell you why.

254
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:57,019
You'll never find anyone better than my brother.
He is the greatest--

255
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,052
That hurts me. Just look at him.

256
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,839
Chicks freak on this guy. Come on, now.

257
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:06,238
He is the shit and that's why
he's in my wedding on Saturday.

258
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,674
-No.
-Yes.

259
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:10,140
-No.
-Just trying to help out.

260
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,242
'Bye!

261
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:18,807
Ladies, big party. Four Seasons, room 402.
You're invited, you're invited.

262
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,282
All right, l'm leaving.

263
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,022
-That's my brother.
-He's special.

264
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:26,393
Careful, that's puke. Don't touch me.

265
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,668
When is the wedding?

266
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,471
Saturday afternoon up in Somerset.
That's where we live.

267
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:33,685
That's nice.

268
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,119
Peter! lt's looking like now.

269
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,903
You're pinching my arm skin.

270
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:43,319
l better go. But for real this time.

271
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,867
-lt was nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you. l had a great time.

272
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,444
Me, too.

273
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,328
Come by the party if you want to.

274
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,789
-Really?
-Definitely. lf you want to.

275
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,283
l'll ask my friends. Maybe we'll stop by.

276
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:59,066
l really hope l see you. But in case
l don't see you, have a nice life.

277
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:01,620
You, too.

278
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:14,548
Chris, it's Court.
I'm at the party with Leather Coat Guy.

279
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,522
I was checking in to see
if you were listening to your messages.

280
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:22,266
If you are, that means you were
too chicken to hook up with Peter...

281
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,871
...which therefore means you are a loser.
You are a loser. A--

282
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,401
Thanks, Court.

283
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:31,443
''I'm a big loser.''

284
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,226
What's up, you bitches and hos and losers?

285
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,216
Too late now.

286
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:54,931
He was kind of cute.

287
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,023
Funny.

288
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:05,204
Really funny.

289
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,426
Cute boy.

290
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,484
My God, you're so good at that.

291
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:38,031
l'd like to do that every hour,
on the hour, for the rest of our lives.

292
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,692
-Of course, go ahead.
-Thank you.

293
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:44,120
Don't worry about returning the favor.
Men don't really like oral sex.

294
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,134
Right.

295
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,952
l'm serious. lt's just a bad rumor
that was started sometime in the '50s.

296
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,084
l had no idea. l need to tell all my friends.

297
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,112
Please, do.
Someone needs to put an end to this madness.

298
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:04,822
God, l'm so glad l came back to the hotel room.

299
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,678
Me, too.

300
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:09,976
l never thought l'd see you again.

301
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:16,053
-Room service.
-Right on time.

302
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,999
-lce cream?
-Only the best for our VlPs.

303
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:22,577
l had them remove all the calories for you.

304
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,776
You are good.

305
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,790
All right!

306
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:31,794
l said l wanted to do it to you every hour,
on the hour, but l can't wait.

307
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,426
Can l do it again now?

308
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:36,114
Okay.

309
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:23,764
San Francisco, California, please,
for Four Seasons Hotel. Thanks.

310
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,200
Great dream.

311
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:35,630
Yes, hi. Do you have a Freddie Mercury Suite?

312
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:40,175
Good. Can l have it? Thanks.

313
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,504
Really?

314
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,140
Already?

315
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,659
Have a great day. Thanks. 'Bye.

316
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,640
What am l even calling for?

317
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:02,965
Hello? Hey, Court.

318
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:04,875
Yeah.

319
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:24,304
-Stop talking shit about me.
-Where you been?

320
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:28,684
Sorry l'm late. l don't want to talk about it.
You ready? l'm starving.

321
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,264
l'll meet you there. l have to drop something off
at the dry cleaners.

322
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,465
Can it wait, please? l'm so hungry right now.

323
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:39,217
lsn't that Courtney's dress
that you borrowed last night?

324
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,362
Yeah.

325
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:44,239
Why are you bringing it in?
Did you get something on it?

326
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:48,011
l'm trying to be a good girlfriend.

327
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,436
-l'm really sorry.
-You slut!

328
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,509
-ls that what l think it is?
-Guilty!

329
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:57,331
l'll take it to the dry cleaners, and it will be gone.

330
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,145
-That's a lot!
-He was holding a lot!

331
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:03,377
My God! What's this on your skirt?

332
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,956
l am scared enough as it is to go in there.
What am l going to say?

333
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,541
''Mr. Martin, can you help me with my jizz?''

334
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,020
You know what?

335
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:19,626
-You guys suck.
-No, obviously you suck.

336
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:22,068
-You suck.
-You suck well. l'm proud.

337
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,306
No spanky-wanky.

338
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,428
Hey, Jane.

339
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,119
-Hi, Mr. Martin.
-How's your mother?

340
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:58,570
-Great. She's good. Everyone's good.
-Your grandmother?

341
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,610
-Everyone's great.
-That's fine. That's fine.

342
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,234
What you got for me today?

343
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:07,624
Just a dress, but l'll be back for it
in a few days, so no hurry.

344
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,190
-Any stains?
-No.

345
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,750
-What's this?
-What?

346
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,990
This. Come here.

347
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,098
Stain?

348
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,503
This is going to be a tough one.

349
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:26,417
l didn't even notice that. l must have spilled
some soda on me last night.

350
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,764
No. This is not soda. Think, Jane. Think.

351
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:35,089
lf l know what it is, it's easier for me to remove.

352
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:41,450
The field trip. Come in, children. Come in.

353
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:45,553
-Fuck.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Franklin.

354
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,143
Hi, Mr. Martin.

355
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:52,751
On today's field trip,
we are going to learn about cleanliness.

356
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,878
Jane?

357
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,148
Jane Burns!

358
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,007
Sweetheart, l haven't seen you
since l taught you in third grade!

359
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:11,335
-Top of the morning there, Mr. Martin.
-Hello, Father Flynn.

360
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:18,096
As l live and breathe, isn't it....
lt is little Mary Jane Burns!

361
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:22,060
What a coincidence!
l'm having supper with your parents tonight.

362
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:25,357
What a stain you got there, little Janie!

363
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:27,432
So how was it? Was it fun?

364
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,604
Oh, my God, l can't believe l didn't tell you this.

365
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:34,798
Apparently, one of the guys
who was at the party flipped out...

366
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:38,346
...was out on the balcony,
screaming at the top of his lungs:

367
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:43,663
''Christina! Has anyone seen
my little Christina?''

368
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:48,941
Then he jumps off and dies
because you're a pussy. Why didn't you go?

369
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,133
l don't know! l was going to. l was.
l was going to, and then l wasn't.

370
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,536
And then l called him at the hotel--

371
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:59,310
Wait. Hold on. Rewind for one second.
You called him at the hotel?

372
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:04,719
-What did he say?
-Nothing. He said nothing. Okay?

373
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:06,733
-Why?
-He checked out already.

374
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:09,614
Let's just sum this up real quickly.

375
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:13,293
ln the bathroom, we hate him,
yet we call him by name.

376
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:15,692
Then we throw beer on him.

377
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,180
Then we laugh and we flirt
and we dance with him.

378
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:23,750
Then we casually call him at the hotel.
Then we obsess about the casual call.

379
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:27,021
Obsess? l'm not obsessing, okay?

380
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:32,167
Could all this erratic behavior
be because this guy got under your skin?

381
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,029
-No.
-That you might really like him?

382
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:38,222
That you regret not going because
you'll never know what might've happened?

383
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,157
No, l don't regret it, and if l had any regrets...

384
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:44,396
...it would be this conversation,
right now, having it with you.

385
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:47,310
-Can we drop it?
-Okay. Sorry l brought it up.

386
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,190
l won't mention it again.

387
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,273
Even if l did regret not going to the party...

388
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:58,471
...it's not like l can do anything about it now.

389
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:02,347
Sometimes you just have
to let these things go, right?

390
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,554
-Exactly.
-Although...

391
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,016
...if there was regret...

392
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:10,855
...l suppose there's always something
you could do about it.

393
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:16,718
You could show up at his brother's wedding,
because it is his brother.

394
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,532
But that's only if you regretted it,
which l don't regret it.

395
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,405
l just don't regret it.
Regret is such a waste of time.

396
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,110
Honey will you just admit
that you regret not going to this party.

397
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:30,282
-Okay, fine l regret not going to this party.
-You need to let it go.

398
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,969
l'm letting it go. l'm over it.

399
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:36,100
Hi, honey, how did it go?

400
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,406
-Fine. No problem.
-Good.

401
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,480
Did we have fun last night?

402
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:44,707
Yes, l did. lt was great.

403
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:47,270
You guys were right,
a transition guy is what l needed.

404
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:48,520
Good.

405
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,280
So how was he, was he good?

406
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,316
He was very sweet and complimentary.

407
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,818
And very into pleasing me first.

408
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:58,187
So how was girth?

409
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,387
Averag-ish.

410
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:03,910
''Averag-ish.'' That's good.
So what did you tell him?

411
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,019
What do you mean?

412
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:08,967
What do we always tell them, no matter what?

413
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:17,738
Oh, my God, your penis is so big.

414
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,300
Good girl.

415
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:22,407
Your penis is so thick.

416
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:27,075
Your penis is just so pretty.

417
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:33,194
You got a handsome dick!

418
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:37,035
Your penis, it's so...

419
00:27:38,317 --> 00:27:39,594
...hard.

420
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:43,206
Your penis is just so large.

421
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,538
My body is a movie...

422
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:50,631
...and your penis is the star!

423
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,806
You're too big to fit in here.

424
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:59,948
Too big to fit in here.

425
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,378
Too big to fit in here.

426
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:13,576
''You're too big to fit in here''

427
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:19,302
Oh, my God.

428
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:22,121
Oh, my God, it's Fame! We're in Fame right now.

429
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:35,339
''What a lovely ride

-Come on.
-How much time we got?

452
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:41,480
We've got three hours before the rehearsal.
Hit the ball.

453
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,961
-Good shot.
-Fore!

454
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:48,293

To 50 years with the same woman.

460
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,057
That's really depressing.

461
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,006
Sorry.

462
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,181
Saggy tits.

463
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,391
Be able to use them as a belt by then.

464
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,493
-Or just tuck them in her socks.
-Okay.

465
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:22,374
God, this marriage is such a big leap.
lt's really intense, Pete.

466
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,636
-But if it's the right woman....
-l guess.

467
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,112
Get up a little. Yes. Fore!

468

You motherfuckers! Stop bothering me!

469
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:35,714
You're driving right into them.

470
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,361
l hear John is still AWOL
from that bachelor party.

471
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,653
He showed up, missing an eyebrow,
with a tattoo on his ass that says ''Bitch.''

472
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,810
-l am not an animal!
-Very good.

473
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,211
Speaking of bitches...

474
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:54,051
...what was going on with you
at the club with that hottie?

475
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:56,838
-Nothing.
-l mean, Jesus!

476
00:31:56,903 --> 00:31:58,845
l don't know what you're talking about.

477
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:01,375
-l think you liked her.
-No, l didn't.

478
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,874
Yeah, you did. Don't lie to me.

479
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:07,462
Don't lie. Don't lie to Darth, Luke.

480
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,463
l could see it in your eyes you liked her.

481
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:19,740
Nothing l can do about it now.

482
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:23,425
Should have poked her in the whiskers
when you had the chance.

483
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,056
What's that, Gramps?

484
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,410
l met this hot young dish...

485
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:32,160
...at the World's Fair back in 1940.

486
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:36,352
Every moment with her was like a slice of heaven.

487
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,942
l bet you really miss Grandma.

488
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,238
Fuck Grandma.

489
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:44,514
lt's Pearl l'm talking about.

490
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:50,207
She was the love of my life.
Don't ever let these moments pass you by.

491
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,094
Fucking Grandma.

492
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:58,364
Be nice.

493
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:02,717
Come on. 7-6.

494
00:33:06,405 --> 00:33:07,779
Fore!

495
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:28,452
You suck!

496
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:29,753
Damn it!

497
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,794
-But you smell so minty fresh now.
-What do you want?

498
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:35,993
l need to borrow your black Gucci bag.

499
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:38,617
lt's in the living room.

500
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:42,336
l don't know where in the living room,
and l don't feel like looking for it.

501
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:45,503
Will you help me find it, please?
Come on, please.

502
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:48,671
Since l'm up now,
and you decided to torture me...

503
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:50,461
...l'll go and get it.

504
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,004
l'm sorry. Oh, my God. Excuse me.

505
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:57,539
Can you tell me where the bathroom is?

506
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,227
-Behind you.
-Over here?

507
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:06,909
Thanks.

508
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:08,608
Oh, my...

509
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,264
...cock.

510
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,084
Oh, my cock.

511
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:20,665
Do you have any Advil?

512
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:28,122
He is so cute. So stupid.

513
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:33,464
Can l get that purse now, please?

514
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,770
Yes, you can have the purse.

515
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,201
Here's the purse.

516
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:40,344
Thank you very much.

517
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,589
-Where are you going?
-You and l are going to a wedding.

518
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:51,707
-What wedding? Who's getting married?
-We're going to Peter's brother's wedding.

519
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,759
Peter?

520
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:56,446
This Somerset place where they live
is some small freak-ass town...

521
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:59,994
...three hours north, so we have to
get on the road now to make it on time.

522
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,174
-Peter.
-What?

523
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:05,568
l'm not going to Peter's brother's wedding!

524
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:10,336
What are you talking about? Yesterday,
you said you wanted to go, so l went....

525
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:13,914
-l was joking.
-No, you weren't.

526
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,119
Yes, l was.

527
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:20,351
Fifty percent of what people say
when they're joking is true.

528
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:24,416
Which means you do want to go,
but you're too afraid to admit it.

529
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:28,255
So by making some sort of joke about it,
you get to say what you really want...

530
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:29,946
...without being vulnerable.

531
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:31,932
-Right?
-Maybe.

532
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:35,833
Okay. The wedding starts at 5:00.
l refuse to be late.

533
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:38,623
Put some clothes on. Now! Thank you.

534
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:42,015
-That was a nice one.
-Thanks.

535
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,819
-Watch the road, sweetie!
-l am watching the road.

536
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,863
Once we get off the 140...

537
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,734
...we'll take the 95, get off on the Somerset exit.

538
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,093
We'll drive around
and we should find the church, no problem.

539
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:09,239
Ta-da!

540
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,059
-What is that?
-What is what?

541
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,807
-You don't smell that?
-What? l don't smell anything.

542
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:23,255
-You're used to it. That's what's scary.
-l don't smell anything.

543
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,362
lt smells like moldy ass,
is what it smells like in here.

544
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,008
Come to think of it,
l did leave some ass in the back.

545
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:31,964
-You did?
-About a week ago.

546
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:35,741
lt must be the ass. No, no. Sit down.

547
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:44,248
-What are you doing?
-Jesus, Courtney.

548
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,905
What is all this crap?

549
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,725
Don't throw out anything l might need.

550
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:53,973
Where is it coming from? Where?
l can still smell it.

551
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,296
Maybe it's you.
Did something crawl up your poon-nonny?

552
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:03,997
l have never, ever had any complaints
in the poon-nonny odor department.

553
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:07,805
-You know what? Neither have l.
-High five on the clean poon-nonny.

554
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:08,915
Bitch.

555
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:12,435
What?

556
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,521
-What is this?
-What is what?

557
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:15,801
What is this?

558
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,162
Jesus, l don't know.
l don't even know how long it's been in here.

559
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,757
What is in here?

560
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,245
No! That is not okay.

561
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,213
lt isn't okay. You are a disgusting, nasty pig.
Do you understand?

562
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:34,523
There was maggots on that flesh.

563
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:43,484
l got maggot juice all over me.

564
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,292
Ladies' room.

565
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:48,445
Ladies' room.

566
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:52,533
-Someone's in here.
-Sorry.

567
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,971
-lt might be a while.
-How long?

568
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,727
Let me put it to you this way:

569
00:37:56,894 --> 00:38:00,156
l had lamb curry last night
and l'm shitting out a Buick.

570
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:04,763
Was it absolutely vital for her to tell us that?

571
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,465
Hello?

572
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:12,823
Clear?

573
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:19,351
l feel like l have maggots all over me.

574
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:23,381
Don't move. You have a maggot right here.

575
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:26,455
Stop it.

576
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,794
l'm going to pee my pants.

577
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,289
l'll just use the urinal.

578
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,804
You want to hear some poetry?

579
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:38,455
''There once was a man from Bandoo
Who fell asleep in a canoe

580
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,955
''He dreamed of Venus
And played with his penis

581
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,541
''And woke up with a handful of goo''

582
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,264
Don't make me laugh!

583
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,340
Darn it. l think l peed on myself.

584
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:53,042
''Follow the yellow brick road''?

585
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:58,712
l'm following the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.

586
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:06,649
Buffy! You look like my old doggie Buffy.
Hello, girl.

587
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,860
-Oh, my God, it's on my hands!
-Good girl. What you got in here?

588
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,736
What you got? What's in your mouth?

589
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,488
What you got in there?

590
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,940
What's in there?

591
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,150
Surprise!

592
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:36,050
Goddamn it.

593
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:39,536
How could you not know what a glory hole is?

594
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,848
Unlike my whore friend Courtney Rockliffe...

595
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:45,712
...l don't usually spend much time
in men's public bathrooms.

596
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,324
Goddamn. That is the funniest thing
l have ever seen in my entire life.

597
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:55,411
l flew across that room.
And you got fucked in the eye.

598
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:59,477
l'm glad you find it so fucking amusing, okay?
l really do.

599
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:03,376
Could you please have some compassion?
Because l could go blind.

600
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,425
You're not going to go blind.

601
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:10,321
-Let me look at it.
-l mean, l got a penis in my eye.

602
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:12,954
Let me see. Let me see.

603
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:16,401
All right.

604
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,673
-ls it okay?
-Yeah, it's okay.

605
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,876
But l think you're pregnant.

606
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,301
Would you please stop it, already?

607
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:30,584
Re-dress the mannequins
and check the sock inventory.

608
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:33,910
Come on, it's Saturday and nobody's here,
and Mr. Mooney--

609
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:37,906
Mr. Mooney is off sailing with his boytoy,
which leaves me in charge of the store.

610
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,112
Somebody needs to get some.

611
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,246
There's my dirty girl!

612
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,392
lt's me, baby. lt's me.

613
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:03,471
-Why are you dressed like that?
-lt's my job. l work at a children's hospital.

614
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,744
You look so cute.

615
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,166
-l'm horny.
-Me, too.

616
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,744
-You'll laugh at this one.
-What?

617
00:41:22,808 --> 00:41:26,638
You know l said l had to do laundry today,
because l ran out of clean underwear?

618
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:30,509
-l've only got the skanky ones left.
-Tell me about it, dude.

619
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,677
You are so unbelievable.

620
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:40,567
ls that what l think it is?

621
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,077
-Spring break, 1994, baby.
-Turn it up.

622
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:19,916
-Oh, my God! Brain.
-Jane!

623
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:22,639
You and l are so awesome together.

624
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,749
We're like two peas in a pod.

625
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:27,060
-Like oil and vinegar--
-Shut up.

626
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:30,292
l can't believe l'm fucking a purple elephant.

627
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:34,259
What do you mean, she's not here?
We have customers, missy.

628
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:36,661
Sorry, Mr. Mooney. l'll check upstairs.

629
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:39,471
l'm gone for one day,
the place turns into lndonesia.

630
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:50,803
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine.

631
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:52,561
-What is going on?
-Nothing.

632
00:42:53,558 --> 00:42:57,901
l'm just frantic. l've a million things to do.
And l'm dizzy. l'm so dizzy.

633
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,008
Mr. Mooney is downstairs, and he is P-l-S-E-D.

634
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:03,276
''Pised''?

635
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:16,497
-Where have you been?
-l was upstairs taking inventory.

636
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,705
Yeah, my aunt Fanny.

637
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:22,803
-Gallini's.
-Hello, is Jane there?

638
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:26,129
-Yes, she is.
-Have a lovely day.

639
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,161
-Hello?
-JanieI

640
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:34,835
Sorry, l can't talk right now.
l'm really busy.

641
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:36,527
We were wondering:

642
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,298
Shit.

643
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,114
Oh, shit.

644
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:08,211
l dropped the thingy to my lip gloss.
Could you get it for me?

645
00:44:08,276 --> 00:44:09,225
l'll get it.

646
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,802
lt's too far over. l'll get it.

647
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:17,005
Hold on to it. Keep steering.

648
00:44:17,076 --> 00:44:18,832
l got it. Don't worry.

649
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,383
Beneath the....

650
00:44:33,716 --> 00:44:34,763
Yeah, baby!

651
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,597
-Oh, yeah, right there.
-No, that's not it.

652
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,647
You like that?

653
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:51,151
Yeah. Let me have some of that.

654
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:54,318
-Oh, yeah. Don't stop.
-l'm not going to stop.

655
00:45:20,307 --> 00:45:23,569
l found it. l almost got smothered down there.

656
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:24,911
Shit.

657
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:26,151
Are you okay?

658
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,634
-You good?
-Yeah, l'm good. Never better.

659
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:36,561
Let's get on the same page about what we'll say.
Game plan.

660
00:45:36,627 --> 00:45:39,922
Walk up to him and be like, ''Peter, is that you?

661
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:44,907
''My friend Courtney, that hot babe?
She and l went to college with the bride.

662
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:48,971
''That is unbelievable.
l can't believe that. lt's unbelievable.

663
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:50,417
''Freaky.''

664
00:46:20,465 --> 00:46:22,156
Afternoon.

665
00:46:27,793 --> 00:46:31,655
-Miss Vera's has plenty to offer us.
-Plenty of crap.

666
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:34,380
-We don't have time for this.
-Okay, let's go.

667
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:39,342
-Welcome to my store. Can l help you?
-No, we were just browsing. Thank you.

668
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:43,915
You don't like my store, do you?

669
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,721
No, that's not it at all. lt's really a lovely store.

670
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:50,159
We were looking for something....

671
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:54,117
The next dress store is 20 miles from here.

672
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:55,367
20 miles away?

673
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,883
-We'll miss the wedding.
-Judy Webb's wedding?

674
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,894
l know all about it. l dressed half the guests!

675
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:05,741

677

Nice and perky.

678
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,796
Gravity has taken them to there.

679

Okay, wait. No, no. Look. What is this?

683
00:47:30,352 --> 00:47:35,174
-What is that, though?
-That, again, is gravity.

684
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:39,113
-Knock, knock. Are you decent?
-Yeah.

Oh, my God.

707
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:47,110
These are the days of our lives.

708
00:49:49,164 --> 00:49:52,328
-This is not discreet.
-No, it isn't.

709
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:56,225
-We can't walk into a wedding--
-Come on. lt's very LaToya Jackson.

710

l mean, really. Look at all this....

711
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:04,259
l may as well strap a sign on my ass
that says ''stalker.''

712
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:10,084
l'm not going there wearing this outfit.
Can we please just go?

713
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:12,457
-Yes. Let's go home.
-Really?

714
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:17,448
We've driven for three and a half hours

00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,719
-But, no, let's go.

00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:28,937
You're so good at it,
you don't even know you're doing it anymore.

719
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:31,332
All right, maybe a little bit.

720
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,461
-Court, this is crazy. This was really crazy.
-What the hell were we thinking?

721
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,853
l wish there were some sign from God...

722
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:41,311
...that you and Peter Donahue
should be together.

723
00:50:41,387 --> 00:50:43,973
How do you know his last name is Donahue?

724
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,215
Because you're sitting on his face.

725
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:52,650
-My God, it's him! He's so cute!
-Yeah, l know.

What do you think? Bride or groom's side?

00:51:31,562 --> 00:51:33,504

732
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:38,436
-Did you misplace your bladder today?
-l'm wearing the tightest skirt ever.

Go to the bathroom. l'll find seats.

734
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:44,389
-Could you tell me where the restroom is?
-lt's right outside.

735
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,355

Well, l'm sure that you're just really nervous.
lt's a big day, right?

749
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:55,588

...how do you know it's real?

751
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,855
l don't know.
l can't answer that for you, really.

752
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:06,562
But l'm sure the two of you
will be really happy together.

753
00:53:07,623 --> 00:53:10,819
And if you're not,
you can always just get divorced.

00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:14,367
-Yeah!
-Yeah, see? lt'll be okay.

755

We don't have to lie anymore

00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,979
No. You cannot lock the door.

That's the strangest thing l've ever seen.

799
00:56:57,954 --> 00:56:59,547
There are no Jews in Somerset.

800
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,073

00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,727

01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,235
-Yeah.
-That's what l thought.

847
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:23,190
l'm such an idiot.

848
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:25,878
No, you're not.

849
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:29,013
l meet a guy for two minutes...

850
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:33,362
...and l'm chasing after him
like he's something special.

851
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:38,425
Maybe you want someone special for once.

852
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:44,085
Maybe you were thinking
that you were tired of the game.

853
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:50,289
Are you tired of the game?

854
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,130
Yep.

855
01:00:57,116 --> 01:00:58,098
Let's go home.

856
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,305
Okay.

857
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,155
My God! What's going on?

858
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,274
Excuse me, Officer?

859
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:23,321
What's going on here?

860
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:26,744
Twenty years on the force,
and l've never seen something so horrible.

861
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:29,942
-What? Where?
-Where's the emergency?

862
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,319
Apartment three.

863
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:33,905
-That's my apartment!
-Jane.

864
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:38,617
Poor girl. Never saw it coming.

865
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:40,474
Excuse me.

866
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:45,208
-Goddamn dress!
-Don't go in there. lt's not a pretty sight.

867
01:01:45,275 --> 01:01:46,681
l live here!

868
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:59,055
-Apparently, they're stuck.
-What do you mean?

869
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:01,430
Are you okay?

870
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:04,312
How are you stuck?

871
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:06,324
l have a piercing.

872
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:10,959
-l don't get it. How is she stuck?
-Behind her tonsils.

873
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,236
How the hell do you know that?

874
01:02:13,786 --> 01:02:17,015
-Honey, l'm going to pull you really gently.
-No.

875
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,020
l'm going to pull it. Gently.

876
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:23,447
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

877
01:02:24,313 --> 01:02:28,307
We've got the ambulance waiting outside.
We have to get going.

878
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:34,354
She could sing. You could sing, Jane.
lt relaxes the throat, honey.

879
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:43,759
Stop it! You're getting me hard again!

880
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:45,714
Wrong song.

881
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:48,598
Armageddon.

882
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:06,289
Come on, try.

883
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:09,869
What?

884
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:17,708
She says to him,
''Girl You Know It's True changed my life.''

885
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:19,124
lt did!

886
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:21,078
And this sad little tear slowly....

887
01:04:21,143 --> 01:04:25,103
Come on. What do you want from me?
l was 16 years old.

888
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,845
l don't even know why l started talking to her
in the second grade.

889
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,976
-You thought l was the shit.
-You are the shit.

890
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:34,224
Shithead.

891
01:04:34,295 --> 01:04:36,182
-My God.
-What?

892
01:04:37,175 --> 01:04:41,201
They found a donor for my patient.
l've got to go. l'm sorry, guys.

893
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:44,270
-Christina, it was great meeting you.
-Nice to meet you, Greg.

894
01:04:44,374 --> 01:04:46,795
-Jane, it was great meeting you.
-Great meeting you.

895
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,521
So sorry to run off.
l'll make you risotto tomorrow.

896
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,867
lt's fine.

897
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:58,131
-Can l just say, that was so sweet?
-He's great.

898
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:00,753
-He's so sweet.
-Shut up.

899
01:05:00,854 --> 01:05:02,796
He doesn't have any piercings, does he?

900
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,896
l don't know, actually...

901
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:11,308
...because l haven't done that with him yet.

902
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:15,189
-So, you know....
-Honey, you really do like him.

903
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:17,675
l don't want to talk about it, because l'll jinx it.

904
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,515
-l closed on the Mahalock house today.
-Great news for you.

905
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:19,691
You don't need to do a thing.

906
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:23,724
-What did they say about aluminum siding?
-No.

907
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,638
-Really?
-Really.

908
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,577
Be careful with those fat-free chips.
They cause anal leakage.

909
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:33,327
-You cause anal leakage.
-Says so on the bag.

910
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,436
What kind of marketing brainiac
puts ''anal leakage'' on his product?

911
01:06:48,979 --> 01:06:50,768
How can they even sell that crap?

912
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,295
-What time is your flight?
-9:30.

913
01:06:54,899 --> 01:06:57,038
l can't believe you're going to Costa Rica.

914
01:06:57,651 --> 01:07:00,039
Your female problems are over with.

915
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:02,188
-Hope so.
-They are.

916
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:04,430
You know what l hear about Costa Rican women?

917
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:06,540
-For five pesos--
-No, Rog.

918
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:09,742
They take your chimichanga and your pequito....

919
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:11,793
-No, seor.
-Listen to me!

920
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:17,067
All l'm saying is,
make nice with the concierge, okay?

921
01:07:19,346 --> 01:07:21,681
-You all right, Vera?
-Couldn't be better.

922
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,850
-Thank you so much.
-Where do you want it?

923
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:30,311
Put her down right here.

924
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:33,513
Since you're going away,
do you want to be on our mailing list?

925
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,522
Yes, ma'am. l'd love to. Thank you.

926
01:07:38,738 --> 01:07:41,934
l've been trying to get us off
that mailing list since 1982.

927
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:43,376
Relax.

928
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:47,758
This is the hottest chick in this store
and l caught her trying to escape.

929
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,243
Very strange.

930
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:20,743
Sweetie, Christina, what's going on?
What happened?

931
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,996
l came to just eat my cookie
and make a phone call, but....

932
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:29,128
You didn't want to eat the cookies? What?

933
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:31,467
Just read this.

934
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:36,680
''Commandment number nine:
Thou shalt love what's possible.''

935
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,750
Honey, we have gone over this.

936
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:43,880
You did not know the guy was getting married.

937
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:46,471
lt's all right. He wasn't possible.

938
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:49,992
Not that one. The next one. Commandment ten.

939
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,374
-''Thou shalt not fear''?
-Yes. ''Thou shalt not fear.''

940
01:08:54,448 --> 01:08:56,303
What are you talking about, fear?

941
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:59,406
What you did was an incredibly brave thing.

942
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:03,560
You dropped all of your boundaries
and you met this guy halfway.

943
01:09:03,888 --> 01:09:06,222
More than halfway, you went to Somerset.

944
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:09,772
Guys, it was just another game. Come on.

945
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,866
lf he hadn't been getting married,
if he wasn't the groom, what would l've done?

946
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,713
That's right.

947
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:23,150
l would've done the same old thing.
l would have hesitated. l would have...

948
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:29,167
...froze up.
l would have kissed him and then ran off.

949
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:32,654
Give him the wrong phone number.

950
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:37,095
Hook that fish and just throw him right back.

951
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:39,654
Jesus.

952
01:09:44,143 --> 01:09:45,801
l'm stuck in a rut.

953
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:52,838
Big, fat rut.

954
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,060
Guys, l don't want to be that girl anymore.

955
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:00,427
-l know.
-You know?

956
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,663
l know. None of us do.

957
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:08,170
Let's go dancing.

958
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:14,125
So, any chance?

959
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:17,862
Of what? No, don't even bother.
She's on a mission.

960
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,692
-How is it shaking, ladies?
-No, thank you.

961
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:34,663
Your body is banging. Your face is--

962
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:36,588
Neato. Thanks. Neat.

963
01:10:42,318 --> 01:10:44,292
What's going on, hot mama?

964
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:51,206
Bringing it down. Bringing it up now!

965
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:57,769
Here it comes, baby. Feel the monkey.
Work the monkey.

966
01:10:57,901 --> 01:11:00,356
The monkey, the monkey, the monkey!

967
01:11:05,772 --> 01:11:08,642
-You're working that monkey.
-You're a really good dancer.

968
01:11:08,877 --> 01:11:12,739
-You have some original moves.
-Thanks, l've been working on it.

969
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,006
-Have me met before?
-A couple of times.

970
01:11:16,556 --> 01:11:17,571
l'm Donny.

971
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,715
Christina.

972
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,180
This is like Sixteen Candles.

973
01:11:28,108 --> 01:11:29,896
l'd love to take you out sometime.

974
01:11:30,221 --> 01:11:33,516
Really? Well, that's nice. l mean....

975
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,839
Give me your card, l'll call you sometime.

976
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,168
Thank you.

977
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,184
You seem like a really nice person.

978
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:45,638
-Work on the monkey.
-l'll work on the monkey.

979
01:12:13,355 --> 01:12:14,500
Hey, Donny.

980
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:18,144
-Do you have a pen?
-You bet.

981
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:26,276
l'm a jerk and l wanted to apologize,
because l didn't plan on calling you.

982
01:12:26,347 --> 01:12:29,446
l'll give you my number so that you can call me...

983
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:34,596
...because l found out something
that was completely life-changing:

984
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,545
lt's okay to take a chance.

985
01:12:37,642 --> 01:12:41,220
Love is crazy and that's what love is,
it's taking a chance.

986
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:46,630
My girlfriend Courtney and l
went on this crazy ride for a guy.

987
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:51,014
l went across the state, practically,
to find this guy that l don't even know.

988
01:12:51,082 --> 01:12:54,977
l don't even know you, but here l am,
having this conversation with you.

989
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:59,816
And l know that if l just take a chance
with you, maybe, l don't know--

990
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,351
Forget it.

991
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,322
What's a guy got to do to get laid?

992
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:43,779
-Chris?
-Yeah?

993
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:44,994
Honey?

994
01:13:47,912 --> 01:13:48,992
What?

995
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:54,053
My God.

996
01:13:57,289 --> 01:13:58,565
What am l going to do?

997
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,793
l think you can handle this one on your own.

998
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:03,587
lt's all good, girl.

999
01:14:05,896 --> 01:14:08,798
Figure this one out. Figure it out. Okay.

1000
01:14:17,864 --> 01:14:19,326
What are you doing here?

1001
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:23,013
-l came here to apologize to you.
-For what?

1002
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,079
For not telling you l was getting married.

1003
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,966
l should have told you that and l didn't.
l'm sorry.

1004
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:31,967
You're the guy that needs the last fling
before your wedding.

1005
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,047
No. l'm not that guy.

1006
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:39,494
You spilled my drink and l let you buy me a beer.
That was all there was to it.

1007
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:44,194
We had fun, we talked and that was it.

1008
01:14:45,288 --> 01:14:46,236
Right?

1009
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:49,795
Yeah, l guess you're right.

1010
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:52,291
l didn't get married.

1011
01:14:58,471 --> 01:15:01,602
-What do you mean?
-Judy and l, we called it off.

1012
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:09,381
l hope my.... That thing that happened
didn't have anything to do with it.

1013
01:15:09,447 --> 01:15:11,454
No, it had nothing to do with that.

1014
01:15:11,847 --> 01:15:16,549
We realized we were doing the wrong thing.
Two people should be in love.

1015
01:15:17,606 --> 01:15:20,705
But Judy is happy. She's scuba diving in Bali.

1016
01:15:20,774 --> 01:15:24,451
She really liked you, too.
Why were you at my wedding?

1017
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:31,067
lt was just one of those spontaneous things
my girlfriend and l do.

1018
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:33,633
lt was just, really....

1019
01:15:34,886 --> 01:15:36,675
lt just got screwed up.

1020
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,132
l came here tonight because l wanted to see you.

1021
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:47,228
l thought that maybe....

1022
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:50,875
Well, that night that we met...

1023
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:55,845
...l thought there was something,
some feeling l had about us.

1024
01:15:56,965 --> 01:16:01,472
l thought that maybe you might feel that way, too.

1025
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:04,640
ls this a mutual thing?
This is not a mutual thing at all.

1026
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:06,782
This is a very stupid thing. l'm stupid.

1027
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:10,400
l should go.
l really apologize for wasting your time.

1028
01:16:10,469 --> 01:16:13,339
And l'll go jump off the Golden Gate Bridge now.

1029
01:16:13,414 --> 01:16:17,188
Thanks. See you. l'm stupid. That's right.

1030
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:21,792
ln fact, that's exactly what l wanted to do.

1031
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:26,178
Yes. Gosh, it's going so well.

1032
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,245
l'm not going to be afraid.

1033
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:56,312
Peter?

1034
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,624
Shit. Peter, wait!

1035
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:15,392
Shit.

1036
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:32,858
Come on!

1037
01:17:34,723 --> 01:17:36,316
Are you okay?

1038
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:38,171
Yes.

1039
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:42,338
l don't think l handled that too--

1040
01:17:42,403 --> 01:17:45,948
l didn't handle it at all. l'm so sorry.

1041
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,377
l wanted to find you so that l could tell you...

1042
01:17:50,115 --> 01:17:53,825
...that l did come to your wedding
because l wanted to see you again...

1043
01:17:53,922 --> 01:17:57,632
...because the feeling is mutual,
and you better be a really good kisser.

1044
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:12,830
That was weak.

1045
01:18:13,858 --> 01:18:15,102
-Weak?
-Yeah.

1046
01:18:17,282 --> 01:18:19,006
lt's okay. You can try again.

1047
01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:32,023
You were so much better in my dream.

1048
01:18:33,346 --> 01:18:34,687
Hold these.

1049
01:18:38,658 --> 01:18:41,276
-l thought this was mutual.
-Oh, my God.

1050
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:44,161
l'm serious. l'll call you, okay?

1051
01:18:45,505 --> 01:18:47,447
What? Wait!

1052
01:18:47,714 --> 01:18:49,536
Thanks for the flowers. Nice touch.

1053
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:51,990
l'm out of practice! l just woke up!

1054
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:54,813
Unbelievable!

1055
01:19:02,081 --> 01:19:04,502
Christina Walters. Yep. l know her.

1056
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,488
Bitch. Made my life a living hell.

1057
01:19:08,993 --> 01:19:11,841
She tries to pawn me off on her friend.
She calls me a dick.

1058
01:19:11,905 --> 01:19:14,393
She hunts me down like a dog
at my own wedding.

1059
01:19:14,529 --> 01:19:17,212
Then, when l try to apologize, she's like:

1060
01:19:17,473 --> 01:19:21,368
''l don't know you. You're one of hundreds.
l have no feelings for you....''

1061
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:29,147
ls that how l sound?

1062
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,295
The movie is starting. Let's go!

1063
01:20:05,728 --> 01:20:06,840
Fuck Grandma.

1064
01:20:17,055 --> 01:20:18,942
Save yourself a buck.

1065
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:25,398
-A girl that you lick.
-Really?

1066
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,326
-That you lick.
-A girl that l lick?

1067
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,410
Are you all right?

1068
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:38,676
You're watching the credits?

1069
01:20:56,222 --> 01:20:59,189
-Chicks freak on this guy.
-You owe me thirty....

1070
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,619
Copy that.

1071
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,037
ls that what you want?

1072
01:21:23,005 --> 01:21:26,267
l think there's always time for a movie montage.

1073
01:21:36,062 --> 01:21:37,971
l hope you like how sexy l am.

1074
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:49,820
Okay. l'm not going to be afraid.

1075
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:54,456
l'm not.

1076
01:21:56,381 --> 01:22:00,571
lt's a very bad rumor. lt's a rumor. l'm serious.

1077
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:02,101
Crap.

1078
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:10,744
You really got my ass. lt's good.

1079
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:16,497
Cut!

1080
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,108
-l look beautiful.
-You look amazing.

1081
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:29,139
-l look beautiful. Thank you.
-You do. Amazing.

1082
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,589
We can sit here like this all night.

1083
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:40,977
-l bet you miss Grandma.
-Grandma.

1084
01:22:48,828 --> 01:22:51,217
-l'm not bah-jiggity.
-You are so bah-jiggity.

1085
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:06,419
lt's Jesus. Look, it's Jesus.

1086
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:12,472
l guess a blowjob is out of the question?

1087
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:14,928
That is the sweetest thing.

1088
01:23:15,035 --> 01:23:16,213
'Bye!

1089
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:24,372
Well, that was fun.

1090
01:26:47,157 --> 01:26:50,735
-lt's over. Bye-bye, go home.
-You can leave.

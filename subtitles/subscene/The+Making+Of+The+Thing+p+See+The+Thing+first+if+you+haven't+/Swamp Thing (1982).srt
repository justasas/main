1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:25,276
Not long ago, in the unexplored
reaches of an unmapped swamp,

2
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,779
the creative genius of one man

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:35,619
collided with another's evil
dream and a monster was born.

4
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:43,878
Too powerful to be destroyed,
too intelligent to be captured,

5
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,716
this being
still pursues its savage dream.

6
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:22,476
So there's the swamp.
Where's the nearest good restaurant?

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,022
Depends. If you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

8
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:30,526
But if you're a 'gator,
could be right where we land.

9
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,406
Thank your lucky stars
you're comin' in at the end of this.

10
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,650
Holland insisted on building it all out here.
He said this is where the life is.

11
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,487
One of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

12
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,495
What? They sent a woman out here?

13
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,498
-Where are you goin'?
-Couldn't take it anymore.

14
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,251
Well, he lasted longer than most.

15
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,706
Boo.

17
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,623
No!

19
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,927
Weird, isn't it? The local fishermen
say this place is haunted.

20
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,347
I don't know where we are, Toto,
but this sure isn't Kansas.

21
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,099
What?

22
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,767
Nothing.

23
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,532
Used to be a church until
about 50 years ago, then the levee broke.

24
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,786
It's just been us and the deer flies
for the last ten weeks.

25
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,455
Welcome back, sir.
What did Washington say?

26
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,957
That's confidential.

27
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,377
<i>-It's ok, miss. I got it.
-But you can start packin'.</i>

28
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,045
All right.

29
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,719
<i>Where's this go?
Give me a hand over here with this.</i>

30
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,888
What does Holland think
about going back to Washington?

31
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,309
I doubt he's been told. Ritter couldn't
believe me when I gave him the news.

32
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,314
-Do you think Washington's paranoid?
-Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

33
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,734
This is your place.

34
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:56,250
You probably haven't seen half this stuff.
It's all new. This is a laser...

35
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:01,672
laser-induced subsonic field generator.
Gives double readings in the 3200 band.

36
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,424
I got a trick for fixing that.

37
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,011
They send someone who knows what
she's doin' the week they pull us out!

38
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,262
What's he working on?

39
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,930
-Who?
-Holland.

40
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:14,352
This thing is so hush-hush, no one asks.
Something to do with plants.

41
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,271
<i>Where the hell's my man?
I thought he was back.</i>

42
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,273
Hey, Charlie!

43
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,276
The emperor calls. Come on.

44
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,528
Hey, you know there's a...

45
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,453
What's going on here?
Get those crates into the church.

46
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:38,292
You men in the boat! What are you doing?
Get that damn thing outta sight!

47
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,794
Lamebrains!

48
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,047
Charlie, welcome back.
And this is Hank's replacement?

49
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,966
Cable, Harry Ritter,
project field supervisor.

50
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,552
One of your sensors
is reading malfunction.

51
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,555
Not surprising.
they rot in a week in these swamps.

52
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,809
Charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

53
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,729
No. They want him and the substance
in Washington where they can watch him.

54
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,231
Anything wrong?

55
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,735
A rumor. Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

56
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:09,240
-I thought Arcane was dead.
-He is. Who said that Arcane's onto this?

57
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,993
Nobody's taking credit for it.
You know Washington.

58
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,081
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

59
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,917
and the whole project goes to hell,
do you know that?

60
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,585
Yes, sir.

61
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,921
That goes for you, too.

62
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:31,262
Come on. I keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

63
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,849
This admits the three of us,
and the Hollands.

64
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,519
It was programmed for your prints
this morning. Try it.

65
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,867
The stuff I have put up with-alligators,
bugs, snakes, and now rumors.

66
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,205
Charlie, I want to hear everything
about the Arcane business, now.

67
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,793
What about that sensor in sector three?

68
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,463
Get somebody to take you there
and take a look.

69
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,757
Me?

70
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,051
In the swamps?

71
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,900
-Any luck there?
-Wiggle your fingers.

72
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,736
Lose a contact lens?

73
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,822
Funny.

74
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:36,494
Well, don't just stand there.
Give us a hand. Right about in the middle.

75
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,578
Please?

76
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,586
I dropped a Cooper's digger.

77
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,547
Would you look under the rocks, please?

78
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:50,091
Go ahead.

79
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,347
What's a Cooper's digger? A shovel?

80
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,765
Nah,

81
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,185
just Alessandro.

82
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:08,234
He's got a little one-celled animal living
in his fur that makes a terrific host.

83
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,696
Terrific. I'll remember that
the next time I throw a party.

84
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,782
Oh, not bad. Not bad.

85
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,704
-You don't have to be crazy around him...
-But it helps?

86
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,791
Alice Cable, new kid on the block.
You part of Holland's crew?

87
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,210
I'm Linda Holland.

88
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,712
<i>You're Dr. Holland.</i>

89
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:31,757
<i>I'm a Dr. Holland, but not the Dr. Holland,
boy genius and oddball.</i>

90
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,636
That's Alec. He's the brains.
I just cook up what he invents.

91
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,806
Don't believe her.
She's got an IQ like a phone number.

92
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:43,894
I want you to run up a variation on the
formula with the host on Alessandro's fur.

93
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,479
Ok.

94
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,988
Hello. I understand you have a sensor out.
Do you wanna go out and take a look?

95
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,326
Well, I guess I could ask Charlie
to give us an escort.

96
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,830
We could ask your mother
to come along, too. Come on.

97
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,335
The only dangerous thing out there is the
government agents with their popguns.

98
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,254
It's your first day.
I'll take you on a cook's tour.

99
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:15,676
Ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air. He'll be tickled pink.

100
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,636
What do you say?

101
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,939
Oh, man.

102
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,442
You look like a tree.

103
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,527
Sometimes I feel like a tree.

104
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,697
-Like the swamps?
-Hate the swamps. Hate bugs.

105
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,284
-Hate things without legs.
-A neatness freak, huh?

106
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:44,205
-You could eat off my kitchen floor.
-You could eat off the swamps.

107
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,208
Maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.

108
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,044
More than likely,
the swamps will eat off us.

109
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,713
Like, what happened
to the guy I'm replacing?

110
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,302
The 'gator was only following his
natural way. Can't blame a guy for that.

111
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,148
I paid a fortune for these boots.

112
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,069
You'd better keep movin'.
There's quicksand around here.

113
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,321
-Keep your eyes open, too.
-For what?

114
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,158
One of these just might
jump out and do you in.

115
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,911
<i>There's over 100 species
of genus orchids here.</i>

116
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,748
So much beauty in the swamps,
if you open up your eyes to it.

117
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,752
Take a look into your own body,
one of God's most magnificent creations,

118
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,004
and what do you see?

119
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:36,590
Straight lines and deodorant,
chrome and Formica? No, no, no.

120
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:41,429
You see blood and bone, pump and flow,
and a million messy miracles.

121
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,682
Look at the most creative thing
man and woman can do together

122
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,352
and you'll see
something growing, unpredictable,

123
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,771
magical, hot.

124
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:56,277
Save the malarkey for your wife, Holland.

125
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,363
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

126
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,532
It's right over there.

127
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,623
Looks ok to me.

128
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,876
Here, let me help.

129
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,557
Well, it doesn't look ok to me.

131
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,642
-Let's get back.
-All right.

132
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,835
Charlie?

133
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,092
Charlie!

134
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,846
Cable, what the hell is your story?

135
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,516
Anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

136
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,435
<i>You're damn right.
Something suspicious did happen.</i>

137
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,522
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

138
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:19,777
takes a scientist we're supposed
to be guarding for a romp in the bush.

139
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,114
-Hold it. Just cool it.
-You think you're on a picnic?

140
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,784
Wait. It was my idea to take her out there.
She was doin' her job.

141
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,704
-Why do you have to be so worried?
-It's my job to worry.

142
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,874
And if I have my way, you'll be
on the next chopper back to Washington.

143
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,211
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

144
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,048
There's a cut sensor out there.

145
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,384
-Which sector?
-Sector three.

146
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,637
Hank was working on that
when he was bitten by the 'gator.

147
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:51,559
He didn't put it all back together again
before we took him to the hospital.

148
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,401
-"Tickled pink", huh?
-I'm really sorry, Cable.

149
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,490
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

150
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,161
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there? Ronnie?

151
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,665
-No. Why?
-We seem to have lost contact with him.

152
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:27,261
-Linda, are you all right?
-It's ok, it's ok.

154
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,269
The damnedest thing.

155
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:39,607
You know this new batch you had me
cook up with the host from Alessandro?

156
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,695
I knew we were up to something
revolutionary, but this is dynamite.

157
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,030
Watch.

158
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,121
-Incredible.
-Weird, huh?

159
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,624
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

160
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:01,962
You've managed to reinvent nitro. let's
hope this project doesn't end with a bang.

161
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,801
Come on, Charlie, please.
I gotta write this down.

162
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,887
<i>I thought you were
working on a weapons system.</i>

163
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,723
-I knew it wasn't just plants.
-Plants, plants.

164
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,976
The only way I thought my work
would be explosive was socially.

165
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,229
It's never been this volatile before.

166
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:22,483
Linda, prep a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

167
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,570
-And be very careful with it.
-What is it you've been doing here?

168
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,572
Come over here. I'll show you.

169
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,421
You see those little guys?

170
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,424
<i>DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli e. coli.</i>

171
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:51,595
Now, you see that one? Another simple
bacilli. Plant matrix called d complex.

172
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:56,517
Each of these organisms have existed in
the labs for years, but always separately,

173
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,103
since one is animal, the other's vegetable.

174
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,523
This is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

175
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:07,778
See that little guy? Never existed on the
face of the Earth before. That's my baby.

176
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:12,450
A simple vegetable cell with
an unmistakable animal nucleus.

177
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,785
Recombinant DNA?

178
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,787
Hey, that's very good.

179
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:24,712
I am very close to developing a plant with
an animal's aggressive power for survival.

180
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,547
A plant for the 21st century.

181
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,216
You want watermelons
the size of weather balloons

182
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,718
or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick?

183
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,556
Or a tomato that could grow in the desert.
or soybeans that could thrive in biafra.

184
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,392
Or corn that could grow in the USA
in the year 2001,

185
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,229
when there'll be 6.5 billion people
on this planet, all of them hungry.

186
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:46,400
-How you doin' there, Linda?
-It's all set. Vector 3379.

187
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,486
Ok.

188
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:57,161
-It's replicating like mad.
-It certainly is.

189
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,498
Let's try it on something.

190
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,835
Cable, would you bring that flask of water
over here, please?

191
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,421
Thank you.

192
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:12,009
If it would work on plants the way
you want it to, what will it do to people?

193
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,681
-And what if it falls into wrong hands?
-Arcane boogieman mentality, huh?

194
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,850
Ok, now we begin. 2000 water,

195
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,854
one part formula.

196
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,441
2000 water, 6:30 March 20th.

197
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,661
How long before you'll know?

198
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,789
What do you want it to do,
jump out and dance a fandango?

199
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,543
I don't know.
A week maybe, maybe longer.

200
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,463
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

201
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,050
Aren't there some sensors
you could be working on?

202
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:56,554
Oops.

203
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:01,809
Forget it. He's just ridiculously sensitive.
Our dad was the same.

204
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,019
Your dad?

205
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:06,564
You've never heard of Walter Holland
the biophysicist?

206
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,901
Nobel prize. He used to throw
a mean Bunsen burner, I can tell you.

207
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:15,322
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

208
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,909
Perfectionist to the day he died.
Alec's the same.

209
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,021
-Oh, my god.
-What is that?

210
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,607
Cable, I don't believe this.

211
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:54,362
All the places that Linda dropped
the formula, the boards grew.

212
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,866
-Who are you kidding?
-No, I'm not kidding.

213
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,867
Alec...

214
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,621
Linda! Get in here quick!

215
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:07,041
This is fantastic. This is incredible.

216
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,463
Oh...

217
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,549
Alec, the formula?

218
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,968
Ritter. He's got to be told right away.

219
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,972
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realizes we've done it.

220
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,643
Ritter?

221
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,229
Ritter?

222
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,818
-You guys seen Ritter?
-He's in the command shed.

223
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,945
Thanks.

224
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,331
Ritter!

225
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,951
Charlie.

226
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:58,986
Get up!

227
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,823
Hold it!

228
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,993
-I'm holding.
-It's over, lady.

229
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:11,248
-Arcane, right?
-Shut up.

230
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,459
Alec, watch out!

231
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,307
-Very interesting, Dr. Holland.
-On your feet.

232
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,771
-Who are you?
-Interesting.

233
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,441
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like this before.

234
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,991
Have you?

235
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,702
What the hell do you want?

236
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,956
I represent a certain party
that's interested in your formula.

237
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,208
He'd give an arm and a leg for it.

238
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,877
<i>Your arm and leg, if necessary.</i>

239
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,879
Get outta my lab! Get out!

240
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,131
Alec!

241
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,466
What's the hold-up?

242
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,722
He's being difficult.

243
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,725
No, Ritter. Not you.

244
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,061
No, Dr. Holland, not Ritter.

245
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,815
Ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

246
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:29,577
You have heard of but never seen me,
so I will introduce myself.

247
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,996
My name is Arcane.

248
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,583
Linda, come here. Here.

249
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,002
Leave her alone.

250
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:41,088
Thank you.

251
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:46,594
All materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

252
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,179
or she dies.

253
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:52,433
What sort of rejuvenation
will you be able to perform on her then?

254
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,522
-Don't, Alec.
-It's all right.

255
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,203
The actual solution as well.

256
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,546
Linda!

257
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,632
Linda! Linda

258
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:42,566
What is best for you is not
to be born, not to be, to be nothing.

259
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:47,154
But the second best for you
is to die soon. Nietzsche.

260
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,529
-The notebooks.
-I never seen anything like that.

261
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,632
The notebooks, good.

262
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,390
Strip it. No bodies.

263
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,143
No witnesses.

264
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,150
No survivors. No trace of them.

265
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,486
You, come here. Burn the papers.

266
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,072
Burn everything. Come on, get a move on.

267
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:15,743
Somebody help Bruno with the bodies.
I want this place clean by dawn.

268
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,686
-Is that the last of 'em?
-That's it.

269
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,021
Then get the lead out.

270
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:56,617
-A final check, then vacate the premises.
-Right. Take that to the boat.

271
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,955
Hurry it up.

272
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,458
Wait a minute.
I'm finding lots of stuff down here.

273
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,793
What kind of stuff?

274
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,047
A little of this, a little of that.
Come on down and take a look.

275
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:16,053
What you got?

276
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:19,557
-Found some money, a watch, and...
-No, this.

277
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:22,143
Oh, that. I took it off the girl.

278
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:25,813
You can have it. Ain't worth nothin'
compared to the watches.

279
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,649
Get out in front.
We're getting out of here.

280
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,345
Ferret?

281
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,028
Plannin' on goin' somewhere?

282
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:17,198
Come on, let's take a little walk.

283
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,282
Bastard!

284
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:21,952
My, haven't you gotten dirty?
My goodness!

285
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:24,455
Tyrone, come here.

286
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:28,459
I think this lady needs a bath.
Let's take her down to the dock.

287
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:29,960
Where'd she come from?

288
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,462
Help!

289
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,548
Help!

290
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,718
Get the boat ready.

291
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:44,892
Move it. We don't have all day,
and I wanna teach this lady how to swim.

292
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,561
The first lesson's called the dead man's...

293
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,230
Ow!

294
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:53,484
You wanna play rough, huh?

295
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,705
Say hello to your boyfriend, baby.

296
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,464
What the hell was that?

297
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:05,056
Willie! Tyrone! Shoot the damn thing.

298
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:22,490
Get it! Kill it! And her!

299
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,492
You, too!

300
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,913
Back in the swamps.

301
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,259
Willie, go that way.
Tyrone, cover that area.

302
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,626
So long, baby.

304
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,382
Willie?

305
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,054
Flank right.

306
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,791
No, no, no! What are you doin'?

307
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,798
What the hell are you doin', Danny?

308
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,637
Spread out.

309
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,306
Keep your head.

310
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,490
-Where's Danny?
-Where's Willie?

311
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,827
-Maybe Willie's with Tyrone.
-Danny shot Tyrone.

312
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,744
Oh, yeah.

313
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:20,835
-Maybe we should
-Get the hell outta here.

315
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,600
The work with DNA, I expected.

316
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:41,605
But the combining
of plant and animal is astonishing.

317
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:45,359
Astonishing.

318
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:51,699
-You should sleep, sir.
-I can't.

319
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:56,120
It was all so near,
right there in the palm of my hand, and...

320
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,125
But it's lovely not to sleep,

321
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:06,714
knowing that I'll soon
make the substance for myself.

322
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,966
Have some coffee, sir.

323
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,135
Thank you.

324
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:20,144
Holland had great talent.

325
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,314
But talent does only what it can.

326
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:30,655
Genius does what it must.

327
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:34,992
It is master of man, power absolute.

328
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,245
And in your hands, sir, how magnificent.

329
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,999
-How beautiful.
-Yes.

330
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,503
The world will bow, or starve.

331
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,505
Yes.

332
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,092
Yes.

333
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:05,189
Four, five, six.

334
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,694
-How many notebooks were there?
-Six, I think.

335
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,448
But six ends with notes two weeks old.

336
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,118
It's unfinished.

337
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:21,372
There must be another,
a seventh notebook.

338
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,545
Ferret has just radioed, sir.
something's happened.

339
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,380
What?

340
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,298
Something about a...

341
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,719
well, you'd better
speak to him yourself, sir.

342
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:51,402
-What?
-You're not gonna believe this.

344
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,988
Something incredible
came out of the swamps.

345
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,656
What came out of the swamps?

346
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,743
Some kind of animal or something.
It got the men.

347
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,829
We wouldn't be here
if it hadn't gone after the girl.

348
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,166
Girl? You mean you let her get away?

349
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,367
Uh-huh, here comes trouble.

350
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,788
Hi.

351
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,125
You in a plane crash?

352
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,461
Just been out walkin'.

353
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,505
Uh-huh.

354
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,132
You got a phone that works?

355
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,067
<i>Operations.</i>

356
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,237
This is 5-17. Operation Mount Pisba.

357
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,864
Get me my next immediate superior,
and hurry.

358
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,243
<i>Hold on. I'm putting you through to Ritter.</i>

359
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,121
<I>I think he's been neutrali...</i>

360
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:32,503
Yes?

362
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,048
<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.
I have an emergency call for you.</i>

363
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,259
Put the call through.

364
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:42,555
<i>Ritter, this is cable.
We've had a catastrophe out here.</i>

365
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,597
What happened?

366
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,018
<i>There was a hit on the compound.
Holland's dead. The lab's gone.</i>

367
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,688
<i>-I thought they got you, too.
-Uh, no, I was called away.</i>

368
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:55,609
<i>I think you were wrong about Arcane.
They knew what they were looking for.</i>

369
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:59,030
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later. Where are you?

370
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,782
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

371
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:03,367
Right.

372
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:06,620
Oh, uh, did you manage to save anything?

373
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,623
Damn right. I got the last notebook.

374
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:13,461
Very good.
I'll be there before you know it.

375
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:14,712
Turn around.

376
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:42,782
-Doesn't anything work around here?
-Just me.

377
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,579
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.
You gotta punch it.

378
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,088
-Thanks.
-Nothin'. Name's Jude.

379
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,756
Cable.

380
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:15,439
Nice station. Your dad own it?

381
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,027
Look like your ride's got here.

382
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:28,285
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

383
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:38,879
Don't be afraid.

384
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,550
Say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

385
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,721
Is there a gun here?

386
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:50,391
Wwhat kinda place do you think this is?
Course there is.

387
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:58,649
Gun's a museum piece.

388
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:00,067
Stay here.

389
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:04,238
Took the words right outta my mouth.

390
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:09,994
Hey, greaseball!

391
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,495
She's mine.

392
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,416
She's got a gun.

393
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,670
Some gun. It blew up on the first shot.

394
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:36,854
Jam it. Jam it to the floor.

395
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,736
Wait a minute. There she is.

396
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,781
Go, go. Go get her. Go on.

397
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,033
Go on.

398
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,499
Watch the trees.

399
00:40:56,624 --> 00:41:00,044
Go, go. Come on,
She's gainin' ground on you.

400
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:31,993
Faster.

401
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:45,339
Got her in the sights.

402
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,760
-It's back! Stop the jeep!
-Run him down.

403
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,095
Don't stop!

404
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,292
Help!

405
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,310
Shoo.

406
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,816
Go!

407
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,010
It's ok, it's ok. It's just me.

408
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,012
Jude, what are you doing here?

409
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:19,934
You think I'd stay at the station
while they're pumpin' it full of holes?

410
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:23,521
What happened to that thing?

411
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:26,023
It, uh

412
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,776
hit a tree.

413
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:34,490
Must have been one of those hit-and-run
trees. It don't seem to be there now.

414
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,620
Some tree, all right.

415
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:44,875
There's a trapper's cabin nearby. Maybe
we can get you a fresh change of clothes.

416
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:48,295
Swamp's no place to be at night.
Come on.

417
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:06,981
The last patrol is in. Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

418
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:10,568
Some of the men say it's one of them
abdominal snowmen or something.

419
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:15,573
<i>It was like hittin' a tree.
Bullets hurt it, but they don't stop it.</i>

420
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,576
I say we forget this notebook.
It's not worth it.

421
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,162
What are we killin' ourselves for?

422
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,249
Just to find a formula
to some ordinary plant fertilizer?

423
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:31,922
"Ordinary"? Something extraordinary
came out of the experiments already.

424
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:37,303
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of. None.

425
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:52,860
Would you recognize immortality
if it knocked on your door, gentlemen?

426
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,322
Obviously you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

427
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,617
I want this swamp thing,

428
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:01,535
and I want the notebook.

429
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,913
-Now.
-I'll get rid of him.

430
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:09,377
You will not get rid of him.
You will simply get him.

431
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:19,470
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there,

432
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,888
in his veins.

433
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:25,017
But how can we find it?

434
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,729
It's gone into the swamps.

435
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:32,650
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

436
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:33,985
That's right.

437
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:37,989
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

438
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:42,743
<i>It doesn't exactly maintain a low profile.</i>

439
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:17,445
He was right. It is beautiful.

441
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,114
Who was right?

442
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,949
A guy I knew.

443
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,285
He loved these swamps.

444
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:28,122
Can't you call him?
Maybe he could come and get you.

445
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,127
Ain't got nobody you can call, huh?

446
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,965
Thought I had, but when I did
those goons showed up back there

447
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:41,969
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

448
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:46,223
-Didn't pay your bookie or somethin'?
-Or somethin'.

449
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,642
Much farther?

450
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,313
A little ways.

451
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:01,382
-Stay here.
-Don't worry.

452
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,387
-If you hear anyone, you yell.
-Don't worry.

453
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,641
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

454
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:12,893
I can handle myself. Don't worry.

455
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,230
I'm not worried.

456
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,899
Well, I am.

457
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,663
-What happened?
-Just go. Go!

458
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:01,752
We're just gonna do our job and get
this notebook back to Washington.

459
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:03,754
The rest isn't my business.

460
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,680
Local people
say this place is full of ghosts.

461
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:41,936
Well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through. There she is.

462
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:48,192
Who's that?

463
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:53,948
<i>Who's that?</i>

465
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,951
That was that thing. Let's go. Come on.

466
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,796
What the heck's goin' on here?

467
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,468
Cut the engine.

468
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:26,314
Units one and two. Sector four.
on the double. We got him cornered.

469
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,656
Where is he?

470
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,326
<i>What is he?</i>

471
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,496
Shh.

472
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,250
I think I see him.

473
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:57,011
Hit it!

474
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:07,188
Units one and two, where are you?
Get over here on the double.

475
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:10,775
<i>Split up. Go in the back way.
We'll come in straight.</i>

476
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:22,203
There he is. Over there.

477
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,373
Open up on him.

478
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,877
Hang on.
I'm gonna knock him outta there.

479
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,636
Jesus! Unit two.

480
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:42,390
<i>Use the grenades if you have to.
Maybe we can stun him.</i>

481
00:53:57,655 --> 00:53:58,990
I think you got him.

482
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:04,495
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got. Come on.

483
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,096
We've got him now.

484
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:38,362
-Where'd he go?
-I don't know.

485
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:55,629
<i>-Do you see him?
-Yeah, I see him everywhere.</i>

486
00:54:57,882 --> 00:54:59,467
Any sign of him over there?

487
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,804
<i>Nothing. We think maybe he bought
the farm or the vegetable patch.</i>

488
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,156
What the hell is that?

489
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,513
He's smart. That thing is smart.

490
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,686
Very smart, Bruno. Very smart.
This thing has considerable intelligence.

491
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:56,273
He's like a brilliant chess player.
He anticipates every move.

492
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:01,445
A strong adversary
is like a beautiful, dangerous woman.

493
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:04,865
I can't resist, either.
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

494
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,619
-We're going home.
-No, we are not.

495
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,122
Captured our knight.

496
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,625
Exposed his queen.

497
00:56:16,377 --> 00:56:18,629
Our move.

498
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,660
Awfully quiet now.
We'd better get outta here.

499
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:51,996
I've gotta go back and help.

500
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:59,420
You just take the notebook and get
to safety. I'll come back for you later.

501
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,672
Go on, do as I say.

502
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,195
-Cable!
-Shh.

503
00:57:24,362 --> 00:57:30,284
Jude, go and do what I told you.
It's not safe here anymore. You hear?

504
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:31,452
Jude?

505
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,130
No!

506
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:46,193
Oh, shit!

507
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,363
There goes the neighborhood.

508
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:54,952
Wait a minute. You're the dude
who saved us back there, right?

509
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:57,788
You a friend of Cable?

510
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:00,207
Then I got something for you.

511
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,960
She said I ought to put it someplace safe.

512
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,311
-Where's arcane?
-Below.

513
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,314
Tell him we've captured his queen.

514
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:30,071
Walked right into our hands, didn't you? Real smart.

515
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,658
Thanks. I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

516
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,662
What I couldn't do for you.

517
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,500
Tell you what,

518
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:46,253
tell me where the notebook is
and I'll get you outta the swamps.

519
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,091
-Deal?
-I don't mind the swamps.

520
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:53,844
It's the slime that crawls out from
under the rocks that turns my stomach.

521
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,513
Nasty mouth.

522
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,682
But a pretty one.

523
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:03,020
<i>What do you say to that?</i>

524
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:04,605
Not much.

525
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,222
Cable!

526
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:39,390
Cable...

527
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,333
Ferret!

528
01:01:14,592 --> 01:01:16,510
Ferret!

529
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,515
Ferret!

530
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:26,687
-Maybe we should go and check.
-No, we go home now.

531
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,440
-Sir, but...
-Home!

532
01:02:04,976 --> 01:02:07,061
That's very kind.

533
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:15,987
Nice orchid.

534
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:20,908
<i>Family orchidaceae.</i>

535
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,910
<i>Genus orchids.</i>

536
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:27,832
Over 100 species here.

537
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,585
Much beauty in the swamp,

538
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,256
if you only look.

539
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:46,183
Alec?

540
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

541
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:02,950
-It must...
-Hurt?

542
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,039
Does it?

543
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,294
Only when I laugh.

544
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,403
Have I gone crazy?

545
01:03:40,488 --> 01:03:43,824
Isn't this a dream?

546
01:03:43,908 --> 01:03:47,828
That's what I keep asking myself.

547
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:53,834
Everything's a dream

548
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,838
when you're alone.

549
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:04,345
Oh, Alec.

550
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:39,333
Now.

552
01:06:53,264 --> 01:06:54,348
Get the hand down!

553
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:02,940
A man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

554
01:07:14,118 --> 01:07:15,536
Alec.

555
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,122
Alec Holland.

556
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:21,375
You knew, didn't you?

557
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:23,544
You knew we'd be caught.

558
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:29,633
The only way out is through.

559
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:30,087
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

562
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:36,427
We have captured the dragon,
and rescued the damsel in distress.

563
01:09:36,594 --> 01:09:38,929
We regret the loss of our friend Ferret.

564
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:42,683
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

565
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:45,853
Nonetheless we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

566
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:49,440
But to speak the truth, which is essential,

567
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:55,196
regrets are trifles
when one considers the grand design.

568
01:09:55,279 --> 01:10:00,618
And we are here tonight in celebration
of an event of profound significance.

569
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:03,537
The duplication of the Holland formula.

570
01:10:10,378 --> 01:10:14,215
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

571
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:16,467
Dear, dear Bruno.

572
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,888
Who won the notebook
from which we extracted the final secret

573
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:24,058
and topped it by capturing the beast.

574
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:37,989
So I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success.

575
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:42,994
to our conquest of the world. to Bruno.

576
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:45,329
Bruno!

577
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,758
But, sir,

578
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:03,097
have you tried it out on a plant? I mean,
when are we going to see the results?

579
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,765
Tonight.

580
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:09,103
Tonight, dear Bruno. Immediately.
But not on a plant.

581
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:11,856
<i>Have you taken it?</i>

582
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:18,195
No, I have given the privilege
of taking the first dose of our formula

583
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,573
to our guest of honor.

584
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,743
He deserves the privilege thoroughly.

585
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:26,620
It is you, dear Bruno,

586
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:30,624
who will tell us
whether or not the formula works.

587
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:40,301
Bruno, what's the matter with you?

589
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:05,826
-Calm.
-Help me!

590
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:08,079
<i>Help me!</i>

591
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:33,187
Calm.

594
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:01,716
What have you done with Cable?

596
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,719
Holland?

597
01:13:05,136 --> 01:13:06,929
Holland.

598
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,558
You're there.

599
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,561
Brain intact.

600
01:13:13,728 --> 01:13:16,355
All your abilities, everything.

601
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,984
Plus the power, the physical strength.

602
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,822
Bring him in.

603
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:28,868
Some friend you are.

604
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:33,039
Sorry, Bruno. It's every man for himself,
and god against all.

605
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,551
Why doesn't Bruno have your strength?

606
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:53,434
We followed the notebooks religiously.
There can be no margin for error.

607
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:57,563
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

608
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:00,650
Because he never had it.

609
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,860
No riddles, please.

610
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:07,031
You will tell me,

611
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,699
or you'll pay.

612
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,869
And through a very dear agent.

613
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:15,748
Bring her in.

614
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,464
The explanation, or her.

615
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,716
Alec, don't.

616
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,222
Which?

617
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:34,725
You don't understand.

618
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,686
There's nothing hidden.

619
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:38,813
No secrets.

620
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,316
The formula works in so simple a way.

621
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:47,738
<i>What Bruno took was what changed me.</i>

622
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:52,284
It only amplifies your essence.

623
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:59,542
It simply makes you more
of what you already are.

624
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:05,172
Bruno's essence
was stupidity and timidity.

625
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:14,849
The formula simply extended, amplified
this to ridiculous forms and proportions.

626
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:22,106
He shrank.
He shrank to what he actually was.

627
01:15:24,442 --> 01:15:29,447
But if the essence is, let us say, genius,

628
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:35,286
then this genius shall be monumental
in body as well as in spirit.

629
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:37,455
Is that what you're saying?

630
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,406
Cable.

631
01:16:13,324 --> 01:16:15,117
Alec.

632
01:18:01,182 --> 01:18:06,937
Not to be the phenomenon,
but the thing in itself.

633
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:12,985
Eternal, absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power,

634
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:17,031
physical and spiritual.

635
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:21,535
To be the world,

636
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:23,412
and own it.

637
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,082
Yes, sir?

638
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,458
Darling,

639
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:32,296
tell Karen
to bring me a glass of brandy, hmm?

640
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:04,620
Reach for it.

641
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,082
You thrive on the light. Reach for it.

642
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:18,592
Alec.

643
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:38,863
Come. Come.

645
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:50,708
What's the matter with you?
Go. Go. Leave me.

647
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:09,787
Your arm.

649
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:28,699
Listen.

651
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:30,951
He's taken the formula.

652
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:47,885
Please! There is a way.

653
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:53,724
I can't reach it, but you twist it
to the right and then to the left.

654
01:22:56,602 --> 01:23:00,272
Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.

655
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,320
Come on, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

656
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:26,924
You'll have to trust me here,
if you wanna survive.

658
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:28,759
If you don't

659
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:29,844
tell us.

660
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:34,265
This is the well of the estate, fed by
a spring from the bottom of the swamp.

661
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:37,768
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

662
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:39,520
Go!

663
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:41,689
Watch your step.

664
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:46,444
Have a nice trip.

665
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,531
<i>See you at the ball.</i>

666
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:42,166
Alec.

667
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:16,367
Alec!

668
01:27:00,972 --> 01:27:02,723
Behind you.

669
01:28:31,395 --> 01:28:34,065
I don't understand.

670
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:36,233
It's healed.

671
01:28:44,408 --> 01:28:46,327
What is it?

672
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:51,666
It's over.

673
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:57,922
Alec, let me go with you.

674
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:00,675
You can start your work again.

675
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:09,433
With these?

676
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:13,354
I'll be your hands.

677
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:16,524
Please?

678
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:21,404
You need to heal.
You need to tell our story.

679
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:24,365
I'll see you soon.

680
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:30,621
Until then...

681
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:34,709
I'll always be with you.

682
01:29:45,845 --> 01:29:46,887
Alec?

683
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:53,811
Cable!

684
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:57,565
Jude.

685
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:05,114
You ok?

686
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:07,658
Mm-hmm.

687
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:13,581
He told me to come and get you.

688
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:17,918
He'll be back, though, right?

1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,070
Right! Now!

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,244
This is Mr. Bennett, and he's going to be
taking the boys for football.

3
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:24,202
Mr. Bennett foolishly wants to be a teacher.

4
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:27,680
-Look at the fucking shell suit, man.
-Fucking wanker.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,855
-I don't fucking believe it.
-Fucking yeah.

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,551
What you fucking looking at?

7
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:38,726
Er, less fucking and more attention please.

8
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:42,900
Something you might have said
to your boyfriend that, Gina.

9
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:47,162
Right, girls, onto the other pitch with me.
Come on.

10
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:53,815
-You, boy.  Why aren't you playing?
-Forgot me kit.

11
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,685
Don't make him play, sir,
he's shit.

12
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,208
Balls, Mr. Bennett!

13
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,512
Right.
Look, I want you joining in, yeah?

14
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:07,687
-You ain't playing, Gangel.
-Fuck off, McBride.

15
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:14,906
Ste! Come on.

16
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,733
Oi! What's his name?

17
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,994
Hugh, sir.  Hugh Janus.

18
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:28,343
Hugh Janus (Huge Anus),
get back here now!

19
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:30,430
Hugh Janus!

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,605
Janus, are you deaf?

21
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,971
Oright, Sandra?

22
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:31,146
Slag!

23
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:55,367
What happened?

24
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,498
-School burnt down, did it?
-Yeah.

25
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:02,107
Oh, what was it this time then?
IRA bomb?

26
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:05,238
-Fundamentalist Muslim Pyromaniacs.
-Oh funny that,

27
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:08,891
looked all right when I walked past it.
-Yeah. Funny that.

28
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,239
Look, you're not too old to be taken over my knee,
young man, d'you hear me?

29
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,631
-The whole o'bloody Thamesmead can hear you.
-Yeah, well..

30
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,631
-You have gotta start doing your games!!
-Why?

31
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,241
Coz you have, that's why!
-Who says?   -I says!

32
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,197
-I hate football!
-You never used to!

33
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:24,763
Well, I do now!

34
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:28,068
You know what I'm gonna do now, duntcha?

35
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:32,243
Juggle with 'em?

36
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:50,072
You know what they'll do, don't you!

37
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,985
They'll put you into care.  They'll say,

38
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:56,464
'She's an unfit mother, bang 'im
into one o'them homes, coz I mean,

39
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,247
she can't even get him to do his PE.'
That's what they'll do.

40
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:03,117
She's throwing away everything I was saving
for me kids. Books, toys.

41
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:06,857
-I don't want kids.
-Kids are cunts.

42
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:10,205
-Anyone been calling you names?
-Like what?

43
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:13,119
-I dunno.  Stumpy?
-No.

44
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,815
-I told you it's stop.
-I know.

45
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,468
-I told you you'd grow.  You never take the
blindest bit o'notice of me, do you?

46
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,990
-I do!
-Oh yeah?

47
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,773
Well, how comes every Wednesday afternoon
without fail you're standing there?

48
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,948
-I've told you.
-Oh, have you!!

49
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:32,644
Call the village band out.
Bid me goodbye.

50
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:35,340
-What you doing?
-Singing.

51
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,515
-What?
-I'm just a girl who can't say no!!

52
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,906
Heard of Mama Cass?

53
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,907
No, sing it.

54
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,081
-What?
-Go on.

55
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:50,256
-No way.
-I won't laugh.

56
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:55,778
Call the village band out.
Bid me goodbye.

57
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:01,910
Everyone stand outside and cry.

58
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:07,780
Never thought so many
Thought me so dear.

59
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,825
I'd be happy any place but here.

60
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:19,043
One way ticket take me anywhere,

61
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,087
Northbound, southbound,
I don't even care.

62
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,741
I know the grass is greener there.

63
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,220
Well, keep going!

64
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,395
-Might persuade him to get back to school!
-Libs!

65
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,308
-It's not natural, isn't it?
-What ain't?

66
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,917
For a girl her age to be into Mama Cass.

67
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,787
She's got a really beautiful voice!

68
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,222
And whassamatter with Madonna?!

69
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,396
She's a slag!

70
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:56,571
Hypocrite!

71
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:00,224
-Oright, Ste?!
-Ste!! Oright?

72
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:02,311
Yous two been bunking off together,
have you?

73
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:04,181
Not together, no.

74
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:08,138
-Oright, Mrs. Gangel?
-Well, it's nice to see someone can stay at school for the full day.

75
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:11,052
-We had football today.
-It's the wrong season for football, innit?

76
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,487
-Student teacher.
-Ah, is that the problem?

77
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,922
-No.
-Well, what is then?!

78
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,923
-I best get in.
-Ah, Ste...

79
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,488
I'm doing the tea.

80
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,923
Stick it on, then come back out here.

81
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:25,228
Bubble and squeak, Leah.
You can't leave bubble and squeak.

82
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,011
Gotta watch it , like a hawk.

83
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,185
Don't that make you fart,
bubble and squeak?

84
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,055
Only if you've got a fat arse.

85
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,012
There was a phone-in this morning on Richard and Judy
about delinquent children.

86
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,577
I shoulda rung in.

87
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,969
-I'm going in.
-See ya, Ste.

88
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,578
-Well, whose fault is it then? Eh?
-The system.

89
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:45,753
I am a victim of the education...thingamabob.

90
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:47,449
Wasteland.

91
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,232
You're a victim of your own big mouth more like.

92
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,493
Leah, love, get in here and
peel some taters for tea, will ya?

93
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:55,755
Kiss my arse.

94
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:59,538
You! Indoors,
she's a bad influence.

95
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,408
She's a bad influence!

96
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:04,104
-Right, you don't peel no taters
you don't get no tea.

97
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:05,582
Jamie!

98
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:08,191
Rainbow's gone anyway.

99
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,366
-That'll be the phone.
-Well, it wouldn't be the bloody Hoover bag, would it!

100
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,064
Yeah, I know.  I know Miss Chauhan.
But see, Miss Chauhan...

101
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,586
He's got a really funny tummy.
You know?

102
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:31,761
I mean...he really wanted to do football today
but he got taken short, see.

103
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:37,066
And when he got to the boy's loos,
it was all locked up...inexplicably.

104
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,893
So he had a little accident,
you know.

105
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,980
Yeah.  Yeah. I couldn't agree
with you more, Miss Chauhan.

106
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,155
I mean, when I was at school I was reserve captain
of the Under Sixteens' netball team,

107
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:56,025
so I can appreciate, yeah, the like,
value of exercise and sport.

108
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,244
I mean, I would hate you to think
this was any reflection on me myself.

109
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:34,293
I'm going to work.

110
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:37,728
There's a cheese salad in the fridge,
and the one with the beetroot's for Tony.

111
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,511
I don't need a babysitter.

112
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:43,468
I know what you need.

113
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,033
Shooting!

114
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,034
-I heard that!
-Yeah, well..

115
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:50,774
you could hear a zit burst in Australia,
you, couldn't you?

116
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:53,470
If you shot me you'd have to
go to prison and live off gruel.

117
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,253
Don't tempt me.

118
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:59,427
I'll be checking your homework
when I get in, so be warned.

119
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,172
Oi, Rose!

120
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,607

00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,564

Yeah, and I'm tryina make chips!

125

She's locked herself in her bloody room, ant she?

126
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,956
Leah!!!

127
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,783
-I'm on tablets, you know.
-Can I get in and try?

128
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:48,218
I give up.

129
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:50,305
Leah! Leah!

130
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,871
This is my idol!

131
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,958
Leah, love, spare a thought for
all the nice people who live round here!

132
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,133
Some of them don't like Mama Cass,
you know!

133
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,568
Well, they should!

134
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,046
Leah, please!

135
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:05,221
Oh I suppose I should be glad
it's not techno...acidic...

136
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:09,178
housey housey...pop...trash.

137
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,961
Leah!!!

138
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,526
What's all the bloody noise?

139
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,614
It's her, she can't control her kids!

140
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,962
I've only got the one, you know!

141
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,223
Just as bloody well!

142
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,832
Rose, turn that bleeding racket down,
will ya?

143
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:23,267
D'you think I'm enjoying this?

144
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,442
Leah!

145
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,530
Oi!  Mush!

146
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,704
Is that Trevor?

147
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:51,315
You only had to ask, Trevor.
You know I'd do anything for you.

148
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:55,272
Or..to you.

149
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:58,577
I wouldn't touch it with his.

150
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:02,752
See you later!

151
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:16,928
Thank you, Trevor.

152
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,713
Trevor!  Trevor!

153
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,541
Your mum told me straight, you know.

154
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,716
Problems.  Been there.

155
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:52,499
Walking cross the park, game going on,
my heart, you know, races.

156
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,239
Scared. Jamie.

157
00:12:56,239 --> 00:13:00,414
Scared of the ball coming,
you know, near me.

158
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,414
Hey, we can fight this together.

159
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:08,850
Fancy a knockabout?

160
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,024
No, me neither.  But some time, yeah?

161
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:32,332
It looks like fried shite.

162
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,072
Trevor, make us a sandwich.

163
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:40,246
-But...
-Trevor!

164
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:44,856
Fuckin'ell!

165
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:18,296
I can't eat all that.

166
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,954
Where d'you meet my mum?

167
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,520
Planet earth.

168
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,998
Where?

169
00:14:56,998 --> 00:15:01,173
Oh, you know, out and about,
here and there.

170
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:04,173
What's a place?

171
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:08,348
It's somewhere where, you know,
shit happens.

172
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:12,827
Yeah, but where?

173
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:17,001
Gateways.

174
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,306
She turn you on?

175
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:20,219
Sure.

176
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,220
She's thirty-five!

177
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,394
What's age? Age is just...

178
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,917
a number.  You know?

179
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,526
Mum said you was a painter.

180
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:36,700
I know why she chose you,
she needs the lounge done.

181
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,266
Only had it painted last  year.

182
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:44,441
Like that, my mum,
goes off things fast.

183
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:50,572
She might go off you.  Won't be laughing then, will you?

184
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:58,617
Is that a spliff?

185
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,313
Give us some.

186
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,749
-Hey.
-What?

187
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:13,924
Your mum's gonna be all right.

188
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:48,669
Dry Martini and lemonade please.

189
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,626
Pint o'Pilsner.

190
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:54,583
Lou?  Ho served her?

191
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,757
I dunno.

192
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,063
You.  Out! You're underage.

193
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,628
I'm only drinking Coke!

194
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,324
You'll be drinking blood
when I slap your face, now move it.

195
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,412
Oh, you're so hard.

196
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,630
Was that a threat?

197
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,239
Yeah, and here's another..

198
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,848
Get out before I call your childminder.

199
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:22,326
Oh, come on, Slasher.  I can't be arsed.

200
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:25,544
Slasher?  What d'you slash?
Crêpe paper?

201
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,849
He's incontinent!

202
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,024
Sandra!!

203
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,111
Louise taking care of you, Mr. Barr?

204
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:38,286
Of course..A word.

205
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,157
Jamie, how old are you?

206
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:54,027
Old enough.  How old are you?

207
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:58,202
Twenty-seven.
Not old enough to be your dad. Right?

208
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:00,507
What?

209
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,594
Sure...

210
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,638
What?

211
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:08,812
It's just..shit, innit?

212
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,117
What?

213
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:15,292
The whole..concept.  Yeah.

214
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:21,554
Anyway, I think we should just like..
move towards getting away from all that.

215
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:27,816
Right?

216
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:16,824
Please, Trevor, I'm sorry.

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,174
You'll breeze it, princess.  Unless
you really balls it up, the job's yours.

218
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:37,349
What sort of questions will they ask?

219
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:41,002
You're interviewing for a new barmaid.
You got three birds up for one job.

220
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:45,176
You say, 'If you find a fiver on the floor
at the end of the night, what d'you do with it?'

221
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,960
First bird goes, 'I'd hang onto it then ask
round the next night to see if anyone's lost it.'

222
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,786
Second bird goes, 'I'd out it in the till.'

223
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:56,961
Third bird goes, I'd pocket it.
Finders keepers.'

224
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:01,309
Who d'you give the job to?

225
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,484
The one with the biggest tits!

226
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:26,357
I'd bet me own flat..

227
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,183
be down Stringfellows every night.

228
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:33,315
I'd get a big drug problem.

229
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:37,185
I'd get me own miniature poodle..

230
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:41,142
and I'd get a make-over. You could do
all that if you had your own pub.

231
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,012
I haven't even had the interview yet.

232
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,838
One of these days I'm going to
dripping in money, I am.

233
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:50,013
-Right, this is me.  See you tomorrow, babes.
-See you, love!

234
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:09,103
Ste?!

235
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:26,802
Ste..

236
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:33,281
I'm not going back there.

237
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:40,152
I know, love.

238
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,373
Tony, make him a sandwich.

239
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,721
What?

240
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,243
Tony!

241
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,678
What's it to be?
Pastrami and fettuccine on rye?

242
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:13,853
Tony.
Just make him a sandwich please.

243
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,550
You'll have to top and tail with Jamie,
I'm afraid.

244
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:35,117
Ronnie!! Trevor?!
It's me Sandra!!

245
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,684
Your little Steven's round
at our place tonight.

246
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:45,206
I've every mind to report you Ronnie?
Are you listening to me?

247
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,728
This is Sandra here and I'm not happy!

248
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:50,207
Fuck off, you meddling cunt!!

249
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:54,381
This has got to stop!

250
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:00,121
What are you reading then?

251
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:01,991
Er, it's me mum's.

252
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,905
Oh, yeah?
I've seen that in the shop.

253
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:08,036
-Hello!
-Hello!

254
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:13,080
-What bit you reading?
-It's about Sally from Coronation Street.

255
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,211
What, the blonde one?

256
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:15,863
Yeah.
Says her real name's Sally an' all.

257
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:20,038
-What, in real life as well as on the telly?
-Yeah, I hate that name.

258
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,691
D'you always wear glasses when you read?

259
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,214
-Supposed to.
-You don't in school.

260
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,996
-Hardly fetching, is it?
-Nah, looks all right.

261
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:33,910
Yeah?

262
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,084
Yeah, I'm telling ya.

263
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:41,128
-How's your sandwich?
-Cheese and salad.  Bang-on food.

264
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,216
-Good for your spots, that.
-That's right. Good for your spots an' all.

265
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,955
-You haven't got any spots.
-Yours are clearing up.

266
00:23:46,955 --> 00:23:51,130
Cheers.

267
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,783
D'you fancy that Sally?

268
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:58,218
Not really.
Do you?

269
00:23:58,218 --> 00:24:02,045
Haven't given it much thought really.

270
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,610
D'you fancy her next door?

271
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,828
-Fancy Leah?
-She fancies you.

272
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,393
- Don't!
-I'm only saying.

273
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:11,568
Jamie!

274
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,397
You goin' sleep?

275
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:31,571
-Yeah, I'm knackered.
-I'll turn the light off.

276
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,229
Ste?

277
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,708
Mm?

278
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,274
You oright?

279
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,578
Yeah.

280
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,753
Right.

281
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:23,058
Ste?

282
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:24,754
What?

283
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:27,233
Night.

284
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:31,407
Night, Jamie.

285
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,239
The second applicant says,
'I'd put it in the till.'

286
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:07,370
The third applicant says,
'I'd keep it for myself.'

287
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,588
'Finders keepers.'

288
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:12,588
To whom would you offer the job?

289
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:16,763
Well, it's obvious, innit?
The bird with the biggest tits.

290
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:28,982
Though seriously I'd have to say
I'd be more keen on the third applicant.

291
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:33,983
At least I'd know
where I stood with her.

292
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,853
You have children, Mrs. Gangel?

293
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:40,027
That's an easy one.  Yeah, a son.
Jamie.  He's ever so nice.

294
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:47,202
I really fucked that up,
didn't I?

295
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:51,377
You'll hear soon, princess.

296
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,645
Yo!

297
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:39,342
Pervert.

298
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:43,516
Sorry?

299
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:47,778
I think you'll find the word pervert
is a serious no-no.

300
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:52,996
Anyone who goes out with that ole slapper
has to be a pervert.

301
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,301
Come again?

302
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,258
Your bird.

303
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,649
Sandra?

304
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,867
She talks to me like
I got cunt written on my forehead.

305
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:06,042
You shouldn't use words like bird.

306
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:14,782
You wanna watch yourself.
Sandra's got a reputation.

307
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:20,827
I'm saying nothing.

308
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:24,697
Anyone got a match?

309
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:26,349
Yeah, my arse your face.

310
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,480
Your arse ain't that nice, love.

311
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,916
Oh, grow up.

312
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:37,090
Oi! Linda Lusardi!
Get in here and cover yourself up!

313
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:15,357
Get us me ball back!

314
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:20,576
Get it yourself!

315
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,369
You okay today, Ste?

316
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,631
Yeah

317
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:34,805
I went to have a look at a new school today.
There's only twenty kids in the whole place.

318
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:39,502
There'll be twenty-two if you go.
You and Mama Cass.

319
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:41,372
-Is it residential?
-No.

320
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,416
Shame.
Coulda given you an 'and packing.

321
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,720
Coulda packed that fat bitch
and her music an'all.

322
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,286
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead!

323
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:51,504
Ere, shame how she died.

324
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:54,722
-How did she die?
-Choking on a sandwich!

325
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,026
Now you know why I tell you
not to gobble your chips down.

326
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,896
-Wasn't she heavily into drugs?
-Was she?

327
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,810
Well, if you're that fat,
drugs are a happy release.

328
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,680
She mighta been happy being fat!!

329
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,854
If she was so happy being fat, Jamie,
why did she die choking on a  sandwich?  Eh?

330
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:11,116
Why wasn't it a walloping
great fry-up or somin'?

331
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,377
It mighta been a
bacon and egg sandwich.

332
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:16,725
No, it's coming to me now,

333
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:20,465
it was beef or chicken,
somin' definitely low in cholesterol.

334
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:23,292
-Hark at her, the fountain of all knowledge.
-Yeah, well

335
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,640
When you can keep up with the questions on
Bob's Full House you can get back to me, all right?

336
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,466
-I'm more of a Mastermind man.
-Liar!

337
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:33,598
Anyone see University Challenge
last week?

338
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:36,946
Me neither.

339
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:41,121
Tony, crack me open another one.

340
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,904
I fancy somin' wet dribbling down the back o'me gullet.
Whaddya say?

341
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:52,818
I say ditto, right.

342
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:56,558
You can say whatever you want, love.
Better in than out, d'you know what I mean?

343
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,384
-Oh, shut up!
-Oi! Manners!

344
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,689
-Me mother never taught me none.
-He makes me die, he does.

345
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,907
That is the intention.

346
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,690
Oh!  I bet you don't speak like that
to your ole man, eh, Ste?

347
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,691
I don't speak.  Full stop.

348
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,691
Oh, no offence, Ste.
D'you know what I mean?

349
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:14,300
-Mum!
-I gotta get in.

350
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,518
-You do that, Ste.
-Going boxing with me dad later.

351
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:21,693
What, can't enough of it, eh, Ste?

352
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:27,215
Nah. Spectating.

353
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:31,390
Weren't so funny when that bloke o'yours
beat you up, was it?

354
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:42,305
Oh, you're so clever,
aren't you?

355
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,609
Well, just remember, you,
I give you them brains, so think on.

356
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,305
I always thought
you'd had a lobotomy.

357
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,784
-What did he say?
-Explain it to her, Tony!

358
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,959
-Lobotomy?  It's when you split your...
-Yes!I know what it means, Tony!

359
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:58,786
I work all the hours God sends
just to keep you in insults.

360
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,177
If this was my pub
I'd have you barred.

361
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:04,830
Well, go on then.  Bar me, kick me out.
You wouldn't dare!

362
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,613
Oh, look at you.
Butter wouldn't melt.

363
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,570
But that's all right, Jamie.
I've got your number.

364
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,875
You got my number?
Well, I've got yours, Sandra.

365
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,658
So why don't you try and be
a bit more like a mother to me?

366
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:16,223
Oh, pull that one on me.

367
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:19,354
I'm a terrible mother
who don't know her arse from her elbow.

368
00:33:19,354 --> 00:33:21,615
I never has a mother so
what do I know about bringing up kids?

369
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,181
I'm not surprised she abandoned you!

370
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:27,356
You skinny little bastard.

371
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:01,666
Am I like my dad?

372
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:05,840
No, you're like me.

373
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:11,058
How am I weird?

374
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,015
Give it a rest, Jamie.
Christ.

375
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:16,494
You said it.

376
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:20,451
You're all right.  Okay?

377
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:24,626
So you got me for a mother,
but who said life was easy?

378
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:29,627
You are.
You're all right.

379
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,676
D'you wanna come the boxing?

380
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,155
Shut up.

381
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:11,329
-Got a spare ticket.
-Leave me alone.

382
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:17,983
-You all right?
-Apparently.

383
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:03,251
They think I'm a piece of shit.

384
00:36:42,649 --> 00:36:45,040
Jamie?

385
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,867
D'you wanna watch The Sound o'Music?

386
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:52,042
-It's on Sky, Jamie!
-We're goin' asleep!

387
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:56,390
OK.
Sorry, lads.

388
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:11,523
It's me mum's.
Body Shop.

389
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:16,741
Peppermint foot lotion.
Soothes your feet.

390
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:23,090
Lie down and I'll rub it into your back.
If you want.

391
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:07,097
Cold, innit?

392
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:11,272
Yeah.

393
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,448
I'm gonna work at the sports center.

394
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:27,318
Yeah?

395
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:31,493
Do me shifts in the fitness pool,
do me shifts in the leisure pool.

396
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:33,667
I know I can do it.

397
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,494
You're a good swimmer.

398
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:40,668
You're on your own when you're swimming.

399
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:55,801
I'm gonna stink of mint.

400
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,976
-Peppermint.
-Peppermint.

401
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:10,586
Have you ever..kissed anyone?
And stuck your tongue in?

402
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,370
Looking like this?

403
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,762
You ain't ugly.

404
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:23,849
They've made me ugly.

405
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:28,024
I don't think you're ugly.

406
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,243
Turn over, I'll do your front.

407
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:44,809
I can't.

408
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:48,940
I'm..I'm too sore. I'd make too much noise
and then your mum'd come in.

409
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:53,115
Jamie?  Sorry, love.
-Who played the baroness?

410
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:55,637
-Eleanor Parker.
-That's it!

411
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:59,812
I wanna show off to Tony.
Sorry, lads. Won't happen again.

412
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,204
-Turn the light off.
-No.

413
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:09,379
-Please.
-I don't wanna.

414
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:23,772
Can I come up that end with you?

415
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:25,642
-No.
-Please.

416
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:29,817
You stay where you are.

417
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,735
-Satisfied?
-Mm.  Night.

418
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:26,565
D'you think I'm queer?

419
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:30,740
Don't matter what I think.

420
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:44,699
Can I touch you?

421
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:50,308
I'm a bit sore.

422
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:55,222
Yeah.

423
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:52,633
-Great kid!
-Fuck off, I'm minding her for my cousin!

424
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,720
Motherhood suits you!

425
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,242
Yeah, well, at least if I did get pregnant
I wouldn't get rid of it like...

426
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,852
some slappers I could mention.

427
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:05,026
Yeah, well, you're with the
black hole o'Thamesmead love, not me.

428
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:19,343
-Where you going?
-Out with me mates.

429
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:21,865
Jamie, you haven't got any mates.

430
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:26,040
-I'm going to a party.  I won't be late.
-I know.

431
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:12,960
Knocked around for you a few times.
Thought you might come round.

432
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,396
It's hot.  Bloody heat wave, Jamie,
and you expect me to be indoors?

433
00:46:16,396 --> 00:46:19,527
No, it's just, you know,
just a bit weird.

434
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,701
I was out.  All right?
What's weird about that?

435
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:24,093
-Been worried about you.
-Don't be.

436
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:28,267
-Well, I was.
-Well, don't be!

437
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,703
Nothing's happened, yeah?
I'm all right. I'm pucker.

438
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:33,485
Everything, everything's pucker.

439
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:36,399
-You're black and blue.
-Give a rest, Jamie.

440
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:38,617
Oh, things getting better then, are they?
Daddy laid off the fist work?

441
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:42,270
-Or haven't you burned the tea lately?
-I said leave it out!

442
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,053
-You're scared.
-I ain't scared o'nothing.

443
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:47,966
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

444
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:50,706
Last week, right..
I went to Woolwich.

445
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:54,880
Coming out of this shop and there's this geezer in the gutter,
pissed out of his skull.  Lying there.

446
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:59,577
And everyone was walking past him.
I had to step over him.

447
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:03,099
And it was my old man.

448
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:06,447
Got me to thinking on the bus.
Why be scared of a bloke who's dead to the world?

449
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:08,404
When he knocks ten different types o'shite
outta ya.

450
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:10,622
He's an embarrassment.
He's nothing more, he's nothing less.

451
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:14,797
-Why be scared o'that?
-Scared o'being called queer?

452
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,189
Are you?

453
00:47:20,189 --> 00:47:24,363
Maybe.

454
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,712
Maybe not.

455
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,408
-And are you?
-Queer?

456
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:32,930
Gay?

457
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,452
I'm very happy.

458
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:40,627
I'm happy when I'm with you.

459
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:43,758
There, said it now.
Go on, piss yourself.

460
00:47:43,758 --> 00:47:44,802
No.

461
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:46,150
Why not?
Don't you think it's funny?

462
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,193
I don't wanna.

463
00:47:47,193 --> 00:47:48,889
I think it's hilarious.

464
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:53,064
Well, why aren't you laughing then?

465
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,805
D'you wanna come round tonight?

466
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:07,545
-Say somin'.
-I Can't.

467
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:11,719
Well, say no then.

468
00:48:20,895 --> 00:48:25,069
Look. Let's get a drink, eh?

469
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:39,245
Scrub me back, Tony.

470
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:43,507
Tony?

471
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:50,595
Tony, what's the matter?

472
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:58,727
Tony?

473
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:03,119
It's just..something Leah said.

474
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:04,771
Leah?

475
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:07,598
Right.  I'll look away.
Yous lot keep talking.

476
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:10,598
-Then as a surprise, hit me over the head with the tongs.
-What?

477
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:12,990
-It's an experiment.
-Man, I'm wired.

478
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,034
I don't understand this,
d'you want me to hit you hard?

479
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:20,122
Yeah.
Ah here Ste, you do it, you're stronger than her.

480
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,513
-No!
-I can fuckin' do it!!

481
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:26,688
Come on.  Talk.

482
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:32,819
-I said talk!
-Is anybody else wired?

483
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:37,820
'Ere. Read this!

484
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:42,299
Mama Cass wasn't allowed to join the group because
Phillips didn't think her range was good enough for his songs.

485
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:47,083
But one day when Cass was decorating at home,
a lead pipe struck her on the head

486
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:50,649
-and when she recovered from the resultant concussion...
-Say it..

487
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:56,997
Lo and behold her voice had changed.

488
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,694
You twisted little bitch.

489
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,912
-How dare you say all those things to my fella?
-La-ah!

490
00:50:04,912 --> 00:50:08,043
I lost that baby,
you venomous little cow!

491
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:11,000
You could never turn Tony's mind against me,
Leah, d'you hear me?

492
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,826
Coz he sees you for the interfering
little slapper that you are.

493
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:17,566
-I wanted it to change.
-Yeah, well, some things never change.

494
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:18,697
I wanted it to change!

495
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:22,871
A leopard never changes it spots and
a slapper never changes her knickers.

496
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:28,698
-Be told.
-Man, I'm tripping.

497
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:29,655
Come on, Tony.

498
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:33,830
-Fancy a drink, babe?
-Have a wank, Big Bollocks!

499
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,613
Is that your mum, Gangel?
No wonder you're fuckin' nuts!

500
00:50:38,613 --> 00:50:40,918
You shouldn't have said that
to Tony.

501
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:43,918
-Don't you start.
-Should I call an ambulance?

502
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:48,093
Call a vet, have it put down.

503
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:49,745
Hey Ste!
You got any of them Es left?

504
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,659
-No!
-Please, Steven!

505
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:54,355
-No way!
-Come on, Jay, let's go..

506
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:58,007
Give us an E.
Or I'll spread it round where you slept last week.

507
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:00,312
What?

508
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:02,791
-Dunno what you're talking about.
-He slept on the couch.

509
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:06,357
Not what I heard. Top to tail,
your mum said, very nice.

510
00:51:06,357 --> 00:51:08,314
Take no notice, Ste.

511
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:10,618
-What would your dad say?
-Piss off, Leah!

512
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:12,184
-What would..your Trevor say?

513
00:51:12,184 --> 00:51:13,619
-Leah!
-Try it!

514
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,098
-I don't like hitting girls!
-Oh, hit me then.  Go on.  Hit me.

515
00:51:17,098 --> 00:51:21,272
-You stupid queer!
-Ste, come on.

516
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:31,056
Oi! Trevor already knows!

517
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:37,318
You know what them flats are like,
walls paper-thin!

518
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:40,449
Why d'you think he's been twatting
the face offa you, eh? He knows!

519
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:42,015
There's nothing to know!

520
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,972
-Top to tail?
-You know fuck all!

521
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:45,841
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, really.

522
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:50,016
But I know this much, I've been sticking up
for you. For the pair of you.

523
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:54,626
Told him I knew you'd slept on the couch,
told him I'd been in and seen.

524
00:51:56,191 --> 00:52:00,018
I goes, 'You shouldn't say things like that
about your own brother, they're just mates.'

525
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:01,801
Nothing happened.

526
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:04,105
-When was the last time your Trevor hit you?
-What's it to you?

527
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,888
-I bet it was Thursday.
-So?

528
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:10,063
You see, that's when I told him.
That's when I lied.

529
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:15,586
-Give her an E.
-Nah, it's all right.

530
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:19,760
I'm not after sympathy.

531
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:24,109
-We going then
-Are you fucking stupid or what?!

532
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:25,979
-Ste...
-Get your hands off of me!

533
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:30,153
-Ste!
-Get your fucking queer hands off of me!

534
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:58,201
-Oright?
-Oright.

535
00:52:58,201 --> 00:53:00,941
-What you doing?
-Oh not a lot.

536
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:03,724
Claire's mum's got some vodka
back at their house, aint she, Claire?

537
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:06,029
-Yeah, half a bottle.
-We're going back there now.

538
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:09,160
Claire's mum works at the all-night garage.
Don't she, Claire?

539
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,030
Yeah.  Her name's Mary.

540
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,943
D'you fancy some vodka, Ste?

541
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,813
Oh, not really.

542
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:20,335
-Well then.  See ya.
-See ya.

543
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:24,466
Come on, Claire.

544
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:31,902
I suppose a shag's outs the question then?!

545
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:05,865
-I'm going now.
-All right, love.

546
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:10,039
Oi!

547
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,476
-What's his problem?
-Oh, he's in love, that's all.

548
00:54:20,476 --> 00:54:22,650
No!

549
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,825
-Yeah, I'll see ya!
-See ya!  Wouldn't want to be ya!

550
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:36,739
How d'you fancy going to Greenwich?  The Park.
Legs astride the Meridian, as they say.

551
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:41,001
I gotta sort out the
week's rota for work.

552
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:43,827
You're addicted to that pub,
addict!

553
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,741
Don't knock it,
there's money to be made in booze.

554
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,046
Is that all you want outta life?

555
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:53,220
All I want is enough money to buy
a decent pair o'shoes that don't let in the rain.

556
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:56,743
-I can get you shoes.
-No, Tony, it's all right.

557
00:54:56,743 --> 00:55:00,917
-I can make you shoes.
-Tony!

558
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:05,222
Right.
I'll do some hoovering or whatever.

559
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:09,049
-But I thought you said you wanted to go to the park!
-No problem.

560
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:11,441
-Yo, Ste!
-Oright?

561
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,485
'Ere, Ste.
Any beans to spill?

562
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:18,355
A little bird told me you're in love.

563
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:19,703
What?

564
00:55:19,703 --> 00:55:22,399
Four-letter word love!

565
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,791
Oh, don't look so worried,
Jamie told me all about it.

566
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,704
She's jealous,
twenty years younger, could've been her.

567
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:31,879
-Come on, what's she like?
-Well, what's her name then?

568
00:55:32,314 --> 00:55:36,488
-No!
-Oh, short for Nolene? Very Home and Away.

569
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:40,880
It's about time too, you  deserve a bit o'luck,
coz you're all right, you are.

570
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:46,186
'Ere, buy Nolene a present with this.

571
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:50,056
-Get her some flowers.
-Sandra, I can't take your money.

572
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:54,187
Oh, I had a good night for tips last night,
go on.

573
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,188
It's for his bird.

574
00:56:03,188 --> 00:56:07,363
Do you have to use words like that?
It really disempowers you.

575
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:26,105
Nolene busy tonight, was she?

576
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:46,761
Got you this.

577
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,589
My, what a pretty hat.
It's the prettiest hat I ever did see, Master Steven.

578
00:57:03,242 --> 00:57:07,416
Does this mean we're engaged?

579
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:15,200
What?

580
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:55,337
Tony.

581
00:57:56,511 --> 00:58:00,686
Sort me out.

582
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:17,993
It just don't feel right.  Here.
Your mum and Tony on the other side o'that door.

583
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:22,255
My ole man and Trevor next door.

584
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:26,125
I got an aunty in Gravesend, thought
we could go there one night coz she's deaf.

585
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:30,300
But that don't feel right either.

586
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:07,306
You cannot transmit the HIV virus
via frottage.

587
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:12,394
-What's frottage?
-Yoghurt.  It's French.

588
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:17,916
Dear Brian,
I am twenty-three, black, and gay.

589
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:22,091
I am happy being with a man, but get a horrible feeling that
people are going to talk about me behind my back,

590
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:25,004
and not accept me as I am.

591
00:59:25,004 --> 00:59:29,179
Also, my family don't know.
Unhappy, north London.

592
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:33,354
Get over that river, mate.
I'll make you happy!

593
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,267
Find page ninety-two.

594
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:42,442
It's the bottom right-hand corner.

595
00:59:43,355 --> 00:59:47,530
It's a pub.
One-eighty bus goes right to it.

596
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,705
So?

597
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:57,358
Look at that.
Isn't that beautiful?

598
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:59,749
You'd never get it through the front door.

599
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:03,402
Yeah, well, you never know when you're gonna be
living somewhere else do you?

600
01:00:03,402 --> 01:00:05,272
That is a work of art.

601
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,664
Claude Monet couldna done better.

602
01:00:07,664 --> 01:00:10,273
Get a life.

603
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,186
D'you know who Claude Monet is?

604
01:00:13,186 --> 01:00:16,317
Jamie, don't make me out to be thick.

605
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:20,492
You just remember I won a year's supply of
toilet freshener for making up that poem.

606
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,014
That took brains and artistry,
that did.

607
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,754
Can you imagine it though?

608
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:35,929
Me and you with our feet up
on a cold winter's night?

609
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:40,930
-On that.
-Sandra!

610
01:00:41,843 --> 01:00:43,626
Who was he then?

611
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:47,801
He painted the Sixteenth Chapel.

612
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:51,975
-And I haven't finished with you yet.
-Miss Chauhan.

613
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:56,150
-See ya!
-Have a cool time, kid!

614
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:00,324
You rung to talk about
my little git of a son?

615
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:38,157
You seen Jamie?!

616
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:01,615
I love you.  You're marvelous.
Well, Petra, I hope your leg gets better.

617
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:05,790
She still thinks she's in Baby Jane.

618
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,356
Fancy wheeling me round the back, mate?

619
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:13,530
Excuse me, what's going on here?
Petra, dear?

620
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:20,705
Bit young for you, isn't she dear?
Looks like she's just out of Pampers.

621
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:23,923
Shut up, you.
What's your name, petal?

622
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:27,576
-Jamie.
-That's lovely.

623
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:31,751
Oh, Jamie, you make me feel like
I just wanna get my breast out to you.

624
01:04:33,012 --> 01:04:37,186
I feel like chicken tonight!

625
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:42,492
So, Jamie, I think I'll have two of you,

626
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,927
and ten of your mate! Hello.

627
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:50,102
Well, I've got my work cut out.
I'll see you after the break.  Trar.

628
01:04:54,276 --> 01:04:57,103
Oh, don't you wish
your leg was better, Petra.

629
01:04:57,103 --> 01:05:01,277
See you later!
Mothercare, here I come!

630
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:31,553
-Oright, Leah?
-Leah?  Who's Leah?

631
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:45,121
Had a nice night?

632
01:06:45,121 --> 01:06:49,295
Yeah.

633
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:53,122
-Got pictures?
-Yeah.

634
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:56,905
-What, with Ste?
-Yeah.

635
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:59,297
This is no time for lying, Jamie!

636
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:02,732
It's not a lie!

637
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:05,863
You went the Gloucester,
didn't you?

638
01:07:05,863 --> 01:07:08,255
Look at me!

639
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:10,125
Only went for a drink.

640
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,690
That's where gay people go.

641
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,864
It's not just gay people go,
other people go.

642
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,952
Oh, people like you?

643
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:18,778
Yeah.

644
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:21,692
-Miss Chauhan rang me today.
-That old bag?

645
01:07:21,692 --> 01:07:24,518
-You never told me you kept getting hit!
-Everyone gets hit!

646
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:26,606
Oh..

647
01:07:26,606 --> 01:07:30,780
and does everyone get called a
queer bent bastard and all then, do they?

648
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:40,999
-You're pissed.
-No I'm not.

649
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:44,304
You're pissed from a bloody gay bar.

650
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:48,392
-How d'you know it's gay anyway?
-Because it's got a bloody great pink neon arse outside of it.

651
01:07:48,392 --> 01:07:51,088
You been spying on me?

652
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:52,784
No. Someone at work saw you go in.

653
01:07:52,784 --> 01:07:56,959
Well, it don't mean I'm gay.
They wanna mind their own business.

654
01:07:57,132 --> 01:07:59,872
-That's what I said.
-Well, what you going on at me for then?

655
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:04,047
Because sometimes, Jamie, I can put
two and two together and make bloody four.

656
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:07,786
-I'm not bloody stupid, you know.
-I went for a drink.  Big deal.

657
01:08:07,786 --> 01:08:10,091
-Everyone in my class goes drinking.
-Yeah

658
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:12,570
But they don't all go the bloody
Gloucester though, do they?

659
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:16,223
-Some of 'em take drugs, at least I'm not doing that.
-No, I bloody hope you're not!

660
01:08:16,223 --> 01:08:19,571
Ah, well, thanks a lot. Thanks a bundle.
Go back to bed.

661
01:08:19,571 --> 01:08:23,746
-I can't sleep, Jamie.
-Well, don't take it out on me.

662
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:27,181
-Will you just talk to me, Jamie?
-I'm knackered.

663
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:31,356
Jamie. Please.
Just talk to me.

664
01:08:32,095 --> 01:08:33,747
What about?

665
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:37,922
I'm your mother.

666
01:08:45,097 --> 01:08:49,054
Some things are just hard to say.

667
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:53,229
I know. I know that.

668
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:57,316
You think I'm too young.
You think it's just a phase.

669
01:08:57,316 --> 01:09:01,491
You think I'm gonna catch AIDS
and...and everything.

670
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,275
You know a lot about me, duntcha?

671
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:19,494
Don't cry.

672
01:09:23,147 --> 01:09:27,321
It's oright.

673
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:47,759
I'm not gonna put you out in the morning
like an empty bottle.

674
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:07,371
There was me goina bed of a night worried
coz you had to share a bed with Ste.

675
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:12,372
And all the time you were...
you were doing a seventy minus one.

676
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:25,505
I like the lad, Jamie.
But he hasn't seen any life.

677
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:30,201
-He's good to me.
-Is he?

678
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:34,376
Yeah.

679
01:10:38,942 --> 01:10:41,899
-What have you done now?
-Nothing.

680
01:10:41,899 --> 01:10:44,377
Then why's she so upset?

681
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:48,117
Coz I'm a queer!  A bender!  A pufter!  A nobshiner!

682
01:10:48,117 --> 01:10:50,205
Coz I'm a queer!  A bender!  A pufter!  A nobshiner!
Brown hatter! Shirtflaplifter!

683
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:53,857
I...I get the picture.

684
01:10:53,857 --> 01:10:56,379
Leave me alone.

685
01:10:56,379 --> 01:11:00,554
-And she knows this?
-No, I thought I'd tell you first.

686
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:06,164
This is...it's...

687
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:12,513
It's cool.

688
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:18,253
Good night, kidder.

689
01:12:09,565 --> 01:12:13,305
He was...

690
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:17,480
He was the most beautiful baby
in Bermondsey.

691
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:23,829
I used to push him round,
in a frilly hat,

692
01:12:23,829 --> 01:12:28,003
in a big blue pram called
'Queen of the Road'.

693
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:32,178
None of that's changed.

694
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:40,614
-You're fighting it, hon.
-Fighting?

695
01:12:40,614 --> 01:12:44,615
I've been fighting all my life.

696
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,311
Kids picking on him. I was there.

697
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:51,355
Council saying bullocks to benefit.
I was there.

698
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:55,138
When I had three pee in my purse and an empty fridge,
I went robbing for that boy.

699
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:59,313
So don't talk to me about fighting.

700
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:03,487
You?  What have you ever had to
fight for in your life?

701
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,837
Thank you.
Thank you to all members of the Academy.

702
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:17,142
This award means so much to me.

703
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:21,099
I've never won anything
in my life before.

704
01:13:21,099 --> 01:13:25,274
I'd like to thank my manager and my band.
But most of all...

705
01:13:25,578 --> 01:13:29,013
-I'd like to thank one very special person.
-What the...

706
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:32,449
The woman from whom all energy flows.

707
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:35,884
This award is as much hers as mine.

708
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:40,059
The woman who gives me so much...
inspiration.

709
01:13:40,798 --> 01:13:43,625
-Let's hear it for her...Mama San!
-Leah.

710
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:46,408
-People say to me, they say...
-Leah, are you drunk?

711
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:49,973
-'Where d'you get your energy from?'
-Leah...it's two o'clock in the morning.

712
01:13:49,973 --> 01:13:52,148
-And I say, "Hey...
-Has she taken something?

713
01:13:52,148 --> 01:13:54,235
-Mama San.'
-Is your mother in?

714
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:58,410
Mama San, get on down, honey.
Your vibes are shooting through me now.

715
01:13:58,627 --> 01:14:02,802
-Is she working nights?
-Don't ever let the light leave you, Mama San.

716
01:14:03,715 --> 01:14:07,672
Rose! Leah, get your keys out.
Hurry up.

717
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:09,890
Have you taken like a trip, you know?

718
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:14,064
-Jamie!  Leah, let me have your keys please.
-Don't shout at her.

719
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:17,500
-You're giving me bad vibes, Mama.
-She's on something.

720
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,804
Jamie!!

721
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:23,936
-You're an old man, and I don't like old men.
-That's cool, it's no problem.

722
01:14:24,892 --> 01:14:27,936
Well, it is a problem actually, Tony,
don't pander to her

723
01:14:27,936 --> 01:14:30,197
-What's going on?
-Rose?!

724
01:14:30,197 --> 01:14:34,372
I saw a video about Woodstock once.

725
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:39,068
Leah, get in here and
turn your bloody music down!

726
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:41,243
-Oh my God! Tony!
-Leah, what the...

727
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:44,069
-Bloody hell, Leah!
-Tony, get her down! Tony!

728
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:48,244
Leah.  Leah, have you taken a trip,
you know?

729
01:14:49,505 --> 01:14:50,853
-Get down, you silly cow.
-Sandra!!

730
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,462
'Ere, body language, Tony!

731
01:14:53,462 --> 01:14:56,593
-Oi!! You!! Pack it in, will ya!

732
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:59,289
-There's no need for that y'arl hewer!!
-Oh, Jamie, help us!

733
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:02,029
-Betty, it's them again!
-I can see that.

734
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:05,551
Right?

735
01:15:05,551 --> 01:15:09,726
-How am I supposed to sleep with that row going on?
-It's all right, babes, you're safe.

736
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:13,378
-Oh, I'll be glad to get off this bloody estate.
-What?

737
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:17,553
-I've been offered a job
if you must know.

738
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:22,771
Temporary licensee in a pub in Rotherhithe.
Nice little flat above it.

739
01:15:23,076 --> 01:15:25,163
Thanks for telling me.

740
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:28,903
Snap!

741
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:31,121
-Leah?!
-Oh, leave the silly cow.

742
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:32,990
We can't just...

743
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:37,165
Tony! Tony!

744
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:43,905
Right, Jamie indoors.

745
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:47,254
Ste, she knows.

746
01:15:47,254 --> 01:15:49,254
-Me mum knows.
-Oh why d'you have to go and grass?

747
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:51,646
-I never!
-Well, how comes she knows?

748
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:55,820
Because she never came down
with the last shower.

749
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:06,039
Jamie, get 'im a hanky.
There's a box of autumnal shades by me bed.

750
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:27,304
Leah!!

751
01:16:27,304 --> 01:16:31,478
Mama Cass!!

752
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:40,436
I don't believe in secrets.

753
01:16:40,436 --> 01:16:44,394
I like people to be
straight up and honest.

754
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:46,568
But I'm not fool.

755
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:50,438
D'you think I want these flats infamous for child murder?
No. So I won't be telling your dad.

756
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,525
He'd kill me.

757
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,613
-Yeah, I just said that.
-No, he would!

758
01:16:54,613 --> 01:16:57,439
Yeah, I think we've established that
already actually, Ste!

759
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:01,614
-They all would!  All of them!
-I'll bloody kill you in a minute if you don't stop sniveling and shut up!

760
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:13,920
You're a good lad.
And that's what counts.

761
01:17:15,877 --> 01:17:19,008
And...somewhere..

762
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:23,183
-you'll find people that won't wanna kill you.
-No I won't.

763
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:26,314
-Well, you've found the Gloucester.
-I hate it.

764
01:17:26,314 --> 01:17:30,488
-Well, somewhere else then, shut up.
-There aint nowhere else.

765
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:37,576
There is actually, Ste.

766
01:17:37,576 --> 01:17:41,012
There's an island in the Mediterranean
called Lesbian,

767
01:17:41,012 --> 01:17:45,186
and all its inhabitants are dykes.
So, I think you got your eye wiped there.

768
01:17:49,448 --> 01:17:53,622
Now wipe 'em properly.

769
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,234
-Fuck me.
-No, we'll have none of that here.

770
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,105
I'm going to bed.

771
01:18:18,105 --> 01:18:20,844
Five minutes.

772
01:18:20,844 --> 01:18:25,019
Right, Sandra.  Night, Sandra. Cheers, Sandra.

773
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:29,585
Yeah, that's me name, Ste,
don't wear it out, eh?

774
01:20:16,168 --> 01:20:20,299
-I wished I was the one that was going away.
-Nothing ever happens round here.

775
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:24,821
I gets up in the morning,
bake me face in half a ton o'slap,

776
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:28,561
tong me hair with yesterday's lacquer.
And that's it.

777
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:31,909
It's the same every bleeding day.

778
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:34,605
There's fuck all to look forward to.

779
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:38,780
-What 'bout your new school?
-Fell through.

780
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,607
-D'you wanna come to the Gloucester?
-Do what?

781
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:43,042
Gay pub.

782
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,738
-Don't know any gay blokes.
-Yes you do.

783
01:20:45,738 --> 01:20:49,912
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

784
01:20:50,652 --> 01:20:53,391
-There'd be plenty o'men.
-Yeah.

785
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:57,522
And they all dance backwards
and never get married.

786
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:02,871
See, I told you.

787
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:04,610
You're going Woolwich, intya?

788
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,698

01:21:06,698 --> 01:21:10,872
-Pub crawl then Stars Nightclub.
-You'll pull dressed like that.

790
01:21:13,699 --> 01:21:17,874
Why don't you come down
to the Gloucester with us?

791
01:21:20,874 --> 01:21:24,657
-Ring the other girls and tell 'em you'll meet 'em later.
-Jamie!

792
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:28,832
You don't know how to enjoy yourselves,
do you?

793
01:21:29,658 --> 01:21:33,833
There's a male stripper on tonight as well.

794
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:42,269
-Louise.
-Yeah?

795
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:46,443
I will never have grandchildren.

796
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:50,835
Ah.

797
01:21:55,488 --> 01:21:58,619
-Don't suppose you've got any jobs in your new pub?
-No.

798
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:02,794
But if I ever do turn it into a brothel,
I'll get back to you, okay?

799
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:06,360
Well...gotta get in.
Get ready.

-The Gloucester?
-Yeah.  I intend to find meself a nice dyke tonight.

802
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:20,101
Coz I'm telling you,
I'm through with men.

803
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:33,582
-Well, if I had a camera now.
-What?

804
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:37,104
-Well, I'd take your picture.
-Tony.  What are you doing?

805
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:41,279
-Can't keep away from you, babes.
-I told you I was going out with the girls from work.

806
01:22:41,496 --> 01:22:45,149
-Thought I could tag along.
-It's a girls' night out, you'll only be bored.

807
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:48,149
-I want to celebrate too.
-Yeah, I know, but I told you.

808

I'll mind.

810
01:22:54,194 --> 01:22:58,368
How about one little kiss to send me on my way.
Something to think of till tomorrow.

811
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:01,934
Stop it.

812
01:23:01,934 --> 01:23:06,109
Well, I'll ring you.

813

-Look, when's your next night off?

You'll be seduced by a lesbian, Leah.
Why don't you come the bingo with me?

But don't you see, Mum?

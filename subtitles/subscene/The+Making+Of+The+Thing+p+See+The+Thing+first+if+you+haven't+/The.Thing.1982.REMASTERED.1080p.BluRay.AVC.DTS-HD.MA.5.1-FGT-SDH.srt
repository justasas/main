[ Blair ]: You see,
what we're talking about here

196
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,930
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,

197
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,982
and it imitates 'em perfectly.

198
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,516
When this Thing attacked our
dogs it tried to digest 'em,

199

absorb them,

200
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,488
and in the process shape
its own cells to imitate them.

201
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:36,032
This, for instance... That's not dog.

202
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,290
It's imitation.

203
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,995
We got to it before
it had time to finish.

204
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,253

205
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,712

207
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,307
Easy, easy.

- Clark.
- Yeah?

209
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:15,112
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

210
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,164
Strange? No.

211
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,081
What was the dog
doin' in the rec room?

212
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,041
I don't know.

213
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,959
He was just wandering
around camp all day.

214
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:32,424
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

215
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,093
Right.

216
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,892
How long were you alone with that dog?

217
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:42,767
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

218
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,363
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

219
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,777
- I don't know.
- What?

220
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,031
I don't know. It's probably nothin'.

221
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,620
It's nothin' at all.

00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,670
How much more of this crap is there?

223
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,052
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

224
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,297
We can't learn anything from this.

225
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:20,755
Guess not.

226
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,822
[ Garry ]: Where'd they
take these shots?

227
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,112
Seems like they were
spendin' a lot of their time

228
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,822
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

229
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,235
[ Garry ]: What's that?

230
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:45,329
[ MacReady ]: It looks like
somethin' buried under the ice.

231
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,422
[ Norris ]: And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

232
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,383
Whatever it was it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

233
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,813
Here. This is it.

234
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,902
The place where they were
spendin' most of their time.

235
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,438
Pretty nasty out, Mac.
Thirty-five knots.

236
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,359
Screw it.
I'm gonna go up anyway.

237
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,930
Half a mile due east.

238
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:23,235
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

239
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:27,414
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

240
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,288
from way down around
here for a long time.

241
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:35,076
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried
in is 100,000 years old, at least.

242
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,590
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

[ sighs ]

00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,628

and it ends up freezing in the ice.

247
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:23,667
I just cannot believe any
of this voodoo bullshit.

248
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,012

Right, Mac?

251
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,846
Do you believe any of this
voodoo bullshit, Blair?

They practically own South America.

254
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,529
I mean, they taught the
Incas everything they know.

255
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,368
Come on, now, MacReady.

256
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,460
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

257
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,826
Yes, Garry, they dig it up.
They cart it back.

258
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,384
It gets thawed out, wakes up,

259
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,495

From now on I want my
kitchen clean, germfree.

Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

All right.
Put that on and watch them.

694
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:52,326
Now I'll show you what I already know.

[ sizzles ]

696
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:58,865
It's a crock of shit.

697
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,090
Let's try the doc and Clark.

698
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,100
[ sizzles ]

699
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,733

[ sizzles ]

701
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:33,581
Then Clark was human, huh?

702
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,790
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

703
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,790
Palmer now.

704
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:48,089
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

705
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:50,128
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

706
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:53,052
You were the only one
that could've got to that blood.

707
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:55,393
We'll do you last.

708
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,098
[ screeches ]

709
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,101
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

- [ all yelling ]
- What is it?

Get me outta here!

Come on, hurry up!

He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

I know you gentlemen
have been through a lot,

737

but when you find the time,

738
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,190
I'd rather not spend the rest of this
winter tied to this fucking couch!

[ MacReady ]: Childs.

01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,667
We're goin' out to
give Blair the test.

742
01:26:54,878 --> 01:26:56,498
If he tries to make it back here

743
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:59,344
and we're not with him... burn him.

744
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:21,402
[ Nauls ]: Mac, the door's open!

745
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:37,297
How'd he get out?

746
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,883
The door was bolted from the outside.

01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:33,805
[ Nauls ]: Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got somethin' for ya!

750
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,620
[ MacReady ]: Blair's been
busy out here all by himself.

751
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,843
- What is it?
- Something he's been making.

752
01:29:00,837 --> 01:29:03,167
It's a ship of some kind.

753
01:29:04,424 --> 01:29:06,724
He stole the parts
from the helicopter.

754
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,546
The smart S.O.B. put it
together piece by piece.

755
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,020
Where was he tryin' to go?

756
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:16,599
Any place but here.

01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:58,193
[ Nauls ]: Hey, you guys, come here.
Come here.

758
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:08,742
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

759
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:11,278
- What's he doin' outside?
- I don't know.

01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:24,502
Got a flare?

761
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:29,090
He got back inside
and blew the generator.

762
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:34,972
In six hours it'll be
a hundred below in here.

763
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:37,022
Well, that's suicide!

764
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,515
Not for that Thing.

765
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:43,307
It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way outta here.

766
01:30:43,523 --> 01:30:46,573
It just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it.

767
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:51,573
What can we do? What can we do?

768
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:55,832
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that Thing freeze again.

769
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:01,615
Maybe we'll just warm things
up a little around here.

770
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:08,209
We're not gettin' outta here alive.

771
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,472
But neither is that Thing.

place right down into the ice.

Garry, plant yours
in the old storage room.

Not the only one.

Where were you, Childs?

If we've got any surprises
for each other...

I don't think we're in much
shape to do anything about it.

Well... what do we do?

Why don't we just...

811
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,159

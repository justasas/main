00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:48,846
Wake up.

2
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,472
Wake up,
wake up, wake up.

3
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,245
Up ya wake, up ya wake,
up ya wake.

4
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,514
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy.

5
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,986
Your voice of choice.

6
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,184
The world's only 12-hour
strong man on the air,

7
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:03,319
Here on We-Love radio, 108 FM.

8
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,592
The last on your dial,
but first in your hearts,

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,758
and that's the truth, Ruth.

10
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:10,426
Here I am.
Am I here?

00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:12,561
Ya know it. It ya know.

12
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,731
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy

13
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,810

14
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,378

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,004

16
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,743
and that's the truth, Ruth.

17
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,618
From the heart of Bed-Stuy,

18
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,018
you're listening to We-Love radio.

19
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,819
Doing the ying and the yang,
the hip and the hop,

20
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,587
the stupid fresh thing,
the flippity-flop.

21
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,754
Awoo!

22
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,761
I have today's forecast for you.

23
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:44,598
Hot! Sss!

24
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:48,266
The color for today is black.

25
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,534
That's right, black.

26
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,839
So absorb these rays
and save that heat for winter.

27
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,812
So wear that black
and be involved.

28
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:58,816
Also today's temperature
is rising over 100 degrees.

29
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:00,783
<i>So that's a Jheri-curl alert.</i>

30
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,445
<i>That's right, Jheri-curl alert.</i>

31
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,921
<i>If you have one, stay inside,</i>

32
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,958
<i>or you'll have
a permanent plastic helmet.</i>

33
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:10,829
<i>All right, we're going to
say hello to Mister and Missus,</i>

34
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,363
<i>that's Mister and Missus.</i>

35
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,330
<i>Happy birthday to Big Red</i>

36
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,868
<i>and Miss Annie Mae, 100 today.</i>

37
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,766
<i>Stay out of this heat,</i>

38
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,771
<i>and you might live that long.</i>

39
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,101
<i>There's a water shortage,</i>

40
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,642
<i>so keep those showers
to one minute.</i>

41
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,008
<i>Two, if you're with a friend.</i>

42
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,080
<i>Get on out there.</i>

43
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,342
Damn! Whoo!

44
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,974
It is hot!

45
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,483
<i>Get that pink slip.</i>

46
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,213
<i>So get up, get out!</i>

47
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,084
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

48
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,556
<i>We don't want to see
anybody lose their job</i>

49
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,719
<i>'cause nobody
got no money as it is.</i>

50
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,562
<i>All right. Now we're
going to talk about it.</i>

51
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,725
<i>We're going
to rock 'n'roll...</i>

52
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,133
Good m-m-morning.

53
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,570
M- M-My name is Smiley.

54
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:59,168
This is M-M-M-M-Malcolm...

55
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,745
X.

56
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:06,615
And this is
M- M-M-M-Martin K-K-King.

57
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,686
Now,

58
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:11,314
th-they are d-d-dead...

59
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,228
but w-we still
h- h-have to f-f-f-fight

60
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:25,361
a- against ap-apartheid.

61
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:31,738
10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 100.

62
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:34,404
20, 40, 60, shit!

63
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:39,213
80... 300.

64
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:44,255
20, 40, 60, 80...
Wait, that's 300.

65
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:50,193
300, 350, 450...
cash dollar bills.

66
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,348
Mookie. Why are you always
bothering me when I'm sleeping...

67
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,078
Wake up, wake up.

68
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,120
Stop breathing
down my neck.

69
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:18,087
Why should I wake up?

70
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,090
It's going to be hot, Jade.

71
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:23,525
Saturday's the only day
I get to sleep late.

72
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,153
Damn.

73
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,028
Stop, Mookie.
That's not funny.

74
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,502
Leave me alone
when I'm sleeping.

75
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,073
You don't love
Brother Mookie anymore?

76
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,402
I loves you, Jade.

77
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,910
I'll get a lock
and keep your ass out of here.

78
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:44,108
Why don't you go to work, man,
and leave me alone?

79
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,116
Later, got to get paid.

80
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:47,617
Yeah, brush your teeth.

81
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,244
I brushed my teeth.

82
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,686
Your breath stinks.

83
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,087
It's your upper lip.

84
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:55,092
What's up, Sal?
How you doin' there, boy?

85
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:59,290
Man, I got to get me
a Cadillac like that.

86
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,798
I'm getting a car
just like that.

87
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,632
Oh, it's hot.

88
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:12,039
Sonny, how's the vegetables, huh?

89
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,442
Good morning, Sal. Vito. Pino.

90
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:17,072
Pop, you talk to that
air-condition guy?

91
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,083
I been calling him all week.

92
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,677
He won't come around
unless he has a police escort.

93
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,355
Pino, get a broom
and sweep up front.

94
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,024
Vito, get a broom
and sweep up front.

95
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:32,995
Huh?

96
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:33,997
Sweep up the front.

97
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,067
What?

98
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,261
Get a broom
and sweep out front!

99
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,807
See? Every time
you tell Pino what to do,

100
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,467
he tells me what to do.

101
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,875
He's brain-dead, Pop, for years.

102
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,810
Both of you, shut up.

103
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:49,812
Tell Pino!

104
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,780
Am I talking to myself?

105
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,011
I didn't want to come anyway.

106
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,985
I hate this friggin' place.

107
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:59,148
I detest it like a sickness.

108
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:03,092
You, you detest this place
like a sickness?

109
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:05,129
That's like really hate, you know?

110
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,493
That's hate.

111
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,964
I didn't say that.

112
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,432
Oh, you didn't say that?

113
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,003
I just heard it.
Am I going crazy?

114
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,072
Did I just hear that, Vito?

115
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,301
I mean, do you think
you can do better?

116
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,275
No, I didn't think so.

117
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,278
This is a respectable business,

118
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,211
and there's nothing wrong with that.

119
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:27,843
I mean, if there's
something wrong with that, tell me.

120
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:29,716
Is there something
wrong with that?

121
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,084
There's nothing wrong. OK?

122
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,091
Do me a favor.
Get a broom and sweep up.

123
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,057
Tell Vito.

124
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,721
What are you... deaf?
Pop asked you.

125
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,798
I'm going to kill somebody today.

126
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,536
I can't believe it.

127
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,571
What?

128
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:48,935
That you like her.

129
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,508
I don't like her.

130
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,667
Yeah?

131
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,250
Hell no.

132
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:05,921
Hey.

133
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:06,923
Hi, Mookie.

134
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:08,254
Mookie.

135
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,384
Hey, Mook.

136
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,364
Mornin', Mookie.

137
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,799
Morning, Miss Mother Sister.

138
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:18,369
Mookie, don't work
too hard today.

139
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,268
It's going to be hot as the devil.

140
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:23,500
I don't want you falling out,
you hear me?

141
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,167
I hear you, Mother Sister.

142
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:26,209
Good.

143
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,176
All right.

144
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,837
I'll be watching you, son.

145
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:32,315
Mother Sister always watches.

146
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:38,387
Mookie...

147
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,083
You're late again.

148
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,626
You live up the block, what?

149
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,195
Your Cadillac broke?

150
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,924
Hello, Sal, Vito.

151
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,124
Yo, Mook. What up?

152
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,223
Just coolin'.

153
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,428
Just coolin'.
You're still late.

154
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:53,334
Relax, Pino.
Take it easy.

155
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:54,371
You'll live longer.

156
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,304
Take the broom.
The front needs sweeping.

157
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,900
Wait. You sweep.
I bet Sal asked you first anyway.

158
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,070
That's right.

159
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,579
<i>Vito, sti cazzi.</i>

160
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,445
Fuck that.
I get paid for delivering pizzas.

161
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,951
You're paid
to do what we say.

162
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,783
<i>What we say?
Did you hear Sal?</i>

163
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,084
Sal didn't say nothing.

164
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,453
Who's working for who?

165
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,424
Shh.

166
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,325
Come on in, Mayor.

167
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,662
Morning, gentlemen.

168
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,736
Pino, Mookie, Vito, Sal.

169
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:25,735
How are you?

170
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:29,740
Ooh-whee. It's going to be
a scorcher today.

171
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:31,434
That's for sure.

172
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,569
Need any work done here?

173
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,116
<i>Daddy, perchè tu dai
questo azupep soldi per niente affatto.</i>

174
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,742
Why don't you
leave him alone?

175
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,720
He's a good man.
Leave him alone.

176
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,415
Choose your weapon, Mayor.

177
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:49,921
You dropped something, Mayor.

178
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,967
You are going to have
the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn.

179
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,902
Clean as the Board
of Health. Ha-ha!

180
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,905
All right, Mayor.

181
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,373
Pop, I don't believe
this shit.

182
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,205
You running welfare
or something?

183
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:09,110
<i>Every day you give
this azupep a dollar.</i>

184
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,147
<i>What's azupep?</i>

185
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,580
Are you Italian?

186
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:13,584
<i>The Mayor ain't no azupep.</i>

187
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:16,917
<i>You give this azupep a dollar
for sweeping our sidewalk.</i>

188
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,421
What's Mookie for, huh?

189
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,821
He don't even work.

190
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,722
I work harder,
and I'm your son.

191
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:25,058
Let's see you carry
six large pies up six flights,

192
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:27,132
no elevator either and shit.

193
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,598
Shut up, you two.

194
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,725
Yeah, Pop.

195
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,565
Why don't you shut up, too, Vito?

196
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,763
We're going to talk.

197
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:34,771
Says who?

198
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:35,841
Says who?

199
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,135
Says me.

200
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,643
What did I just say?

201
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:42,270
Don't start that
"Mookie don't work" shit.

202
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,244
Yo, Ahmad!

203
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:44,247
I coulda done that.

204
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,910
Man, shut up.
Yo, Ahmad!

205
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,418
Shit. Look, stop.

206
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,455
Punchy, you want to do
any more screaming,

207
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:52,888
be my guest.

208
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:55,187
Yo, who's yelling my name?

209
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,421
Well, Punchy told me to.

210
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,496
Punchy told me to.

211
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,497
Don't listen to this knothead.

212
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,827
It'll get you in trouble.

213
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:02,901
Heard that, Punchy.

214
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,060
Yo, Ella? Ella?

215
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,101
What?

216
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,195
You got a brain.
Use it.

217
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,407
Peace, y'all.

218
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,737
Peace, Radio Raheem.

219
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:12,811
Peace, man.

220
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:14,607
You the man.
I'm just visiting.

221
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:15,611
It's your world, G.

222
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:16,646
For real,

223
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:19,081
in a big motherfuckin' way.

224
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,947
That boy's livin' very large.

225
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,953
Even walks in stereo.

226
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:23,953
Ha-ha-ha.

227
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,216
Yo, P.E.'s in full effect...

228
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,222
Boyee!

229
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,316
Radio Raheem
like a motherfucker.

230
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,988
Radio Raheem.
Blastin' that big box.

231
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,726
Cold rockin' the scene.

232
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,030
Where's the Miller High Life?

233
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,506
Where is the Miller High Life?

234
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,507
No more High Life.

235
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,100
You look what we have.

236
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:47,405
No more High Life?

237
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,640
What kind of a joint is this?

238
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:51,409
How come no more High Life?

239
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,815
Look, doctor,
this ain't Korea or China

240
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,886
or wherever you're from.

241
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,888
You get some Miller High Life
in this fuckin' joint.

242
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,048
You buy another beer.

243
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,184
Da Mayor...

244
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,559
don't drink this Lite shit.

245
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:08,929
Tastes like cold pot liquor.

246
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:12,697
All right, all right.
But you're askin' a lot

247
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:16,036
to make a man change
his beer. A lot, doctor.

248
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,811
Hey! You old drunk!

249
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:23,245
What did I tell you

250
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:25,317
about drinkin'
in front of my stoop?

251
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,942
Move on.
You're blockin' my view.

252
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:31,755
You are ugly enough.

253
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:33,222
Don't stare at me.

254
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,816
The evil eye doesn't work on me.

255
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:39,830
Mother Sister, you been
talkin' about me for 18 years.

256
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:41,763
What I ever done to you?

257
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:42,765
You a drunk fool.

258
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:43,766
Besides that?

259
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,769
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

260
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:48,772
and nobody don't bother
the Mayor but you.

261
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:51,775
The Mayor just tend
to his own business.

262
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,310
I love everybody.

263
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,743
I even love you.

264
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:56,246
Hold your tongue.

265
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,975
You don't have that much love.

266
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,018
One day you gonna be nice to me.

267
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,021
We may both be dead and buried,

268
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:06,284
but you gonna be nice.

269
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,586
At least civil.

270
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,560
I told you, I'm not going
to baby-sit for you,

271
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:21,900
and that's it!

272
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,304
What are you
talking about?

273
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:25,309
Yesterday you said you would.

274
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:26,844
Now today
you're changing your mind?

275
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,310
No, I'm not changing...

276
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:30,314
<i>¿Ay, Mommy,
que mucho jota?</i>

277
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,316
Get off of me, please!

278
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:33,817
I do everything for you.

279
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,750
You can't do shit for me!

280
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,446
<i>Yo tengo
el derecho de salirte.</i>

281
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,992
Right, right.
You know it's not like that, Mommy.

282
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,993
I can do everything for you,

283
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:46,360
but you won't do shit for me.

284
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,659
Stop it!

285
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,327
That lady makes me sick!

286
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:58,842
Your father makes me sick, too.

287
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,935
Everybody makes me sick.

288
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,104
Shit.

289
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,739
Your father ain't no real father.

290
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,647
He's a bum.

291
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:09,220
Chump change, to-the-curb,

292
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,915
pulling no major pub, bum!

293
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,753
Mike.

294
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,156
Fuck Mike Tyson!

295
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,661
I remember when he mugged
that woman on Lexington.

296
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:19,856
I remember that shit.

297
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:20,863
You're going to tell him?

298
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:22,797
I'll tell him.
Fuck Mike Tyson!

299
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:23,765
To his face?

300
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,836
You goddamn right!

301
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:27,371
He'll knock
your goddamn ass off.

302
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:28,838
You talk shit now.

303
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:31,375
I'll drop him like a bad habit.

304
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:34,344
If Tyson dream about whippin' my ass,

305
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,107
he better wake up and apologize.

306
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:39,116
Well, gentlemen, the way I see it,

307
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:41,152
if this hot weather continues,

308
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:44,120
it's going to melt the polar caps

309
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:46,123
and the whole wide world.

310
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,126
And all those parts
that ain't water already

311
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:51,162
will surely be flooded.

312
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:53,197
You dumb ass, simple motherfucker!

313
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,664
Where you read that shit, eh?

314
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,166
The polar caps.

315
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:58,668
Don't worry about it.

316
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,671
When it happens,
and I'm in my boat

317
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,173
and you black asses are drowning,

318
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,177
don't call for me
to throw you no rope,

319
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,043
no lifesaver, or no nothing.

320
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,549
You 30 cent away from a quarter.

321
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:15,176
How the fuck
you gonna get a boat?

322
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,379
Here, boy.

323
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:17,887
Don't worry about it.

324
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,890
Goddamn right.
Look at you.

325
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:21,892
You're raggedy as a roach,

326
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:24,326
eat the holes out of doughnuts.

327
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,863
Raggedy motherfucker!
Don't worry about it.

328
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,364
I'm in good shape.

329
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,832
I will be.

330
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,870
I'll be back on my feet
soon enough.

331
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,336
Look, raggedy-ass shoes!

332
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:38,842
So run over, you gotta
lay down to put 'em on.

333
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,344
So, ML, ML, ML, tell me.

334
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:45,610
When is all this goddamn ice
supposed to melt?

335
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,412
Hello. Sal's Pizza.

336
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,544
Yep.

337
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:51,020
Meatball hero,
eggplant parmesan.

338
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:52,681
You got it.

339
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,762
Yeah, we deliver.
Of course, we deliver.

340
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,094
All right. Where is that?

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
You going to pay now
or on layaway?

342
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:04,858
How much?

343
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,837
You been coming here
three times a day.

344
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,170
What are you, a retard?

345
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,333
It's $1.50.

346
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,741
Put some cheese
on that motherfucker.

347
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,870
Extra cheese is $2.00.

348
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,107
$2.00?

349
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:18,183
Yeah, $2.00.

350
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,841
Hey, forget that shit.

351
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,990
Damn, Sal, you're cheap, man.

352
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,886
Yo, Mook!

353
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,394
Mookie! How come
ain't no brothers

354
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,793
up on the wall?

355
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,694
Man, ask Sal, all right?

356
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,529
Hey, Sal, how come
ain't no brothers there?

357
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,036
You want brothers on the wall?

358
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,537
Get your own place.

359
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,041
You can put your brothers and uncles,
nieces and nephews,

360
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,577
your stepfather, stepmother,
whoever you want.

361
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,544
But this is my pizzeria.

362
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:25,082
American-Italians
on the wall only.

363
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,309
Take it easy, Pop.

364
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:28,909
And you, hey, don't start
with me today.

365
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,079
What?

366
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,588
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,

367
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,090
but you own this.

368
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,591
Rarely do I see

369
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,685
any American-Italians eating in here.

370
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:40,230
All I see is black folks.

371
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,232
Since we spend much money here,

372
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,131
we do have some say.

373
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,971
You lookin' for trouble?

374
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:52,134
Are you a troublemaker,
is that what you are?

375
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,643
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker.

376
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,303
I'm making trouble.

377
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:56,779
You're a ball-breaker.

378
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,782
You're always coming in here

379
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,784
looking for trouble, aren't you?

380
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,946
Suppose I busted your head.
How would you...

381
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:08,484
Mookie, you want to get
your friend out of here?

382
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,857
What, you gonna
kick me out now?

383
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:13,260
I'm not.
You're kicking yourself out.

384
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:16,266
We want some brothers
up on the wall...

385
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,302
You know, Malcolm X,
Nelson Mandela,

386
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,802
Michael Jordan!
Tomorrow!

387
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,463
Mookie, get him out.

388
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,438
I'm trying! Take your slice.

389
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,567
I know you paid for it.

390
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:27,542
All right, you're kicking me out.

391
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:30,581
Beat me on the head
and kick me out.

392
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:32,115
I paid for my...

393
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:33,946
Look, boycott Sal's!
Boycott Sal's.

394
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,644
I got your boycott swinging.

395
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:36,652
Boycott Sal's.

396
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,723
Yo, what you laughin' at?

397
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:41,224
Mookie, I paid for my slice.

398
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:43,317
I spend much money in there!

399
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,328
What are you trying to do?

400
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,330
I want brothers on the wall.

401
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,229
You're fucking my shit up.

402
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:50,699
It's between me and Sal.

403
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:51,769
You're fucking me up.

404
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,271
I ain't trying to fuck you up.
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:56,636
You're sorry?

406
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,801
In a week, it'll be squashed.

407
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,968
A week?

408
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,045
A week.

409
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:02,078
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,078
All right?

411
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,079
Bet.

412
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,206
Bet.

413
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:08,049
Mook...

414
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,484
Stay black!

415
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:14,224
This guy's your friend, right?

416
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:15,953
If I'm wrong, tell me.

417
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,119
He's my friend.

418
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,628
If he don't behave,

419
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,459
I don't want him here anymore.

420
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,089
I can't do nothing.

421
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,428
Talk brother talk to him.

422
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,502
Brother talk?

423
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,697
People are free to do
whatever the hell they want.

424
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,502
Free? What the hell
are you talking about?

425
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:32,509
Free? There's no free here.

426
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,010
I'm the boss.

427
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,012
No freedom.
I'm the boss.

428
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:38,548
You want freedom?
There, that's free.

429
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,050
Take that order out.
He's got an order.

430
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,553
Let's go. Come on!
Get to work!

431
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,555
You're standing here doing nothing.

432
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,522
You're afraid of the goddamn oven.

433
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:48,888
Hit the oven!

434
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,222
Is this the address?

435
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,693
Is that the address?

436
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,856
Is that what he just asked me?

437
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:02,601
Mookie.

438
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,240
Come here, doctor.

439
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,777
Mayor, I got to go.
I'm working.

440
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,039
Come here, doctor.

441
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:10,774
This is the Mayor talking.

442
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:11,746
All right.
All right.

443
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,748
Doctor?

444
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,749
What?

445
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,080
Always do the right thing.

446
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,412
That's it?

447
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,454
That's it.

448
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:19,819
I got it.
I'm gone.

449
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,923
M- M-Mookie...

450
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,294
How you doin', Smiley?

451
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,424
P- P-Pay...

452
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,365
2... 2 d-d-dollars.

453
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,835
The other one.

454
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:34,337
2... 2 d-d-dollars.

455
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,872
The other one, Smiley.

456
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:38,306
1... 1 d-dollar.

457
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,503
That one.
Tonight, when I get paid.

458
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:43,809
When...
When you get p-p...

459
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:46,816
Bye, M-Mookie.

460
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,250
M- M-M-M-Malcolm.

461
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,254
M- M-M-M-Martin.

462
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,415
M- M-M-M-Martin.

463
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:56,855
Shit.

464
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,462
Seen your brother this morning.

465
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,435
Yeah, on his way to work, I hope.

466
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:10,304
This might take
a little bit of time, Mother Sister.

467
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,273
I got nowhere to go.

468
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:16,780
We haven't had a good sit-down
for a long while.

469
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,282
Tender-headed runs in my family.

470
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,215
Are you tender-headed?

471
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,684
Yeah. Me, too.

472
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,618
I don't fool with it.

473
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,816
That's why only you can touch it.

474
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:27,857
Ouch!

475
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,052
I'm sorry.
The comb got caught.

476
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,721
Be gentle, child.
Mother Sister's old.

477
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:33,991
Yes, Mother Sister.

478
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,329
Ooh-whee!

479
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,335
I didn't know you had
such beautiful hair.

480
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,496
There's a lot you don't know.

481
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,666
I'm not stopping.
I'm on my way.

482
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:52,648
Mother Sister,
why are you so cruel to the Mayor?

483
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:54,150
It isn't right.

484
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:56,152
I ain't studying no Mayor.

485
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:59,052
He reminds me
of my least favorite peoples...

486
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:01,557
my tenant and my ex-husband.

487
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,093
Goddamn!
Bless his soul.

488
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,691
Whew!

489
00:25:58,383 --> 00:25:59,816
<i>¡Salud!
¡Salud!</i>

490
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:59,175
What are you doing?

491
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:00,801
Ahmad, put me down!

492
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,434
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

493
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:34,910
It's Radio.
Radio, man.

494
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,344
Hey, what's up, Radio?

495
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,472
Radio!

496
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,056
Don't! Stop!

497
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:03,032
Hey, yo! Don't be
fucking with the water now.

498
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,200
Oh, man, go ahead.
You got it!

499
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,540
There's going to be
a lot of fucking trouble

500
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,771
if this car gets wet.

501
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,745
Ain't nobody
fucking around, man.

502
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,316
Why don't you just go ahead?

503
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,408
This is an antique here, hotshot.

504
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,111
Man, go ahead!
It's what?

505
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:18,086
Hey, man, I'm...
I'm serious, man!

506
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,282
All right.
OK, you won't get wet.

507
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:21,688
Make sure I don't.

508
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,421
Go ahead! Go ahead!
Drive the car!

509
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,588
All right,
I'm driving it.

510
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:30,827
Get out!
Get out, motherfucker!

511
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:31,959
Fuck you back!

512
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,697
Turn the fucking water.

513
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:43,775
Go!

514
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,043
Those son of a bitches!

515
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:48,085
They got me fucking soaked!

516
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,312
Officer!

517
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,217
Wait a minute.
Hold it!

518
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:53,347
I want an arrest made now!

519
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,356
Right now!

520
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,721
What's the matter?
Calm down.

521
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,488
Sir, tell us what happened.

522
00:28:57,595 --> 00:29:00,223
Two black kids soaked me
with the fire hydrant.

523
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:02,731
They ruined my car!
It's an antique!

524
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:03,892
They got me soaked!

525
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:04,866
So where are they?

526
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,402
Brilliant fucking question!

527
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:07,903
They ran away!

528
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,064
What do you think?

529
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:11,005
Do you wish
to file a complaint, sir?

530
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:14,442
Yeah. I want 'em locked
under the fucking jail.

531
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,537
I'm going to turn off the water.

532
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,548
Where you going?
Where's he going?

533
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,379
Did you catch their names?

534
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,283
Officer, what the fuck
are you doing?

535
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,480
Just calm down.

536
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,147
Did you catch their names?

537
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:27,690
Fuck you, their names!

538
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,157
Moe and Joe!

539
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,160
Moe and Joe what, sir?

540
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,662
Moe and Joe what?
Moe and Joe what?

541
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,699
Moe and Joe Black.
How's that?

542
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,165
They're brothers, sir?

543
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:39,202
Brothers. Yeah,
they're fucking brothers.

544
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:42,239
This hydrant
better not come back on again,

545
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,740
or there's going to be hell to pay!

546
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,743
Come answer to me, goddamn it!

547
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,244
Ask him. He knows.

548
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,507
He witnessed
the whole fucking thing!

549
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:51,980
Tell him what happened.

550
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,948
Let us do the questioning, sir.

551
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:56,984
Fucking bullshit.

552
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:58,180
Know anything about this?

553
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:00,120
Who were the punks?

554
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:04,821
Doctors, those that'll tell
don't know,

555
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,229
and those that know won't tell.

556
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:12,735
What the fuck is that, voodoo shit?

557
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:15,863
Hey, the Mayor don't
know nothin', all right?

558
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,736
Hey! He's leaving?

559
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:20,242
Keep this hydrant off.

560
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:21,642
Go swim at Coney Island.

561
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,145
I'm talking to you!

562
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:24,909
He's leaving?
What about me?

563
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:27,917
I suggest you get to your car

564
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,419
before these people
strip it clean.

565
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,580
Have a nice day, sir.

566
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:39,427
He left there
about a half hour ago?

567
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,430
No, no problem.
Thank you.

568
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:42,430
Mookie left...

569
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,433
Where the hell you been?

570
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,969
I got a business to run.

571
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,265
Run it then, OK?

572
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,772
That's for the station.

573
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:50,772
Love Daddy?

574
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,433
Yeah. Love Daddy.

575
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:56,646
Hey, Pop, I'm going
to go with Mookie, OK?

576
00:30:56,748 --> 00:31:00,081
Yeah. You make sure
Mookie don't jerk around.

577
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:01,549
Wait up, Mook!

578
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,348
You ain't going anywhere.

579
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:04,819
How you doing?

580
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:07,858
Vito, I know Pino's
your brother and shit,

581
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,824
but you should kick his ass

582
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,658
the next time he touches you.

583
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:15,324
The next time he hits you,
fuck him up!

584
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,333
Whoa! Whoa!
Yo, hey, Mook.

585
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,834
I appreciate this concern,

586
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,771
but I don't think
it's any of your business, Mook.

587
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:25,172
Yeah, but you need
to kick his ass.

588
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:26,641
Smiley, not now.

589
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:29,144
If I had a brother like him,

590
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:30,646
we'd fight all the time.

591
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:31,646
Smiley!

592
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:34,650
Mook, you don't got
a brother like him.

593
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,652
Smiley, get out of here!

594
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:40,190
If you did, you wouldn't know
what to do with him.

595
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,656
He's my brother.

596
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,522
I'm not going to hit him.

597
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:45,027
I got a sister.

598
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,528
You never clocked your sister.

599
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,030
Does she bug you?

600
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,327
You don't hit girls
like you hit guys.

601
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,959
Just fuck your brother up once,

602
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,469
it'll be over with.

603
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:56,472
We'll be out
of this fucking conversation.

604
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:58,007
It might do some good?

605
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,010
Yes, all right.
A lot of good.

606
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,636
Let's give...
Love Daddy!

607
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:04,681
Peoples, my stomach's
been grumbling,

608
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:06,613
but help has arrived.

609
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:10,279
My main man Mookie
has saved the day!

610
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,323
Straight from Sal's
Famous Pizzeria up the block.

611
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,324
Step up to the mike, Mookie.

612
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:18,327
Come on. Come on!
Don't be shy.

613
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:19,828
Mmm, this smells good.

614
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:22,866
Go ahead.
This is your Love Daddy talking,

615
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,434
Starvin' like Marvin.

616
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:25,399
Say something.

617
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:26,902
All right, Love Daddy.

618
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,405
I'd like to dedicate this record

619
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:32,169
with all my heart and soul...
to Tina.

620
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,710
All right!
Let me put this song on

621
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,507
while I go to work

622
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:38,013
on this chicken
parmigiana hero

623
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:41,677
with extra cheese
and extra s-sauce.

624
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,347
<i>Salsa. Musica latina.</i>

625
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:47,185
<i>El sonido de mi pais,</i>

626
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,657
<i>el pais mas bello,
Puerto Rico.</i>

627
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:50,659
Chill, man.

628
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,662
Shut up.
I'm trying to read.

629
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,857
Have some fucking respect, huh?

630
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:13,582
Not so loud!

631
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:16,585
I want to listen
to my salsa music!

632
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,052
Chill! Chill! Chill!

633
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,852
<i>You think you got it
like that, bro? ¿Chocolate?</i>

634
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,359
Let's go, motherfucker!

635
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,860
Turn it up, Stevie!

636
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,862
Blow it away!
Blow it!

637
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,363
Yeah, blow it away!

638
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:29,865
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

639
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,366
Turn up the bongos!

640
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,834
Oh, yeah!

641
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:45,048
Yo, Steve!
Put it up loud.

642
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,173
Yeah, man!

643
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,694
You got it, bro.

644
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:00,695
<i>¡Hey, pendejo!</i>

645
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,857
<i>¿Qué pasa, la neta?</i>

646
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,364
Come on, Steve, man.

647
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:09,535
<i>Rafael, suba el volumen.</i>

648
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:12,575
You're dead, choco-man.

649
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,702
He's a punk anyway, man.

650
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:17,246
<i>Yo! Hey. ¡Pendejo!</i>

651
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,381
<i>Hey, ¡pendejo! What's up?</i>

652
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:21,383
<i>¡Pendejo!</i>

653
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,647
He's a sucker, man.
A punk.

654
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,051
He's a sucker, man.

655
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,520
See last night's game?

656
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,023
Uh-huh. I saw it.

657
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:30,060
Best pitcher in the game...

658
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,059
Dwight Gooden.

659
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:33,528
I knew you'd bring that up.

660
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:34,563
Who's better?

661
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:35,689
Roger Clemens.

662
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,667
Clemens sucks.
He can't carry Dwight's jock.

663
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,669
Dwight's best in the game.

664
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:42,705
Dwight's best in the game.

665
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,206
What's up, Buggin' Out?

666
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:45,206
You the man.

667
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:46,207
No, you the man.

668
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,208
No, you the man.

669
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:48,209
No, you the man.

670
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:49,210
No, you the man.

671
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:50,678
I'm a struggling black

672
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:54,182
trying to keep my dick hard
in a cruel world.

673
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:56,219
What's with the white boy?

674
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,685
Don't start no shit.

675
00:34:57,788 --> 00:35:00,222
Vito's down.
Vito's down, all right?

676
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:01,222
Yeah, right.

677
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,189
Vito's down.

678
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:03,191
Yeah.

679
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:04,352
Phew.

680
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:15,196
Yo!

681
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:18,775
Damn.

682
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:19,934
Yo!

683
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,036
Yeah?

684
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:30,151
You almost knocked me down.

685
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,188
The word is "excuse me."

686
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,689
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,692
You stepped on
my brand-new white Air Jordans.

688
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,625
That's all you can say?

689
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:39,661
You're serious?

690
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,198
Yeah! I'll fuck
your prick two times!

691
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,164
Two times!

692
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,633
Who told you to be
in my neighborhood?

693
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:46,862
I own this brownstone.

694
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:50,873
Who told you to buy a brownstone
in my neighborhood?

695
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,375
What do you want to live

696
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:56,207
in a black neighborhood for,
anyway?

697
00:35:56,314 --> 00:35:58,714
I understand this is
a free country.

698
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:01,182
A man can live
wherever he wants.

699
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,686
Free country?
I should fuck you up for saying that.

700
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,189
Yo, man.
Your Jordans are fucked up!

701
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,226
Might as well throw them shits out.
They're broke.

702
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:12,694
They looked good
before he messed them up.

703
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,527
He was even talking
about your mama...

704
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,193
Shit, you used
to be so fine!

705
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,701
How much they cost?

706
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,736
$100!

707
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:22,203
$108 with tax.

708
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,900
You're lucky
I got a loving heart.

709
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:26,943
Next time, cross the street quick.

710
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:28,409
I'm out of here.

711
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:29,911
Break his feet!

712
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:32,005
You should buy me another pair!

713
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:34,050
Black Panther'd whip his ass!

714
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,517
You're lucky I'm
a righteous black man!

715
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:39,715
Otherwise you'd be
in serious trouble! Serious!

716
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,189
Let's fuck him up.

717
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,919
Move back to Massachusetts!

718
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:44,551
I was born in Brooklyn.

719
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,095
- No! -
Oh! - Man!

720
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:48,188
Get outta here!

721
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,725
I should send Vito
with you all the time.

722
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:56,539
Yeah. No more
90-minute deliveries

723
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,006
Around the corner.

724
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:01,044
I work hard like
everybody else here, OK?

725
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:03,170
You know that's true, Pino.

726
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,339
Vito, come here.

727
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,509
Come here.

728
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,192
What's going on
between you two?

729
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:18,694
You boyfriend and girlfriend?

730
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,196
What did we just talk about?

731
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,197
What?

732
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,666
What did we just talk about?

733
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,134
What you talking about?

734
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:27,101
Smack him.

735
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,570
Any smacking
around here, I'll do.

736
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:34,643
You going to listen to him
tell you to smack me,

737
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,303
your older brother?

738
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,350
Remember who you are.

739
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:43,352
Your name is Vito Frangone,

740
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,479
not Vito Muhammad.

741
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:46,647
OK?

742
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:57,166
I'd love for you
to stay out of my business.

743
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,169
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, OK?

744
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:03,672
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?

745
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,173
What Muhammad shit?

746
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:07,904
Look... don't fuck me, all right?

747
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,674
Oh, man.

748
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:13,673
Fuck, man.

749
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:23,789
I hate this place.
I hate this place.

750
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,237
What a waste.

751
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:16,904
What a waste.

752
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:19,681
As I was saying

753
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:22,218
before we were
so rudely interrupted

754
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,184
by New York City's finest...

755
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:26,119
What was you saying?

756
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:28,123
The motherfucker
wasn't saying shit.

757
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,489
Yeah.
Look at that.

758
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:32,653
Look at what?

759
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,061
It's a goddamn shame.

760
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,599
What's a goddamn shame?

761
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,065
Sweet Dick Willie.

762
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,568
That's my name.

763
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,104
Do I have to spell it out?

764
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:43,605
Make it plain.

765
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,106
OK, but listen up.

766
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,109
I'm going to break it down.

767
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:48,576
Let it be broke.

768
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,941
Can you dig it?

769
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:51,207
It's dug.

770
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:54,216
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street.

771
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:57,253
Bet they haven't been
off the boat a year

772
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,821
before they opened
their own place.

773
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:01,323
Right. It's been about a year.

774
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:03,325
A motherfuckin' year
off the motherfuckin' boat,

775
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,861
and they got a business
in our neighborhood.

776
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:07,328
A good business,

777
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:09,831
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

778
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:13,097
for longer than
I care to remember,

779
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:16,037
and I've been here a long time.

780
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,539
Yeah, a long time.

781
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:18,505
Hear, boy.

782
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,839
Now, for the life of me...

783
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:23,607
you know, I can't
figure this out.

784
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,275
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses...

785
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:32,283
or you black asses
are just plain dumb.

786
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,156
Fuck you.

787
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:37,159
It's got to be
because we're black.

788
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:38,626
Ain't no other explanation.

789
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,128
You know it's true.

790
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:43,257
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

791
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,801
Oh, oh! You motherfuckers
hold that shit down.

792
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:48,667
I'm tired of that
old excuse, that shit.

793
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:50,171
I swear, man,

794
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:52,208
I will be one happy fool

795
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:54,709
when we open
our own business

796
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:56,677
right here in our neighborhood.

797
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,213
I swear to God,

798
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:01,842
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got.

799
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,886
You motherfuckers
are always talking

800
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,853
that old Keith Sweat shit...

801
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:08,322
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that."

802
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,325
You ain't gonna do nothing.

803
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,327
You're gonna sit on this corner.

804
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,863
When you going
to get your business?

805
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,330
Just like I thought.

806
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,833
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing.

807
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,336
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

808
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,871
more of my money.

809
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,304
Out of my way.

810
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:25,670
It's Miller time, motherfuckers.

811
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,267
Old Moosehead fuckers
telling me what to do.

812
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:29,778
Coconut, you got nerve.

813
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,281
You got off the boat, too.
Leave me alone.

814
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:36,444
Kung Fu, give me
one of them damn beers.

815
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:37,816
No more free beer.

816
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,287
No more free beer.

817
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,823
Don't push me, baby.

818
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:42,324
No more free beer.

819
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:43,825
Don't start no shit.

820
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:45,225
Mr. Sweet Dick Willie.

821
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:46,626
Right. That's my name.

822
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,631
It's a motherfuckin' shame.

823
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,133
Man, ain't that a bitch?

824
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,842
Here, Doctor.
What's your name?

825
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:00,842
Eddie.

826
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:02,139
How old are you?

827
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:03,144
10.

828
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:04,475
What makes Sammy run?

829
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:05,810
My name is Eddie.

830
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,144
What makes Sammy run?

831
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,980
My name is Eddie Lovell.

832
00:42:09,086 --> 00:42:12,852
Relax. I want you
to go to the store for me.

833
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:14,151
What'll it cost?

834
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:15,486
How would I know?

835
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:16,821
What am I buying?

836
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,361
Eddie, you're too smart
for your own britches.

837
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:21,192
How much do you want

838
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:23,823
to go to the store
for the man?

839
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:24,764
50 cents.

840
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:26,301
You got a deal.

841
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:29,770
I want you to get me
a quart of beer.

842
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:31,101
Miller High Life.

843
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,802
Say it's for your bedridden,
old granddad.

844
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:35,276
Now, go. Go.

845
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,609
What is wrong with him?

846
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:41,310
He ain't got no money for nobody.

847
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:43,318
Look at this here, man.

848
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,819
Cut this shit out.

849
00:42:44,922 --> 00:42:47,117
What makes you the Mayor
of this block?

850
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:48,486
Shit, he's self-appointed.

851
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:49,820
Leave the man alone.

852
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:50,791
Shut up!

853
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:53,294
Look, you all leave me
the hell alone.

854
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:55,831
I ain't going out
like that, man.

855
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,834
You walk around this block
like you own it.

856
00:42:58,936 --> 00:42:59,834
For real.

857
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:02,997
You're so old,
you're like a fossil.

858
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:05,803
You're a bum.
You're an old drunk zero.

859
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:08,343
Now what do you got to say?

860
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:10,379
What you know about me?

861
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,814
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you.

862
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,976
What you know about anything?

863
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:17,985
Unless you...

864
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:21,023
Unless you done stood
in the door...

865
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,992
and listened to your
five hungry children

866
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:25,459
crying for bread,

867
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,429
and you can't do
anything about it.

868
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:29,760
Your woman standing there...

869
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:32,267
You can't even look
her in the eye.

870
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:33,597
Unless you done that,

871
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:36,639
you don't know my pain,
my hurt, my feelings.

872
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,968
You don't know shit!

873
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,303
Don't call me bum.

874
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,275
Don't call me a drunk.

875
00:43:41,378 --> 00:43:44,814
You don't got the sense
God give a billy goat!

876
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,109
Don't call me nothing!

877
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:47,148
It's disrespectful.

878
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:49,719
Your mamas and papas
raised you better.

879
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,482
I hope you finished
your little soliloquy

880
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,285
'cause I been peeing straight
for years.

881
00:43:55,392 --> 00:43:56,620
Understand what I'm saying?

882
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:57,955
And you're right.

883
00:43:58,062 --> 00:43:59,324
I wouldn't stand around

884
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,455
listening to my children
go hungry.

885
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:03,328
I'd be getting a job,

886
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,628
anything to feed them.

887
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,636
You're right.
I don't want to know your pain.

888
00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:08,966
I don't care.

889
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,836
You did this to yourself.

890
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,636
Every day I see you walk

891
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:14,938
up and down this block, inebriated.

892
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:17,980
Never sober, but that's
what D-A stands for...

893
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:19,481
Da Mayor... drunk ass.

894
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,572
Come on!

895
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,584
This man's getting me mad!

896
00:44:22,686 --> 00:44:24,517
He don't get no respect!

897
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,680
You'll never get
respect here, boy!

898
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,224
I respect those
who respect themselves!

899
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:30,190
Ahmad!

900
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,693
Come on, man!

901
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,799
Tina, I know it's been four days.

902
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:39,300
I'm a working man.

903
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:42,804
I work, too,
and I seem to make time.

904
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:45,272
What do you want me
to do, huh?

905
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,775
Spend some time
with me and Hector!

906
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:50,813
I want you to try and make
this relationship work.

907
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:53,781
If not, I'd rather not
be bothered with your ass.

908
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:55,647
Mookie, you're too, too tired.

909
00:44:55,753 --> 00:44:56,947
OK, all right, damn.

910
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:58,783
I'll be over sometime today.

911
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,117
You always say later!

912
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:02,283
Later when I get off work.

913
00:45:02,392 --> 00:45:05,122
Bring some ice cream.
I'm burning up.

914
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:07,288
Mookie, do you love me?

915
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:10,431
Do I love you?

916
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:11,967
Mookie, get off the phone!

917
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:15,004
Be off in a second,
all right, Sal?

918
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:16,504
Do I love you?

919
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:17,801
I dedicated a record

920
00:45:17,908 --> 00:45:20,172
on Love Daddy's show to you.

921
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:21,141
So what?

922
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:24,180
How's anybody going
to call in, Mookie?

923
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:25,077
All right!

924
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,082
One time.
You probably wasted...

925
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,584
If that ain't love, you're crazy.

926
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,586
Are you deaf or what?

927
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,088
Pino, I'm talking on the phone.

928
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,125
I think I see that.

929
00:45:36,226 --> 00:45:38,091
Tina, I got to go.

930
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,992
Yeah, Pino's an asshole.

931
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:41,962
See you later today.

932
00:45:42,065 --> 00:45:42,963
Later!

933
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:43,964
Everybody happy?

934
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:46,801
Sal's Famous.

935
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:48,269
Yeah. Yeah, hold it.

936
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:52,775
OK, two large anchovy
and pepperoni.

937
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,935
OK. Just hold on one second.

938
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,445
See, Daddy? Mookie's
fucking talking on the phone,

939
00:45:57,548 --> 00:45:59,812
people are trying
to call in orders.

940
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,509
He's making us lose business.

941
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:02,607
Mookie!

942
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:03,686
20 minutes.

943
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:07,614
How come niggers
are so stupid?

944
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,124
If you see a nigger,
kick his ass.

945
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,092
Fuck you.
Stay off the phone.

946
00:46:12,196 --> 00:46:14,255
Hey, Mookie.
Forget about it.

947
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:18,459
Can I talk to you for a second?

948
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,302
What?

949
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:23,339
Who's your favorite
basketball player?

950
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,304
Magic Johnson.

951
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:26,239
Who's your favorite movie star?

952
00:46:26,343 --> 00:46:27,241
Eddie Murphy.

953
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:29,403
Who's your favorite rock star?

954
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:30,673
Prince.

955
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,112
You're a Prince freak.

956
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,080
Boss. Bruce.

957
00:46:33,183 --> 00:46:34,514
Prince.

958
00:46:34,618 --> 00:46:37,610
All you talk about is
nigger this and nigger that.

959
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:39,382
Your favorite people are niggers.

960
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:42,458
It's different.
Magic, Eddie, Prince...

961
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:43,924
are not niggers.

962
00:46:44,027 --> 00:46:45,961
I mean, they're not black,

963
00:46:46,063 --> 00:46:47,997
I mean...
Let me explain myself.

964
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,759
They're...
They're not really black.

965
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,267
I mean, they're black,
but not really.

966
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:54,530
They're more than black.
It's different.

967
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:55,536
It's different?

968
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,368
Yeah. To me,
it's different.

969
00:46:57,474 --> 00:46:59,567
Deep down you wish
you were black.

970
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:02,236
Get the fuck out of here.

971
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:03,608
Go ahead, laugh.

972
00:47:03,714 --> 00:47:05,477
Your hair's kinkier than mine.

973
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:06,947
What does that mean?

974
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,417
And you know what they say
about dark Italians.

975
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,921
You know, I been listening...
and reading...

976
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:15,423
You been reading now?

977
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:16,423
I read.

978
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:19,620
I've been reading
about your leaders.

979
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,494
Reverend Al
"Mister 'Do" Sharpton.

980
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:23,964
Jesse "Keep hope alive"...

981
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:25,432
That's fucked up.

982
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:27,298
"Keep hope alive."

983
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:29,235
That's fucked.
Don't talk about Jesse.

984
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,739
And even the other guy,
what's his name?

985
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:33,241
Faraman, Fairakan...

986
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:34,310
Minister Farakhan.

987
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:35,435
Right. Sorry.

988
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:36,739
Minister Farakhan.

989
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:40,783
Anyway, Minister Farakhan
always talks about the so-called day...

990
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,250
when the black man will rise.

991
00:47:43,353 --> 00:47:44,786
What does he say?

992
00:47:44,888 --> 00:47:47,254
"We will one day rule the earth

993
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:49,951
as we did in our glorious past"?

994
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,992
That's right.

995
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:52,857
What past?
What did I miss?

996
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,487
We started civilization.

997
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:55,860
Man, keep dreaming, man.

998
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:57,399
Then you woke up!

999
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,025
Pino, fuck you.

1000
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:01,366
Fuck your fucking pizza,

1001
00:48:01,471 --> 00:48:02,836
and fuck Frank Sinatra.

1002
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,467
Yeah? Well, fuck you, too,
and fuck Michael Jackson.

1003
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:07,940
You dago, wop, guinea,

1004
00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:09,444

nonsinging motherfucker.

1008
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:17,852
You gold-teeth,
gold-chain-wearing,

1009
00:48:17,955 --> 00:48:20,788

tit, soon, spade, moulan, yan.

1014
00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:33,566
Take your fucking pizza piece

1015
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,638
and go the fuck back to Africa.

1016
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:38,003
You little slanty-eyed,
me-no-speaky-American,

1017
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:40,838
own every fruit and vegetable stand
in New York,

Yeah, you!

1025
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:56,391
It's cheap.

1026
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:58,859
I got good price for you,

1027
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:01,260
Mayor Kochie,
"How I'm doing?"

1028
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:03,196
Chocolate-egg-cream drinking,

1029
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,531
bagel-and-lox,
B'nai B'rith, Jew asshole.

1030
00:49:06,636 --> 00:49:10,333
Yo! Hold up!
Time out!

1031
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,499
Time out!

1032
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,008
Y'all, take a chill!

1033
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:17,512
Ya need to cool
that shit out!

1034
00:49:17,614 --> 00:49:21,015
And that's the double truth, Ruth!

1035
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,118
Sal, can you do me a favor?

1036
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:27,622
That depends, Mookie.

1037
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,658
Can you pay me now?

1038
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,159
I can't do that.

1039
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:32,626
Sal, just this once.

1040
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:35,664
Can't you do me a solid, man?

1041
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,961
Not till tonight when we close.

1042
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:40,969
Sal, I want to get paid now.

1043
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:43,972
You know you get paid
tonight when we close.

1044
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:45,473
We're still open, OK?

1045
00:49:45,575 --> 00:49:48,476
If I pay you now,
you won't show tonight.

1046
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:49,806
That's a bet.

1047
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:51,175
Yeah, that's a bet.

1048
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:52,646
I'm going to remember that.

1049
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:55,650
You got to do
what you got to do.

1050
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:57,185
I'll remember that.

1051
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:58,481
I want you to.

1052
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,989
Please do me a favor, hey, Mook?
Remember that.

1053
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:16,037
Come on, Sal.

1054
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:17,902
I can't.

1055
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:27,779
Radio Raheem!

1056
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:29,283
Mook.

1057
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:30,478
What's happening?

1058
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:31,986
It's your world.

1059
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:33,488
Where you headed to?

1060
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,455
I'm going to get a slice.

1061
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:36,958
You going to Sal's?

1062
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,960
I'll check you back there.

1063
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:40,324
On the rebound.

1064
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,328
You bet.

1065
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:42,796
All right.

1066
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,298
Oh, shit!

1067
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:46,335
Let me check it out.

1068
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:47,835
That's the hype!

1069
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:48,962
Newest latest.

1070
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:52,974
Let me tell you the story
of right hand/left hand.

1071
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:55,476
It's a tale of good and evil.

1072
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:56,637
Hate.

1073
00:50:56,746 --> 00:51:00,648
It was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother.

1074
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,308
Love.

1075
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:04,319
These five fingers,

1076
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:07,356
they go straight
to the soul of man.

1077
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:08,981
The right hand...

1078
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:10,923
the hand of love.

1079
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:15,155
The story of life is this...

1080
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:18,199
Static.

1081
00:51:19,636 --> 00:51:22,503
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

1082
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:25,439
and the left hand
is kicking much ass.

1083
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:29,945
I mean, it looks like the right hand...
love... is finished.

1084
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,980
But hold on.
Stop the presses.

1085
00:51:32,082 --> 00:51:33,947
The right hand's coming back.

1086
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,451
He got the left hand
on the ropes now.

1087
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:38,953
That's right.
Yeah. Ooh!

1088
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,956
It's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt.

1089
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,457
Down! Ooh! Ooh!

1090
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,120
Left hand, hate,
K.O.'d by love.

1091
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,458
If I love you, I love you.

1092
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:54,794
But if I hate you...

1093
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,840
There it is...
love and hate.

1094
00:51:58,942 --> 00:52:00,341
I love you, brother.

1095
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:01,637
Bet.

1096
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,838
Radio Raheem,
check you later.

1097
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:05,312
Peace.

1098
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,392
Two slices.

1099
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:29,336
No service till you
turn that shit off!

1100
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:32,532
Two slices.

1101
00:52:32,642 --> 00:52:33,734
Turn it off!

1102
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:35,538
Mr. Radio Raheem...

1103
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:38,170
I can't even hear myself think!

1104
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:41,117
You are disturbing me!

1105
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:45,052
You are disturbing my customers!

1106
00:52:55,398 --> 00:52:56,660
Two slices.

1107
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:59,291
You come into Sal's...

1108
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:01,131
There's no music.

1109
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:06,341
No rap, no music,
no music, no music.

1110
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:07,410
<i>Capisci?</i>

1111
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,205
Understand?

1112
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:22,822
Yo, put some extra mozzarella

1113
00:53:22,926 --> 00:53:25,292
on that motherfuckin' shit.

1114
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:31,494
Extra cheese is $2.00.

1115
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,534
Pizza delivery!

1116
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:44,308
All right. Later.

1117
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:51,517
Mousie, what's up?

1118
00:53:54,824 --> 00:53:56,587
Watch out. Move!

1119
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:01,729
People are in the same shit!

1120
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:04,732
What's up, buddy?
How you livin', man?

1121
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:06,233
Here come Mookie.
Mookie!

1122
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:07,769
Give me some of that!

1123
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,270
Get a job.

1124
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,737
Don't need no job.

1125
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,273
Get a job, man.

1126
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,569
Shut up!

1127
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,241
Buggin'.

1128
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:23,751
Where are the females?

1129
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:26,720
You don't do nothin'
with them anyway.

1130
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:29,519
Hey, I've got it like that.

1131
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:32,720
M- M-M-Mookie.

1132
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:34,729
All right.
Here you go.

1133
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:36,230
Stop bothering me.

1134
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:39,700
Th-Th-Thank you,
b- b-b-black man.

1135
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:41,862
All right.
Leave me alone.

1136
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:51,071
Jade!

1137
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:52,273
What?

1138
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:55,283
Mookie, how come
you're not at Sal's?

1139
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:56,716
I'm working.

1140
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,221
What's this... Another of your
patented two-hour lunch breaks?

1141
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:03,258
I wanted to come home
and take a quick shower.

1142
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,725
Sal's going to be mad.

1143
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:08,730
Sometimes I think you're more
concerned about him than me,

1144
00:55:08,832 --> 00:55:10,231
and I'm your brother.

1145
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,767
That's real smart.
Sal pays you.

1146
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,734
That's why you should work.

1147
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:16,237
I work.
Slavery's over.

1148
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,239
My name ain't Kunta Kinte.

1149
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:21,742
I just don't want you
to lose the one job

1150
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:23,745
you've kept over a month.

1151
00:55:23,847 --> 00:55:26,179
I'm carrying you as it is.

1152
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,681
I'll always get paid.

1153
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:29,684
Yeah. You always get paid.

1154
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,185
What about
your responsibilities?

1155
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,222
Why don't you
take better care of those?

1156
00:55:34,324 --> 00:55:35,348
What responsibilities?

1157
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,857
What are you, deaf?

1158
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,360
You know what
I'm talking about.

1159
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,363
Take care of your responsibilities,
all right?

1160
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,365
Who you yelling at, anyway?

1161
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:45,866
I'm yelling at you.

1162
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:48,870
I'm going to take care
of this shower.

1163
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:52,373
I'm your big brother.
Don't be yelling at me.

1164
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:53,874
You're a bum.

1165
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:56,036
Don't call me no bum.

1166
00:55:58,915 --> 00:56:00,143
Whew!

1167
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:05,549
If I want to shower
in the middle of the day,

1168
00:56:05,655 --> 00:56:07,020
it's OK.
Fuck Sal.

1169
00:56:07,123 --> 00:56:09,057

I'm beat.

1221
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:18,534
Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking.

1222
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:22,378
Maybe we should sell this place.

1223
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,915
Get out while we're still ahead...

1224
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:26,644
and alive.

1225
00:58:28,987 --> 00:58:32,889
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?

1226
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:35,391
I mean, couldn't we sell this

1227
00:58:35,494 --> 00:58:39,430
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1228
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:41,931
There's too many pizzerias
already there.

1229
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,400
Maybe we could try
something different.

1230
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:46,437
What am I going to do?

1231
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:47,903
That's all I know.

1232
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:51,567
I been here 25 years.
Where am I going?

1233
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:55,911
I'm sick of niggers.

1234
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:58,414
It's like I come to work...

1235
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:00,951
it's "Planet of the Apes."

1236
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:03,453
I don't like being around them.

1237
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:04,749
They're animals.

1238
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:09,084
Why you got so much anger in you?

1239
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:12,094
Why? I'll tell you why.

1240
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:14,597
My friends...
They laugh at me.

1241
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,100
They laugh right in my face.

1242
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:19,602
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy.

1243
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:21,263
Go feed the moulies."

1244
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:25,540
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1245
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:27,043
Food on your table?

1246
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:30,581
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head?

1247
00:59:30,682 --> 00:59:31,876
Huh?

1248
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,217
They're not your friends.

1249
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,219
If they were your friends,

1250
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,255
they wouldn't laugh at you.

1251
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,257
Pop, what can I say?

1252
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:42,759
I don't want to be here.

1253
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:44,761
They don't want us here.

1254
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:47,730
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

1255
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:48,925
in Bensonhurst,

1256
00:59:49,034 --> 00:59:50,433
and niggers in theirs.

1257
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:53,562
I never had no trouble
with these people.

1258
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,941
I sat in this window...

1259
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:59,909
all I see is
little kids get old.

1260
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,947
And I seen
the old people get older.

1261
01:00:03,048 --> 01:00:05,949
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,

1262
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,076
but most of them do.

1263
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:13,924
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food.

1264
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,459
<i>On my food.</i>

1265
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,426
I'm very proud of that.

1266
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:19,463
You may think it's funny,

1267
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:22,090
but I'm very proud of that.

1268
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:27,027
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh...

1269
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,700
Sal's Famous Pizzeria
is here to stay.

1270
01:00:32,678 --> 01:00:33,702
I'm sorry.

1271
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:36,713
I'm your father,
and I love you.

1272
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:38,248
I'm sorry, but...

1273
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,875
but that's the way it is.

1274
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:53,730
Hey, S-S-Sal.

1275
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:55,424
Hey, S-S-Sal.

1276
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:56,933
How you doing?

1277
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:59,936
These are $2.00.

1278
01:01:00,038 --> 01:01:01,232
Get out.

1279
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:06,944
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1280
01:01:07,045 --> 01:01:09,570
Get the fuck out of here!

1281
01:01:10,716 --> 01:01:12,445
$2.00.

1282
01:01:14,052 --> 01:01:15,246
S- S-Sal.

1283
01:01:17,055 --> 01:01:19,455
Come on.
Get out of here.

1284
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:21,924
Get the fuck out of here!

1285
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,461
Every day it's the same shit.

1286
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:26,360
Hey, leave that boy alone!

1287
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:30,868
Get a fucking job.
Why don't you get a fucking job?

1288
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:32,402
Go to fucking work!

1289
01:01:32,504 --> 01:01:34,028
S- S-Sal.

1290
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:35,572
Get out. Get out!

1291
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:37,039
See what I'm saying?

1292
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:40,543
Leave that boy alone.
You know he ain't right!

1293
01:01:40,646 --> 01:01:42,580
Get a fucking job, man!

1294
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,546
I'm sick of this shit.

1295
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,083
<i>You get a job!</i>

1296
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,549
I got a job.

1297
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:49,553
Bring your ass here, punk!

1298
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:51,555
I ain't going over there.

1299
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:55,058
I ain't got no reason
to go over there.

1300
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,060
F- F-F-Fuck you!

1301
01:01:57,162 --> 01:02:00,063
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

1302
01:02:00,165 --> 01:02:02,258
F- F-F-Fuck you!

1303
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,732
Go inside.
Go inside.

1304
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:05,735
Smiley, here. Here.
Smiley, here.

1305
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:07,737
Here's a couple of dollars.

1306
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,773
Come on. Come on. Here.

1307
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,899
Fuckin' asshole!

1308
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:12,909
Hey, Willie,
take it easy.

1309
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:14,444
He didn't mean nothin'.

1310
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:16,739
OK?

1311
01:02:16,848 --> 01:02:17,940
Motherfucker!

1312
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,745
This is what I'm talking about.

1313
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:22,010
Whoo!

1314
01:02:22,988 --> 01:02:24,580
Let's go, Jade!

1315
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,024
Da Mayor,
we need your leadership.

1316
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:30,526
Doctor, what are you talking about?

1317
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:33,496
I'm organizing a boycott
of Sal's Famous.

1318
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:34,997
Shit.
Keep walking, Doctor.

1319
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:39,002
I don't want to hear
none of your damn black foolishness.

1320
01:02:39,104 --> 01:02:40,571
Damn. No juice.

1321
01:02:44,643 --> 01:02:46,372
No, man, no.

1322
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:48,403
No!

1323
01:02:48,513 --> 01:02:50,413
Hell, no, goddamn it.

1324
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:53,416
Sal ain't never
done nothin' to you before.

1325
01:02:53,518 --> 01:02:56,419
What you ought to boycott
is that barber

1326
01:02:56,521 --> 01:02:58,421
that fucked up your head.

1327
01:02:58,523 --> 01:02:59,581
Yeah!

1328
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:00,749
Shit.

1329
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:03,794
Come out here fuckin'
with Sweet Dick Willie.

1330
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:05,192
Get the fuck away.

1331
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:09,131
Would you sign a petition
to boycott Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1332
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:10,599
I ain't boycottin' jack,

1333
01:03:10,702 --> 01:03:12,101
string-cheese
head motherfucker.

1334
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,604
I'm going for a slice now.

1335
01:03:14,706 --> 01:03:17,140
I was raised on Sal's pizza.

1336
01:03:17,242 --> 01:03:18,607
What you talkin' about?

1337
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,143
You crazy, man?

1338
01:03:20,245 --> 01:03:22,611
Good as them
motherfuckin' pizzas is?

1339
01:03:22,714 --> 01:03:25,615
Black Panther eat pizza,
we eat pizza.

1340
01:03:25,684 --> 01:03:27,777
I'll do it without your help.

1341
01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:29,618
That's 75 cents.

1342
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:30,813
Thanks.

1343
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:31,911
Thanks, honey.

1344
01:03:32,023 --> 01:03:34,924
Sal, we're going to boycott
your fat pasta ass.

1345
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:37,221
You're going...
You're going to boycott me?

1346
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:40,230
You haven't got the balls
to boycott me.

1347
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:43,267
He's going to boycott me.
Are you kidding?

1348
01:03:43,368 --> 01:03:44,767
Here...
Here's your boycott.

1349
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,270
Up your ass.
You're going to boycott.

1350
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:49,738
Where you going?
Where you going?

1351
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:51,741
I'm talking to you, Pino!

1352
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:53,276
I'm right here.

1353
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:56,245
Go inside.
I can take care of myself.

1354
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:57,781
Take it easy, OK?

1355
01:03:57,883 --> 01:04:00,351
No. Go inside.
Here's your boycott!

1356
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:03,444
Messed up my Jordans with muck.

1357
01:04:03,555 --> 01:04:04,783
Damn!

1358
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:08,991
Get this thing
straightened out, man.

1359
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:10,459
White guy/black man.

1360
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,462
I can't believe this crap.

1361
01:04:12,564 --> 01:04:14,464
Ah, your Jordans are dogged.

1362
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:16,500
Oh, man, you, too. Stop.

1363
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:17,966
Yeah, me, too.

1364
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:19,969
Hangin' out with baby sis.

1365
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:21,504
We're not hangin' out.

1366
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:23,972
She's escortin' me back to Sal's.

1367
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:26,407
I'm just goin' to get a slice.

1368
01:04:26,511 --> 01:04:27,944
You can't. Not today.

1369
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:30,913
I'm organizing a boycott
of Sal's Famous.

1370
01:04:31,016 --> 01:04:32,449
What did he do?

1371
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:36,920
You know them pictures
he got on the wall of fame?

1372
01:04:37,022 --> 01:04:38,080
So?

1373
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,623
Notice somethin' about them?

1374
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:41,624
No, Buggin' Out,
I haven't.

1375
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:43,091
You're wasting my time.

1376
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,594
Leave that shit alone.

1377
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:46,721
You really should.
I'm gone.

1378
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:48,129
I'll see you there.

1379
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:50,394
Buggin' Out, how you been?

1380
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:53,835
Every single one of them pictures
is somebody Italian.

1381
01:04:53,939 --> 01:04:55,167
And...

1382
01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:56,797
We want black people.

1383
01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:58,239
Did you ask Sal?

1384
01:04:58,343 --> 01:04:59,708
Yeah, I asked him.

1385
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,711
We want nobody in there,

1386
01:05:01,813 --> 01:05:04,145
nobody spending
good money in Sal's,

1387
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:07,116
until we get black pictures
on the wall.

1388
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:09,153
What good will that do?

1389
01:05:09,254 --> 01:05:10,619
If you tried hard,

1390
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:13,691
you could direct
your energies more usefully.

1391
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,022
You got to be down.
You ain't?

1392
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:20,564
I'm down, but I'm down for something
positive in the community.

1393
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:22,530
Are you down for that?

1394
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:23,862
Jade...

1395
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,665
Jade, I still
love you anyway.

1396
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:31,503
Yeah, I still love you,
too, Buggin' Out.

1397
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,668
Later.

1398
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:33,971
Later.

1399
01:05:36,114 --> 01:05:37,376
Man.

1400
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:40,985
You're pushing it, Mookie.

1401
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:42,519
You're really pushing it.

1402
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:44,486
I don't pay good money

1403
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:46,989
to have you jerk me around.

1404
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:49,993
Keep it up,
you'll be in the street

1405
01:05:50,095 --> 01:05:51,653
with your other homeboys.

1406
01:05:53,131 --> 01:05:54,655
About time, Pop.

1407
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,437
Jade.

1408
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:07,171
How you doin', Jade?

1409
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:08,405
Where you been?

1410
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:10,208
Just working hard.
Keeping busy.

1411
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,247
How's business?

1412
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,373
Business is great.

1413
01:06:12,484 --> 01:06:14,975
We were wondering
when you'd stop by.

1414
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,610
How's Mookie doing?

1415
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:18,586
He's, uh... Mookie is...

1416
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:21,056
He's great.
A good kid.

1417
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:22,558
Hey, Pop.
Stop lying.

1418
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:23,719
He's kidding.

1419
01:06:23,828 --> 01:06:24,817
I know.

1420
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:25,828
What'll it be?

1421
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:27,057
Regular slice.

1422
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:29,998
No, I'm going to make you
something special,

1423
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:31,295
if you don't mind.

1424
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:32,802
No, that'll be great.

1425
01:06:32,904 --> 01:06:35,304
OK. What do you
want to drink?

1426
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:36,465
Cream soda.

1427
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,269
Used to be root beer.

1428
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:40,367
Tell me if I'm wrong.

1429
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:43,470
I want a change of pace.

1430
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:45,981
Vito, clean the table for Jade.

1431
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,483
All right, Pop.

1432
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,883
Come here, Jade.
Sit here.

1433
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,640
20 "D" Energizers.

1434
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,007
20 "C" Energizers?

1435
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:16,137
"D." Not "C." "D."

1436
01:07:16,247 --> 01:07:17,646
"C" Energizers?

1437
01:07:17,749 --> 01:07:19,148
"D," motherfucker. "D!"

1438
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,912
Learn to speak English first,
all right? "D."

1439
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,419
How many you say?

1440
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:26,149
20, motherfucker. 20.

1441
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:28,449
Motherfuck you!

1442
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,788
Motherfuck...

1443
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:33,163
Motherfucker, you,
you all right, man.

1444
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:35,630
Just give me
the motherfuckin' batteries.

1445
01:07:35,734 --> 01:07:38,362
20 "D" fuckin' batteries.

1446
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,869
Hey, yo. Yo, wait.

1447
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:41,871
What's the date on them?

1448
01:07:41,973 --> 01:07:43,838
What's the date on them?

1449
01:07:43,942 --> 01:07:45,842
The date!
The fuckin' date!

1450
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:47,002
What?

1451
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:50,013
Can you fuckin' speak English?
The date!

1452
01:07:50,115 --> 01:07:51,343
The date?

1453
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:52,507
Marcha!

1454
01:07:52,617 --> 01:07:53,709
Marcha?

1455
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:54,978
What you talkin' about... Marcha?

1456
01:07:55,086 --> 01:07:56,144
1991.

1457
01:07:56,254 --> 01:07:58,188
Oh, March.
That's March, motherfucker,

1458
01:07:58,289 --> 01:07:59,313
March.

1459
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:01,824
Yo, man,
you sure that's 20?

1460
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:02,984
20.

1461
01:08:03,094 --> 01:08:05,995
No. No. Take them out.
Count them again.

1462
01:08:06,097 --> 01:08:07,997
Count the shits again, man.

1463
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,464
Motherfucker.

1464
01:08:28,987 --> 01:08:30,545
May I help you?

1465
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,089
I want some flowers.

1466
01:08:34,192 --> 01:08:36,251
The whole thing?

1467
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:37,760
The whole thing.

1468
01:08:37,862 --> 01:08:39,386
It's very expensive.

1469
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:41,055
I know. I'll pay.

1470
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:04,248
I thought you might like these.

1471
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:10,125
I guess not.

1472
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:11,593
There is nothing

1473
01:09:11,696 --> 01:09:14,597
like the smell of fresh flowers.

1474
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:17,133
Don't you agree,
Mother Sister?

1475
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:19,100
Summertime...

1476
01:09:19,204 --> 01:09:22,105
All you can smell is the garbage.

1477
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,606
Smell overpowers everything,

1478
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:27,371
especially the soft,
sweet smell of flowers.

1479
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:30,243
You don't mind,
I'll sit right here,

1480
01:09:30,348 --> 01:09:34,375
catch a breeze or two,
then be on my way.

1481
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:40,424
Thank the Lord,
the sun is going down.

1482
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:44,052
It is hot as blazes.

1483
01:09:44,162 --> 01:09:46,255
Yes, Jesus.

1484
01:09:46,364 --> 01:09:50,630
Well, guess I'll be on my way.

1485
01:10:08,686 --> 01:10:09,778
Oh!

1486
01:10:09,888 --> 01:10:11,253
Oh, goddamn, man!

1487
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:12,755
Cut that shit down!

1488
01:10:12,857 --> 01:10:15,087
A person go deaf
or something.

1489
01:10:15,193 --> 01:10:16,251
Fucker!

1490
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:19,262
Man, I don't know
how he does it.

1491
01:10:19,364 --> 01:10:21,594
Oh, man!
Goddamn.

1492
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:22,961
That is shit.

1493
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:25,558
ML, come here.

1494
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,035
What?

1495
01:10:27,138 --> 01:10:29,072
Come hold this fucker, baby.

1496
01:10:29,174 --> 01:10:32,541
Hold what, sucker?

1497
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:35,078
You know what I'm talkin' about.

1498
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,204
That's OK.

1499
01:10:36,314 --> 01:10:39,078
At least my moms
didn't name me...

1500
01:10:39,184 --> 01:10:40,708
Sweet Dick Willie.

1501
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:41,785
Uh-huh.

1502
01:10:41,886 --> 01:10:44,582
I told you about that mama shit.

1503
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:46,384
Nobody talkin' about your moms.

1504
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:49,221
I ain't say nobody.
I said you!

1505
01:10:49,327 --> 01:10:50,760
Just squash that shit.

1506
01:10:50,862 --> 01:10:53,228
I didn't mean it like that.

1507
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:54,764
You did, too.

1508
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:58,063
I just wanted to know

1509
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:01,104
who named you
Sweet Dick Willie.

1510
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:03,071
Man, it's just a name.

1511
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:04,573
Goddamn. Shit.

1512
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:07,474
How'd you get the name ML?

1513
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:08,978
ML stands for ML.

1514
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,014
Now that's some stupid shit.

1515
01:11:11,115 --> 01:11:13,413
Hear me?
That's some stupid shit.

1516
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:14,951
'Cause everybody know

1517
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:17,954
why they call me
Sweet Dick Willie.

1518
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:19,421
You Negroes kill me.

1519
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:21,583
Always holding on to...

1520
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:24,127
always talking
about your dicks.

1521
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:27,062
It's too hot to fuck.

1522
01:11:27,165 --> 01:11:29,565
Man, you out
your fuckin' mind?

1523
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:31,532
It ain't never too hot

1524
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:34,036
or never too cold for fuckin'.

1525
01:11:34,138 --> 01:11:36,868
I had my best piece of woman

1526
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:38,374
on a humid day.

1527
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:39,909
Over in the projects.

1528
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:41,410
Close to your woman.

1529
01:11:41,512 --> 01:11:42,536
Get out!

1530
01:11:42,647 --> 01:11:45,081
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

1531
01:11:45,183 --> 01:11:47,811
I better not see her
naked on payday.

1532
01:11:47,919 --> 01:11:50,080
Piraguero!
Everybody out!

1533
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:52,383
The icee, icee man is here.

1534
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,425
Hey hey!
Looking good.

1535
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:56,891
Here we are.

1536
01:11:56,995 --> 01:11:58,929
Look at these beautiful people.

1537
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,123
The icee man is here.

1538
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:03,097
I want coconut.

1539
01:12:03,201 --> 01:12:04,793
Give me lemon.

1540
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:06,733
Tell me what you need.

1541
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:08,738
There you go, my love.

1542
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,866
That's your color.
That's your flavor.

1543
01:12:11,976 --> 01:12:15,241
I want more syrup on mine.

1544
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:19,206
He's always drinking, man.

1545
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:24,079
Hey, hey!

1546
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:26,053
Where's everybody going?

1547
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:27,454
Ice cream!

1548
01:12:29,227 --> 01:12:30,353
Ice cream!

1549
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,452
Doctor!

1550
01:12:36,634 --> 01:12:39,034
Doctor, don't you
know no better

1551
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:42,538
than to run out
in front of a car?

1552
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,540
You trying to kill yourself?

1553
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:47,475
Come on.
Let's get up.

1554
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:50,546
You gonna be all right.

1555
01:12:50,648 --> 01:12:53,549
You gonna be all right, my boy.

1556
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:55,744
You gonna be just fine.

1557
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:58,083
Eddie, what's wrong?

1558
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:00,054
Mayor knocked me down.

1559
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:02,319
You ought to be
shamed of yourself.

1560
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:06,386
Ha ha. That boy's
just scared to death.

1561
01:13:06,497 --> 01:13:07,930
What happened...

1562
01:13:08,032 --> 01:13:10,398
I was walking,
minding my business.

1563
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:14,938
I seen your son
about to get hit by the car,

1564
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:16,438
so I dashed out.

1565
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,906
I knocked him down

1566
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:20,910
to keep us both
from getting hit.

1567
01:13:21,012 --> 01:13:25,381
I saved two lives today...
his and mine.

1568
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:27,348
Eddie, is that the truth?

1569
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:30,353
Eddie, you hear me
talking to you.

1570
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:32,889
I'm talking to you, boy.

1571
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:35,185
He gonna be fine, miss.

1572
01:13:39,797 --> 01:13:40,889
Mommy, Mommy!

1573
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:42,363
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

1574
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:43,866
Get upstairs now!

1575
01:13:43,968 --> 01:13:46,869
Your father gonna
wear out your behind.

1576
01:13:46,971 --> 01:13:50,907
Miss, you didn't have
to hit your boy like that.

1577
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:53,306
He's already scared to death.

1578
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:55,811
I appreciate you
helping my Eddie,

1579
01:13:55,913 --> 01:13:59,576
but I'll have nobody question
how I raise him.

1580
01:13:59,684 --> 01:14:01,208
You're right, miss.

1581
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:02,752
You're right.

1582
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:07,055
I don't want to sound like a jerk,

1583
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,422
but can I say something, Jade?

1584
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:10,892
Yeah, Sal.

1585
01:14:10,995 --> 01:14:13,725
You got the biggest eyes
I've ever seen.

1586
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:16,231
They jump out of your head.

1587
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,768
I feel embarrassed
even saying that.

1588
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,098
Thanks, Sal.

1589
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:22,069
Don't even mention it.

1590
01:14:22,173 --> 01:14:24,767
It was delicious.

1591
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,208
I got to talk to you.

1592
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:29,677
I got to talk to you.

1593
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:31,214
Come on.
Let's go.

1594
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:34,182
Jade, don't forget
to come back soon, OK?

1595
01:14:34,285 --> 01:14:36,219
Hey, Mookie.
Take it easy.

1596
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,845
You're going to bust her arm.

1597
01:14:44,629 --> 01:14:47,530
I don't want you
in Sal's no more.

1598
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:49,031
Mookie, what?
Stop tripping.

1599
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:51,567
Read my lips.
Don't see Sal.

1600
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:53,762
What are you worked up about?

1601
01:14:53,871 --> 01:14:56,305
The way Sal looks at you.

1602
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:58,068
- He's being nice.
- Nice?

1603
01:14:58,176 --> 01:14:59,973
- He's completely innocent.
- Innocent?

1604
01:15:00,077 --> 01:15:01,510
You heard me.

1605
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:03,842
Sal just wants
to hide the salami.

1606
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:05,882
You're really crude, Mookie.

1607
01:15:05,983 --> 01:15:08,247
Do not come in Sal's anymore.

1608
01:15:08,352 --> 01:15:09,717
You are not welcome.

1609
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,550
You got a lot of nerve.

1610
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,886
I'll tell you one last time.

1611
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:16,152
Stop playing
big brother to me.

1612
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,693
I'm a grown woman!

1613
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:21,162
You can't pay your rent,
and you're lecturing me?

1614
01:15:21,265 --> 01:15:22,493
That makes no sense.

1615
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,931
Oh, it doesn't, huh?

1616
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:26,003
You got $250 a week.

1617
01:15:26,103 --> 01:15:27,900
I'm getting paid.

1618
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:29,165
Peanuts.

1619
01:15:30,608 --> 01:15:33,509
In a while,
I'll be making a move.

1620
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,703
Yeah, when?

1621
01:15:34,812 --> 01:15:35,836
Don't worry.

1622
01:15:35,947 --> 01:15:37,005
When, Mookie?

1623
01:15:37,114 --> 01:15:38,513
Don't worry about it.

1624
01:15:38,616 --> 01:15:40,345
Don't come here no more.

1625
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:42,351
We're not talking about that.

1626
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:45,183
I'm tired of supporting
a grown woman, OK?

1627
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:48,053
I'm tired of supporting
a grown man, OK?

1628
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,526
When are you going
to pack up and go?

1629
01:15:51,629 --> 01:15:53,961
Don't come in Sal's no more.

1630
01:15:54,065 --> 01:15:56,192
And no more pizza, either.

1631
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,036
I don't care if you fire me

1632
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,074
this exact fucking moment.

1633
01:16:05,176 --> 01:16:06,541
If you're saying

1634
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:08,544
what I'm thinking
you're saying,

1635
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,580
you better not say it.

1636
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:12,046
You hear this?

1637
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:15,050
Do me a favor.
Leave Jade alone.

1638
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:17,552
You know, Mookie,
not for nothin',

1639
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:20,556
but if you were
just a little taller,

1640
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:23,593
I'd kick your ass
for what you're thinking.

1641
01:16:23,694 --> 01:16:25,491
As a matter of fact,

1642
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:28,360
I should kick your ass
on principle alone.

1643
01:16:28,466 --> 01:16:30,491
Here.
You got a delivery.

1644
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:37,005
This the right address?

1645
01:16:37,108 --> 01:16:38,541
What is this...

1646
01:16:38,643 --> 01:16:40,543
Yeah. It's the right address.

1647
01:16:40,645 --> 01:16:42,044
That's the right address.

1648
01:16:42,146 --> 01:16:43,511
I wrote it myself.

1649
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:45,013
Sometimes you make mistakes,

1650
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:46,879
and I deliver fucking pizzas

1651
01:16:46,984 --> 01:16:48,679
to the wrong fucking address.

1652
01:16:48,786 --> 01:16:50,185
I don't make mistakes.

1653
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:51,687
You don't make mistakes?

1654
01:16:51,789 --> 01:16:53,188
Hurry back, OK?

1655
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,725
Don't get lost.
We're still open.

1656
01:16:55,826 --> 01:16:57,521
Make a pizza, huh?

1657
01:17:04,835 --> 01:17:05,859
Mr. Mayor.

1658
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:10,370
I saw what you did.

1659
01:17:10,474 --> 01:17:12,408
That was foolish but brave.

1660
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:14,876
That child owes you his life.

1661
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:17,379
Wasn't trying to be a hero.

1662
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:19,745
I just seen what was happening,

1663
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:22,045
and I reacted... didn't even think.

1664
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:24,053
Probably wouldn't have done it

1665
01:17:24,155 --> 01:17:25,486
if I had thought.

1666
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,989
Da Mayor's getting old.

1667
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:29,491
Ain't run like that in years.

1668
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:32,995
Went from first to home
on a bunt single.

1669
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:34,496
Scored the winning run.

1670
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:36,999
Two outs.
Bottom of the ninth.

1671
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:39,501
August 1, 1939.
Snow Hill, Alabama.

1672
01:17:39,604 --> 01:17:42,004
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher.

1673
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:43,505
He hated my guts.

1674
01:17:43,608 --> 01:17:45,872
He come down off that mound,

1675
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:47,342
and I took off

1676
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:51,040
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass.

1677
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:53,173
Maybe I, uh...

1678
01:17:53,284 --> 01:17:56,776
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often.

1679
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:58,286
Maybe you shouldn't.

1680
01:17:58,389 --> 01:17:59,754
Don't get happy.

1681
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:02,519
This changes nothing
between you and me.

1682
01:18:02,627 --> 01:18:04,356
You did a good thing.

1683
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:06,327
Mother Sister just thanks you.

1684
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,091
I want to thank you.

1685
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,394
You're welcome.

1686
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:23,208
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

1687
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:25,111
Is it hot?

1688
01:18:25,216 --> 01:18:27,741
I've never delivered a cold pizza.

1689
01:18:37,528 --> 01:18:38,722
Come here.

1690
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,104
You think you're slick, Tina.

1691
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:50,901
How else could
I get you up here?

1692
01:18:51,008 --> 01:18:53,408
I haven't seen you all week.

1693
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:54,944
I'm working.
Making money.

1694
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:57,412
You forgot the ice cream again.

1695
01:18:57,515 --> 01:18:58,573
I forgot.

1696
01:18:58,683 --> 01:19:00,082
Your memory's getting ridiculous.

1697
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:02,584
I got things on my mind.

1698
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:05,087
I really wanted some ice cream.

1699
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:07,589
I'll run out and get some.

1700
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:10,593
No, no. That's out.
You won't come back.

1701
01:19:10,695 --> 01:19:12,595
I can't be staying long.

1702
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:13,755
How long?

1703
01:19:13,864 --> 01:19:16,264
Long enough to do the nasty.

1704
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:18,267
Come on, Mookie.
That's out.

1705
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:20,633
First of all, it's too hot.

1706
01:19:20,738 --> 01:19:23,434
If you think
I'll let you get some,

1707
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,702
put your clothes on and leave,

1708
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,971
and I won't see you again,

1709
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:29,068
you're bugging.

1710
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,613
I'll see you tomorrow.

1711
01:19:30,715 --> 01:19:32,580
Yeah, right.

1712
01:19:32,683 --> 01:19:34,241
So no nasty, huh?

1713
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:35,716
No.

1714
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,844
Something else.

1715
01:19:36,954 --> 01:19:37,886
What?

1716
01:19:37,988 --> 01:19:38,920
Trust me.

1717
01:19:39,023 --> 01:19:42,220
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son.

1718
01:19:42,326 --> 01:19:43,293
Remember him?

1719
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:44,725
His name's Hector.

1720
01:19:44,829 --> 01:19:47,093
You saying I'm a bad father?

1721
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:48,392
On the strength.

1722
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:50,262
Let me talk to you.

1723
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:51,425
What? What?

1724
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:52,729
Over here.

1725
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,107
Tina, take your clothes off.

1726
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,574
I already told you

1727
01:19:59,677 --> 01:20:02,578
it's too fucking hot
to make love.

1728
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,079
It's too fucking hot.

1729
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:06,081
Why are you always cursing?

1730
01:20:06,183 --> 01:20:08,583
I don't fucking curse that much.

1731
01:20:08,686 --> 01:20:10,620
What the hell you mean?

1732
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:12,621
All you do is curse.

1733
01:20:12,723 --> 01:20:15,624
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight.

1734
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:17,091
All right?
That's it.

1735
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:18,252
No rawness?

1736
01:20:18,362 --> 01:20:19,761
No. No rawness.

1737
01:20:19,864 --> 01:20:21,764
Why's it always like that

1738
01:20:21,866 --> 01:20:23,265
when you come over?

1739
01:20:23,367 --> 01:20:25,198
It's not always like that.

1740
01:20:25,302 --> 01:20:27,736
It's always...
What are you doing?

1741
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:30,136
I'm not cursing.

1742
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:32,869
Mookie. Come on.

1743
01:20:32,977 --> 01:20:35,241
I mean it.
I'm not playing.

1744
01:20:35,346 --> 01:20:36,870
I'm not playing.

1745
01:20:39,383 --> 01:20:41,613
Don't be so anxious.

1746
01:20:44,655 --> 01:20:46,714
That's right.
Take it off.

1747
01:20:53,197 --> 01:20:54,221
You're sweating.

1748
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:55,730
Of course I'm sweating.

1749
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,233
It's only 100 degrees in here.

1750
01:20:58,335 --> 01:20:59,734
Look, freeze.
Don't move.

1751
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:01,236
I'll be right back.

1752
01:21:01,338 --> 01:21:04,273
What do you mean
you'll be right back?

1753
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,740
Where are you going?

1754
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:07,276
I'll be right back.

1755
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:10,040
Why you got me
standing on the bed?

1756
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:11,705
Where you going?

1757
01:21:15,853 --> 01:21:18,083
How's my son, Hector?

1758
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:20,123
Honey, do you hear that?

1759
01:21:20,224 --> 01:21:23,091
He wants to know
how you are doing?

1760
01:21:23,194 --> 01:21:27,028
And he has the straight face
of asking about it.

1761
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:29,531
<i>Sinvergüenza.</i>

1762
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:31,066
Good for nothing.

1763
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:32,658
<i>Callejero.</i>

1764
01:21:33,637 --> 01:21:36,538
<i>Que se la pasa por la calle... -</i>

1765
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,039
English! English!

1766
01:21:38,142 --> 01:21:40,542
I want my son speaking English.

1767
01:21:40,644 --> 01:21:42,578
Get out of my kitchen.

1768
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,375
Bad enough his name's Hector.

1769
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:46,381
Get out of my kitchen.

1770
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:48,815
I don't want to hear anything.

1771
01:21:48,919 --> 01:21:50,409
Out, I said.

1772
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,490
Yes, children.

1773
01:21:54,592 --> 01:21:57,789
This is the cool-out corner.

1774
01:21:57,895 --> 01:21:59,453
We're slowing it down

1775
01:21:59,563 --> 01:22:02,999
for all the lovers in the house.

1776
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,467
I'll be giving you
all the help you need.

1777
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,731
Musically, that is.

1778
01:22:08,839 --> 01:22:10,204
This shit is cold.

1779
01:22:10,307 --> 01:22:13,003
Supposed to be cold.
It's an ice cube.

1780
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,475
Later for your shit.

1781
01:22:14,578 --> 01:22:16,136
<i>Mira.</i>

1782
01:22:16,247 --> 01:22:17,475
<i>Mira.</i>

1783
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:18,639
What?

1784
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:20,649
You don't got a forehead.

1785
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:22,651
You got a eight-head.

1786
01:22:22,753 --> 01:22:24,653
Mookie, you're full of shit.

1787
01:22:24,755 --> 01:22:27,485
You got one of them
Sade foreheads.

1788
01:22:27,591 --> 01:22:28,649
Fuck you.

1789
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:30,693
Goddamn.
Big-ass forehead.

1790
01:22:30,794 --> 01:22:33,490
I need an iceberg...

1791
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,500
rather than this ice cube.

1792
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:42,436
Thank God for lips.

1793
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:46,838
Thank God for the neck.

1794
01:22:48,112 --> 01:22:50,376
Thank God for kneecaps.

1795
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:55,814
Thank God for elbows.

1796
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,946
Thank God for thighs.

1797
01:23:01,058 --> 01:23:03,618
Thank God
for the right nipple.

1798
01:23:05,062 --> 01:23:07,622
Thank God
for the left nipple.

1799
01:23:07,731 --> 01:23:08,663
Feels good.

1800
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:10,666
Ah. You likes.
You likes.

1801
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:12,429
You likes.

1802
01:23:12,536 --> 01:23:13,730
Amen.

1803
01:23:15,105 --> 01:23:16,970
I got to be going.

1804
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:18,473
You better come back.

1805
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:19,974
I'll be back tonight.

1806
01:23:20,077 --> 01:23:22,978
You better,
'cause I'll kick your ass.

1807
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,015
Oops. I got to be back then.

1808
01:23:26,116 --> 01:23:27,879
All right.

1809
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,382
All right.

1810
01:23:33,624 --> 01:23:34,682
All right.

1811
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,191
Get out of here.

1812
01:23:36,293 --> 01:23:37,692
I got to go.

1813
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:38,955
Bye.

1814
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:47,035
I'm not leaving yet.

1815
01:23:47,137 --> 01:23:48,502
Get out of here.

1816
01:23:48,605 --> 01:23:50,038
All right. Later.

1817
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,266
Later.

1818
01:23:53,744 --> 01:23:55,109
Just out of curiosity,

1819
01:23:55,212 --> 01:23:57,612
how long you
sticking around here?

1820
01:23:57,715 --> 01:23:59,080
You mean tonight?

1821
01:23:59,183 --> 01:24:00,741
I mean the neighborhood.

1822
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:02,751
I figure about 50 years.

1823
01:24:02,853 --> 01:24:05,253
'Cause I'm going into real estate.

1824
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:08,621
I'll put up a high-rise
in the neighborhood.

1825
01:24:08,726 --> 01:24:11,490
Yeah. Lot of people
want to move here.

1826
01:24:11,595 --> 01:24:12,459
Why not?

1827
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:13,894
You want a condominium?

1828
01:24:13,998 --> 01:24:16,330
A couple of straws, Mr. Trump.

1829
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:17,491
Trump's Pizza.

1830
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:18,966
I heard of that.

1831
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:20,661
That's Trump's Plaza.

1832
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:22,295
Get out of here.

1833
01:24:22,406 --> 01:24:23,964
Take care, Salvatore.

1834
01:24:24,074 --> 01:24:26,975
Pino, take the soft drinks
from the back

1835
01:24:27,077 --> 01:24:28,271
and load up here.

1836
01:24:28,379 --> 01:24:29,403
OK, Pop.

1837
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:32,845
You want me to deliver faster,

1838
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,645
I need a rocket... something.

1839
01:24:34,752 --> 01:24:36,185
I can't be running.

1840
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:38,151
The cheese lands on one side.

1841
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:39,984
Mookie, I didn't say nothing.

1842
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:42,888
You must have a guilty conscience.

1843
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:44,654
I'm not guilty of anything.

1844
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,161
You're guilty of something.

1845
01:24:46,263 --> 01:24:48,458
Otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.

1846
01:24:48,565 --> 01:24:49,862
Come on, Sal.

1847
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,366
Where we going?

1848
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:52,628
Oh, shit.

1849
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:56,363
Vito, give me a hand.

1850
01:24:59,743 --> 01:25:00,732
Come on.

1851
01:25:00,844 --> 01:25:02,835
What the fuck's the matter?

1852
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:10,618
Vito, I want you to listen to me.

1853
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:12,154
I'm your brother.

1854
01:25:12,256 --> 01:25:14,952
I smack you around
once in a while,

1855
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:16,993
but I'm still... your brother.

1856
01:25:17,094 --> 01:25:18,493
So what, Pino?

1857
01:25:18,595 --> 01:25:19,994
So fucking what?

1858
01:25:20,097 --> 01:25:23,260
I love you, man.

1859
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:26,768
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

1860
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,770
I want you to listen.

1861
01:25:28,872 --> 01:25:30,305
Jesus Christ, Pino.

1862
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:31,840
I said I'm listening.

1863
01:25:31,942 --> 01:25:33,307
Vito, black... white. No.

1864
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,970
No, no, no. No.

1865
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,480
What the hell
you talking about?

1866
01:25:38,582 --> 01:25:40,516
Are you listening to me?

1867
01:25:40,617 --> 01:25:41,982
Stop busting my balls.

1868
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:43,519
I said I'm listening.

1869
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,349
Mookie's not to be trusted.

1870
01:25:45,456 --> 01:25:46,821
I trust him, Pino.

1871
01:25:46,924 --> 01:25:48,323
They can't be trusted.

1872
01:25:48,425 --> 01:25:50,484
First time you turn your back...

1873
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:51,652
Boom. Aah!

1874
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:53,593
The spear in the back.

1875
01:25:53,697 --> 01:25:55,597
How do you know this?

1876
01:25:55,699 --> 01:25:57,599
How do you know, man?

1877
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:59,134
I know. I read.

1878
01:25:59,236 --> 01:26:01,431
I never seen you read nothing

1879
01:26:01,538 --> 01:26:02,971
in your fucking life.

1880
01:26:03,073 --> 01:26:04,472
Read your history.

1881
01:26:04,575 --> 01:26:05,473
It's historical.

1882
01:26:05,576 --> 01:26:07,942
He, them...
They're not to be trusted.

1883
01:26:08,045 --> 01:26:10,809
What do you want me to do?

1884
01:26:10,914 --> 01:26:12,313
Be on fucking guard.

1885
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:13,781
Mookie has Pop conned,

1886
01:26:13,884 --> 01:26:16,785
so we got to look out for him.

1887
01:26:16,887 --> 01:26:19,321
You don't know
what you're saying.

1888
01:26:19,423 --> 01:26:21,288
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1889
01:26:21,391 --> 01:26:23,791
Vito! Pino! Let's go!

1890
01:26:23,894 --> 01:26:25,794
We'll be right there, Pop.

1891
01:26:25,896 --> 01:26:26,954
One minute.

1892
01:26:27,064 --> 01:26:29,965
You better listen to what I say.

1893
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:33,525
I'll rip you.
I'll fuck you up.

1894
01:26:35,739 --> 01:26:37,138
You know something, Pino?

1895
01:26:37,241 --> 01:26:39,971
You don't know everything
you think you know.

1896
01:26:40,077 --> 01:26:42,807
You think you know,
but you don't know.

1897
01:26:42,913 --> 01:26:45,848
Mookie, he listens to me.
You don't, man.

1898
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:47,746
You fucking don't.

1899
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,412
You'll fucking stab me
in the back, man.

1900
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,267
Radio!

1901
01:27:04,368 --> 01:27:05,801
Buggin', what's up?

1902
01:27:05,903 --> 01:27:07,302
How you been, man?

1903
01:27:07,404 --> 01:27:08,769
Living large, bro.

1904
01:27:08,872 --> 01:27:11,306
Yo, that the only tape you gots?

1905
01:27:11,408 --> 01:27:13,467
You don't like
Public Enemy, man?

1906
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:14,942
The shit's dope.

1907
01:27:15,045 --> 01:27:18,276
I'm down, but you don't be
playing nothing else.

1908
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:20,282
I don't like nothing else.

1909
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:22,318
Yo, check this.
You know Sal?

1910
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:23,943
Yeah, I know
that motherfucker.

1911
01:27:24,054 --> 01:27:26,488
I've been trying
to organize a boycott

1912
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:27,989
of Sal's Famous.

1913
01:27:28,091 --> 01:27:30,958
I almost had to bust him
in the head today.

1914
01:27:31,061 --> 01:27:33,461
Gonna tell me...
Tell me, Radio Raheem...

1915
01:27:33,564 --> 01:27:36,465
to turn down my box
and shit, man,

1916
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:38,467
and didn't even say "please."

1917
01:27:38,569 --> 01:27:41,504
Who the fuck he think
he is, Don Corleone?

1918
01:27:41,605 --> 01:27:43,971
He make much money
off us black people,

1919
01:27:44,074 --> 01:27:46,975
and all he got on the wall
is Italians...

1920
01:27:47,077 --> 01:27:49,511
Sylvester Stallone,
okey-doke-lookin' motherfuckers.

1921
01:27:49,613 --> 01:27:51,012
On the strength.

1922
01:27:51,114 --> 01:27:52,411
We shouldn't buy one slice,

1923
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:53,915
spend one penny in there

1924
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:56,918
till he put folks of color
on that wall.

1925
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,453
That's what I'm saying!

1926
01:27:58,555 --> 01:27:59,920
You got my back?

1927
01:28:00,023 --> 01:28:01,422
Your back is got.

1928
01:28:01,525 --> 01:28:02,583
My bro.

1929
01:28:02,693 --> 01:28:03,751
My bro.

1930
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,919
Yo, Smiley.
Come here, man.

1931
01:28:06,029 --> 01:28:07,621
What you listening to?

1932
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:12,627
M- M-M-Malcolm.

1933
01:28:12,736 --> 01:28:13,930
M- M-M-Malcolm, huh?

1934
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:15,971
Cut off that rap music!

1935
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:18,974
I'm in here trying to get me
some motherfucking...

1936
01:28:19,076 --> 01:28:20,976
I'll fuck you up quick!

1937
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:22,136
Two times!

1938
01:28:22,246 --> 01:28:26,979
Th-Th-Th-Three t-times!

1939
01:28:27,084 --> 01:28:28,073
Th...

1940
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:30,584
Sal, start counting
my money tonight

1941
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:33,247
'cause I gots to get paid.

1942
01:28:36,093 --> 01:28:38,118
Come on, Vito.
Come on.

1943
01:28:45,068 --> 01:28:47,127
This is terrific.

1944
01:28:47,237 --> 01:28:51,298
I mean we had
a great, great day.

1945
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:54,070
You know something?

1946
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:56,077
There's nothing like a family

1947
01:28:56,179 --> 01:28:57,976
in business working together.

1948
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:00,948
I'm going to rename the place.

1949
01:29:01,051 --> 01:29:02,916
I'm going to call it

1950
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,454
Sal and Sons'
Famous Pizzeria.

1951
01:29:05,555 --> 01:29:06,579
Why not?

1952
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:10,251
You guys are going to
take it over someday, right?

1953
01:29:11,561 --> 01:29:13,256
And, Mookie...

1954
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,665
Mookie, I want to tell you

1955
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:20,203
that there's always
going to be a place for you

1956
01:29:20,304 --> 01:29:22,169
right here
at Sal's Famous Pizzeria

1957
01:29:22,272 --> 01:29:25,366
because you've always
been like a son to me.

1958
01:29:25,475 --> 01:29:27,875
Sal! Can we get some pizza?

1959
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:28,967
We're closed!

1960
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:29,977
Shut up!

1961
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,445
You shut up!

1962
01:29:31,548 --> 01:29:33,482
Shut the fuck up, man!

1963
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,210
All right, let them in.

1964
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:36,946
They love my pizza.

1965
01:29:37,054 --> 01:29:38,681
Four slices, and I'm gone.

1966
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:41,223
Sal, we're trying to go home!

1967
01:29:41,325 --> 01:29:42,189
Shut up!

1968
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:44,226
You're a delivery boy, bitch!

1969
01:29:44,328 --> 01:29:46,193
Man, you don't know shit!

1970
01:29:46,296 --> 01:29:47,695
Shut the fuck up!

1971
01:29:47,798 --> 01:29:49,732
Sit your black ass down!

1972
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,198
Shut up! Fuck you!

1973
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:53,599
Yo, Sal.
Four slices, man, regular.

1974
01:29:53,704 --> 01:29:55,069
To go, all right?

1975
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:56,605
Why you gotta curse?

1976
01:29:56,707 --> 01:29:57,731
Looking good.

1977
01:29:57,841 --> 01:29:59,240
Looking real good, man.

1978
01:29:59,343 --> 01:30:01,243
Come on.
Move it, man!

1979
01:30:15,692 --> 01:30:18,024
I told you about that noise!

1980
01:30:18,128 --> 01:30:19,618
What about them pictures?

1981
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,595
What the fuck, are you deaf?

1982
01:30:21,698 --> 01:30:23,427
No! Are you?
Fuck you!

1983
01:30:23,533 --> 01:30:25,398
We want some black people

1984
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:28,699
on that motherfucking
wall of fame now!

1985
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:30,705
We're trying
to go fucking home!

1986
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:32,331
We've been here all day!

1987
01:30:32,442 --> 01:30:35,002
Turn that jungle music off!
This ain't Africa!

1988
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:37,512
Why it got to be
about jungle music?

1989
01:30:37,614 --> 01:30:39,514
Why it got to be about Africa?

1990
01:30:39,616 --> 01:30:41,584
It's about them fucking pictures!

1991
01:30:41,685 --> 01:30:43,516
It's about turning that shit off

1992
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,417
and getting out of my place!

1993
01:30:45,522 --> 01:30:46,454
Radio Raheem!

1994
01:30:46,556 --> 01:30:47,488
Fuck you!

1995
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:48,922
And fuck you, too!

1996
01:30:49,025 --> 01:30:51,585
Kick ass, Sal!
Get in there, Pino!

1997
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:53,060
This is music!

1998
01:30:53,163 --> 01:30:54,095
My music!

1999
01:30:54,197 --> 01:30:56,324
Fuck your music!

2000
01:30:56,433 --> 01:30:58,060
Well, turn it off, then!

2001
01:30:58,168 --> 01:31:00,796
Get the fuck out of here!
We're closed!

2002
01:31:00,904 --> 01:31:01,871
Fuck you!

2003
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:04,907
We're closing you
guinea bastards for good!

2004
01:31:05,008 --> 01:31:06,407
For good, motherfucker!

2005
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,876
Until you get some black people

2006
01:31:08,979 --> 01:31:11,413
on that motherfucking
wall of fame!

2007
01:31:11,515 --> 01:31:13,415
You're gonna fucking close me?

2008
01:31:13,517 --> 01:31:14,916
You're goddamn right!

2009
01:31:15,018 --> 01:31:16,417
You black cocksucker!

2010
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,489
I'll fucking tear
your fucking nigger ass!

2011
01:31:19,589 --> 01:31:20,988
Oh, we're niggers now?

2012
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:22,991
We niggers now.
Fuck them up!

2013
01:31:23,093 --> 01:31:24,492
You fucking white trash!

2014
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,152
I'll fuck you up!

2015
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:28,561
Sal, put the fucking bat down!

2016
01:31:28,665 --> 01:31:31,099
Come on,
you fucking guinea trash!

2017
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:33,260
Open the motherfucking counter!

2018
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:35,804
You black cocksucker!

2019
01:31:35,906 --> 01:31:38,534
You nigger motherfucker!

2020
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:20,810
I just killed your fucking radio.

2021
01:32:26,189 --> 01:32:27,656
My music!

2022
01:32:27,757 --> 01:32:29,190
You motherfucking...

2023
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,691
Aah!

2024
01:32:30,794 --> 01:32:32,352
Get off him!

2025
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:33,861
Get off him!

2026
01:32:33,964 --> 01:32:35,864
Get the fuck off him!

2027
01:32:35,966 --> 01:32:38,025
Get off him!
Get off!

2028
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,895
You fucked up my eye!

2029
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,639
Ahmad, stop!
Please, stop it!

2030
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:47,039
Stop it!

2031
01:32:47,143 --> 01:32:50,203
You fucked with my box, man!

2032
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:06,122
Stop it!

2033
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:07,491
Get the fuck up!

2034
01:33:07,597 --> 01:33:09,497
I'll kick your ass some more!

2035
01:33:09,599 --> 01:33:10,793
Come on!

2036
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:21,010
Somebody got it at Sal's, brother!

2037
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:22,203
Fight!

2038
01:33:22,312 --> 01:33:24,337
Mookie!

2039
01:33:36,226 --> 01:33:37,124
Hey!

2040
01:33:37,227 --> 01:33:38,592
Break it up!

2041
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:39,627
Hey! Hey!

2042
01:33:39,729 --> 01:33:41,094
Break it up!

2043
01:33:41,197 --> 01:33:42,562
Break it up!

2044
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:44,497
You're gonna kill him!

2045
01:33:44,601 --> 01:33:46,501
- Stop it!
- Break it up!

2046
01:33:46,603 --> 01:33:47,934
Stop it!

2047
01:33:48,038 --> 01:33:50,233
Stop! Break it up!

2048
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,830
You're gonna kill him!

2049
01:33:57,547 --> 01:33:58,946
Let me at 'em.

2050
01:33:59,049 --> 01:34:00,778
Let me at 'em!

2051
01:34:00,884 --> 01:34:01,976
Get...

2052
01:34:02,085 --> 01:34:04,315
Get the fuck out
of the way, man!

2053
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:05,410
Move it!

2054
01:34:05,522 --> 01:34:06,454
Get off!

2055
01:34:06,556 --> 01:34:08,285
Let me through!

2056
01:34:08,391 --> 01:34:09,722
Get the big guy!

2057
01:34:09,826 --> 01:34:11,259
Let me through!

2058
01:34:11,361 --> 01:34:12,760
Get off me!

2059
01:34:12,862 --> 01:34:14,295
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

2060
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:16,297
Just take him off me!

2061
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:17,593
Get away!

2062
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,635
What are you doing? Sal!

2063
01:34:19,736 --> 01:34:21,465
Get the fuck off me!

2064
01:34:21,571 --> 01:34:22,936
Get off of me!

2065
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:24,939
You're taking me to jail, huh?

2066
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,805
You're not taking Vito
or Pino or Sal out!

2067
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:29,811
Get the fuck off me!

2068
01:34:29,913 --> 01:34:30,971
Aah!

2069
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,480
Get his other arm!

2070
01:34:32,582 --> 01:34:33,514
Get his other arm!

2071
01:34:33,617 --> 01:34:36,484
Take him down!
Take him down!

2072
01:34:36,586 --> 01:34:38,451
Just take him down, man!

2073
01:34:38,555 --> 01:34:40,216
Let him go, goddamn it!

2074
01:34:40,323 --> 01:34:41,688
You're killing him!

2075
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,190
Give it up, asshole!

2076
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:45,158
Aah! Aah!

2077
01:34:45,261 --> 01:34:46,694
Just take him down!

2078
01:34:46,796 --> 01:34:47,820
Come on!

2079
01:34:47,931 --> 01:34:48,955
Aah!

2080
01:34:49,065 --> 01:34:50,498
Let him go!

2081
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,431
Stop it, goddamn it!

2082
01:34:52,535 --> 01:34:53,729
Stop it!

2083
01:34:53,837 --> 01:34:54,769
Aah!

2084
01:34:54,871 --> 01:34:56,429
Get his arm!

2085
01:34:56,539 --> 01:34:57,972
Gary, that's enough!

2086
01:34:58,074 --> 01:34:58,972
Shut up.

2087
01:34:59,075 --> 01:35:00,474
Gary, that's enough, man!

2088
01:35:02,512 --> 01:35:03,911
Gary, that's enough!

2089
01:35:04,014 --> 01:35:05,413
Shut the fuck up!

2090
01:35:05,515 --> 01:35:07,005
Radio Raheem!

2091
01:35:07,117 --> 01:35:08,414
Radio Raheem!

2092
01:35:08,518 --> 01:35:09,746
No!

2093
01:35:09,853 --> 01:35:11,081
Radio!

2094
01:35:12,355 --> 01:35:13,447
Radio Raheem!

2095
01:35:13,556 --> 01:35:15,353
Radio Raheem!

2096
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:17,016
Get up!
You ain't dead!

2097
01:35:17,127 --> 01:35:18,526
Get up, asshole!

2098
01:35:18,628 --> 01:35:20,027
Quit faking it!

2099
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,563
Get up, asshole!

2100
01:35:21,665 --> 01:35:23,030
Get the fuck up!

2101
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,930
Let's get him out of here.

2102
01:35:25,035 --> 01:35:27,936
Goddamn it!
I'm a black man!

2103
01:35:28,038 --> 01:35:29,903
You can't kill us all!

2104
01:35:30,006 --> 01:35:33,100
You can't fucking
kill us all, goddamn it!

2105
01:35:33,209 --> 01:35:34,608
Motherfucker!

2106
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:37,202
Let's get him out of here!

2107
01:35:37,313 --> 01:35:38,337
Come on!

2108
01:35:39,282 --> 01:35:40,977
Get him to the car.

2109
01:35:41,084 --> 01:35:43,143
Get him to the car.
Let's go.

2110
01:35:47,424 --> 01:35:49,551
Back off, assholes!

2111
01:35:49,659 --> 01:35:51,092
You pig-fucking murderers!

2112
01:35:51,194 --> 01:35:53,424
You can't kill us all, man!

2113
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:55,521
You can't fucking kill us all!

2114
01:35:55,632 --> 01:35:56,564
Back off!

2115
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,099
Back off! Back off!

2116
01:35:58,201 --> 01:35:59,566
Everybody, back off!

2117
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:01,068
Get back!

2118
01:36:01,171 --> 01:36:02,195
Fucking bastards!

2119
01:36:02,305 --> 01:36:03,704
Shut up, man.

2120
01:36:03,807 --> 01:36:05,240
Fuck off, you fucking...

2121
01:36:05,341 --> 01:36:06,273
Damn it!

2122
01:36:06,376 --> 01:36:08,435
I told you to shut up!

2123
01:36:09,546 --> 01:36:10,638
Back off!

2124
01:36:10,747 --> 01:36:11,771
Radio!

2125
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:13,348
Back off!

2126
01:36:22,525 --> 01:36:25,983
Radio!

2127
01:36:44,614 --> 01:36:46,445
Mookie, they killed him.

2128
01:36:46,549 --> 01:36:47,982
They killed Radio Raheem!

2129
01:36:48,084 --> 01:36:49,142
It's murder.

2130
01:36:49,252 --> 01:36:51,880
They did it again,
just like Michael Stewart.

2131
01:36:51,988 --> 01:36:53,387
Murder!
Eleanor Bumpers! Murder!

2132
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:55,219
Damn, man!
It ain't safe

2133
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:56,917
in our own fucking neighborhood!

2134
01:36:57,026 --> 01:36:58,891
Never was.
Never will be.

2135
01:36:58,995 --> 01:37:02,897
We ain't gonna stand
for this shit no more, Sal.

2136
01:37:02,999 --> 01:37:05,900
Ain't gonna stand for
no fucking police, punk!

2137
01:37:06,002 --> 01:37:08,163
It's as plain as day.

2138
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:11,172
They didn't have
to kill the boy.

2139
01:37:38,034 --> 01:37:40,434
You do what you gotta do.

2140
01:37:40,537 --> 01:37:41,936
Fuck that, man!

2141
01:37:42,038 --> 01:37:44,029
Listen, listen, listen.
Good people, please.

2142
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,505
Let's all go home.

2143
01:37:45,608 --> 01:37:47,007
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

2144
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:48,509
Yeah. You, boy!

2145
01:37:48,611 --> 01:37:50,602
If we don't stop this now,

2146
01:37:50,713 --> 01:37:53,204
we gonna do something
we're gonna regret

2147
01:37:53,316 --> 01:37:55,216
for the rest of our lives.

2148
01:37:55,318 --> 01:37:58,310
Sal had nothing to do
with what the cops did.

2149
01:37:58,421 --> 01:38:01,083
One of the police was black!

2150
01:38:01,191 --> 01:38:02,818
Leave him alone.

2151
01:38:02,926 --> 01:38:05,952
We'll get you
and them three stooges, Sal.

2152
01:38:06,062 --> 01:38:08,360
Go on, Mr. Sal.

2153
01:38:08,464 --> 01:38:11,194
You see how they had him
in a choke hold?

2154
01:38:11,301 --> 01:38:14,202
I knew that choke hold
would kill him!

2155
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:15,737
You might have saved him!

2156
01:38:15,839 --> 01:38:17,204
A fucking radio!

2157
01:38:17,307 --> 01:38:19,673
He died because of a fucking radio!

2158
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,711
He wanted pictures
on the wall, and he died!

2159
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:24,837
What you got to say, Sal?

2160
01:38:31,888 --> 01:38:33,412
Your son called the cops!

2161
01:38:33,523 --> 01:38:36,424
Get the fuck out of here, man!

2162
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:37,925
Somebody's getting hurt!

2163
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:39,585
Fuck that, man!

2164
01:38:49,539 --> 01:38:50,972
Hate!

2165
01:38:51,074 --> 01:38:52,371
Ohh!

2166
01:38:52,475 --> 01:38:53,533
Whoo!
Whoo!

2167
01:38:53,643 --> 01:38:54,871
Whoo!
Whoo!

2168
01:38:54,978 --> 01:38:56,969
Whoo!
Whoo!

2169
01:39:32,615 --> 01:39:34,014
What are they doing?

2170
01:39:34,117 --> 01:39:35,482
What are they doing?

2171
01:39:35,585 --> 01:39:37,780
Sal, come on.
Come on, quick.

2172
01:39:37,887 --> 01:39:39,582
Get them out of there!

2173
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:40,781
Get...

2174
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,619
That's my place!

2175
01:39:42,725 --> 01:39:44,454
That's my fucking place!

2176
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,652
Sal!

2177
01:39:45,762 --> 01:39:47,286
Fucking niggers.

2178
01:39:59,075 --> 01:40:00,565
Radio! Radio!

2179
01:40:00,677 --> 01:40:02,144
Radio! Radio!

2180
01:40:02,245 --> 01:40:04,145
Burn it down!
Burn it down!

2181
01:40:04,247 --> 01:40:05,908
Radio! Radio!

2182
01:40:06,015 --> 01:40:07,505
Radio! Radio!

2183
01:40:07,617 --> 01:40:09,244
Radio! Radio!

2184
01:40:09,352 --> 01:40:11,411
Radio! Radio!

2185
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:13,216
Radio! Radio!

2186
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:24,923
Come on.
Let's clean house.

2187
01:40:25,034 --> 01:40:26,558
Shit. Come on.

2188
01:40:30,006 --> 01:40:32,406
I no white.
I no white!

2189
01:40:32,508 --> 01:40:33,907
It's your turn, sucker!

2190
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:36,069
I no white!
I no white!

2191
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:37,908
I no white!
I'm black!

2192
01:40:38,014 --> 01:40:38,946
What?

2193
01:40:39,048 --> 01:40:40,037
I black!

2194
01:40:40,149 --> 01:40:41,047
Me black!

2195
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:42,549
Where you black at?

2196
01:40:42,652 --> 01:40:43,584
Me black!

2197
01:40:43,686 --> 01:40:44,584
I'm black!

2198
01:40:44,687 --> 01:40:46,587
You, me... same!

2199
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:49,791
We same.

2200
01:40:51,627 --> 01:40:52,855
Same?

2201
01:40:52,962 --> 01:40:54,486
Me black!

2202
01:40:55,965 --> 01:40:57,865
Open your eyes, motherfucker!

2203
01:40:57,967 --> 01:41:00,367
ML, leave the Korean alone, man.

2204
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,097
He's all right.

2205
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:07,370
Yeah? He's all right.

2206
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:08,374
He's black.

2207
01:41:08,478 --> 01:41:10,173
Shit.

2208
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,035
Oh, fuck you, man!

2209
01:41:40,143 --> 01:41:42,407

2229
01:42:15,411 --> 01:42:17,470
We're giving you
one more warning

2230
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,945
to please go home!

2231
01:42:19,048 --> 01:42:20,413
This is our home!

2232
01:42:20,516 --> 01:42:22,416
OK, you've had your warning!

2233
01:42:22,518 --> 01:42:24,986
Hose that black sucker down!

2234
01:42:25,088 --> 01:42:26,350
Aah!
Aah!

2235
01:42:26,456 --> 01:42:28,390
Aah! Aah!

2236
01:42:38,434 --> 01:42:39,492
Aah!

2237
01:42:39,602 --> 01:42:41,126
Get off of me!

2238
01:42:48,744 --> 01:42:49,802
Yo!

2239
01:42:49,912 --> 01:42:50,970
Yo!

2240
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:51,910
Yo!

2241
01:42:52,014 --> 01:42:54,141
Well, come on! Come on!

2242
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:06,919
Come on, asshole.
Come on!

2243
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:08,428
Come on. Move it.

2244
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:09,964
Motherfucker, come on!

2245
01:43:10,066 --> 01:43:12,466
What you think this is, Birmingham?

2246
01:43:12,568 --> 01:43:13,432
Fucking Alabama.

2247
01:43:13,536 --> 01:43:14,969
Yo, where's Bull Connor?

2248
01:43:15,071 --> 01:43:19,770
Son of a bitch!

2249
01:43:19,876 --> 01:43:21,104
Oh, no!

2250
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:23,269
No!

2251
01:43:23,379 --> 01:43:25,438
No!

2252
01:43:25,548 --> 01:43:27,709
No!

2253
01:43:27,817 --> 01:43:30,650
Oh, no!

2254
01:43:30,753 --> 01:43:32,880
No!

2255
01:43:32,989 --> 01:43:35,457
No!

2256
01:43:35,558 --> 01:43:36,991
Oh, no!

2257
01:43:37,093 --> 01:43:39,789
No!

2258
01:43:39,896 --> 01:43:42,456
No!

2259
01:43:42,565 --> 01:43:45,864
No!

2260
01:43:45,968 --> 01:43:48,232
No!

2261
01:43:48,337 --> 01:43:50,601
No!

2262
01:43:50,706 --> 01:43:53,903
No!

2263
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:56,638
No!

2264
01:43:56,746 --> 01:43:59,112
No!

2265
01:43:59,215 --> 01:44:01,410
No!

2266
01:44:01,517 --> 01:44:03,849
No!

2267
01:44:03,953 --> 01:44:06,513
No!

2268
01:44:06,622 --> 01:44:09,022
No!

2269
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:15,880
My people, my people...

2270
01:45:15,992 --> 01:45:17,391
What can I say?

2271
01:45:17,493 --> 01:45:19,427
Say what I can?

2272
01:45:19,528 --> 01:45:22,429
I saw it, but I didn't believe it.

2273
01:45:22,531 --> 01:45:25,762
I didn't believe it, what I saw.

2274
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:27,961
Are we going to live together?

2275
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:31,005
Together are we going to live?

2276
01:45:31,107 --> 01:45:33,473
This is your
Mister Señor Love Daddy

2277
01:45:33,576 --> 01:45:36,010
talking to you
from We-Love radio,

2278
01:45:36,112 --> 01:45:38,410
108 FM on your dial,

2279
01:45:38,514 --> 01:45:41,574
and that's the triple truth, Ruth.

2280
01:45:41,684 --> 01:45:44,244
<i>Today's weather?</i>

2281
01:45:44,353 --> 01:45:45,377
<i>Hot!</i>

2282
01:45:49,325 --> 01:45:50,792
<i>Wake up!</i>

2283
01:45:52,595 --> 01:45:54,085
Fuck!

2284
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:55,629
My money. Shit!

2285
01:45:55,731 --> 01:45:57,289
Where are you going?

2286
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:58,594
To get my money.

2287
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:00,100
Don't try that shit, OK?

2288
01:46:00,202 --> 01:46:02,102
You're going to run out,

2289
01:46:02,204 --> 01:46:04,604
and I won't see your ass
for another week.

2290
01:46:04,707 --> 01:46:05,935
It's not like that.

2291
01:46:06,042 --> 01:46:08,408
You don't give
a fucking shit about me,

2292
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:11,446
and you don't
give a shit about your son.

2293
01:46:11,547 --> 01:46:13,981
I care about you and my son.

2294
01:46:14,083 --> 01:46:15,983
Why don't you be a man?

2295
01:46:16,085 --> 01:46:17,347
I am a man.

2296
01:46:17,453 --> 01:46:18,818
Then act like a man.

2297
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:21,321
Why don't you be
a fucking man, Mookie?

2298
01:46:21,424 --> 01:46:23,324
I'm so tired of your shit.

2299
01:46:23,426 --> 01:46:26,327
Why do we have to
go over this again?

2300
01:46:26,429 --> 01:46:28,863
Because you don't
fucking listen, Mookie!

2301
01:46:28,964 --> 01:46:30,329
If you listen to me,

2302
01:46:30,433 --> 01:46:32,333
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2303
01:46:32,435 --> 01:46:33,663
like a fucking radio!

2304
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:35,669
What kind of mother you are

2305
01:46:35,771 --> 01:46:37,170
using fucking language like that?

2306
01:46:37,273 --> 01:46:39,207
What kind of mother am I?

2307
01:46:39,308 --> 01:46:41,173
Your ass isn't even here!

2308
01:46:41,277 --> 01:46:42,938
Get another vocabulary, right?

2309
01:46:43,045 --> 01:46:44,410
Get a fucking life.

2310
01:46:44,513 --> 01:46:45,878
Yeah. Look...

2311
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:46,845
Look what?

2312
01:46:46,949 --> 01:46:48,211
I'll be back.

2313
01:46:48,317 --> 01:46:50,182
Don't leave, Mookie.
Don't leave.

2314
01:46:50,286 --> 01:46:51,981
I'm tired of this shit.

2315
01:46:52,088 --> 01:46:54,249
You walk out that door, that's it.

2316
01:46:54,357 --> 01:46:55,381
All right?

2317
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:59,928
I have to get my money from Sal.
I'll be back.

2318
01:47:00,029 --> 01:47:03,931
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired of it.

2319
01:47:04,033 --> 01:47:05,398
You need to step off

2320
01:47:05,501 --> 01:47:07,059
with your stupid-ass self.

2321
01:47:07,169 --> 01:47:10,070
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,

2322
01:47:10,172 --> 01:47:12,732
because the one you got
is not working!

2323
01:47:12,842 --> 01:47:16,209
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2324
01:47:16,312 --> 01:47:18,212
Shit.
Fucking ass, stupid ass,

2325
01:47:18,314 --> 01:47:19,906
<i>fucking pendejo.</i>

2326
01:47:20,015 --> 01:47:22,677
Shit. Fuck.
Fucking shit.

2327
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,480
Good morning.

2328
01:47:27,757 --> 01:47:29,691
Is it a good morning?

2329
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:32,056
Yes, indeed.

2330
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:35,221
You almost got yourself
killed last night.

2331
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:38,924
I've done that before.

2332
01:47:44,273 --> 01:47:45,797
Where did you sleep?

2333
01:47:47,977 --> 01:47:49,035
I didn't.

2334
01:47:52,815 --> 01:47:56,376
I hope the block is still standing.

2335
01:47:56,485 --> 01:47:58,077
We're still standing.

2336
01:48:39,094 --> 01:48:40,493
What do you want?

2337
01:48:40,596 --> 01:48:42,996
I want my money.
I want to get paid.

2338
01:48:43,098 --> 01:48:45,032
You don't work here no more.

2339
01:48:45,134 --> 01:48:46,328
I want my money.

2340
01:48:46,435 --> 01:48:48,369
Your money couldn't begin to pay

2341
01:48:48,471 --> 01:48:49,836
for the window you broke.

2342
01:48:49,939 --> 01:48:52,271
Motherfuck a window.
Radio Raheem is dead.

2343
01:48:52,374 --> 01:48:54,774
I know he's dead.
I was here, remember?

2344
01:48:54,877 --> 01:48:56,777
He's dead because of his buddy.

2345
01:48:56,879 --> 01:48:58,278
That cocksucker started this shit.

2346
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,314
He's responsible
for that kid's death.

2347
01:49:00,416 --> 01:49:01,781
He wanted to close me,

2348
01:49:01,884 --> 01:49:04,216
and you stood there like a fuck

2349
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,151
and watched them
burn me down!

2350
01:49:06,322 --> 01:49:08,620
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem.

2351
01:49:08,724 --> 01:49:12,160
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal.

2352
01:49:12,261 --> 01:49:14,195
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

2353
01:49:14,296 --> 01:49:15,490
This ain't about money.

2354
01:49:15,598 --> 01:49:17,498
I could give a fuck
about money.

2355
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,828
You see this place?

2356
01:49:18,934 --> 01:49:21,232
I built this fucking place!

2357
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:23,464
With my bare fucking hands!

2358
01:49:23,572 --> 01:49:26,507
Every light socket,
every piece of tile.

2359
01:49:26,609 --> 01:49:28,509
Me! With these fucking hands!

2360
01:49:28,611 --> 01:49:30,545
You know what that means?

2361
01:49:30,646 --> 01:49:33,046
It means pay me
my motherfucking money.

2362
01:49:33,148 --> 01:49:34,740
That's what it means, Sal.

2363
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:36,784
OK, Mookie.

2364
01:49:36,886 --> 01:49:39,116
How much do I owe you?

2365
01:49:39,221 --> 01:49:42,384
My salary is 250.
250 a week.

2366
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:51,561
1...

2367
01:49:51,667 --> 01:49:53,532
that's 2...

2368
01:49:53,636 --> 01:49:55,968
that's 3...

2369
01:49:56,071 --> 01:49:57,766
that's 4...

2370
01:49:57,873 --> 01:49:59,807
and that's 5.

2371
01:49:59,909 --> 01:50:02,400
You got $500.
You're a rich fucking man.

2372
01:50:02,511 --> 01:50:04,672
Are you happy?
You happy?

2373
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:07,749
He's got 500 fucking dollars!

2374
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:09,249
He's a big man!

2375
01:50:09,351 --> 01:50:11,046
He's a rich fucking man!

2376
01:50:11,153 --> 01:50:14,452
He's never going to have
any more trouble!

2377
01:50:14,557 --> 01:50:15,751
Not Mookie!

2378
01:50:15,858 --> 01:50:17,348
He's fucking rich!

2379
01:50:17,459 --> 01:50:18,858
Who the fuck you yelling at?

2380
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:20,360
You're wealthy, Mookie.

2381
01:50:20,462 --> 01:50:22,521
You're a real fucking Rockefeller.

2382
01:50:23,532 --> 01:50:26,990
You got your fucking pay.
Now leave me alone.

2383
01:50:27,102 --> 01:50:29,900
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

2384
01:50:31,974 --> 01:50:33,703
I owe you 50 bucks.

2385
01:50:33,809 --> 01:50:34,707
Keep it.

2386
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:35,708
You keep it.

2387
01:50:35,811 --> 01:50:36,709
You keep it.

2388
01:50:36,812 --> 01:50:37,710
You keep it.

2389
01:50:37,813 --> 01:50:38,711
No, you keep it.

2390
01:50:38,814 --> 01:50:40,008
You keep it.

2391
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:45,846
I don't believe this shit.

2392
01:50:45,955 --> 01:50:47,081
Believe it.

2393
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:50,725
Are you sick?

2394
01:50:50,826 --> 01:50:54,819
I'm hot as a motherfucker.
I'm all right, though.

2395
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:58,491
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today.

2396
01:51:01,737 --> 01:51:04,604
What are you going
to do with yourself?

2397
01:51:04,707 --> 01:51:06,766
Make that money.
Get paid.

2398
01:51:07,843 --> 01:51:10,209
Sal, I got to go see my son

2399
01:51:10,312 --> 01:51:12,940
if it's all right with you.

2400
01:51:21,023 --> 01:51:23,423
<i>Hey, Mook.
It's the Mook man.</i>

2401
01:51:23,525 --> 01:51:26,289
<i>I see you walking.
Go home to your kid.</i>

2402
01:51:26,395 --> 01:51:27,953
<i>Now the news and weather.</i>

2403
01:51:28,063 --> 01:51:30,964
<i>Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...</i>

2404
01:51:31,066 --> 01:51:32,897
<i>"to get to the bottom</i>

2405
01:51:33,002 --> 01:51:34,196
<i>of last night's disturbance.</i>

2406
01:51:34,303 --> 01:51:35,702
<i>The City of New York</i>

2407
01:51:35,804 --> 01:51:38,238
<i>will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."</i>

2408
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,365
<i>His Honor plans to visit
our block today.</i>

2409
01:51:40,476 --> 01:51:42,876
<i>He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,</i>

2410
01:51:42,978 --> 01:51:44,377
<i>buy him a beer.</i>

2411
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,914
<i>Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.</i>

2412
01:51:47,016 --> 01:51:48,881
<i>The election is coming up.</i>

2413
01:51:48,984 --> 01:51:51,919
<i>There's no end in sight
from this heat wave,</i>

2414
01:51:52,021 --> 01:51:54,353
<i>so today,
the cash money word is chill.</i>

2415
01:51:54,456 --> 01:51:56,754
<i>That's right. C-h-i-l-I.</i>

2416
01:51:56,859 --> 01:52:00,454
<i>When you hear "chill,"

2417
01:52:00,562 --> 01:52:02,860

cash money, honey.</i>

2418
01:52:02,965 --> 01:52:04,865

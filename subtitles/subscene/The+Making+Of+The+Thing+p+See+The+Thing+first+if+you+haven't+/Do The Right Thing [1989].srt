I brushed my teeth?

182
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Your breath stinks?

183
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
It's your upper lip?

184

I been calling him all week?

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,400
He won't come around
unless he has a police escort?

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Pino, get a broom
and sweep up front?

Sweep up the front?

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Get a broom
and sweep out front!

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
See? Every time
you tell Pino what to do,

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,200
he tells me what to do?

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,600
He's brain-dead, Pop, for years?

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Both of you, shut up?

204
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Tell Pino!

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Am I talking to myself?

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
I didn't want to come anyway?

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
I hate this frigging place?

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I detest it like a sickness?

209
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,000
You, you detest this place
like a sickness?

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's like really hate, you know?

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
That's hate?

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't say that?

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh, you didn't say that?

214
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
I just heard it?
Am I going crazy?

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Did I just hear that, Vito?

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
I mean, do you think
you can do better?

217
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
No, I didn't think so?

218
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
This is a respectable business,

219
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
and there's nothing wrong with that?

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
I mean, if there's
something wrong with that, tell me?

221
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
Is there something
wrong with that?

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
There's nothing wrong? OK?

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do me a favor?
Get a broom and sweep up?

224

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

362
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
and nobody don't bother
the Mayor but you?

363
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
The Mayor just tend
to his own business?

364
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
I love everybody?

365
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
I even love you?

366
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
Hold your tongue?

367
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
You don't have that much love?

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
One day you gonna be nice to me?

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,800
We may both be dead and buried,

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,200
but you gonna be nice?

371
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
At least civil?

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,400
I told you, I'm not going
to baby-sit for you,

373
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
and that's it!

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,200
What are you
talking about?

375
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Yesterday you said you would?

376
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,600
Now today
you're changing your mind?

377
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
No, I'm not changing...

378
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
¿Ay, Mommy,
que mucho jota?

379
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Get off of me, please!

380
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
I do everything for you?

381
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
You can't do shit for me!

382
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Yo tengo
el derecho de salirte.

383
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Right, right?
You know it's not like that, Mommy?

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
I can do everything for you,

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,200
but you won't do shit for me?

386
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Stop it!

387
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
That lady makes me sick!

388
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Your father makes me sick, too?

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Everybody makes me sick?

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Shit?

391
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Your father ain't no real father?

392
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
He's a bum?

393
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Chump change, to-the-curb,

394
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,600
pulling no major pub, bum!

395
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Mike?

396
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Fuck Mike Tyson!

397
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,400
I remember when he mugged
that woman on Lexington?

398
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I remember that shit?

399
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,600
You're going to tell him?

400
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
I'll tell him?
Fuck MikeTyson!

401
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
To his face?

402
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You god damn right!

403
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,200
He'll knock
your god damn ass off?

404
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
You talk shit now?

405
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,200
I'll drop him like a bad habit?

406
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
LfTyson dream about whipping my ass,

407
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
he better wake up and apologize?

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, gentlemen, the way I see it,

409
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
if this hot weather continues,

410
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
it's going to melt the polar caps

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and the whole wide world?

412
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And all those parts
that ain't water already

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,000
will surely be flooded?

414
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
You dumb ass, simple mother fucker!

415
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Where you read that shit, eh?

416
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
The polar caps?

417
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
Don't worry about it?

418
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
When it happens,
and I'm in my boat

419
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
and you black asses are drowning,

420
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,000
don't call for me
to throw you no rope,

421
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
no lifesaver, or no nothing?

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
You 30 cent away from a quarter?

423
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,000
How the fuck
you gonna get a boat?

424
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Here, boy?

425
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Don't worry about it?

426
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
god damn right?
Look at you?

427
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
You're raggedy as a roach,

428
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,200
eat the holes out of doughnuts?

429
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,600
Raggedy mother fucker!
Don't worry about it?

430
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm in good shape?

431
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
I will be?

432
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,600
I'll be back on my feet
soon enough?

433
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Look, raggedy-ass shoes!

434
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,600
So run over, you gotta
lay down to put 'em on?

435
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
So, ML, ML, ML, tell me?

436
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
When is all this god damn ice
supposed to melt?

437
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:27,600
[Vito]
Hello? Sal's Pizza?

438
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Yep?

439
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
Meatball hero,
eggplant parmesan?

440
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
You got it?

441
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah, we deliver?
Of course, we deliver?

442
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
All right? Where is that?

443
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
You going to pay now
or on layaway?

444
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
How much?

445
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
You been coming here
three times a day?

446
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
What are you, a retard?

447
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
It's $1? 50?

448
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Put some cheese
on that mother fucker?

449
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Extra cheese is $2? 00?

450
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
$2? 00?

451
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, $2? 00?

452
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,600
Hey, forget that shit?

453
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,800
Damn, Sal, you're cheap, man?

454
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,600
Yo, Mook!

455
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
Mookie! How come
ain't no brothers

456
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
up on the wall?

457
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Man, ask Sal, all right?

458
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
Hey, Sal, how come
ain't no brothers there?

459
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
You want brothers on the wall?

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Get your own place?

461
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
You can put your brothers and uncles,
nieces and nephews,

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
your stepfather, stepmother,
whoever you want?

463
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
But this is my pizzeria?

464
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000
American-Italians
on the wall only?

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Take it easy, Pop?

466
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,600
And you, hey, don't start
with me today?

467
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

468
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, that might be fine, Sal,

469
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
but you own this?

470
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Rarely do I see

471
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
any American-Italians eating in here?

472
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
All I see is black folks?

473
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Since we spend much money here,

474
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
we do have some say?

475
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
You looking for trouble?

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
are you a troublemaker,
is that what you are?

477
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker?

478
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm making trouble?

479
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
You're a ball-breaker?

480
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
You're always coming in here

481
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
looking for trouble, aren't you?

482
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Suppose I busted your head?
How would you??

483
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Mookie, you want to get
your friend out of here?

484
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,600
What, you gonna
kick me out now?

485
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm not?
You're kicking yourself out?

486
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
We want some brothers
up on the wall...

487
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
You know, Malcolm X,
Nelson Mandela,

488
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Michael Jordan!
Tomorrow!

489
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Mookie, get him out?

490
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm trying! Take your slice?

491
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I know you paid for it?

492
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
All right, you're kicking me out?

493
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Beat me on the head
and kick me out?

494
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
I paid for my...

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Look, boycott Sal's!
Boycott Sal's?

496
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I got your boycott swinging?

497
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Boycott Sal's?

498
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Yo, what you laughing at?

499
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
Mookie, I paid for my slice?

500
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I spend much money in there!

501
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
What are you trying to do?

502
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
I want brothers on the wall?

503
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,000
You're fucking my shit up?

504
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
It's between me and Sal?

505
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
You're fucking me up?

506
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
I ain't trying to fuck you up?
I'm sorry?

507
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
You're sorry?

508
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
In a week, it'll be squashed?

509
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
A week?

510
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
A week?

511
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah? Yeah?

512
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
All right?

513
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Bet?

514
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Bet?

515
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,000
Mook??

516
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Stay black!

517
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
This guy's your friend, right?

518
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
If I'm wrong, tell me?

519
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's my friend?

520
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
Lfhe don't behave,

521
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,200
I don't want him here anymore?

522
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
I can't do nothing?

523
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Talk brother talk to him?

524
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Brother talk?

525
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
People are free to do
whatever the hell they want?

526
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Free? What the hell
are you talking about?

527
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Free? There's no free here?

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm the boss?

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No freedom?
I'm the boss?

530
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
You want freedom?
There, that's free?

531
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Take that order out?
He's got an order?

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
Let's go? Come on!
Get to work!

533
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
You're standing here doing nothing?

534
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
You're afraid of the god damn oven?

535
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Hit the oven!

536
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
Is this the address?

537
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Is that the address?

538
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Is that what he just asked me?

539
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Mookie?

540
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
Come here, doctor?

541
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,600

00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,000
OK, but listen up?

905
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm going to break it down?

906
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,400
Let it be broke?

907
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Can you dig it?

908
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
It's dug?

909
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Look at those Korean mother fuckers
across the street?

910
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Bet they haven't been
off the boat a year

911
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,600
before they opened
their own place?

912
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Right? It's been about a year?

913
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
A mother fucking year
off the mother fucking boat,

914
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?

915
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
A good business,

916
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,600
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

917
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,000
for longer than
I care to remember,

918
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
and I've been here a long time?

919
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
Yeah, a long time?

920
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,400
Hear, boy?

921
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,600
Now, for the life of me??

922
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,400
You know, I can't
figure this out?

923
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Either them Korean mother fuckers
are geniuses??

924
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,200
Or you black asses
are just plain dumb?

925
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,000
fuck you?

926
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,000
It's got to be
because we're black?

927
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
Ain't no other explanation?

928
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,000
You know it's true?

929
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

930
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh, oh! You mother fuckers
hold that shit down?

931
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm tired of that
old excuse, that shit?

932
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
I swear, man,

933
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I will be one happy fool

934
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
when we open
our own business

935
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
right here in our neighborhood?

936
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
I swear to God,

937
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,600
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?

938
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
You mother fuckers
are always talking

939
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
that old Keith Sweat shit...

940
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,200
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"

941
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
You ain't gonna do nothing?

942
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,200
You're gonna sit on this corner?

943
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,600
When you going
to get your business?

944
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
Just like I thought?

945
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
You ain't going to do
a god damn thing?

946
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

947
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
more of my money?

948
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Out of my way?

949
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
It's Miller time, mother fuckers?

950
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Old Moose head fuckers
telling me what to do?

951
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,600
Coconut, you got nerve?

952
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,200
You got off the boat, too?
Leave me alone?

953
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Kung Fu, give me
one of them damn beers?

954
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
No more free beer?

955
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,200
No more free beer?

956
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't push me, baby?

957
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,200
No more free beer?

958
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't start no shit?

959
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,000
Mr? Sweet DickWillie?

960
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
Right? That's my name?

961
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,400
It's a mother fucking shame?

962
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,000
Man, ain't that a bitch?

963
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Here, Doctor?
What's your name?

964
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,600
Eddie?

965
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
How old are you?

966
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,000
10?

967
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400
What makes Sammy run?

968
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
My name is Eddie?

969
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
What makes Sammy run?

970
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,800
My name is Eddie Lovell?

971
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,600
Relax? I want you
to go to the store for me?

972
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
What'll it cost?

973
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
How would I know?

974
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,600
What am I buying?

975
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
Eddie, you're too smart
for your own britches?

976
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
How much doyou want

977
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,600
to go to the store
for the man?

978
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,600
50 cents?

979
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
You got a deal?

980
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,600
I want you to get me
a quart of beer?

981
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
Miller High Life?

982
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,600
Say it's for your bedridden,
old granddad?

983
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,200
Now, go? Go?

984
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
What is wrong with him?

985
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,200
He ain't got no money for nobody?

986
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,200
Look at this here, man?

987
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,600
Cut this shit out?

988
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
What makes you the Mayor
of this block?

989
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
Shit, he's self-appointed?

990
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
Leave the man alone?

991
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,600
Shut up!

992
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
Look, you all leave me
the hell alone?

993
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,600
I ain't going out
like that, man?

994
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,600
You walk around this block
like you own it?

995
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,600
For real?

996
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
You're so old,
you're like a fossil?

997
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
You're a bum?
You're an old drunk zero?

998
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
Now what do you got to say?

999
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,200
What you know about me?

1000
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Can't even pee straight,
nary a one of you?

1001
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
What you know about anything?

1002
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,800
Unless you...

1003
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Unless you done stood
in the door??

1004
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,800
And listened to your
five hungry children

1005
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,200
crying for bread,

1006
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,200
and you can't do
anything about it?

1007
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,600
Your woman standing there...

1008
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,200
You can't even look
her in the eye?

1009
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,400
Unless you done that,

1010
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,400
you don't know my pain,
my hurt, my feelings?

1011
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,800
You don't know shit!

1012
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,200
Don't call me bum?

1013
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,200
Don't call me a drunk?

1014
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,600
You don't got the sense
God give a billy goat!

1015
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
Don't call me nothing!

1016
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,000
It's disrespectful?

1017
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,600
Your mamas and papas
raised you better?

1018
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,400
I hope you finished
your little soliloquy

1019
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,200
'cause I been peeing straight
for years?

1020
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,400
Understand what I'm saying?

1021
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
And you're right?

1022
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,200
I wouldn't stand around

1023
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,200
listening to my children
go hungry?

1024
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,200
I'd be getting a job,

1025
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
anything to feed them?

1026
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,400
You're right?
I don't want to know your pain?

1027
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,800
I don't care?

1028
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,600
You did this to yourself?

1029
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
Every day I see you walk

1030
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,800
up and down this block, inebriated?

1031
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Never sober, but that's
what D-A stands for...

1032
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
Da Mayor... drunk ass?

1033
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Come on!

1034
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,400
This mars getting me mad!

1035
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,400
He don't get no respect!

1036
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,600
You'll never get
respect here, boy!

1037
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
I respect those
who respect themselves!

1038
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,000
Ahmad!

1039
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,400
Come on, man!

1040
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,400
Tina, I know it's been four days?

1041
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,200
I'm a working man?

1042
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,600
I work, too,
and I seem to make time?

1043
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
What do you want me
to do, huh?

1044
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,600
Spend some time
with me and Hector!

1045
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I want you to try and make
this relationship work?

1046
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,600
If not, I'd rather not
be bothered with your ass?

1047
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,400
Mookie, you're too, too tired?

1048
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,800
OK, all right, damn?

1049
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,600
I'll be over sometime today?

1050
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
You always say later!

1051
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Later when I get off work?

1052
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,000
Bring some ice cream?
I'm burning up?

1053
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Mookie, doyou love me?

1054
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,200
Do I love you?

1055
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,800
Mookie, get off the phone!

1056
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Be off in a second,
all right, Sal?

1057
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Do I love you?

1058
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,600
I dedicated a record

1059
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
on Love Daddy's show to you?

1060
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,000
So what?

1061
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,000
How's anybody going
to call in, Mookie?

1062
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,000
All right!

1063
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,000
One time?
You probably wasted??

1064
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,400
If that ain't love, you're crazy?

1065
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,400
are you deaf or what?

1066
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,000
Pino, I'm talking on the phone?

1067
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,000
I think I see that?

1068
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,000
Tina, I got to go?

1069
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,800
Yeah, Pino's an asshole?

1070
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
See you later today?

1071
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,800
Later!

1072
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,800
Everybody happy?

1073
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,600
[Ring]

1074
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Sal's Famous?

1075
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,200
Yeah? Yeah, hold it?

1076
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,600
OK, two large anchovy
and pepperoni?

1077
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,800
OK? Just hold on one second?

1078
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,400
See, Daddy? Mookie's
fucking talking on the phone,

1079
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,600
people are trying
to call in orders?

1080
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,400
He's making us lose business?

1081
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Mookie!

1082
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
20 minutes?

1083
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
How come niggers
are so stupid?

1084
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,000
If you see a nigger,
kick his ass?

1085
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,000
fuck you?
Stay off the phone?

1086
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Hey, Mookie?
Forget about it?

1087
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Can I talk to you for a second?

1088
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,200
What?

1089
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,200
Who's your favorite
basketball player?

1090
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,200
Magic Johnson?

1091
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,200
Who's your favorite movie star?

1092
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Eddie Murphy?

1093
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Who's your favorite rock star?

1094
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Prince?

1095
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,000
You're a Prince freak?

1096
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,000
Boss? Bruce?

1097
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,400
Prince?

1098
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,400
All you talk about is
nigger this and nigger that?

1099
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,200
Your favorite people are niggers?

1100
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,400
It's different?
Magic, Eddie, Prince??

1101
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,800
Are not niggers?

1102
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,800
I mean, they're not black,

1103
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,800
I mean...
Let me explain myself?

1104
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,600
They're...
They're not really black?

1105
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,200
I mean, they're black,
but not really?

1106
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400
They're more than black?
It's different?

1107
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
It's different?

1108
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,200
Yeah? To me,
it's different?

1109
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Deep down you wish
you were black?

1110
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,200
Get the fuck out of here?

1111
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,400
Go ahead, laugh?

1112
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,400
Your hair's kinkier than mine?

1113
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,800
What does that mean?

1114
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
And you know what they say
about dark Italians?

1115
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,800
You know, I been listening??
And reading...

1116
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,200
You been reading now?

1117
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,200
I read?

1118
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,400
I've been reading
about your leaders?

1119
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,400
Reverend Al
"Mister 'Do" Sharpton?

1120
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,800
Jesse "Keep hope alive"??

1121
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
That's fucked up?

1122
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,200
"Keep hope alive?"

1123
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,200
That's fucked?
Don't talk about Jesse?

1124
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,600
And even the other guy,
what's his name?

1125
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,200
Faraman, Fairakan...

1126
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Minister Farakhan?

1127
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,200
Right? Sorry?

1128
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,600
Minister Farakhan?

1129
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Anyway, Minister Farakhan
always talks about the so-called day??

1130
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,200
When the black man will rise?

1131
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,600
What does he say?

1132
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
"We will one day rule the earth

1133
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,800
as we did in our glorious past"?

1134
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,800
That's right?

1135
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,600
What past?
What did I miss?

1136
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
We started civilization?

1137
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,600
Man, keep dreaming, man?

1138
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Then you woke up!

1139
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,000
Pino, fuck you?

1140
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,200

Take your fucking pizza piece

1155
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,400
and go the fuck back to Africa?

1156
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,000

It's cheap?

1166
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,600
I got good price for you,

1167
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,200
Mayor Kochie,
"How I'm doing?"

1168

Yo! Hold up!

Y'all, take a chill!

1173
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,400
Ya need to cool

1174
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,000
And that's the double truth, Ruth!

1175
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,000
Sal, can you do me a favor?

1176
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,400
That depends, Mookie?

1177
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,400
Can you pay me now?

1178
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,000
I can't do that?

1179
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Sal, just this once?

1180
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
Can't you do me a solid, man?

1181
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,800
Not till tonight when we close?

1182
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,800
Sal, I want to get paid now?

1183
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,800
You know you get paid
tonight when we close?

1184
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,400
We're still open, OK?

1185
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,400
If I pay you now,
you won't show tonight?

1186
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,600
That's a bet?

1187
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah, that's a bet?

1188
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,400
I'm going to remember that?

1189
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,400
You got to do
what you got to do?

1190
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,000
I'll remember that?

1191
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,400
I want you to?

1192
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,800
Please do me a favor, hey, Mook?
Remember that?

1193
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,000
Come on, Sal?

1194
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,600
I can't?

1195
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,600
Radio Raheem!

1196
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,200
Mook?

1197
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,400
What's happening?

1198
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,800
It's your world?

1199
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,400
Where you headed to?

1200
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
I'm going to get a slice?

1201
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,800
You going to Sal's?

1202
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,800
I'll check you back there?

1203
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
On the rebound?

1204
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,200
You bet?

1205
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,600
All right?

1206
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,200
Oh, shit!

1207
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,200
Let me check it out?

1208
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,600

Newest latest?

1210
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,800
Let me tell you the story
of right hand/left hand?

1211
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,400
It's a tale of good and evil?

1212
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Hate?

1213
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,400
It was with this hand
that Cain iced his brother?

1214
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,200
Love?

1215
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,200
These five fingers,

1216
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,200
they go straight
to the soul of man?

1217
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,800
The right hand...

1218
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,800
the hand of love?

1219
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
The story of life is this??

1220
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,200
Static?

1221
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,400
One hand is always
fighting the other hand,

1222
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,200
and the left hand
is kicking much ass?

1223
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,800
I mean, it looks like the right hand...
love... is finished?

1224
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,800
But hold on?
Stop the presses?

1225
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,800
The right hand's coming back?

1226
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,400
He got the left hand
on the ropes now?

1227
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,800
That's right?
Yeah? Ooh!

1228
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,800
It's a devastating right,
and hate is hurt?

1229
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,400
Down! Ooh! Ooh!

1230
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,000
Left hand, hate,
K? O? 'd by love?

1231
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,400
If I love you, I love you?

1232
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
But if I hate you??

1233
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,600
There it is...
love and hate?

1234
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,200
I love you, brother?

1235
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Bet?

1236
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600

1261
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,600

1263
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,400

1268
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,400
Watch out? Move!

1269
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,600
People are in the same shit!

1270
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,600
What's up, buddy?
How you living, man?

1271
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,200

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,600
Give me some of that!

1273
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,200
Get a job?

1274
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,600
Don't need no job?

1275
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,200
Get a job, man?

1276
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Shut up!

1277
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Bugging?

1278
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,600
Where are the females?

1279
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,600
You don't do nothing
with them anyway?

1280
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,400
Hey, I've got it like that?

1281
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,600
M-M-M-Mookie?

1282
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
All right?
Here you go?

1283
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,200
Stop bothering me?

1284
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,600
Th-Th-Thank you,
b-b-b-black man?

1285
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
All right?
Leave me alone?

1286
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Jade!

1287
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,200
What?

1288
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Mookie, how come
you're not at Sal's?

1289
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm working?

1290
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,200
What's this... Another of your
patented two-hour lunch breaks?

1291
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,200
I wanted to come home
and take a quick shower?

1292
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,600
Sal's going to be mad?

1293
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Sometimes I think you're more
concerned about him than me,

1294
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,200
and I'm your brother?

1295
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,600
That's real smart?
Sal pays you?

1296
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,600
That's why you should work?

1297
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,200
I work?
Slavery's over?

1298
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
My name ain't Kunta Kinte?

1299
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,600
I just don't want you
to lose the one job

1300
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
you've kept over a month?

1301
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm carrying you as it is?

1302
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,600
I'll always get paid?

1303
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Yeah? You always get paid?

1304
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,000
What about
your responsibilities?

1305
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,200
Why don't you
take better care of those?

1306
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
What responsibilities?

1307
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,600
What are you, deaf?

1308
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,200
You know what
I'm talking about?

1309
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,200
Take care of your responsibilities,
all right?

1310
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,200
Who you yelling at, anyway?

1311
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,600
I'm yelling at you?

1312
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,600
I'm going to take care
of this shower?

1313
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,200
I'm your big brother?
Don't be yelling at me?

1314
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,600
You're a bum?

1315
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Don't call me no bum?

1316
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,000
Whew!

1317
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,400
If I want to shower
in the middle of the day,

1318
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,000
it's OK?
Fuck Sal?

1319
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000

1361
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400
Fan me with your ears?

1362
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,000

Shut up?

1366
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,000
It's too hot for that?

1367

I'm beat?

1371
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,200
Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking?

1372
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,000
Maybe we should sell this place?

1373
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,400
Get out while we're still ahead??

1374
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,200
And alive?

1375
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,400
You really think you know
what's best for us, Pino?

1376
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,000
I mean, couldn't we sell this

1377
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,000
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

1378
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,400
There's too many pizzerias
already there?

1379
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Maybe we could try
something different?

1380
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,000
What am I going to do?

1381
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400
That's all I know?

1382
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,200
I been here 25 years?
Where am I going?

1383
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,400
I'm sick of niggers?

1384
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,000
It's like I come to work??

1385
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,400
It's "Planet of the Apes?"

1386
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't like being around them?

1387
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
They're animals?

1388
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Why you got so much anger in you?

1389
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
Why? I'll tell you why?

1390
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,200
My friends...
They laugh at me?

1391
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,800
They laugh right in my face?

1392
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,200
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy?

1393
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,000
Go feed the moulies?"

1394
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
Do your friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

1395
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,800
Food on your table?

1396
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,200
They pay your rent,
a roof over your head?

1397
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Huh?

1398
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,800
They're not your friends?

1399
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,800
If they were your friends,

1400
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
they wouldn't laugh at you?

1401
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Pop, what can I say?

1402
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
I don't want to be here?

1403
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
They don't want us here?

1404
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

1405
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
in Bensonurst,

1406
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,000
and niggers in theirs?

1407
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,200
I never had no trouble
with these people?

1408
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,400
I sat in this window??

1409
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,400
All I see is
little kids get old?

1410
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,400
And I seen
the old people get older?

1411
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,400
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,

1412
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
but most of them do?

1413
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,400
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food?

1414
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,000
On my food?

1415
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm very proud of that?

1416
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,000
You may think it's funny,

1417
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,800
but I'm very proud of that?

1418
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,800
Look, what I'm trying
to say, son, is, uh??

1419
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Sal's Famous Pizzeria
is here to stay?

1420
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm sorry?

1421
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,200
I'm your father,
and I love you?

1422
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,800
I'm sorry, but??

1423
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,400
But that's the way it is?

1424
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Hey, S-S-Sal?

1425
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,000

01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,400

1429
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,400
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1430
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,200

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,000

01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,800
this exact fucking moment?

1792
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,200
If you're saying

1793
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,200
what I'm thinking
you're saying,

1794
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,200
you better not say it?

1795
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,800
You hear this?

1796
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,800
Do me a favor?
LeaveJade alone?

1797
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,200
You know, Mookie,
not for nothing,

1798
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,200
but if you were
just a little taller,

1799
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,200
I'd kick your ass
for what you're thinking?

1800
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,200
As a matter of fact,

1801
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,000
I should kick your ass
on principle alone?

1802
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,200
Here?
You got a delivery?

1803
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,800
This the right address?

1804
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,200
What is this??

1805
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Yeah? It's the right address?

1806
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,800
That's the right address?

1807
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,200
I wrote it myself?

1808
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,800
Sometimes you make mistakes,

1809
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,400
and I deliver fucking pizzas

1810
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,200
to the wrong fucking address?

1811
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,800
I don't make mistakes?

1812
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,400
You don't make mistakes?

1813
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,800
Hurry back, OK?

1814
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,400
Don't get lost?
We're still open?

1815
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,200
Make a pizza, huh?

1816
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Mr? Mayor?

1817
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,000
I saw what you did?

1818
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,000
That was foolish but brave?

1819
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,400
That child owes you his life?

1820
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,000
Was't trying to be a hero?

1821
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,400
I just seen what was happening,

1822
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,800
and I reacted... didn't even think?

1823
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,800
Probably wouldn't have done it

1824
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,200
if I had thought?

1825
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,600
Da Mayor's getting old?

1826
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,200
Ain't run like that in years?

1827
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,600
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?

1828
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,200
Scored the winning run?

1829
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,600
Two outs?
Bottom of the ninth?

1830
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,200
August 1, 1939?
Snow Hill, Alabama?

1831
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,800
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher?

1832
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,200
He hated my guts?

1833
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,400
He come down off that mound,

1834
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,000
and I took off

1835
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,800
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?

1836
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Maybe I, uh??

1837
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,400
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?

1838
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,000
Maybe you shouldn't?

1839
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,400
Don't get happy?

1840
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,200
This changes nothing
between you and me?

1841
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,000
You did a good thing?

1842
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,000
Mother Sister just thanks you?

1843
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
I want to thank you?

1844
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You're welcome?

1845
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,800
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

1846
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,800
Is it hot?

1847
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,400
I've never delivered a cold pizza?

1848
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,400
Come here?

1849
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,800
You think you're slick, Tina?

1850
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
How else could
I get you up here?

1851
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,000
I haven't seen you all week?

1852
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,400
I'm working?
Making money?

1853
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,000
You forgot the ice cream again?

1854
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,200
I forgot?

1855
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,800
Your memory's getting ridiculous?

1856
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
I got things on my mind?

1857
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,800
I really wanted some ice cream?

1858
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,200
I'll run out and get some?

1859
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,200
No, no? That's out?
You won't come back?

1860
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,200
I can't be staying long?

1861
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,400
How long?

1862
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,000
Long enough to do the nasty?

1863
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Come on, Mookie?
That's out?

1864
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,200
First of all, it's too hot?

1865
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,000
If you think
I'll let you get some,

1866
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,400
put your clothes on and leave,

1867
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,600
and I won't see you again,

1868
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800
you're bugging?

1869
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,200
I'll see you tomorrow?

1870
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,200
Yeah, right?

1871
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,000
So no nasty, huh?

1872
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,200
No?

1873
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,400
Something else?

1874
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,400
What?

1875
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
Trust me?

1876
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,000
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son?

1877
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Remember him?

1878
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,400
His name's Hector?

1879
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,800
You saying I'm a bad father?

1880
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
On the strength?

1881
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,000
Let me talk to you?

1882
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
What? What?

1883
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,400
Over here?

1884
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,800
Tina, take your clothes off?

1885
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,200
I already told you

1886
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,200
it's too fucking hot
to make love?

1887
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,800
It's too fucking hot?

1888
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,800
Why are you always cursing?

1889
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,200
I don't fucking curse that much?

1890
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,200
What the hell you mean?

1891
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,200
All you do is curse?

1892
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,200
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping off tonight?

1893
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,800
All right?
That's it?

1894
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
No rawness?

1895
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
No? No rawness?

1896
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Why's it always like that

1897
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,000
when you come over?

1898
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,800
It's not always like that?

1899
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,400
It's always...
What are you doing?

1900
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,800
I'm not cursing?

1901
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,400
Mookie? Come on?

1902
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,000
I mean it?
I'm not playing?

1903
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,400
I'm not playing?

1904
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,200
Don't be so anxious?

1905
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,200
That's right?
Take it off?

1906
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You're sweating?

1907
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,400
Of course I'm sweating?

1908
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,000
It's only 100 degrees in here?

1909
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,400
Look, freeze?
Don't move?

1910
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,000
I'll be right back?

1911
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What do you mean
you'll be right back?

1912
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,400
Where are you going?

1913
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,000
I'll be right back?

1914
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,800
Why you got me
standing on the bed?

1915
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,200
Where you going?

1916
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,800
How's my son, Hector?

1917
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,800
Honey, do you hear that?

1918
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,800
He wants to know
How you are doing?

1919
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,800
And he has the straight face
of asking about it?

1920
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,200
Sinverguenza.

1921
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,800
Good for nothing?

1922
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,200
Callejero.

1923
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Que se la pasa por la calle... - 

1924
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,800
English! English!

1925
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,200
I want my son speaking English?

1926
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,200
Get out of my kitchen?

1927
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,000
Bad enough his name's Hector?

1928
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,000
Get out of my kitchen?

1929
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,400
I don't want to hear anything?

1930
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,000
Out, I said?

1931
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Yes, children?

1932
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,400
This is the cool-out corner?

1933
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,200
We're slowing it down

1934
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,600
for all the lovers in the house?

1935
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,200
I'll be giving you
all the help you need?

1936
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,400
Musically, that is?

1937
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,000
This shit is cold?

1938
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,800
Supposed to be cold?
It's an ice cube?

1939
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,200
Later for your shit?

1940
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,800
Mira.

1941
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,200
Mira.

1942
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,200
What?

1943
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,200
You don't got a forehead?

1944
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,200
You got a eight-head?

1945
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,200
Mookie, you're full of shit?

1946
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,200
You got one of them
Sade foreheads?

1947
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,200
fuck you?

1948
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
god damn?
Big-ass forehead?

1949
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,200
I need an iceberg??

1950
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,200
Rather than this ice cube?

1951
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,000
Thank God for lips?

1952
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,400
Thank God for the neck?

1953
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,000
Thank God for kneecaps?

1954
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,400
Thank God for elbows?

1955
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Thank God for thighs?

1956
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,200
Thank God
for the right nipple?

1957
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,200
Thank God
for the left nipple?

1958
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,200
Feels good?

1959
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,200
Ah? You likes?
You likes?

1960
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,000
You likes?

1961
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,400
Amen?

1962
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,600
I got to be going?

1963
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
You better come back?

1964
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,600
I'll be back tonight?

1965
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,600
You better,
'cause I'll kick your ass?

1966
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,800
Oops? I got to be back then?

1967
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,400
All right?

1968
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,000
All right?

1969
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,200
All right?

1970
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,800
Get out of here?

1971
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,400

Yeah? Lot of people

Mookie, I didn't say nothing?

2001
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,400
You must have a guilty conscience?

2002

I'm not guilty of anything?

2003
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,800
You're guilty of something?

2004
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,200
Other wise you wouldn't be saying that?

Are we going to live together?

To get my money?

2478
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,800
Don't try that shit, OK?

2479
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,800
You're going to run out,

2480
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,200
and I won't see your ass
for another week?

2481
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,600
It's not like that?

2482
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,200
You don't give
a fucking shit about me,

2483
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,200
and you don't
give a shit about your son?

2484
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,600
I care about you and my son?

2485
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,600
Why don't you be a man?

2486
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I am a man?

2487
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,400
Then act like a man?

2488
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,000
Why don't you be
a fucking man, Mookie?

2489
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,000
I'm so tired of your shit?

2490
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,000
Why do we have to
go over this again?

2491
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,400
Because you don't
fucking listen, Mookie!

2492
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,000
If you listen to me,

2493
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,000
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

2494
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,400
like a fucking radio!

2495
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,400
What kind of mother you are

2496
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,000
using fucking language like that?

2497
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
What kind of mother am I?

2498
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Your ass isn't even here!

2499
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,600
Get another vocabulary, right?

2500
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,200
Get a fucking life?

2501
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,400
Yeah? Look??

2502
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,400
Lookwhat?

2503
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,000
I'll be back?

2504
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Don't leave, Mookie?
Don't leave?

2505
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,600
I'm tired of this shit?

2506
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
You walk out that door, that's it?

2507
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,000
All right?

2508
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,600
I have to get my money from Sal?
I'll be back?

2509
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,600
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired ofit?

2510
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,000
You need to step off

2511
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,800
with your stupid-ass self?

2512
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,800
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,

2513
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,400
because the one you got
is not working!

2514
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,000
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

2515
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Shit?
Fucking ass, stupid ass,

2516
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,600
fucking pendejo.

2517
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,400
Shit? Fuck?
Fucking shit?

2518
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Good morning?

2519
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,400
Is it a good morning?

2520
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,800
Yes, indeed?

2521
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
You almost got yourself
killed last night?

2522
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,600
I've done that before?

2523
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,400
Where did you sleep?

2524
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,800
I didn't?

2525
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,000
I hope the block is still standing?

2526
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,800
We're still standing?

2527
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,200
What do you want?

2528
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,600
I want my money?
I want to get paid?

2529
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
You don't work here no more?

2530
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I want my money?

2531
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,000
Your money couldn't begin to pay

2532
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,400
for the window you broke?

2533
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,000
Mother fuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?

2534
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,400
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?

2535
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,400
He's dead because of his buddy?

2536
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,000
That cocksucker started this shit?

2537
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,000
He's responsible
for that kid's death?

2538
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,400
He wanted to close me,

2539
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,000
and you stood there like a fuck

2540
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,000
and watched them
burn me down!

2541
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,400
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?

2542
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,000
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?

2543
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

2544
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,200
This ain't about money?

2545
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,200
I could give a fuck
about money?

2546
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,400
You see this place?

2547
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,000
I built this fucking place!

2548
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,200
With my bare fucking hands!

2549
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,200
Every light socket,
every piece of tile?

2550
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,200
Me! With these fucking hands!

2551
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,200
You know what that means?

2552
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,800
It means pay me
my mother fucking money?

2553
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,400
That's what it means, Sal?

2554
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,400
OK, Mookie?

2555
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,800
How much do I owe you?

2556
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,200
My salary is 250?
250 a week?

2557
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,200
1??

2558
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,200
That's 2??

2559
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,600
That's 3??

2560
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,400
That's 4??

2561
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,400
And that's 5?

2562
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,200
You got $500?
You're a rich fucking man?

2563
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,400
Are you happy?
You happy?

2564
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,400
He's got 500 fucking dollars!

2565
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,000
He's a big man!

2566
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,800
He's a rich fucking man!

2567
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,200
He's never going to have
any more trouble!

2568
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,400
Not Mookie!

2569
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,000
He's fucking rich!

2570
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,600
Who the fuck you yelling at?

2571
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,200
You're wealthy, Mookie?

2572
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?

2573
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:08,600
You got your fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?

2574
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,600
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

2575
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,400
I owe you 50 bucks?

2576
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,400
Keep it?

2577
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,400
You keep it?

2578
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,400
You keep it?

2579
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,400
You keep it?

2580
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,400
No, you keep it?

2581
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,800
You keep it?

2582
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,400
I don't believe this shit?

2583
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,800
Believe it?

2584
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,400
Are you sick?

2585
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:36,400
I'm hot as a mother fucker?
I'm all right, though?

2586
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,200
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today?

2587
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,200
What are you going
to do with yourself?

2588
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,400
Make that money?
Get paid?

2589
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,000
Sal, I got to go see my son

2590
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,600
if it's all right with you?

2591
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,200
Hey, Mook.
It's the Mook man.

2592
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,000
I see you walking.
Go home to your kid.

2593
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,600
Now the news and weather.

2594
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,600
Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...

2595
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,600
"to get to the bottom

2596
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,000
oflast night's disturbance.

2597
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,400
The City ofNew York

2598
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,000
will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."

2599
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
His Honor plans to visit
our block today.

2600
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,400
He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,

2601
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,000
buy him a beer.

2602
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,600
Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.

2603
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,600
The election is coming up.

2604
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,600
There 's no end in sight
from this heat wave,

2605
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,000
so today,
the cash money word is chill.

2606
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,400
That's right. C-h-i-l-I.

2607
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:42,200
When you hear "chill,"
call in at 555-L OVE,

2608
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,600
and you'll win
cash money, honey.

2609
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,600
This is Mister Señor Love Daddy

2610
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,400
coming at you from
what's last on your dial

2611
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,200
but first in your hearts,

2612
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,800
and that's
the quintessential truth, Ruth.

2613
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,600
The next record goes out
to Radio Raheem.

2614
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,200
We love you, brother.

2615
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,400
# From the heart ofBed-Stuy #

2616
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:54,000
# W-e-L -o-v-e ##

2617
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:12,200
# I was looking through
a window at my life today #

2618
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,800
# And for the first time #

2619
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,600
# I saw things in a different way #

2620
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:27,400
# I n the middle of my mind #

2621
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:34,800
# It was there all the time #

2622
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
# Never explain love #

2623
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
# It's not like anything
you've ever done #

2624
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:45,000
# lf it is there,
it's yours to keep #

2625
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,800
# And the boundaries, they grow deep #

2626
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,800
# Never explain love #

2627
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
# Let the experience take over you #

2628
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:59,400

# Never explain love #

2630
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,200
# I was looking for an answer #

2631
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,000
# And I was searching for a sign #

2632
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:31,200
#To try and understand
this relationship of mine #

2633
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:38,000
# But I didn't need to go far #

2634
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,200
# I was reading it all wrong #

2635
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:48,200
# Never explain love #

2636
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,400

#Who needs to be rational #

2646
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:29,600
#When love isn't practical #

2647
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,800
# Oh, I knew this was inside #

2648
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
# And it's so wrong #

2649
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,000
# It's so right #

2650
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:41,000

2651
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:55,200

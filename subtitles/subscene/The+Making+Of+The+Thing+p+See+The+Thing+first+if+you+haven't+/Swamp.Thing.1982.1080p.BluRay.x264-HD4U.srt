Depends-- If you you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,242
But if you're a gator,
it could be right where we land.

<i>He said this is
where the life is.</i>

9
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,287
One of those life forms

Couldn't take it anymore.

The local fishermen say
this place is haunted.

I don't know where
we are, Toto,

What?

28
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,151
Nothing.

29
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,247
Used to be a church

30
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,124
Then the levee broke.

31
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,835

Welcome back, sir.

33
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,298

00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,466
That's confidential, Teddy.

What does Holland think
about getting yanked

42
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,522
from the swamps
back to Washington?

43
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,107
I doubt he's even been told.

44
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,985
Ritter couldn't believe me
when I gave him the news this morning.

45
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,029
Do you think Washington's paranoid?

46
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,614
Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

47
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,450
This is your place.

48
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,881
You probably haven't seen
half this stuff.

49
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,174
It's all new.

50
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,926
Take this, for instance.
This is a la--

51
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,345
laser-induced
subsonic field generator.

52
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,680
Gives double readings
in the 3200 band, right?

53
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,058
I got a trick for fixing that.

54
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,518
Just my luck
they send me someone

00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,478

- <i>Who?</i>

This thing is so hush-hush,
no one asks.

It's not surprising.

76
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,314
They rot in a week

00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,526
Charlie, did you get them
to, uh, change their minds?

78
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,195
No, they want him and the substance
back in Washington

79
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,613
where they can keep
their eyes on him.

80
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,948

that you know of?

81
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,241
A rumor.

00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,494
Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

83
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,662
I thought Arcane was dead.

84
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,539
He is!
Who said that?

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,957
Who said Arcane's on to this?

86

Nobody's taken credit for it.
You know Washington.

87
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,631
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

88
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,758
and the whole project
goes to hell in a hand basket.

Come on.

146
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,840
The only dangerous thing out there

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,134
are those government agents
with their popguns.

148
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,178
It's your first day on the job.

149

00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,347
Like, what happened to the guy
I'm replacing, for instance?

167
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,474

his natural way.

168

Can't blame a guy for that.

169
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,823
I paid a fortune
for these boots.

170
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,660
You better keep moving, there's
a fair amount of quicksand around here.

171
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,996
- You better keep <i>your</i> eyes <i>open</i> too.

Or one of these just might
jump out and do you in.

You know there's over a hundred species
of Genus Orchia here.

174
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,213
There's so much beauty
in the swamps

175
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,464
if you just open up
your eyes to it.

176
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,843

00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:41,679
and what do you see?

179
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,849
Straight lines and deodorant
and chrome and Formica?

180
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:48,018
No, no, no, you see
blood and bone, pump and flow

181
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,312
and a million messy miracles.

182
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,897
I mean, just look
at the most creative thing

183
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,357
a man and a woman
can do together

184
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,900
and you'll see
something growing.

185
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,861
Unpredictable.

186
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,028
Magical.

187
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,155
Hot.

188
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,117
Just save the malarkey
for your wife, Holland.

189
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,288
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

190
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,957
Oh, it's, uh, right over there.

191
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,131
Looks okay to me.

192
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,425
Here, let me help.

193
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,647
Well, it doesn't look
okay to me.

194
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,734
- Let's get back.
- All right.

195
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,424
[buzzing]

196
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,384
Charlie?

197
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,891
Charlie.

198
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:12,978
Cable?

199
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,772
What in the hell is your story?

200
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,941
Charlie, did anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

201
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,067
You're damn right!

202
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,027
Something suspicious did happen!

203
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,405
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

204
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,325
takes a scientist
we're all supposed to be guarding

205
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,369
for an unguarded romp
in the bush!

206
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,287
<i>Hold it.
Just cool it a minute, all right?</i>

207
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,831
<i>You think you're
on a picnic or something?</i>

208
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,458
Wait a minute, Ritter,
it was my idea to take her out there.

209
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,584
She was just doin her job.

210
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,253
Why do you have to be
so worried all the time for?

211
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,754
Because it's my job to worry.

212
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,714
And if I have my way,
and by God I will,

213
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,842
you'll be on the next chopper
back to Washington.

214
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:45,010
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

215
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,723
There's a cut sensor out there,
what about that?

216
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,766
Which sector?

217
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,976
<i>Sector three.</i>

218
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:55,104
Hank was working on that one
when he was bitten by the gator.

219
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,982
Needless to say, he didn't put it
all back together again

220
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,775
before we took him
to the hospital.

221
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,362
[sighs]

222
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,323
Tickled pink, huh?

223
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,951
I'm really sorry, Cable.

224
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:14,498
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

225
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,835
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there?

226
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:18,919
Ronnie?

227
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,170
- No, why?
- Mm-mm.

228
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,048
We seem to have
lost contact with him.

229
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,508
<i>[explosion]</i>

230
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,427
<i>- Hey, what's that?
- Back off, get back.</i>

231
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,018
Linda, are you all right?

232
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,269
<i>[Linda]
It's okay, it's okay!</i>

233
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,187
Oh, dear God.

234
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,193
The damnedest thing.

235
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,696
You know this new batch
you had me cook up

236
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,531
with the host
from Alessandro's fur?

237
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,574
Uh-huh.

238
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,576
I knew we were up
to something revolutionary.

239
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,203
But this is literally dynamite.

240
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,705
Watch.

241
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,126
[explodes]

242
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,503
Incredible.

243
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,796
Weird, huh?

244
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,048
[chuckles]
Yeah.

245
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:07,718
Congratulations, you managed
to reinvent nitro.

246
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,929
Let's hope this project
doesn't end with a bang.

247
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,016
Oh, come on, Charlie, please.

248
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,392
I gotta write this down.

249
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,853
I thought you were working
on some sort of weapons system.

250
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,357
<i>- I</i> knew <i>it</i> wasn't just plants.
- Plants, plants.

251
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,650
The only way
lever thought my work

252
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,610
would be explosive
was social, if you believe it.

253
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,196
The stuff we've been working with
has never been this volatile before.

254
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,240
Linda, cut up a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

255
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,284
- Right.
- And be exceptionally careful with it.

256
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,369
- All right?
- Don't worry.

257
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,079
What is it you've
been doing here, Holland?

258
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,246
Come on over here,
I'll show you.

259
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,590
[beeping]

260
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,220
Now, you see those little guys?

261
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,641
DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli E. coli.

262
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,809
Now, you see that one?

263
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,935
Another simple bacilli.

264
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,645
Plant matrix called D Complex.

265
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,774
Now, each of these organisms
have existed in the labs for years.

266
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,276
But always separately,
which isn't too surprising

267
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,778
since one is animal,
the other's vegetable.

268
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,115
But now this is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

269
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,366
You see that little guy?

270
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,952
Never existed on the face
of the Earth before.

271
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,078
That's my baby-.

272
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,082
A simple vegetable cell
with an unmistakable animal nucleus.

273
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,584
Recombinant DNA?

274
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,628
Hey, that's very good.

275
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,757
I'm very close
to developing a plant

276
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,885
with an animal's aggressive
power for survival.

277
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,222
A plant for the 21st century.

278
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,850
What do you want, watermelons
the size of weather balloons?

279
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,560
Or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick.

280
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,229
Well, I wouldn't mind a tomato
that could grow in the desert.

281
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,481
Or soybeans
that could thrive in Biafra.

282
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,275
Or corn that could grow
in the good old U.S. of A.,

283
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,528
say in the year 2001, when there'll be
6 1/2 billion people on this planet.

284
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,780
<i>All of them hungry.
How you doin' there, Linda?</i>

285
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,906
<i>[Linda]
It's all set.</i>

286
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,616
Vector 3-3-7-9.

287
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,201
Okay.

288
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,997
[whirring]

289
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,127
- It's replicating like mad.
- It certainly is.

290
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,173
Well, come on,
let's try it on something.

291
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,009
Cable, would you bring that, uh, flask
of water over here, please?

292
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,138
Thank you.

293
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,307
If it would work on plants
the way you want it to,

294
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,642
what will it do to people?

295
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,811
And what if it falls
in the wrong hands?

296
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,064
Arcane boogie man
mentality, huh?

297
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,940
Okay, now we begin.

298
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,025
I have 2,000 water.

299
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,738
One part formula.

300
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,991
<i>[Linda]
Two thousand water, 6:30, March 20.</i>

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,211
- How long before you'll know?
- What?

302
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,712
Look, what do you want it to do?

303
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,798
Jump out of the beaker
and dance a fandango?

304
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,341
I don't know,
a week maybe.

305
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,383
Maybe longer.

306
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,637
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

307
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,516
Aren't there some sensors out there
you could be working on?

308
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,188
- Oops.
- Forget it.

309
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,815
He's just ridiculously sensitive.

310
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,191
Our dad was the same.

311
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,610
Your dad?

312
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,404
You've never heard of Walter Holland,
the biophysicist?

313
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,573
Nobel prize?

314
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,243
He used to throw a mean
Bunsen burner, I can tell ya.

315
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,038
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

316
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,791
Perfectionist 'til the day he died.

317
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,126
Alec's the same.

318
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,423
[sighs]

319
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,361
Oh, my God.

320
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,737
What is that?

321
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,323
Cable, I don't believe this.

322
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,909
All the places
that Linda dropped the formula,

323
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,953
the boards grew.

324
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,913
Are you kidding?

325
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,123
No, I'm not kidding.

326
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,751
- Alec.
- Linda!

327
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,171
<i>- What?</i>
- Get in here quick!

328
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,755

00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,715

00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,137
Oh.

331
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,057
Alec, the formula?

332
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,602
Ritter, he's gotta be told
right away.

333
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,146
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realizes we've done it!

334
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,109
Ritter!

335
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,112
Ritter!

336
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,074
You guys seen Ritter?

337
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,451
<i>[male]

338
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,660
Thanks.

339

Interesting.

Let go!

356
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:46,033
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like, uh... this before.

357
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,789
Have you?

358
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,791
What the hell do you want?

359
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,754

No, Ritter, not you.

368
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,777
No, Doctor Holland, not Ritter.

369
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,531

00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,299
Linda, come here.
Here.

374
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,425

All right.

is not to be born.

388

Not to be.

389
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,532
To be nothing.

390
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,995
But the second best
for you is to die soon.

402
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,285
- Burn the papers.
- Yes, sir.

403

I think he's been neutral--

00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:41,093

Yes.

<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.</i>

539
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,805
<i>I have an emergency
call for you.</i>

540
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,349
Put the call through.

<i>Ritter, this is Cable.</i>

542
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,229
<i>We've had...
a catastrophe out here.</i>

543
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,355
What happened?

544
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:53,814
<i>There was a hit
on the compound.</i>

545
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,524
<i>Holland's dead,
the lab's gone.</i>

546
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,235
<i>I thought they got you too.</i>

547
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,362
Uh, no, I was called away.

548
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,405
<i>Well, I think you were wrong
about Arcane.</i>

549
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,324
These <i>guys knew
what they were looking for.</i>

550
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,450
<i>And there's only one person--</i>

551
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,702
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later.

552
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:07,745
Where are you?

553
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:10,331
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

554
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,916
Right.

555
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,378
Oh, uh, did you manage
to save anything?

556
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,796
Damn right.

557
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:18,214
I got the last notebook.

558
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:19,966
Very good.

559
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,759
I'll be there
before you know it.

560
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,052
Uh, turn around.

561
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,079
Doesn't anything work
around here?

562
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,205
Just me.

563
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:52,498
[kick]

564
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,793
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.

565
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,086
You gotta punch it.

566
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:03,551
Thanks.

567
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,052
Nothin', name's Jude.

568
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,804
Cable.

569
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,310
Mmm.

570
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,687

[sighs]

572
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,820
Nice station.

573
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,904
Your dad own it?

574
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,908
Look like your ride's got here.

575
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,249
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

576
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:47,762
Don't be afraid, Jude.

577
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,139
You better say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

578
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,478
Is there a gun here?

579
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,979
What kind of place
you think this is?

580
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,189
Of course, there is.

581
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,739
Gun's a museum piece.

582
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,324
Stay here.

583
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:11,535
Took the words
right outta my mouth.

584
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,626
Hey, greaseball!
Uhh!

585
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:19,794
She's mine.

586
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,881
<i>She's got a gun.</i>

587
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,802
Some gun, it blew up
on the first shot.

588
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,388
<i>Let's go.</i>

589
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,069
Jam it!
Jam it to the floor!

590
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:51,492
Wait a minute.
There she is.

591
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,329
Go, go!
Go get her, go on!

592
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:57,373
Go on!

Go, go!

596
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,300
<i>Come on,
she's gaining ground on ya!</i>

597
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,035
Hey, there she is.

598
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,875
Faster!

599
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,013
Got her in your sights.
[chuckles]

600
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,224
It's back, stop the Jeep!

601
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,601
<i>Run her down.</i>

602
00:41:58,601 --> 00:41:59,643
Don't stop!

Shoo!

606
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:53,614
Go!

607
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,600
- [gasps]
- It's okay, it's okay, it's just me.

608
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,561
Oh, Jude, what are
you doing here?

609
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,020
If you think I'm gonna stay
at the station

610
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,522
while they're pumping it
full of holes,

611
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:27,982
you're mistaken.

612
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,151
<i>What happened to that thing?</i>

613
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,779
It uh...

614
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,198
hit a tree.
[sighs]

615
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:37,366
Uh-huh.

616
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,827
Musta been one of those
hit and run kinda trees.

617
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,495
Don't seem to be there now.

618
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,334
Some tree, all right.

619
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,129
There's a trapper's cabin nearby.

620
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,673
<i>Maybe we can get you
a fresh change of clothes.</i>

621
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,426
Swamp's no place to be at night.

622
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,219
Come on.

623
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,109
The last patrol is in.

624
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,237
Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

625
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,239
Some of the men say
it's one of those

626
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,158
abdominal snowmen
or something.

627
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,909
<i>[Ferret]
I tell you, it was like hittin' a tree.</i>

628
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,746
<i>And bullets hurt it,
but they don't seem to stop it.</i>

629
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:25,914
<i>I say we forget this notebook.</i>

630
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,499
It's-- it's not worth it.

631
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,168
What are we killin'
ourselves for?

632
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:32,379
Just to find the formula to some...

633
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,173
ordinary plant fertilizer?

634
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,215
Ordinary?

635
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:39,887
Something extraordinary came out
of the experiments already.

636
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,183
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of.

637
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:45,142
None!

638
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,531
Would you recognize
immortality

639
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,450
if it knocked on your door,
gentlemen?

640
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,371
Obviously, you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

641
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,290
I want this swamp thing

642
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,167
and I want the notebook.

643
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,543
Now.

644
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:12,753
<i>[Ferret]
Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.</i>

645
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,338
You will not get rid of him.

646
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,883
You will simply... get him.

647
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:26,850
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there...

648
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,436
in his veins.

649
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:33,607
But... how can we find it?

650
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,235
It-- It's gone into the swamps.

651
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,322
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

652
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,366
That's right.

653
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,327
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

654
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,416
It doesn't exactly maintain
a low profile.

655
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,544
[roaring]

656
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,527
Whew!

657
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:23,991
He was right.

658
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,952
It is beautiful.

659
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:28,829
Who was right?

660
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,997
A guy I knew.

661
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,124
He loved these swamps.

662
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,293
Can't you call him?

663
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,669
Maybe he can come
and get you.

664
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,216
Ain't got nobody
you can call, huh?

665
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:42,885
Thought I had.

666
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,930
But when I did, those, uh, goons
showed up back there

667
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,850
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

668
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:52,269
Didn't pay your bookie
or somethin'?

669
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,229
Or somethin'.

670
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,023
Much farther?

671
00:46:58,567 --> 00:46:59,943
Little ways.

Don't worry.

676
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,976
If you hear anyone,
you give a yell.

677
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:14,935
Don't worry.

678
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:19,314
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

679
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,858
I can handle myself.

680
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:21,942
Don't worry.

681
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,485
I'm not worried.

682
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:26,613

Well, there's gonna be one more

Open up on him.

00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,757
Hang on, I'm gonna knock
him outta there.

00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,187
<i>Maybe we can stun him.</i>

718
00:53:58,111 --> 00:53:59,738
[roars]

719
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,913
Good hit,
I think you got him.

720
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:11,291
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got.

721
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,751
Come on.

722
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:30,936
We got him now!

723
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,825
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

724
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,592
Do you see him?

725
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:04,177
Yeah, I see him everywhere.

726
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,181
Any sign of him over there?

727
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,433
<i>Nothing, we think maybe
he bought the farm,</i>

728
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,851
<i>or the vegetable patch.</i>

729
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,647
[roaring]

730
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,036
Who the hell is that?

731
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,336
[roars]

732
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,311
Smart, that thing is smart.

733
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:57,314
Very smart, Bruno,
very smart.

734
00:55:57,314 --> 00:56:00,442
This thing is
considerably intelligent.

735
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:03,069
He's like a brilliant chess player.

736
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:05,280
He anticipates every move.

737
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:10,493
A strong adversary is like
a beautiful, dangerous woman.

738
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,329
I've never been able
to resist either.

739
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:13,872
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

740
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:15,790
- We're going home.
- No, we're not.

741
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,461
Captured our knight...

742
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:22,964
exposed his queen.

743
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:27,302
Our move.

744
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,374
Awfully quiet now.

745
00:56:57,374 --> 00:56:58,625
<i>We better get outta here.</i>

746
00:56:58,625 --> 00:56:59,793
I've gotta go back and help.

747
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:06,424
You just take the notebook
and get yourself to safety.

748
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,009
<i>I'll come back for you later.</i>

749
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,011
Go on, do as I say.

750
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,492
- [Jude] Cable!
" Shh! '

751
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,577
Jude, go and do what I told you.

752
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,121
It's not safe here anymore.

753
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:37,664
You hear?

754
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,041
Jude!

755
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,259
Uh!

756
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,469
[screams]
No!

757
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:54,282
Oh, shit.

758
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,242
There goes
the neighborhood.

759
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:01,456
Wait a minute, you're the dude
that saved us back there, right?

760
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,626
You a friend of Cable?

761
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,922
Then I got somethin' for you.

762
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:10,924
She said I ought
to put it someplace safe.

763
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:28,274
- Where's Arcane?
- Below.

764
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,527
I'll tell him
I've captured his queen.

765
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:36,324
Walked right into our hands,
didn't you?

766
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,201
Real smart.

767
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,203
Thanks.

768
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,330
I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

769
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:45,250
What I couldn't do for you.

770
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,170
Tell you what--

771
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,298
Tell me where
the notebook is

772
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,842
and, uh, I'll get you
out of the swamps.

773
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,010
Deal?

774
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:57,929
I don't mind the swamps.

775
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:00,974
It's the slime that crawls out
from under the rocks

776
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:02,308
that turns my stomach.

777
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,102
Oh, nasty mouth.

778
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:05,270
You're a pretty one.

779
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,400
What do you say to that?

780
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,860
Not much.

781
01:00:39,596 --> 01:00:40,597
[screams]

782
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:44,851
[screams]

783
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,352
Cable!

784
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,396
Cable.

785
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,778
[groans]

786
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,671
<i>[male]
Ferret!</i>

787
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,432
Ferret!

788
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:29,395
Ferret!

789
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:33,900
Maybe we should go
in and check.

790
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,276
No, we go home now.

791
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,070
- Sir, but--
- Home.

792
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,749
[motor starts]

793
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:14,691
It's very kind.

794
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:23,741
Nice orchid.

795
01:02:25,702 --> 01:02:29,414
Family Orchidaceae.

796
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:31,791
Genus Orchis.

797
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,087
Over a hundred species here.

798
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:40,174
Much beauty in the swamp...

799
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,844
if you only look.

800
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:53,938
Alec?

801
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,201
Oh, I'm sorry.

802
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,705
It must--

803
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:11,831
hurt?

804
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,293
Does it?

805
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,841
Only when I laugh.

806
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:26,888
[laughing]

807
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,074
Have I gone crazy?

808
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,578
Isn't this a dream?

809
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:56,417
That's what I keep
asking myself.

810
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:02,465
Everything's a dream...

811
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,384
when you're alone.

812
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,892
Alec.

813
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,501
[screaming]

814
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:15,806
Now.

815
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:18,142
No!

816
01:06:35,952 --> 01:06:40,164
The man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

817
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:46,796
[coughs]

818
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:51,842
Alec.

819
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,928
Alec

820
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,096
Holland.

821
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:56,764
You knew, didn't you?

822
01:06:58,307 --> 01:06:59,725
You knew we'd be caught.

823
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,772
The only way out...

824
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,649
is through.

825
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,628
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

826
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,316
<i>[clinking on glass]</i>

827
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:55,031
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

828
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:57,992
We have captured
the dragon

829
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:01,203
and rescued
the damsel in distress.

830
01:08:02,038 --> 01:08:04,582
Of course, we regret the loss
of our friend, Ferret.

831
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:08,753
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

832
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,255
Nonetheless, we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

833
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,884
But to speak the truth,
which is essential,

834
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:17,261
regrets are trifles

835
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:20,681
when one considers
the grand design.

836
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:22,600
And we are here tonight
in celebration

837
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,686
of an event of profound
significance--

838
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:29,023
The duplication
of the Holland formula.

839
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:38,908
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

840
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:42,328
Dear, dear Bruno,

841
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:43,788
who won the notebook

842
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,624
from which we extracted
the final secret.

843
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:49,543
And topped it
by capturing the beast.

844
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:03,599
<i>So, I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success,</i>

845
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,268
to our conquest of the world.

846
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:08,604
To Bruno.

847
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,815
[all]
Bruno.

848
01:09:21,242 --> 01:09:22,618
But sir...

849
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,955
have you tried it out
on a plant yet?

850
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:28,165
<i>I mean, when are we going
to see the results?</i>

851
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,542
Tonight.

852
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,878
<i>Tonight, dear Bruno,
immediately.</i>

853
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:34,630
<i>But not on a plant.</i>

854
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:36,423
Have you taken it?

855
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:38,551
No.

856
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:43,013
I have given the privilege of taking
the first dose of our formula

857
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:45,391
to our guest of honor.

858
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,311
<i>Who deserves
the privilege thoroughly.</i>

859
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:52,106
It is you, dear Bruno

860
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:56,152
who will tell us whether or not
the formula works.

861
01:09:57,736 --> 01:09:59,822
[hiccups and wheezes]

862
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,870
Bruno, what's the matter
with you?

863
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,080
[creaking]

864
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,675
[groaning]

865
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:29,894
Calm.

866
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:54,793
[screaming]

867
01:10:57,755 --> 01:10:58,714
Calm.

868
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,726
You...

869
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:27,117
What have you done
with Cable?

870
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,703
[whispering]
Holland.

871
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:31,956
Holland.

872
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:35,167
You're there.

873
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:38,254
Brain intact.

874
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:43,592
All your abilities, everything,
plus the power--

875
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:45,469
the physical strength.

876
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,473
Bring him in.

877
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,311
Some friend you are.

878
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,438
Sorry, Bruno,
it's every man for himself,

879
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:58,357
and God against all.

880
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,036
Why doesn't Bruno have
your strength?

881
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,375
We followed
the notebooks religiously.

882
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,961
There can be
no margin for error.

883
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:23,132
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

884
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:26,218
Because he never had it.

885
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:28,345
No riddles, please.

886
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,181
You will tell me...

887
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:33,684
or you'll Pay-

888
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:37,104
And for a very dear agent.

889
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:40,357
Bring her in.

890
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:49,116
The explanation or her.

891
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:50,409
Alec, don't!

892
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:56,790
Which?

893
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,168
You don't understand.

894
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,545
There's nothing hidden.

895
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:03,797
<i>No secrets.</i>

896
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,801
<i>The formula works
in so simple a way.</i>

897
01:13:08,844 --> 01:13:13,432
What Bruno took
was what changed me.

898
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:19,146
It only amplifies
your essence.

899
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,648
It simply makes you more

900
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,027
of what you already are.

901
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:30,991
Bruno's essence was stupidity--
timidity.

902
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,287
The formula simply extended,

903
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:40,459
amplified this to ridiculous forms
and proportions.

904
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,213
He shrank.

905
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,591
<i>He shrank to what
he actually was.</i>

906
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:53,972
But if the essence is,
let us say, genius,

907
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,852
then this genius shall be
monumental in body,

908
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,063
as well as in spirit.

909
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,106
Is that what you're saying?

910
01:14:36,682 --> 01:14:37,933
Cable.

911
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:39,977
Alec.

[buzzing]

913
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,460
Not to be the phenomenon,

914
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,630
but the thing in itself.

915
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:33,840
Eternal.

916
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:38,512
Absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power--

917
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:43,183
physical and spiritual.

918
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:48,605
To <i>be the world and own</i> it.
<i>[footsteps approach]</i>

919
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,650
Yes?

920
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:52,818
Darling,

921
01:16:53,986 --> 01:16:57,573
tell Karen to bring me
a glass of brandy, hm?

922
01:16:57,573 --> 01:16:59,491
[no audible dialog]

923
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,271
Reach for it.

924
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:33,483
You thrive on the light,
reach for it.

925
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:44,161
Alec.

926
01:17:44,161 --> 01:17:46,622

Come.
Come.

[gasps]

930
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:12,689
[clanking]

931
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:13,940
What's the matter with you?

932
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,067
Go.

933
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,151
Go, leave me!

934
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:59,194
[grunting]

935
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:16,628
[shrieking]

936
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:34,938
Your arm.

01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:45,866

940
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:53,517
Listen.

941
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,561
He's taken the formula.

942
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:13,453
Please, there is a way.

943
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:16,289
I can't reach it.

944
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:18,750
But you twist it to the right
and then to the left.

945
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:24,339
<i>Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.</i>

Come on, follow me.

01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:51,157
You'll have to trust me here

952
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,659
if you want to survive.

953
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:53,869
If you don't...

954
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,453
Tell us!

955
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,289
This is the well of the estate

956
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:59,875
fed by a-- a spring from the bottom
of the great swamp.

957
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,501
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

958
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:04,629
Go!

959
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,215
Watch your step.

960
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:09,676
[Bruno laughing]

961
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:11,636
Have a nice trip?

962
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,640
See you in the fall.

01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,776

I don't understand.

It's over.

975
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:22,572
Alec, let me go with you.

976
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:25,158
You can start your work again.

01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:33,917
With these?

01:27:36,044 --> 01:27:37,420
I'll be your hands.

You need to heal.

You need to tell our story.

<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

<i>He told me to come get you.</i>

1
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm fond of close up photos

2
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:59,024
because they reveal something more of

3
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,427
what we are unable to see in larger perspective.

4
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,729
When you take portrait photos,

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,098
what do you focus on?

6
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,092
I think I focus on the eyes.

7
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,607
You'll have to excuse me, the little one's crying.

8
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:25,213
Gosh! He's gorgeous

9
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:27,414
but too bad he has a baby already.

10
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,818
Hey, why are you crying? Are you hungry?

11
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,520
Are you a furious little baby?

12
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,823
You feel better now?

13
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:42,494
Everyone has special someone in their hearts.

14
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:49,700
The heart tinkles every time we think about them,

15
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,303
but they will always remain in our hearts.

16
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,705
Even though, I don't know...

17
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:58,708
how he's doing or where he is now.

18
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,914
At least, he has taught me about

19
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,516
my first love.

20
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:11,111
"A CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE"

21
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,782
No wonder why you wanna come here everyday.

22
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:50,776
What? He's got really weird scooter.

23
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:55,389
Hey look...

24
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,383
she's a very pretty thing!

25
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,701
He's gorgeous, no doubt you're so into him.

26
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:12,502
I'm not into him at all.

27
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,205
"James Bean."

28
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,175
Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.

29
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:29,184
Follow me.
Okay.

30
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:30,880
This way please.

31
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,291
Hello...

32
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,893
I wondering if you have a room for tonight.

33
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:41,594
Yes, how long are you gonna stay here?

34
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:42,496
I think 3 nights.

35
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,397
American breakfast.

36
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:47,299
Fried rice and breakfast for this table, mom.

37
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,373
After you're done with that table,

38
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:56,874
can you go to the market for me?

39
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,075
Sure, mom.

40
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,270
Good girl.

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
How's school dear?

42
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:05,383
It's going well. I'm hanging out

43
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,883
with my old gang, Cheer, Kie and Nim.

44
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,484
You've been with them since first grade.

45
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:11,287
Aren't you sick of each other already?

46
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,088
Well, you wouldn't have
anyone else to hang out with,

47
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,491
even if you wanted to.

48
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,993
You guys are ugly ducklings.

49
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:19,983
There...

50
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,398
Let me tell you something,

51
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,499
who we hang out with

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,967
is not all about looks you know.

53
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,870
But how you look is the first impression.

54
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,772
Good that I took after you,

55
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,874
if I looked like dad,

56
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,777
I'll never have a boyfriend.

57
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,075
There!

58
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,581
Enough you two,

59
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:48,384
you're too old to fight.

60
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:53,388
Don't talk like that about your father,

61
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,792
if he hears you he'll be upset.

62
00:04:56,793 --> 00:05:00,752
Now go, be on your way.

63
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:06,663
He's in the states. He can't hear me.

64
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,869
You want some mangoes?

65
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,251
Mangoes?

66
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:46,767
The new seniors are so cute.

67
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:50,570
Yes, I was in all girls school since kindergarten,

68
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,171
so sick of that.

69
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,773
Have you got it?

70
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:56,775
Yes, mine adds up to 28.

71
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,777
25-35,

72
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:01,179
you're compatible with men who're leaders,

73
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,880
warm and kind.

74
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:06,840
Must be Tong, the Chairman of Buddhist Club.

75
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:09,552
Cheer got 15.

76
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,154
15-25

77
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:15,657
you're compatible with athletes, just and fair.

78
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:18,354
Must be Ken, the basketball player over there.

79
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,469
Couldn't be him.

80
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,268
Mine must be a bad boy.

81
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,174
That's quite right.

82
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,576
It must be...

83
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,178
Meaw,

84
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,840
tough guy.

85
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,949
Kie.

86
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,252
30, Nam got 30

87
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,954
30, you're compatible with artists,

88
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:53,157
unique and artistic.

89
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,353
Who must he be?

90
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:06,658
You seem a little down for English class.

91
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:10,565
Could you be a little more active like during lunch?

92
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:17,443
Don't smile just yet.

93
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,545
You seem to be doing well only in English.

94
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:23,348
Other subjects are so bad.

95
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,050
You little ugly duckling!

96
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:29,654
Today, we'll be studying grammar from song lyrics,

97
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:32,756
please pass on the paper.

98
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:37,561
His name is Shone, he's a junior.

99
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:41,555
He has quite a reputation.

100
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:45,858
Maybe it's just a rumor.

101
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:51,038
Students, if we change A to E

102
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,240
in the word 'inspiration',

103
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:57,234
it becomes a verb 'inspire'.

104
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,346
Two girls left the school because of him.

105
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,848
So better stay away from him.

106
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,349
You know?

107
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes...

108
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,153
My friend's sister went to the same school as Shone.

109
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,153
Really?
Yes.

110
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,451
Do you think the story is true?

111
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,546
What are you guys talking about?

112
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,322
But I'm teaching...

113
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,836
Cheer.

114
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,338
Stand up.

115
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,332
What does 'You are the inspiration' means?

116
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,445
What does it mean?

117
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:40,447
Just moment.

118
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,549
You inspire me.

119
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,950
Yes...

120
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,852
You're the inspiration.

121
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:54,125
You're the inspiration.

122
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:57,227
Everyone is inspired by someone.

123
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,730
Even I'm inspired

124
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,432
by someone...

125
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,834
Sit down.

126
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,135
Thank you teacher.

127
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,637
All right.

128
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:11,640
Let's read all together now.

129
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:16,543
You are the inspiration...

130
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:17,943
Again.

131
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:39,520
Akarin, would you solve this equation, please?

132
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,529
Who did this?

133
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:03,734
Prof. Orn.

134
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,535
It's in.

135
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:06,804
You're good. When are you going

136
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,505
to try out for school team.

137
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,606
Playing just for fun is much better.

138
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:13,309
You're still scared? Come on let's play.

139
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,910
Shone...

140
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,912
Hey, I'll be right back.

141
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,814
Who is that girl?
Who?

142
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:23,012
Why is Shone talking to her?

143
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,722
Or maybe she's his ex?

144
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:33,226
That's not true!

145
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,024
Sorry.

146
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,212
Uncle Chang!

147
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,515
Mom, Nam, Uncle Chang's here.

148
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:01,916
Hello, we miss you so much.

149
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,819
Uncle Chang...

150
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,412
Hello, Chang.

151
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,725
Hey, Pang, long time no see,

152
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,592
you head still smells funky.

153
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,395
Oh, Nam? You're all grown up now,

154
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:18,697
I hardly recognize you.

155
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,800
Hey Pim, oh...

156
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:24,602
Hey, uncle.

157
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:25,402
Are you that sleepy?

158
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:26,604
I think it's jet lag.

159
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:29,306
I haven't adjusted to Thailand's time yet.

160
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:30,607
Here we go again.

161
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,007
Hey, hold it!

162
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,513
Is my dad as fat as you are?

163
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,215
Your dad is working as a sous chef.

164
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,617
He's doing all the heavy jobs,

165
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:45,319
he's very buff right now.

166
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,481
I have a photo from him to show you.

167
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:51,692
Hey, let me see.

168
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:54,388
Hey... wait.

169
00:12:58,698 --> 00:12:59,898
Pim,

170
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:04,393
your man said he'll transfer more money this month.

171
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:09,897
He told me to tell you that...

172
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:13,210
I promise,

173
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:17,214
I'll pay off the mortgage of this house,

174
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:20,883
you and kids hang in there.

175
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,877
He should visit us sometimes.

176
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,891
He said that if one of you

177
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,792
can be top of the class,

178
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:35,786
he'll send to a ticket to visit him in the states.

179
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,600
The airfare is quite expensive.

180
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,101
Do you think he'll keep his promise, mom?

181
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:46,805
He knows that being top of class

182
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:50,799
is quite difficult, dear.

183
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,479
You'll see.

184
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,881
I will be the top of my class,

185
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,679
so he knows I can do it.

186
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:04,278
You're going to the top from the rank 30?

187
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,986
2 strawberry soda and 2 orange soda please.

188
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:17,989
Hey, 2 Pepsi, I'm so thirsty.

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,700
How can you do this?

190
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,702
I'm just really thirsty,

191
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:25,905
do you have a problem with that?

192
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,173
Haven't you heard that men, children,

193
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:31,276
and basketball players get the privileges

194
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,478
at this school.

195
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,879
And I'm a basketball player.

196
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,872
Can I have 4 sodas for the soccer players please?

197
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,693
Will Pepsi do?

198
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,286
Yes...

199
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,757
Darn it!

200
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,271
Hey, don't kick at me.

201
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,866
Sorry... don't you get it?

202
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,579
Hey!

203
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,277
Hey... I can handle this.

204
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,791
Nam, Shone and Ding

205
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,594
are having a fight behind the school.

206
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,894
Stop...

207
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,163
Where are you going?

208
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:38,156
Let's take the scooter, it's faster, come on.

209
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,261
Hurry!

210
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:50,871
I think you can handle him.

211
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,281
So you want to be hero like your dad?

212
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:00,284
He was a loser and cost us National Championship.

213
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:02,186
Did you guys know

214
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:06,180
that he missed the penalty kick?

215
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:09,158
It took ages to make it to National Championship.

216
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,457
Darn it...

217
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:36,972
We just missed seeing Ding getting beat up.

218
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:40,251
Let's go.

219
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,858
Do you still want this soda he gave us?

220
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:48,959
If you're not going to drink it,

221
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,654
can I throw it away?

222
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,863
Do not drink.

223
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:57,264
Why is it in the freezer if you can't drink it?

224
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,966
All right students,

225
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,569
I have 2 announcements today.

226
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,871
Our school has become filthy due to littering,

227
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,740
and the students are ignorant.

228
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:49,743
So from now on,

229
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,146
anyone who litters will be fined 1 baht per piece.

230
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,947
I have a promotion if you think this is too expensive,

231
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,450
this is a great deal.

232
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,452
Pay 50 baht per day

233
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,454
and you can litter anytime and anywhere,

234
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:05,756
I'll just clean up after you.

235
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:10,060
Students with the following names

236
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,062
please proceed to Disciplinary Office,

237
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:15,364
Jakawan Class 4/5

238
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,967
and Achawin Class 4/7.

239
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:21,737
Everybody understand?

240
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,338
Understand?

241
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,939
Yes...

242
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,340
Thank you. I love you.

243
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,443
Cross your arms.

244
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,655
If you get into fights again,

245
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,057
I'll inform your parents, do you hear me?

246
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,759
Shone, you have great talent,

247
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,961
in photography.

248
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,763
Why don't you enter
the provincial photography contest?

249
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,331
I think you should apply for it.

250
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,432
Maybe you can do something for our school,

251
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,133
instead of wasting your time fighting.

252
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,336
Do you understand me?

253
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,936
Yes, sir.
You may go now.

254
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,738
Thank you.

255
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,036
Next.

256
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:15,249
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

257
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,049
I'm really sorry.

258
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,451
It's okay.

259
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,953
It's not your fault.

260
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:25,357
Band aids for you.

261
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,121
Get well soon.

262
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,925
Nam.

263
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,329
Thank you.

264
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,141
Yes, he knows my name.

265
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:49,844
He actually knows my name.

266
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,541
He knows my name.

267
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,352
What?

268
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:01,121
They actually have books like this?

269
00:20:01,122 --> 00:20:05,114
Oh... 20 ways to get your guy.

270
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:09,324
There goes the 'White Ribbon' girls.

271
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,333
I'll be right back.

272
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,734
Look at her,

273
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:20,636
since when is she friends with them?

274
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,242
Is she for real?

275
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,643
I miss my dad,

276
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,446
I haven't seen him for 5 years now.

277
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,014
Earn,

278
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,116
Kai's now in love with me,

279
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,918
because of this book.

280
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,421
Really? This book really works?

281
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:44,424
Yeah, Pooh also bought this book

282
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,124
before she got together with Toh.

283
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,026
9 love tips really works.

284
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,831
You're not going with them anymore?

285
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:57,825
No, they're saying I outshine them.

286
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,009
Tip No. 1.

287
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,003
Greek belief on how to win someone's heart,

288
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:14,716
look at the stars in the sky,

289
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:17,018
connect the stars with your fingers

290
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,219
to make the name of someone you love in Latin.

291
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,723
Hey, wait up!

292
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:25,124
Hey, I can't do it.

293
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,627
Nam, why don't you join us?

294
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:31,621
No, I think it's nonsense.

295
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:33,933
Gotta get this right.

296
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,128
I'm going to do it at home.

297
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:41,297
We're going, Nam. Later!

298
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,009
You're practicing real hard.

299
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,512
Do you have a soccer match somewhere?

300
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,111
Just around here.

301
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,205
Hey, I can't!
Catch!

302
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:36,718
I told you I can't, watch where you kick.

303
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:39,621
I though you were Chinese?

304
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:43,615
My ancestral accent comes out every time I'm upset!

305
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,393
Come on.

306
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:50,697
Look at this, Shone.

307
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:52,198
How about it?

308
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,700
A poster of the 3rd Photography Contest

309
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,301
that you asked about.

310
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:57,599
I see.

311
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:03,007
Look at him. He can play soccer day

312
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,809
and night on the streets

313
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,111
but refuses to join his school team.

314
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:09,612
He's just having fun,

315
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:12,715
I don't think he's taking soccer seriously.

316
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:15,207
Even if he is, he wouldn't join the team.

317
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,489
I should've scored that penalty kick.

318
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:25,592
Here you go again, don't blame yourself.

319
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:27,495
Maybe he's not really feeling ashamed

320
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:29,396
about what you did.

321
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:34,000
Or even if he is, he has to get over it by himself.

322
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:37,994
Look at you now, how far you've come.

323
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,013
You look a bit strange.

324
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:53,282
Look, I have new braces for my teeth,

325
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,984
do you like them?

326
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,386
They don't look anything special to me.

327
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:00,689
Hey, here, look here.

328
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,783
I still don't like them.

329
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,995
Hey, you picked Ken?

330
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,397
Yes,

331
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,599
eat now,

332
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,301
eat now.

333
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:18,504
Yes, he ate.

334
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,407
Are you crazy? He's in the middle of his lunch.

335
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:23,908
This is not hypnotizing.

336
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:27,178
What are you guys doing?

337
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,379
Tip no. 2,

338
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,581
from Mayan, the indigenous people,

339
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:33,383
concentrate

340
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,085
and look at the one you love,

341
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:36,886
try to hypnotize him

342
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,487
to do what you want.

343
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:40,790
If he acts as you ordered,

344
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,692
it means that he is your soulmate.

345
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,501
Hey, he turned around.

346
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,202
Who...

347
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,805
Oh, no one.

348
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,174
Are you hypnotizing Shone?

349
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,373
No...

350
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,075
I didn't do anything.

351
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:07,069
I though you said this book is nonsense.

352
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:12,883
Well, taking beliefs from different culture

353
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:15,385
and various islands is kinda weird.

354
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,187
Then why are you following the book?

355
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,887
I... hey!

356
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:21,590
You can tell us the truth.

357
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,692
I don't wanna be teased.

358
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:25,594
Don't you worry about that.

359
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:29,588
Because we will definitely tease you.

360
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,999
Tip No. 3.

361
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,067
Scottish way of saying you love someone.

362
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:37,771
Give a gift to someone anonymously,

363
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:40,172
just for the person to know

364
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:43,370
that someone has a crush on him.

365
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,478
This jelly is mine.

366
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:49,971
How can you drop it?

367
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,387
Thank you so much, Prof. Pol.

368
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:58,988
Salted eggs.

369
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:01,290
Oh, I must be on your mind

370
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:04,594
when you were travelling.

371
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:07,762
I'll finish it all,

372
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,764
thank you so much.

373
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:12,766
Thank you.

374
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:15,369
Prof. Pol's eggs.

375
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,771
Prof. Pol's eggs and some salts.

376
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:20,573
Prof. Pol's salted eggs, it's correct.

377
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,775
Prof. Pol brought me eggs.

378
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:26,769
Prof. Pol's salted eggs...

379
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,286
Oh, don't tell me...

380
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,087
Yes, there's from Prof. Pol.

381
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:37,989
How many boxes have you got?

382
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,755
4 boxes.
4 boxes?

383
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,955
Salted eggs.

384
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,559
Hope you can finish them all.

385
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:50,557
See you.

386
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:59,564
Oh, no!

387
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,577
My scooter's ruined!

388
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:06,570
I forgot we live in a tropical country.

389
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:14,750
Mangoes?

390
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,656
People give flowers and handkerchiefs,

391
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:20,958
what's so romantic about mangoes?

392
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,952
Hey, look over there.

393
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:29,556
Cool dude! Go...

394
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:35,260
Mango cake, I made it myself.

395
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:41,074
Thank you, looks delicious.

396
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,375
Are you okay?

397
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:44,077
I'm all right.

398
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:48,037
Okay, we're dead.

399
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:51,850
She only has to do that.

400
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:56,354
She's adorable and she bakes.

401
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:59,657
How can you beat that?

402
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,649
Better find another boy.

403
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:10,066
Actually I already have a date,

404
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,568
but if you invite me over for dinner

405
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:12,868
at your place,

406
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:16,270
and this is would be our first date...

407
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:20,441
If you're not free, that's okay.

408
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:23,744
Next semester then.

409
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,945
Oh, wait,

410
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:29,939
actually I'm free, I accept your invitation.

411
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:35,245
See you later this evening.

412
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,362
This dinner is not just for the two of us?

413
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:46,764
It's not actually a dinner,

414
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:49,165
it's a party for the end of semester,

415
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,567
a lot of our colleagues are coming,

416
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:53,035
it'll be fun.

417
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,628
Oh, okay.

418
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,240
Prof. Orn.

419
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:01,843
Prof.

420
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:05,245
I never give up.

421
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,547
This time it's war.

422
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:10,847
That's my answer sheet.

423
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:14,854
Higher...

424
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,355
Prof.

425
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,347
Lift me higher, Nam.

426
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,459
I got it.

427
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,862
We have to make Shone give Nam a lift home.

428
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,330
Yes...

429
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,333
It's your once in a lifetime wish isn't it?

430
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:31,834
Yeah.

431
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:38,940
He gives you mangoes after he drives you,

432
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:41,034
how romantic is that.

433
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:46,747
You have to pretend your scooter's broken.

434
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:48,549
How?

435
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,251
He'll know once he tries to fix it.

436
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:52,352
That's true.

437
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:54,054
You must lose your keys.

438
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:56,555
How?

439
00:29:56,556 --> 00:30:00,225
It's here.

440
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:01,427
Hey...

441
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,328
It's gone.

442
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:07,322
Hey, there he is.

443
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,937
Mango cake girl, what's wrong?

444
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,140
I tripped and must have sprained my ankle.

445
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:20,743
Come, I'll give you a lift.

446
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:22,644
That's all right!

447
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:28,549
Come on, let me take you home.

448
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,348
I'm a little clumsy.

449
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,529
What a show!

450
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,731
She went to acting school or what?

451
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:53,036
"Bye Bye Grade 7. See you all Grade 8."

452
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:56,039
Mom, come see this.

453
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,340
Pang, you little brat.

454
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:01,334
Mom, Nam has a boyfriend.

455
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:06,914
Nam, I think this can wait until you grow up.

456
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,817
You're going away to see your dad,

457
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:13,811
concentrate on your school, dear.

458
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:31,535
Hey, Cheer.

459
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:33,337
Your little sister said

460
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:34,839
you've been depressed for weeks now.

461
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,141
Listening to sad tunes all week.

462
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:41,101
I thought you must have gotten over Shone by now.

463
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:45,013
Keep your voice down, mom might hear us.

464
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:49,007
She's off to the market already.

465
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,614
Don't push me.

466
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,524
When's your mom going to expand these stairs?

467
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:00,119
Hey, Nam, hear one more tip okay?

468
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,529
Tip no. 7

469
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,533
is from the Gypsies, let love inspire you.

470
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,334
The power of love shall make you smarter,

471
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:13,404
prettier and better in every way,

472
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,107
then that person will finally notice you.

473
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,700
Hey what?

474
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:27,917
Shone is gorgeous so Nam should be beautiful...

475
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:30,819
Okay, do that later, my skin's coming off now.

476
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:16,824
What is this?

477
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:17,723
Turmeric.

478
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:20,784
Let's go.

479
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:32,004
Hey, hello girls.

480
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:34,405
Let me know how I can help you okay?

481
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:37,398
Have a look around.

482
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:52,721
"Pornchai missed PK."

483
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,990
"Failed to hand Provincial cup."

484
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,592
I don't see him anywhere.

485
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,293
Maybe he's not home.

486
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:03,597
He's probably out. I don't see his scooter.

487
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:07,600
Have you found what you're looking for?

488
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:11,594
Yes, this one.

489
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,401
What are you buying?

490
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,577
You guys play table tennis?

491
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,882
Why are you so yellow?

492
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:39,193
Do you have jaundice?

493
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:41,396
Shone.

494
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:42,697
Mango cake girl.

495
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:43,696
Are you here to buy something?

496
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,199
I need a dozen of table tennis balls.

497
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,292
Come, I'll get them for you.

498
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:57,709
Come on kids, join my Drama Club.

499
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,911
Drama Club, anyone?

500
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:00,478
We have a lot of plays for you.

501
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,781
You can be a princess or a prince.

502
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:03,981
You can star in our plays.

503
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,684
The lords of comedy were in my club.

504
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,786
Anyone interested?

505
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:10,286
Join us?

506
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,989
Father of talk show was also in our club.

507
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,792
Really?
If you wanna make it in the business,

508
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,092
this is your chance.

509
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:20,085
Join us, dear? Don't pass over me.

510
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,901
Take off your glasses.

511
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:27,803
Your glasses.

512
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,604
Hey, but I feel awkward without them.

513
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,706
I think we totally don't fit with that

514
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:35,174
pretty-polis-posh concept

515
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,376
of that Dancing Arts Club.

516
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:41,679
Prof. Orn always selects the smartest and prettiest

517
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,881
for her club and when they perform,

518
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,882
the whole school goes to see them.

519
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:49,786
Unlike those weirdos in Drama Club,

520
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,888
no one ever watches their plays.

521
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,890
Well, it's worth giving it a try.

522
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:58,194
We maybe a little dark,

523
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:01,096
a little dorky but pretty in our own ways.

524
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,468
Shone,

525
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,670
which club are you joining?

526
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,972
Photography.

527
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:15,966
Whenever you need a model, just let me know.

528
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,375
I like photographing landscapes, not people.

529
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,682
Are you kidding me?

530
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,983
If you say so.

531
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,680
Come on, get in the frame.

532
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,772
You're not yellow anymore,

533
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:54,574
your skin seems lighter?

534
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:56,176
Maybe...

535
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:58,475
a little.

536
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,373
I'll be watching your performance okay?

537
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,660
You see, Nam,

538
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:18,361
he said you look prettier,

539
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,963
keep up head high okay?

540
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:22,266
If we get to do dance performance,

541
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:24,966
would be fantastic!

542
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,969
We'll be so pretty and fabulous.

543
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,471
If you're not sure that you're pretty enough,

544
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:33,474
you're always welcome in other clubs, you know?

545
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:35,576
Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.

546
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:39,579
I wasn't talk to you, I was talking to Funn, right?

547
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,281
Liar,

548
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:43,273
you said it to us.

549
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:52,256
Stop it, girls.

550
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:55,055
I don't want any troublemakers in my club.

551
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,362
Wait...

552
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:03,356
Faye and Funn, stay behind.

553
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,552
Nam...

554
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:30,055
I'm sorry about earlier.

555
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:31,456
I have to apologize too.

556
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:32,856
Yeah.

557
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,553
I bought extra drink, you can have it.

558
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,666
Wait,

559
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,668
let her drink it first.

560
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:50,372
Why won't you drink it.

561
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:51,273
Go.

562
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:53,141
If you don't want a drink spiked

563
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:57,135
with fish sauce, throw it away.

564
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:02,742
How can she do that?

565
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:09,555
There you are, I was looking all over for you.

566
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,357
Look at me

567
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:12,357
and smile...

568
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:14,259
Frown...

569
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,562
Laugh,

570
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,762
oh perfect!

571
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,565
See you tomorrow at the auditorium okay?

572
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,167
Professor.

573
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:24,468
Keep your voice down,

574
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:26,435
I'm only accepting a few students.

575
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,233
Understand?

576
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,033
Can I have some?

577
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:39,847
Prof. In,

578
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:42,650
oh, what's wrong?

579
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:44,350
Are you okay?

580
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:45,952
Are you all right?

581
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:49,155
Are you okay?

582
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,958
Prof. In.

583
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,960
How can I help you, sir?

584
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:57,962
Nothing, how are you?

585
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:01,532
I'm fine.

586
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,633
See you tomorrow.

587
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,727
I'm fine.

588
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,239
Water, need water.

589
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,439
No...

590
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,142
It's a perfect match and I mean it.

591
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:15,244
Prof. In.

592
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,046
Maybe I shouldn't let you do the play,

593
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,546
if you're this late.

594
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:19,347
Okay...

595
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,850
Oh, wait!

596
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,952
I was just joking!

597
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:28,355
We meant to tell you that...

598
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:30,256
No worries,

599
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,058
I'll give you the best parts.

600
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:34,827
We meant to tell you...

601
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,328
Come on, help me out...

602
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:39,130
We want to dance...

603
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:43,124
dance...

604
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,736
in you play,
dance...

605
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:48,729
because we're so happy to be in your play.

606
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:57,246
This year, I proudly present the play called

607
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:03,550
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"

608
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:08,722
Nam, your English is better than the rest.

609
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,924
You play Snow white okay?

610
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:13,426
Me?

611
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:18,330
Yes... ready! Oh, a rabbit,

612
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:21,132
what are you doing here?

613
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:22,533
I'm here to paint.

614
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,936
Then what are you doing inside the box?

615
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:28,338
I bought interior paint.

616
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,739
Go paint elsewhere.

617
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:34,443
Wait a second,

618
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:36,846
get me all phone numbers of those

619
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,542
in Art Production.

620
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:43,118
My students are so gifted in acting,

621
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,819
I'm sure it's gonna be a great play.

622
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,522
Are you all right? Are you sick?

623
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:49,924
No.

624
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,026
I feel fine.

625
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:56,629
Oh, maybe you're not used to my natural beauty.

626
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,731
Lipsticks are waste of money.

627
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:01,333
And most importantly,

628
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:05,336
I just wanna give someone a head start.

629
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:09,640
Perhaps you went a little too far?

630
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:11,242
Let's compete with our work.

631
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:12,343
Because judging from our looks,

632
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:13,810
we're neck and neck.

633
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:17,514
I've trained the students to put make up on

634
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,506
like my natural style.

635
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:25,611
And this is how you get the natural look.

636
00:42:29,825 --> 00:42:33,818
Are you sure you've trained them?

637
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,822
It this a play or a circus?

638
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,634
Could be a circus, Prof. Orn.

639
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:45,628
This is the kids' creativity.

640
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,818
You're going home?

641
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:02,911
Yes.

642
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:10,624
Shone.

643
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,097
Home safe.

644
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,506
She was walking fine

645
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:30,907
when she got here wasn't she?

646
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,618
Professor.
Yes.

647
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,519
Would you like some water?
Thank you.

648
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:02,001
My football's going to be out of air.

649
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:05,304
Sorry about that.

650
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:07,205
This is Pin, a junior,

651
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:08,707
she'll be taking care of

652
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,509
costumes and make-up for our play.

653
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,001
May I have a round of applause for Pin.

654
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:16,714
Please take care of this for me, Pin.

655
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:18,116
I think we should get started.

656
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:22,519
Okay, let's get started with me.

657
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,221
I forgot I'm not in the play.

658
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:27,689
Let's start with Snow white then.

659
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,091
Start with me?

660
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:31,686
Yes, you first.

661
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,609
What do you think?

662
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,779
She looks the same to me.

663
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,771
Snow white with braces.

664
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:52,094
I don't want braces anymore.

665
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:54,393
I wanna take them out.

666
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:58,800
Nam, are you there?

667
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,802
Okay, ready. Stand by.

668
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,404
Where's the Prince?

669
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:05,706
He has diarrhea.

670
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:09,666
On a final rehearsal? Is he crazy?

671
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:15,380
You... the painter.

672
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:17,382
Can you fill in for the Prince please?

673
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:18,483
Me?

674
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,577
Yes, be a Prince, it'll be quick.

675
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:26,790
Closer, get closer.

676
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:31,094
When I say action, lean towards her to kiss okay?

677
00:46:31,095 --> 00:46:32,494
Action.

678
00:46:34,797 --> 00:46:38,790
You so beautiful, I have to kiss you.

679
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,088
Hey, Nam...

680
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:25,864
You're going to break you neck there.

681
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:31,569
Hey, too long already, go back to painting.

682
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:34,480
Nam standby. Koi, ready.

683
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,472
What?

684
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:43,283
Ready, action.

685
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:02,962
Hello, this is Pornchai Sports Shop.

686
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:10,277
May I please speak to Shone?

687
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,678
Shone speaking.

688
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:20,642
Hello...

689
00:48:33,365 --> 00:48:35,060
He hung up.

690
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:05,057
Mirror mirror on the wall,

691
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:09,051
who is the most beautiful one of all?

692
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:15,966
Where are you going? Toilet?

693
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:17,567
The witch is here,

694
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:18,770
this is the climax of the play.

695
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,870
There's the witch.

696
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:24,173
Yes, eat.
Apple?

697
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:26,335
Eat.

698
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:40,853
Look...

699
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:42,155
She's not dead.

700
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:45,058
She's gonna solve her problem, you'll see.

701
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,358
Death snow white... death.

702
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:57,058
No one informed me about our student

703
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:00,036
who won the provincial photography contest.

704
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:02,138
They just called to inform us now, sir.

705
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,541
Try to keep up with the performance

706
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,343
of our students okay?

707
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:08,844
Hurry up.

708
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:10,145
Yes... I'm trying.

709
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:14,139
The iron's not working so well, sir.

710
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:19,250
Prof. Rabue, this is why.

711
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:25,148
Could you plug it for me?

712
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,462
Will you marry me?

713
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:31,763
Yes, I will.

714
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:35,533
And so snow while and the prince

715
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:39,527
lives happily ever after.

716
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:46,042
Well done, students, great job!

717
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,245
You can still see the footprints.

718
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,847
I ironed, I didn't wash his shirt, sir.

719
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,748
Do you want me to wash it?

720
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,150
We don't have time.

721
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:57,051
Don't forget your bag.

722
00:50:59,955 --> 00:51:02,355
Get going now. Go.

723
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:03,948
Well done!

724
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:10,420
Dinner's on me tonight.

725
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,634
"For Snow White, I tasted it for you,"

726
00:51:14,635 --> 00:51:16,434
"it's not poisoned."

727
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,035
Hold on.

728
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:21,439
One more time, eat your heart out tonight,

729
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,533
my treat!

730
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:28,341
Let's pack up now.

731
00:51:29,446 --> 00:51:31,947
For Snow white.

732
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:34,250
Who is it from? A bitten apple.

733
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:37,152
Must be from Shone.

734
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:38,753
You really think so?

735
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:41,021
You ugly thing!

736
00:51:41,022 --> 00:51:44,014
Nam, maybe it's from that guy...

737
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:50,329
Prince Frog.

738
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:54,323
Princess Frog and Prince Frog.

739
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:58,437
What a jerk, why didn't you come see the play?

740
00:51:58,438 --> 00:52:02,431
I bet you were watching those dancers.

741
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:18,710
What a jerk!

742
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:27,627
Mac doesn't feel a thing.

743
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,729
Hey, how's my little boy?

744
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,932
Hey, what brings you here?

745
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,133
Hello.

746
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:38,127
Guys, this is Top, my friend since kindergarten.

747
00:52:38,337 --> 00:52:41,139
Hello...

748
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,732
Hello.

749
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:46,504
He's cute.

750
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:52,509
Hey!

751
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,119
Let's go.

752
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,022
How long are you going to stay this time?

753
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:02,123
Probably until my dad retires.

754
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:03,625
But if I can get into university,

755
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:04,926
I'll move to Bangkok with my mom.

756
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:07,027
Cute!

757
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:08,723
Let's go see the cafeteria.

758
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:13,233
Hey, pretty girl,

759
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:14,934
what's your name?

760
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:18,036
Yes, you. What's your name?

761
00:53:18,037 --> 00:53:24,108
Don't be shy. Going already?

762
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:26,100
You wanna a little fight with me, girl?

763
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,913
I think Prof. In put it on.

764
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,716
It's probably been showing all day.

765
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:34,207
Let's go.

766
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,021
Hey, that's Snow white on TV.

767
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:42,924
She's cute. Does she have a boyfriend?

768
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:44,826
I don't think so but I don't think

769
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:46,828
you should ask her out.

770
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,829
Why not?

771
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,931
Isn't she too young?

772
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:54,891
Hey, I've asked for numbers of 5th graders before.

773
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:59,705
"Bye Sophomore. Hello Junior!"

774
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:01,697
"2 more subjects to make up for"
"Will follow you to Junior year!"

775
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:10,314
Shone, this is yours.

776
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:12,516
I thought so. Every time we play soccer,

777
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:15,318
you'll always have give me a penalty kick.

778
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,220
You do it.

779
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,722
Hey, you're still not over it?

780
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,224
Your dad must have forgotten about it by now.

781
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:24,426
It's not that. That was too easy.

782
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,695
Yeah right, Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo.

783
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,597
Top, can I take a photo with you?

784
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:30,598
Yeah, sure.

785
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,099
Can I have one too?

786
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,701
Then who's going to the photo for me?

787
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:35,702
Will you take one for me first?

788
00:54:35,703 --> 00:54:37,604
I can take it for you.

789
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:39,800
Thank you...

790
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:42,608
A bit closer.

791
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,109
Okay...

792
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,103
1... 2... 3...

793
00:54:58,923 --> 00:55:02,191
Hey, why are you stealing my scene?

794
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:06,185
I asked him first, you know?

795
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:11,199
Stop...

796
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,001
All of you stop it!

797
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:17,504
Stop it right now!

798
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:20,707
Isn't this too much?

799
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,801
I have no idea.

800
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:26,011
Stop now. Stop!

801
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:38,488
I was the referee, sir.

802
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:41,691
How many days to district sports day?

803
00:55:41,692 --> 00:55:43,693
About 2 weeks, sir.

804
00:55:43,694 --> 00:55:47,696
The athletes and cheer squad are practicing hard.

805
00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:50,598
Who's going to be drum major now?

806
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,100
I think...

807
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,102
I have to ask Prof. Orn for some help,

808
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,594
see if she can find someone.

809
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:14,786
Don't worry about that, sir.

810
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,880
I got it.

811
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:22,784
It's nothing.

812
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:30,699
Nam,

813
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,201
in my entire being,

814
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:36,203
I've never met anyone so perfect

815
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:37,805
and excellent like you.

816
00:56:37,806 --> 00:56:41,275
You look incredible and fabulous.

817
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,776
Please get straight to the point.

818
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:46,770
What can I do for you, Prof. In?

819
00:56:47,481 --> 00:56:50,883
I was wondering if you could be the school's

820
00:56:50,884 --> 00:56:53,786
drum major for the District Sports Day?

821
00:56:53,787 --> 00:56:54,386
What?

822
00:56:54,387 --> 00:56:56,587
I'm not looking for anyone else.

823
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:58,990
You're perfect for it.

824
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:01,892
But that's in 2 weeks.

825
00:57:01,893 --> 00:57:04,995
I don't think I can do it.

826
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:08,989
I can not find anyone else.

827
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,569
I promise I'll make it up to you in a religious way.

828
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,171
In a religious way?

829
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:20,174
I can pray for you for 6 months...

830
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:24,168
or forever. I can definitely do that.

831
00:57:33,386 --> 00:57:36,588
Hold the baton upright then throw it up,

832
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:41,792
keep your eyes on the baton then catch it

833
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:43,394
then continue marching.

834
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:44,695
See?

835
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:47,464
As easy as that.

836
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,765
Can you show me?

837
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,967
I have my own baton.

838
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,469
You can do it. That's yours, this is mine.

839
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,971
Focus on how high you want to throw it,

840
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,073
then throw it up when you're ready,

841
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:02,168
123, up!

842
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:13,786
This is difficult.

843
00:58:13,787 --> 00:58:16,278
Why didn't she pick someone else?

844
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,249
Don't give up just yet, it's only been a few days.

845
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,462
The most important tip

846
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:27,264
in 9 Love Tips

847
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:31,067
says that you should give it your best shot in love,

848
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:33,069
wholeheartedly give it all you've got,

849
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:37,063
then the person you love will find you.

850
00:58:40,777 --> 00:58:44,678
Hey, you've come this far,

851
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,981
you have to keep fighting.

852
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,383
This is not only for school,

853
00:58:49,384 --> 00:58:52,085
you're representing our town.

854
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:53,747
You can do it.

855
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:30,441
Top, pass the ball.

856
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:35,855
Hey, you're distracted by girls again.

857
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:42,060
I promise you that our marching band

858
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:44,362
will be the best in town this year, sir.

859
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:45,663
What about the drum major?

860
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:46,866
You need not worry.

861
00:59:46,867 --> 00:59:49,567
She's pretty, tall and fabulous.

862
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:52,970
She's just perfect.

863
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:56,463
Watch out!

864
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:07,644
Sorry.

865
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,953
Don't tell me that's our drum major.

866
01:00:11,954 --> 01:00:15,947
Oh, yes. But she's been doing well, sir.

867
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,558
It's the first time she messed up.

868
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,458
She's throwing her baton like a boomerang.

869
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:22,162
What happens if she mess up on the sports day?

870
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:26,155
No incident like that will happen, sir.

871
01:00:33,137 --> 01:00:35,539
Get a new drum major

872
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,840
or I'll be after you.

873
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,741
Oh, sir. But,

874
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:42,445
we only have 1 week to practice, sir.

875
01:00:42,446 --> 01:00:44,243
This is not looking too good.

876
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:51,151
The director confiscated the baton?

877
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:53,254
Who's going to be our drum major now?

878
01:00:53,255 --> 01:00:56,156
I don't know. Serves Prof. In right.

879
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:58,858
She should've picked one of us, pretty girls.

880
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,961
I don't know how she could pick such ugly student.

881
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:04,363
Her students are always losers.

882
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:06,031
I'm glad she didn't pick us,

883
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:10,035
would be bad for our reputation.

884
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:11,535
How can you say that?

885
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:13,738
It's true.

886
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:15,536
Bug face.

887
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:21,544
I'm going to prove them wrong.

888
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:25,538
Students of Prof. In are not always a loser.

889
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,852
You're going use a broomstick?

890
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,654
Where did you get that?

891
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,656
I borrowed from the janitor.

892
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,650
It's a bit light, but it'll do.

893
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,323
I will not let anyone look down on us and Prof. In.

894
01:01:56,241 --> 01:02:02,043
Everyone, I'm asking for 100% from you today.

895
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,341
There...

896
01:02:12,255 --> 01:02:16,214
Hey, that's a foul. Hey!

897
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:32,231
You're going to take the penalty kick?

898
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,040
Hey, my son's going take the penalty kick.

899
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,542
Let's leave.

900
01:02:37,543 --> 01:02:39,444
Wait, hold on.

901
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:42,446
Unbelievable, Shone's going kick a penalty goal.

902
01:02:42,447 --> 01:02:43,747
I can't believe my eyes,

903
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:47,707
come on, he's going to kick now.

904
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,931
Do you guys know why

905
01:03:03,932 --> 01:03:06,032
we lost the National Championship?

906
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,634
It's because of his dad.

907
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:12,628
Wait...

908
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,142
That was just a warm up kick.

909
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:20,101
Have another go.

910
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:22,214
Is there such thing as a warm up penalty kick?

911
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,215
In my book, there is.

912
01:03:24,216 --> 01:03:26,116
In my book too.

913
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:27,617
Mine too.

914
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:31,120
And I haven't blown my whistle.

915
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:32,816
Yes, sir.
One more time.

916
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:41,824
Why?
He's going have another go at it.

917
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,700
Come here.

918
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:12,413
He's gonna do it.

919
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:23,831
If you kick like that,

920
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:26,200
you're ready to join our school team.

921
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:26,895
Yes.

922
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:37,308
Yes, Shone did it...

923
01:04:38,812 --> 01:04:41,013
He's all smile now.

924
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:43,505
I get it now.

925
01:05:25,118 --> 01:05:29,111
Very good, perfect, dear.

926
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:34,591
My goodness, excuse me Prof. Orn,

927
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:36,593
I was wondering whether your students

928
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:39,695
can throw their headdress that high and catch it?

929
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:43,689
So high, very good!

930
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,901
So, your sister is as pretty as I am now?

931
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:29,895
She much prettier.

932
01:06:30,906 --> 01:06:33,306
Fabulous, Nam.

933
01:06:40,381 --> 01:06:42,981
I don't wanna move anywhere.

934
01:06:42,982 --> 01:06:46,975
You say that every time.

935
01:06:58,095 --> 01:07:02,097
You're way to hot, Nam.

936
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:05,801
Last Valentine's day, she was still very dark.

937
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:08,304
I'm gonna take Kai's gift for her.

938
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:09,704
Have you asked Nam?

939
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:11,105
I don't know.

940
01:07:11,106 --> 01:07:15,065
Can I have this pink chocolate Nam?

941
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,281
What's wrong with her? She looks a bit down.

942
01:07:21,282 --> 01:07:22,482
She's been waiting for him all day

943
01:07:22,483 --> 01:07:25,184
and he hasn't shown up.

944
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:29,178
Hey, Nam, come here... hurry.

945
01:07:33,492 --> 01:07:35,289
Go ahead.

946
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,162
Here,

947
01:07:55,677 --> 01:07:57,975
it's from a friend of mine.

948
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:52,858
See you tomorrow at 4,

949
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,560
on 3rd floor staircase.

950
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:57,961
I have something to tell you.

951
01:09:21,884 --> 01:09:23,884
Do you wanna leave together, Shone?

952
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:24,886
You haven't left yet?

953
01:09:24,887 --> 01:09:27,946
You can go ahead.

954
01:09:38,864 --> 01:09:40,764
Nam.

955
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:46,566
I knew you'd come.

956
01:09:48,572 --> 01:09:52,565
This letter was from you, Top?

957
01:09:54,178 --> 01:09:58,580
Yes, it's from me.

958
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:02,540
Did you want anything?

959
01:10:04,753 --> 01:10:08,755
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

960
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:12,749
What were you going to tell me, Shone?

961
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:17,754
I was just going to ask why you're here.

962
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,957
But now I know.

963
01:10:29,974 --> 01:10:32,743
So what do you say?

964
01:10:32,744 --> 01:10:35,644
Silence means yes to me.

965
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:36,645
What?

966
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:41,049
Top? Where did he come from?

967
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:43,848
And that's what all Shone said?

968
01:10:45,554 --> 01:10:48,155
What was your answer?

969
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:51,258
I didn't say anything.

970
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:54,460
What should I do?

971
01:10:54,461 --> 01:10:56,562
You have to think twice

972
01:10:56,563 --> 01:10:58,464
since he's Shone's best friend.

973
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:01,166
If you make a wrong move,

974
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:03,465
Shone's going to kill you.

975
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:09,240
Mistake.

976
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:11,442
Are you free today? Wanna go see a soccer game?

977
01:11:11,443 --> 01:11:13,743
No, I'm not free.

978
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:16,246
It'll only take a while.

979
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:19,848
Shone's playing for the team first time today.

980
01:11:19,849 --> 01:11:21,250
Do you wanna go?

981
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:22,843
Okay, I'll go.

982
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:30,558
Nam.

983
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,049
Get on.

984
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,233
Some water.

985
01:11:41,234 --> 01:11:43,035
Thank you.

986
01:11:43,036 --> 01:11:44,536
Do you have some water?

987
01:11:44,537 --> 01:11:46,334
No.

988
01:11:56,347 --> 01:11:58,645
Let's go to plan B.

989
01:12:00,851 --> 01:12:03,046
Faster...

990
01:12:30,442 --> 01:12:34,435
Dear button, I really wanna ride with Shone.

991
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,250
"Summer Holiday!"

992
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:44,743
"See you in Junior Year."

993
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:47,423
What kind of cake would you like

994
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:50,325
for your birthday this year? Go pick one.

995
01:12:50,326 --> 01:12:52,527
Vanilla cake,

996
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:54,428
Nam loves it.

997
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:03,736
Hello, where are you?

998
01:13:03,737 --> 01:13:06,539
We're picking a cake for Cheer's birthday right now.

999
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,940
I'm at the Dam with Shone and his friends,

1000
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,742
I won't make it back in time.

1001
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:13,644
I called Cheer this morning but she didn't pick up,

1002
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:16,046
please tell her Happy Birthday for me.

1003
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:17,348
Sorry guys.

1004
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:19,817
Okay... we'll tell her.

1005
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:24,313
We'll take this one.

1006
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,734
Grilled squids.

1007
01:13:44,438 --> 01:13:46,838
I'll be right back.

1008
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:17,822
What are you doing here all alone?

1009
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:22,426
It's a great view here.

1010
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:32,001
Would you like some grilled squid?

1011
01:14:33,913 --> 01:14:37,615
Have you heard a story about squids?

1012
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:39,709
No.

1013
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,119
I'll tell you.

1014
01:14:46,223 --> 01:14:48,525
Once upon the time,

1015
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:51,226
two squids met

1016
01:14:51,227 --> 01:14:57,632
and fell in love with each other,

1017
01:14:57,633 --> 01:15:01,002
they decided to be together

1018
01:15:01,003 --> 01:15:04,996
and eventually got married.

1019
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:10,109
On their wedding day,

1020
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:14,413
the reverend squire told them to hold hands

1021
01:15:14,414 --> 01:15:18,016
so they held hands,

1022
01:15:18,017 --> 01:15:20,017
held hands...

1023
01:15:29,326 --> 01:15:33,285
You're so silly.

1024
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,198
But that's sweet.

1025
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,398
The story teller or the story?

1026
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,501
The story teller.

1027
01:15:38,502 --> 01:15:41,502
Oh, the story.

1028
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,405
I'm all confused now.

1029
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,806
No more appetite for squids?

1030
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:50,800
I never ate squids again after I heard that story.

1031
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:58,117
Have you ever held

1032
01:15:58,118 --> 01:16:02,120
someone's hand like the squids?

1033
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:07,391
Once I held hand of a clumsy girl

1034
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:09,793
who was about to fall off the stage,

1035
01:16:09,794 --> 01:16:11,294
so I grabbed her hand.

1036
01:16:11,295 --> 01:16:14,997
Nam...

1037
01:16:14,998 --> 01:16:17,099
Why don't you eat the squids?

1038
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,801
They're really delicious.

1039
01:16:19,802 --> 01:16:22,203
Don't...

1040
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:25,706
Why? They're yummy.

1041
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,508
Seriously,

1042
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:29,109
do you like Nam?

1043
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,911
You're going out with her,

1044
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:33,513
why are you asking me this?

1045
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:36,415
Oh, it's nothing.

1046
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:42,688
Are you all right?

1047
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:44,588
I'm fine, just hurts a bit.

1048
01:16:44,589 --> 01:16:48,092
Can you try to walk?

1049
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:50,391
Come on, get on my back.

1050
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:02,695
Dear button, Shone carried my bag today.

1051
01:17:14,582 --> 01:17:16,882
Happy Birthday...
Is that you Nam?

1052
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,684
Cheer's not here.

1053
01:17:18,685 --> 01:17:20,686
She went with Kie and Nim.

1054
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:23,288
You didn't go with them?

1055
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:24,689
No.

1056
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:28,683
Give them a call okay?

1057
01:17:40,304 --> 01:17:42,003
I miss the old times,

1058
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:46,374
when we would do reports together, don't you?

1059
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,375
Angels should be in heaven,

1060
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,578
not in hell like us.

1061
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:52,780
Take it easy, Cheer.

1062
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:55,381
There's always next year.

1063
01:17:55,382 --> 01:17:58,985
I only have 3 friends.

1064
01:17:58,986 --> 01:18:01,784
I wouldn't do that if I were her.

1065
01:18:10,596 --> 01:18:13,397
Do you wanna come over later to do the report?

1066
01:18:13,398 --> 01:18:15,992
Why don't you write report with your new gang?

1067
01:18:38,286 --> 01:18:40,277
Top's not here yet?

1068
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,591
He told me to tutor a sophomore.

1069
01:18:46,592 --> 01:18:48,493
He's not here yet, he said

1070
01:18:48,494 --> 01:18:52,453
he was going to borrow a book for the sophomore.

1071
01:18:56,668 --> 01:19:00,661
That day, I was in the hospital.

1072
01:19:03,774 --> 01:19:06,475
Which day?

1073
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:10,279
The day my dad missed the penalty kick,

1074
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,282
I was born on that day.

1075
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:17,084
My dad never played soccer again

1076
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:21,078
after I was born.

1077
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:25,090
I'm such a bad luck.

1078
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:29,050
Our team never made it to the finals again.

1079
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:35,466
Are you okay?

1080
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:42,673
I'm used to all the teasing.

1081
01:19:42,674 --> 01:19:44,874
My last name is

1082
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:48,868
Shone, the son of the guy who missed the goal.

1083
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:51,980
But it's okay,

1084
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:55,383
I'm in the team now.

1085
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:58,686
Are you thinking of playing professional soccer?

1086
01:19:58,687 --> 01:20:00,848
I don't know.

1087
01:20:02,557 --> 01:20:06,550
Right now, I just wanna have someone.

1088
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:17,268
Nam, I still can't find the book.

1089
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:19,863
Can you come help look for it?

1090
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:29,375
We won't take long, Shone!

1091
01:20:42,457 --> 01:20:46,450
What's the surprise for Ake's birthday?

1092
01:20:47,661 --> 01:20:49,652
You'll see.

1093
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:17,743
Time for our special show for tonight.

1094
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:24,859
The story happened when we were in 5th grade.

1095
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,061
We happened to like the same girl.

1096
01:21:28,062 --> 01:21:30,563
Her name is Bo, she's in 4th grade.

1097
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:32,065
So we both practiced dancing

1098
01:21:32,066 --> 01:21:36,068
hoping to be her partner in the event.

1099
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:38,770
And when the day comes,

1100
01:21:38,771 --> 01:21:41,239
Shone...

1101
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,142
got chicken pox,

1102
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:48,136
so I got to be her dance partner.

1103
01:21:49,047 --> 01:21:53,549
But Top backed out on that day,

1104
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:54,952
so we both didn't get her anyway.

1105
01:21:54,953 --> 01:22:00,455
He threatened to not be friends with me

1106
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:01,657
so we promised each other

1107
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:02,958
since that day...

1108
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:05,059
That we will never like the same girl.

1109
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:09,053
Right?

1110
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:40,255
Happy birthday to you.

1111
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:44,058
Happy birthday...

1112
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:48,018
Happy birthday to you.

1113
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,841
Same time tomorrow?

1114
01:23:02,842 --> 01:23:05,037
Let's go see Shone's soccer match.

1115
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:09,646
You don't have to pick me up anymore.

1116
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:11,849
Why not? Are you busy?

1117
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,350
No,

1118
01:23:13,351 --> 01:23:15,251
I mean...

1119
01:23:15,252 --> 01:23:17,550
you don't have to pick me up ever again.

1120
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:25,018
Are you upset because I kissed you?

1121
01:23:25,228 --> 01:23:28,729
But you're my girlfriend, aren't you?

1122
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:32,723
I never said I was your girlfriend.

1123
01:23:33,335 --> 01:23:36,536
After all these?

1124
01:23:36,537 --> 01:23:40,339
I'm sorry,

1125
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,941
but I have someone I like.

1126
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:46,944
Who is it?

1127
01:23:46,945 --> 01:23:50,938
Who...

1128
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,522
This is the worse ever

1129
01:23:59,523 --> 01:24:03,426
in the history of my love life.

1130
01:24:03,427 --> 01:24:05,622
Can I ask you a favor?

1131
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:11,332
Could you not ask her out

1132
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,233
no matter what happens?

1133
01:24:14,836 --> 01:24:17,337
Do you think she broke up with you because of me?

1134
01:24:17,338 --> 01:24:19,238
No,

1135
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:21,541
I just can't take

1136
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:24,544
if my best friend

1137
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:26,513
is seeing the girl I love.

1138
01:24:28,614 --> 01:24:32,516
There's not much I can do, can I?

1139
01:24:32,517 --> 01:24:34,417
Are you okay with that?

1140
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:37,513
Yeah.

1141
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,907
Thanks mom.

1142
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,319
I've spoken to the manager

1143
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,921
of Bangkok Glass team, son.

1144
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:37,522
What did he say?

1145
01:26:37,523 --> 01:26:38,823
He said,

1146
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:40,991
maybe he'll accept you for training camp

1147
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:43,494
of Bangkok Glass League.

1148
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:46,196
Hope he's not kidding about this?

1149
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:48,598
Nobody jokes about things like that.

1150
01:26:48,599 --> 01:26:50,400
Just be ready,

1151
01:26:50,401 --> 01:26:51,802
maybe you'll have to move

1152
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:55,795
to Bangkok after high school.

1153
01:26:57,106 --> 01:26:59,006
Dad.

1154
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:00,599
Thank you.

1155
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:18,389
You should've told me,

1156
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:22,383
I would've applied for the grant to go with you.

1157
01:27:22,895 --> 01:27:24,494
Sorry,

1158
01:27:24,495 --> 01:27:28,488
I was really preoccupied.

1159
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:31,801
I think the director

1160
01:27:31,802 --> 01:27:34,503
has found a new P.E. Replacement.

1161
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:38,807
You're just irreplaceable,

1162
01:27:38,808 --> 01:27:41,009
I can confirm that.

1163
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:45,980
May I ask for something from you before you leave?

1164
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:48,582
What can I do for you?

1165
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:52,185
This...

1166
01:27:52,186 --> 01:27:54,086
Maybe too much to ask from you?

1167
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:05,196
I asked for you heart but got a whistle.

1168
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:07,098
There's...

1169
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:08,999
the new P.E. Teacher.

1170
01:28:15,905 --> 01:28:19,074
I think you should hurry and be on your way,

1171
01:28:19,075 --> 01:28:21,377
you might miss your flight.

1172
01:28:21,378 --> 01:28:25,280
I feel occupied all of a sudden. Bye now.

1173
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:39,191
You don't waste your time at all.

1174
01:28:39,192 --> 01:28:40,393
Hello...

1175
01:28:40,394 --> 01:28:41,594
Aren't you the new P.E. Teacher?

1176
01:28:41,595 --> 01:28:43,295
Yes.
What's your name?

1177
01:28:43,296 --> 01:28:45,096
I'm Boat.

1178
01:28:45,097 --> 01:28:47,898
I'd love a boat ride.

1179
01:28:47,899 --> 01:28:51,602
"Bye bye Junior. Hello Senior!"

1180
01:28:51,603 --> 01:28:54,070
"It's summer break again."

1181
01:28:54,071 --> 01:28:57,674
Why won't you stay for high school?

1182
01:28:57,675 --> 01:28:59,175
I just love the pink uniform

1183
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:02,878
of the technical school I applied for.

1184
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,479
Very very pretty.

1185
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,473
So the whole school's in pink?

1186
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:36,173
Monday, I wait.

1187
01:29:36,174 --> 01:29:42,977
Tuesday I still wait for you.

1188
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:49,984
Wednesday, you never show up.

1189
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:53,687
Thursday, all are empty.

1190
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:58,391
Friday, Saturday or Sunday,

1191
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:02,962
not a day goes by without missing you.

1192
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:05,963
We can never turn back time.

1193
01:30:13,572 --> 01:30:18,475
To the day we met, the day we got closer,

1194
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:24,179
the day we held hands,

1195
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:29,485
the day I love you, the day I told you,

1196
01:30:29,486 --> 01:30:33,254
the day you dream.

1197
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:37,257
No matter how long,

1198
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:41,661
how many months or years,

1199
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:49,967
my memories of you shall remain.

1200
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,670
Cheer,

1201
01:30:52,671 --> 01:30:56,573
I'm sorry.

1202
01:30:56,574 --> 01:31:02,478
Your song is so cheesy.

1203
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:04,080
Why did you sing along?

1204
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:08,040
We're laughing at your song.

1205
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:12,554
Friday, Saturday or Sunday

1206
01:31:12,555 --> 01:31:16,357
not a day goes by without missing you.

1207
01:31:16,358 --> 01:31:24,265
We can never turn back time...

1208
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:28,567
Nam.

1209
01:31:28,568 --> 01:31:30,369
We heard from Prof.

1210
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:38,176
In while we were buying ice cream
at the market that your...

1211
01:31:38,177 --> 01:31:40,744
your exam result...

1212
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,946
What about my exam result?

1213
01:31:42,947 --> 01:31:45,148
That you are the top of the class.

1214
01:31:45,149 --> 01:31:48,551
I thought so...

1215
01:31:48,552 --> 01:31:51,153
Right.
I'm the top of the class.

1216
01:31:51,154 --> 01:31:56,858
Mom, I'm top of the class this semester.

1217
01:31:56,859 --> 01:32:01,762
You'll get to see your dad now.

1218
01:32:01,763 --> 01:32:03,264
I'll get to see dad, get to see dad.

1219
01:32:03,265 --> 01:32:06,666
Dad...

1220
01:32:06,667 --> 01:32:08,167
I'll get to see dad.

1221
01:32:08,168 --> 01:32:09,658
Can I kiss you for him?

1222
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:18,043
I ranked 8 in my class, can I come too?

1223
01:32:18,044 --> 01:32:19,743
Sure.

1224
01:32:19,744 --> 01:32:23,347
I'll bring you some toys and sweets.

1225
01:32:23,348 --> 01:32:25,548
I'm going to the states.

1226
01:32:25,549 --> 01:32:29,542
Bring us back some snow please.

1227
01:32:35,158 --> 01:32:37,859
You got it?

1228
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,460
Is 50 Baht, okay?

1229
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:42,263
It's a 100 Bath, take it or leave it.

1230
01:32:42,264 --> 01:32:45,932
I had to sneak in, almost got bitten by stray dogs.

1231
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:48,134
70 Baht?

1232
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:51,437
Leave it then.

1233
01:32:51,438 --> 01:32:55,431
No, give it to me.

1234
01:33:00,045 --> 01:33:02,046
He's cute.

1235
01:33:02,047 --> 01:33:03,647
Is he your boyfriend?

1236
01:33:03,648 --> 01:33:06,350
It's Bam's girlfriend.

1237
01:33:06,351 --> 01:33:11,354
No, I just took the photo for her.

1238
01:33:11,355 --> 01:33:15,348
Please don't tell mom.

1239
01:33:19,028 --> 01:33:21,029
Mom, Pang's...

1240
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:22,030
Nam.

1241
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:23,931
Yes?

1242
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:29,335
Pang's hungry, is the food ready?

1243
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:32,931
Almost done, dear.

1244
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:37,743
Just be a good girl, okay?

1245
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:40,345
What about you?

1246
01:33:40,346 --> 01:33:42,747
What about my money?

1247
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:44,549
Come on have some snacks, kids.

1248
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:45,850
Thank you...

1249
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:48,251
Snack on these first, okay?

1250
01:33:50,354 --> 01:33:54,313
Does Shone knows how you feel about him?

1251
01:33:56,526 --> 01:34:00,129
You've like him since first year.

1252
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,230
I don't think you should tell him,

1253
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:05,833
so it can be a world record that a silly girl

1254
01:34:05,834 --> 01:34:08,635
has been in love with him for 3 years

1255
01:34:08,636 --> 01:34:10,831
without him knowing.

1256
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:19,545
Maybe you'll never
see him again for the rest of your life.

1257
01:34:19,546 --> 01:34:22,140
Aren't you going to anything about it?

1258
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:29,820
I've done everything the book says, haven't I?

1259
01:34:29,821 --> 01:34:34,123
We're here to support you, what are you afraid of?

1260
01:34:34,124 --> 01:34:36,926
You pretty, smart,

1261
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:42,631
nice and cheesy.

1262
01:34:42,632 --> 01:34:44,433
How can he not fall for you?

1263
01:34:44,434 --> 01:34:47,232
Is that a compliment?

1264
01:34:49,037 --> 01:34:51,839
Tip No. 10 from Thailand is probably

1265
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,831
the best and straight to the point.

1266
01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:02,815
This is for you, sign here.

1267
01:35:02,816 --> 01:35:05,216
Thank you.
Sign here...

1268
01:35:06,318 --> 01:35:10,311
Take my photo...

1269
01:35:12,023 --> 01:35:15,325
Love...

1270
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:18,818
Write on top right there.

1271
01:35:22,733 --> 01:35:24,223
Thank you.

1272
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,733
"On top"

1273
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:47,518
Go, girl.

1274
01:36:10,105 --> 01:36:12,907
The pool's out of order, sorry.

1275
01:36:12,908 --> 01:36:16,901
Hey, you haven't signed my shirt.

1276
01:36:21,215 --> 01:36:23,616
Shone...

1277
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:25,812
I have something to tell you.

1278
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,723
I really like you. I've liked you for 3 years.

1279
01:36:31,724 --> 01:36:34,625
I've done everything I could for you to notice me.

1280
01:36:34,626 --> 01:36:36,226
I...

1281
01:36:36,227 --> 01:36:38,328
I've tried out for a dancer,

1282
01:36:38,329 --> 01:36:40,197
been in a play, a drum major

1283
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:43,099
and even studied harder.

1284
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,501
But I realized that I shouldn't have been

1285
01:36:44,502 --> 01:36:48,103
straightforward with you
about my feelings a long time ago.

1286
01:36:48,104 --> 01:36:53,701
I just want to tell you that I like you.

1287
01:37:15,994 --> 01:37:19,486
"Pin loves Shone"

1288
01:37:27,604 --> 01:37:31,597
Pin and you...

1289
01:37:41,015 --> 01:37:44,218
Since when?

1290
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:46,483
Just last week.

1291
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:55,193
You two are together.

1292
01:37:55,194 --> 01:37:57,496
What a perfect match.

1293
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,397
You guys make a great couple.

1294
01:38:03,802 --> 01:38:08,304
I wish you both good luck.

1295
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:08,794
Nam!

1296
01:38:11,608 --> 01:38:15,110
Nam.

1297
01:38:15,111 --> 01:38:19,380
I'm okay...

1298
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:21,872
Nam.

1299
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:33,993
You guys are perfect.

1300
01:38:33,994 --> 01:38:38,596
Nam, are you all right?

1301
01:38:38,597 --> 01:38:40,792
Nam.

1302
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,873
Let her go.

1303
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,176
What wrong?

1304
01:39:07,889 --> 01:39:09,379
Pin.

1305
01:39:41,383 --> 01:39:43,184
Hi dad.

1306
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:46,382
Welcome to Glass Rabbit Junior Team.

1307
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:49,890
Thank you dad.

1308
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:54,393
This is Uncle Neng, Bangkok Glass Team Manager.

1309
01:39:54,394 --> 01:39:56,596
Hello...

1310
01:39:56,597 --> 01:40:00,065
This is Uncle Nguan, the coach.

1311
01:40:00,066 --> 01:40:03,263
Thank you all.

1312
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:06,070
Yeah!

1313
01:40:06,071 --> 01:40:07,771
He's happy!

1314
01:40:07,772 --> 01:40:10,969
Congratulations, son.

1315
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,482
Pack your things, you're leaving tonight with them.

1316
01:40:20,483 --> 01:40:21,684
The training camp starts tomorrow.

1317
01:40:21,685 --> 01:40:23,785
Tonight?

1318
01:40:23,786 --> 01:40:25,777
What are you waiting for, son?

1319
01:41:08,457 --> 01:41:12,951
"This scrap book is funny, it shows how hard you try."

1320
01:41:14,863 --> 01:41:16,660
Home safe.

1321
01:41:20,668 --> 01:41:24,968
"Just want to let you know that,
you had my heart since we met."

1322
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,579
She looks the same,

1323
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,881
a Snow white in braces.

1324
01:41:37,882 --> 01:41:40,248
"I told Pin that you look the same."

1325
01:41:42,452 --> 01:41:45,148
"You look cute as usual."

1326
01:41:48,457 --> 01:41:49,957
"I held your hand for the first time,"

1327
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,358
"but had to let go, so no one would suspect."

1328
01:42:00,268 --> 01:42:03,567
"I tasted an apple I gave you."

1329
01:42:21,752 --> 01:42:22,953
"You're doing much better now. Keep it up."

1330
01:42:22,954 --> 01:42:25,945
Throw it up!

1331
01:42:37,766 --> 01:42:40,967
"Love conquers all, especially fears."

1332
01:42:40,968 --> 01:42:44,070
"Planting a rose is a tough job."

1333
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:46,437
It's from a friend of mine.

1334
01:42:52,544 --> 01:42:54,646
"I gave you a rose today,
but told you it was from a friend."

1335
01:42:54,647 --> 01:42:56,841
"I couldn't tell you the truth."

1336
01:43:06,957 --> 01:43:09,059
"Do you know it hurts me
to see Top said he loved you?"

1337
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:12,256
"How come we never have our moments?"

1338
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:27,931
"I wish you could ride on my back."

1339
01:43:36,349 --> 01:43:39,050
Nam.

1340
01:43:39,051 --> 01:43:40,746
Would you be my girlfriend?

1341
01:44:30,627 --> 01:44:34,030
Can I ask you a favor?

1342
01:44:34,031 --> 01:44:37,125
Could you not ask her out?

1343
01:45:31,946 --> 01:45:34,546
"9 years later"

1344
01:45:49,628 --> 01:45:52,825
There's a window on that side.

1345
01:45:55,833 --> 01:45:58,534
Kai, could you take the customer?

1346
01:45:58,535 --> 01:46:00,332
I'll be right back.

1347
01:46:06,708 --> 01:46:10,701
Hello, handsome.

1348
01:46:13,114 --> 01:46:14,915
You're sleepy aren't you?

1349
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,316
Sorry to bother you every time.

1350
01:46:17,317 --> 01:46:21,310
No problem, your kid is like mine.

1351
01:46:24,623 --> 01:46:26,824
Come on, don't be a cry baby.

1352
01:46:26,825 --> 01:46:29,327
Don't mess up my hair.

1353
01:46:29,328 --> 01:46:32,029
Gotta go now.

1354
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,725
Bye kiddo.

1355
01:46:35,433 --> 01:46:38,534
I wish his real dad would love him like this.

1356
01:46:38,535 --> 01:46:41,103
Come on now.

1357
01:46:41,104 --> 01:46:43,305
Call me.

1358
01:46:43,306 --> 01:46:46,007
Shone.

1359
01:46:46,008 --> 01:46:51,111
Are you going to that TV show?

1360
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:54,515
I don't know yet.

1361
01:46:54,516 --> 01:46:59,317
Bye Shone, say bye!

1362
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:05,110
Please hurry up!

1363
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:09,090
Continue to Break 2, are you ready?
-A min

1364
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,990
OK

1365
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:14,090
Clothing staffs ready?
- Yes

1366
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:17,020
No worry, it will be perfect!

1367
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,270
I'm ready now!

1368
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:27,730
Please relax.
Our show isn't formal.

1369
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:28,230
Yes

1370
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:31,880
- You're so beautiful
-Thank you

1371
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:39,160
It's good that Nam is fashionable.

1372
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,510
If Nam was beautiful as mom like me....

1373
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:50,660
Teacher Boat!

1374
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,690
Hello

1375
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:56,370
Since that time,
I've rode the boat all this time.

1376
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,230
So envious!

1377
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:01,890
He likes to do sweet things

1378
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:07,050
I'm jealous

1379
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,690
He always surprises me

1380
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,360
Surprise again

1381
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:31,300
Uh.. That.. That is a rose

1382
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,320
I have to eat, if not he will sulk

1383
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:37,890
5..4..3..2..

1384
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:46,760
Now, we're here with Nam

1385
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:50,550
The designer of the beautiful clothes that we've just watched

1386
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,360
Hello

1387
01:48:52,360 --> 01:49:02,240
Our fans may know her well
cause she is the designer in only a few of Thais that are famous in New York

1388
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,240
and this is the evidence

1389
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:23,690
This is only a part of her work

1390
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:29,130
Nam, do you know that...

1391
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:33,490
In Thailand, you're also well-known

1392
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:37,860
I still have to develop my skill

1393
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:42,550
So, what work will you do as you came back to Thailand?

1394
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:47,550
There's a brand that would like to organize a fashion show

1395
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:52,880
I think it's interesting, so I agree to do

1396
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,420
and because I want to come back

1397
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:58,590
I miss my mom

1398
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,990
Nam used to tell reporters that....

1399
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:04,790
When you were young
Umm... I'm sorry

1400
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:08,560
You were so ugly and had bad sense of fashion

1401
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,030
That's totally different from now

1402
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:15,860
What make you've changed yourself this much?

1403
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,590
Because, I fell in love some one

1404
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:21,590
falling in love?

1405
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:24,670
Could you tell the story?

1406
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:28,460
Yes, he was my senior

1407
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,580
M.4 senior

1408
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,090
He was a football player

1409
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:35,000
and very cute

1410
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,410
At that time, I.........

1411
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:39,860
Had bug face studying M.1

1412
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,250
Developed myself a lot

1413
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:47,080
If It could make me to be beautiful, to be better
I tried to do it

1414
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:51,390
and tried to study better so he might interest in me

1415
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:56,440
Did he know it, in the end?

1416
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,880
He knew but it didn't have a happy ending

1417
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:05,940
I went to study in the US

1418
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:08,220
to stay with my dad

1419
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:11,160
It's bad

1420
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:15,330
but when I think about it.
He is like....

1421
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:17,330
my inspiration

1422
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:20,850
He made me use the love in good way

1423
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:22,580
He is like....

1424
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:26,040
The power that support me to be better and better

1425
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,570
Till I am today's Nam

1426
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:34,640
Khun Nam, you remember this notebook?

1427
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,780
You may recall it?

1428
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:44,440
Yes, I remember

1429
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:50,340
If so, let's welcome the owner of this book

1430
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:55,730
Shone, the former footballer of Bangkok glass

1431
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:12,500
Now, he's changed his career to be a pro-photographer

1432
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,900
I want to give it to Nam

1433
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:20,550
Nam???

1434
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:22,550
It's Nam's

1435
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,420
Please sit

1436
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:47,620
Shone, after you've never met Nam for 9 years.....

1437
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:51,250
Do you have something to tell Nam?

1438
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:56,080
I want to tell you that......

1439
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,230
This button

1440
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:06,230
is not mine

1441
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,530
It may be Ding's

1442
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:24,770
How about you Nam?
Do you have something to tell him?

1443
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:34,110
I want to ask Shone that......

1444
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,580
Have you been married?

1445
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:44,790
Umm.........

1446
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,750
Um...I

1447
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:07,220
I have been waiting for someone to come back from the US

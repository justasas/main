00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,485
<i>Your move: Bishop to knight four.</i>

2
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,985
<i>My move: Knight to rook three.</i>

3
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,870
Poor baby, you're startin'
to lose it, aren't you?

4
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,999
<i>Your move: King to rook one.</i>

5
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,132
<i>My move: Rook to knight six.</i>

6
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,880
<i>Checkmate. Checkmate.</i>

7
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,008
You cheatin' bitch.

8
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,826
Childs, what's he doin'?

9
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,170
Circling the camp.

10
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,036
Who is he?

11
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,960
Said "Norge" or something
on the side.

12
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,458
It's Norwegian.

13
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,171
- George, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

14
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,053
- Are you?
- Yeah. What's going on there?

15
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,491
Watch it.

16
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,506
Easy.

17
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:02,807
Easy, easy, easy. Yes.

18
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,987
First goddamn week of winter.

19
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, come on. Four stitches.
Barely grazed ya.

20
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,678
What were they doin' flyin' that low,

21
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,848
shooting at a dog, at us?

22
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,307
Mmm, stir-crazy.

23
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,768
Cabin fever. Who knows?

24
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:47,018
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Come in. Over.

25
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,611
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.

26
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,651
Urgent. Come in. Over.

27
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,454
Great.

28
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,950
- Come on, come on.
- Nobody!

29
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,002
Nobody.
Get a hold of somebody.

30
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,116
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.

31
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:07,753
Look, I haven't been able
to reach shit in two weeks.

32
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,802
I doubt if anybody's talked to
anybody on this entire continent,

33
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:14,506
and you want me to reach somebody!

34
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,561
Maybe we're at war with Norway.

35
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,533
I was wonderin' when El Capitan...

36
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,107
was gonna get a chance
to use his popgun.

37
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,042
How long've they been stationed there?

38
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,664
It says here only eight weeks.

39
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,501
Well, that's not long enough for
guys to go bonkers.

40
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,536
Bullshit, bwana.

41
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,171
Five minutes is enough to put a
man over down here.

42
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,745
- Damn straight.
- I mean, look at Palmer.

43
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,422
He been the way he is
since the first day.

44
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,512
How many in their party?

45
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,719
They started with ten.
There'd be eight others left.

46
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,048
How do we know?

47
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,262
Guys as crazy as that
could have done

48
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,394
a lot of damage to their
own before they got to us.

49
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,942
- Nothing we can do about that.
- Oh, yes there is. I wanna go up.

50
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,936
- In this weather?
- Bennings?

51
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,308
Winds are gonna let up a
tad next couple of hours.

52
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,315
A tad?

53
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,357
Can't condone it much myself,

54
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,531
but it is a short haul.

55
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,450
An hour there, an hour back.

56
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,869
Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift.
No problem.

57
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,999
Forget it, Palmer.

58
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,916
Hey, thanks for
thinking about it though.

59
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,416
Loaded with kerosene.
I count 15 cans.

60
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,632
MacReady!
Mac, get your gear on!

61
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,904
- Mac, it may not clear up for a week.
- Yeah.

62
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,186
- We're the closest ones to 'em.
- It's all right by me, Doc.

63
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,359
I'm just lettin' you know
we're takin' a chance.

64
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,398
Quit the griping, MacReady.

65
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,070
Those clouds keep movin' over the sun,
we're gonna get a whiteout.

66
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,952
We get caught in that, you can
scratch one doctor and one pilot.

67
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,997
This is real thin.
It'll clear as soon as you get up.

68
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,625
It's up to you, Mac.
If you don't wanna fly, we don't fly.

69
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,710
You really wanna save those
crazy Swedes, huh?

70
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,710
Norwegians.

71
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,921
- Which way, Doc?
- Southwest.

72
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,053
You're gonna have to read the map,
'cause I'm gonna be busy.

73
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,976
Mac's really taking it up, huh?

74
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,774
He knows what he's doin'.

75
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,995
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?

76
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,843
I'm trying to get some
sleep. I was shot today.

77
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,969
Read, bwana. Will do.

78
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,973
<i>♪ Writing's on the wall ♪</i>

79
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,480
<i>♪ Very superstitious ♪</i>

80
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,621
Anybody there?

81
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,494
Hey, Sweden!

82
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,499
They're not Swedish, Mac.
They're Norwegian.

83
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,866
Mac!

84
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,486
My God.
What the hell happened here?

85
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,171
Come on, Doc.

86
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:07,793
- Portable video unit. Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.

87
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,722
What are you doin', Doc?

88
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,383
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back with us.

89
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,643
Well, it's gettin' late.
Let's hurry it up.

90
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,345
I'll check out the last few rooms.

91
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,123
<i>Hey, Copper, come here!</i>

92
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,619
Maybe they found a fossil,
the remains of some animal

93
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,000
buried in the ice,
and they chopped it out.

94
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,209
But where is it?
Look at this.

95
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,639
What is that?

96
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Is that a man in there or something?

97
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,987
Whatever it is,
they burned it up in a hurry.

98
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,069
Help me find a shovel, Doc.

99
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,628
We found this.

100
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,590
Jesus Christ.

101
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,581
Blair, I'd like you to
start an autopsy right away.

102
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,429
- Did you reach anybody yet?
- Reach anybody?

103
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,774
We're a thousand miles
from nowhere, man,

104
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,149
and it's gonna get
a hell of a lot worse

105
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,314
before it gets any better.

106
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,193
Well, stick to it, Windows.
Stick to it.

107
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,119
Nothin' wrong with this Norwegian,
physiologically anyway.

108
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,371
No drugs, no alcohol, nothing.

109
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,666
Hmm.

110
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,185
Well, what we got here is
what appears to be, anyway,

111
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,726
a normal set of internal organs.

112
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,073
Heart, lungs,

113
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,200
kidneys, liver.

114
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,068
Intestines.

115
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,913
Seem to be normal.

116
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:00,135
<i>...one, door number
two and door number three.</i>

117
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,523
<i>And I think that Dawn Screen here has
got the one that's trading the most.</i>

118
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,562
<i>I went to you first.
You brought your friend Anna.</i>

119
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,725
<i>You've been consulting Anna
all through the show anyhow.</i>

120
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,864
<i>You may as well consult
her one more time.</i>

121
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,160
I know how this one ends.

122
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,487
Clark, will you put this mutt
with the others where he belongs?

123
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,660
Yeah, okay.

124
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,932
Go ahead.

125
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,265
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

126
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,861
I don't know what the hell's in there,

127
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,356
but it's weird and pissed off,
whatever it is.

128
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,778
Bennings, go get Childs.

129
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,446
What is this?
What's goin' on?

130
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,067
- Hey, Palmer, what is this?
- I don't know.

131
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,994
Childs, Mac wants the
flamethrower!

132
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,872
- Mac wants the what?
- That's what he said.

133
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,208
- Now move!
- Damn it.

134
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,390
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?

135
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,690
- Don't! No!
- Get away! Get back! Get back!

136
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,878
Get your ass over here!

137
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,298
Burn it.

138
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,725
Damn it, Childs, torch it!

139
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,561
Oh my God.

140
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,821
Oh!

141
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,196
Oh!

142
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,788
Look. Son of a bitch. Oh.

143
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,434
You see,
what we're talking about here

144
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,930
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,

145
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,982
and it imitates 'em perfectly.

146
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,516
When this Thing attacked our
dogs it tried to digest 'em,

147
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,651
absorb them,

148
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,488
and in the process shape
its own cells to imitate them.

149
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:36,032
This, for instance... That's not dog.

150
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,290
It's imitation.

151
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,995
We got to it before
it had time to finish.

152
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,253
Finish what?

153
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,712
Finish imitating these dogs.

154
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:59,853
Easy, easy. Good.

155
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,307
Easy, easy.

156
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,192
- Clark.
- Yeah?

157
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:15,112
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

158
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,164
Strange? No.

159
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,081
What was the dog
doin' in the rec room?

160
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,041
I don't know.

161
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,959
He was just wandering
around camp all day.

162
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:32,424
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

163
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,093
Right.

164
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,892
How long were you alone with that dog?

165
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:42,767
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

166
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,363
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

167
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,777
- I don't know.
- What?

168
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,031
I don't know. It's probably nothin'.

169
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,620
It's nothin' at all.

170
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,670
How much more of this crap is there?

171
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,052
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

172
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,297
We can't learn anything from this.

173
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:20,755
Guess not.

174
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,822
Where'd they
take these shots?

175
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,112
Seems like they were
spendin' a lot of their time

176
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,822
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

177
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,235
What's that?

178
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:45,329
It looks like
somethin' buried under the ice.

179
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,422
And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

180
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,383
Whatever it was it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

181
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,813
Here. This is it.

182
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,902
The place where they were
spendin' most of their time.

183
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,438
Pretty nasty out, Mac.
Thirty-five knots.

184
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,359
Screw it.
I'm gonna go up anyway.

185
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,930
Half a mile due east.

186
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:23,235
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

187
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:27,414
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

188
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,288
from way down around
here for a long time.

189
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:35,076
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried
in is 100,000 years old, at least.

190
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,590
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

191
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,327
I don't know.

192
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,617
Thousands of years ago it crashes,

193
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:16,001
and this Thing...

194
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,628
gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

195
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:23,667
I just cannot believe any
of this voodoo bullshit.

196
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,012
Childs, it happens all the time, man.

197
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,679
They're fallin' outta
the skies like flies.

198
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,058
Government knows all about it.
Right, Mac?

199
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,846
Do you believe any of this
voodoo bullshit, Blair?

200
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,850
Childs. Childs.
Chariots Of The Gods, man.

201
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,145
They practically own South America.

202
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,529
I mean, they taught the
Incas everything they know.

203
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,368
Come on, now, MacReady.

204
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,460
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

205
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,826
Yes, Garry, they dig it up.
They cart it back.

206
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,384
It gets thawed out, wakes up,

207
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,495
probably not in the best of moods.

208
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,594
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

209
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,295
Which one of you
disrespectful men

210
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,838
been tossin' his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

211
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:13,394
From now on I want my
kitchen clean, germfree.

212
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:16,599
Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

213
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,640
- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

214
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,595
'Cause it's different than us, see?

215
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:25,185
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me? Ask him.

216
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,155
You buy any of this, Blair?

217
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,113
<i>Mac,
we're movin' those things</i>

218
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,164
<i>out of the lab into the storeroom.</i>

219
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,827
<i>Can you come get your stuff?</i>

220
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,657
Be there in a minute, Doc.

221
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:01,058
Through the door.

222
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:06,345
Right over here. Right over...

223
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:12,565
Sorry, Mac.
You have to move your stuff ou...

224
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:16,106
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

225
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:19,123
I have to talk to you.
I'm tired of talkin', Fuchs.

226
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:21,036
I just wanna get up to
my shack and get drunk.

227
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:23,703
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

228
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:27,252
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

229
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,709
In the Thiokol.
Please, Mac.

230
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:47,348
We ought to just burn these things.

231
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,103
Can't burn the find of the century.

232
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:53,225
That's gonna win somebody
the Nobel Prize.

233
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,829
You, uh, got the keys?

234
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:11,211
Get 'em from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff outta here.

235
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,325
There's something wrong with Blair.

236
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,579
He's locked himself in his room
and he won't answer the door.

237
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:52,584
So I took one of his
notebooks from the lab.

238
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,963
- Yeah?
- Listen.

239
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,415
"It could have imitated a million
life-forms on a million planets.

240
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,715
"Could change into any
one of them at any time.

241
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,719
Now it wants life-forms on Earth. "

242
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:05,761
It's gettin' cold in here, Fuchs,
and I haven't slept in days.

243
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,774
Wait, Mac, wait a minute.
"It needs to be alone

244
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,556
"and in close proximity with
a life-form to be absorbed.

245
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,561
The chameleon strikes in the dark. "

246
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:14,613
- So is Blair cracking up or what?
- Damn it, MacReady.

247
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,226
"There is still cellular
activity in these burned remains.

248
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,154
They're not dead yet."

249
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:32,117
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.

250
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:54,939
Holy shit.

251
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,530
Go get the doc.

252
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,532
I'll get Garry.
We'll meet in Blair's room.

253
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,584
It's Bennings!

254
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:24,547
Bennings was right there, Mac.

255
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,640
I swear to God
it had a hold of him.

256
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,111
Windows!
Windows! Keep away from him!

257
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:47,067
Get back! Stay back!

258
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:52,698
It isn't Bennings.

259
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:28,029
My God, what was happening to him?

260
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,161
If it had had more time to finish

261
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,576
it would have looked and sounded
and acted just like Bennings.

262
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,195
I don't know what you're saying.

263
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,710
That was one of those Things out
there trying to imitate him, Garry.

264
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,131
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.

265
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,088
I've known him for ten years.

266
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,970
He's my friend.

267
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,514
We've gotta burn the rest of 'em.

268
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,959
All right, step back.

269
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,276
You sure that's all of'em?

270
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,040
We cleaned out the storehouse,
the lab, there is nothin' left.

271
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,960
Where's Blair?

272
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,919
I can't find Blair.

273
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:46,134
Where's everybody else?

274
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:48,086
Windows is in the radio room
still trying to get through.

275
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,795
Everyone else is in the rec room.

276
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,220
Well, you go on.
I'll be in in a minute.

277
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:18,445
Blair?

278
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,541
Blair?

279
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:23,022
<i>Don't! You son of a bitch.
You understand me?</i>

280
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:26,056
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill 'em.

281
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,479
Just leave it here.
We're gonna talk.

282
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,608
He smashed up some of
the chopper pretty good.

283
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:32,647
Nobody talk to nobody!

284
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:35,571
Childs, go see if
he got to the tractor.

285
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:38,779
Nobody gets in and outta here.
Nobody.

286
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:49,419
You guys think I'm crazy.
Well, that's fine.

287
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:53,126
Most of you don't know
what's goin' on around here.

288
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,590
Well, I'm damn well
sure some of you do.

289
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,223
Christ.

290
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,682
He got most of the
chopper and the tractor,

291
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:06,561
and he's killed the rest of the dogs.

292
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,440
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.

293
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:17,193
Now, Childs, go around to the
map room door. Talk to him.

294
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:19,065
Okay.

295
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:22,329
Norris, get a table from the lab.

296
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,789
Do you think that Thing
wanted to be an animal?

297
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,583
No dogs make it a thousand
miles through the cold.

298
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,133
Nah, you don't understand!

299
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,974
That Thing wanted to be us.

300
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:43,468
If the cell gets out...

301
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,471
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth...

302
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,983
- and it's not gonna stop!
- Okay, Blair.

303
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,517
Come on, man,
you don't wanna hurt anybody.

304
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,610
I'll kill you.

305
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,633
Good shot, MacReady.

306
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,635
Excuse me. Okay.

307
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:25,597
- All right, bring him up.
- Yeah.

308
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:47,537
Come on, Blair.

309
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,584
What about your shack, MacReady?

310
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,553
I don't want him in my shack.
We'll lock him in the toolshed.

311
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:06,224
Why am I in here?
For your own protection, Blair.

312
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,900
How you doin', old boy?

313
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,368
I don't know who to trust.

314
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:32,287
I know what you mean, Blair.

315
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:36,327
Trust's a tough thing
to come by these days.

316
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:41,836
Tell you what.
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

317
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,892
- Watch Clark.
- What?

318
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:52,637
I said watch Clark.

319
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,602
And watch him close.
Do you hear me?

320
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,753
And now the radio's gone.

321
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:18,879
- And so are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.

322
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:21,087
All we can do now
is hole up 'til spring,

323
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:22,546
wait for the rescue team.

324
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,007
No, we don't wait.

325
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,722
Somebody in this camp
ain't what he appears to be.

326
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,886
Right now that may
be one or two of us.

327
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:30,814
By spring it could be all of us.

328
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:33,022
So how do we know who's human?

329
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,730
If I was an imitation...
a perfect imitation...

330
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:40,437
how would you know
if it was really me?

331
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,738
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

332
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,907
Well, yeah, possibly.

333
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,286
I've been thinkin'
about a blood serum test.

334
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,334
What's that?

335
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,999
We could take a sample
of each person's blood,

336
00:56:57,207 --> 00:56:59,167
could mix it with
uncontaminated blood.

337
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:02,337
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

338
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:05,875
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

339
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,633
Keep an eye on Clark.

340
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:11,675
He was close to that dog.

341
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,809
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:20,808
Mac, we need Blair's help.

343
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,692
He's the only one who knows
what this organism is capable of.

344
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,151
He's too far gone, Fuchs.

345
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:27,359
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start goin' through 'em.

346
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:42,667
Garry!
Hey, you guys, come here!

347
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,415
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.

348
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,592
What?

349
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,352
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

350
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:54,102
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Was this broken into?

351
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,925
No, the lock is undamaged.

352
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:58,232
Somebody opened it,
closed it, and then locked it.

353
00:57:58,435 --> 00:58:01,685
- Great.
- Who's got access to it?

354
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:08,654
I guess I'm the only one.

355
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,913
And I got the only key.

356
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:17,702
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- Oh, I think so, yes.

357
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:20,084
Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

358
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:23,331
Well, who else could've used that key?

359
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,254
Nobody! I just give it to
Copper whenever he needs it.

360
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,878
Could anybody have
gotten it from you, Doc?

361
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:32,428
I don't see how. As soon as I'm
finished, I return it right away.

362
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,141
Great.

363
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:39,561
When was the
last time you used it?

364
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,187
A day or so ago, I guess.

365
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,321
I suppose somebody
could have lifted it off me--

366
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:46,903
Oh, come on!

367
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:48,818
That key ring of yours is always
hooked to your belt.

368
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:55,448
- Accusing everybody--
- Stop it! It ain't worth it!

369
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,370
Copper's the only one
who's got any business with it.

370
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:58,405
Now wait a minute, Garry!

371
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,251
You've been in here
on several occasions.

372
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:01,405
And Doc thought of the test.

373
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:03,373
So what? Is that
supposed to clear him?

374
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,125
- Bullshit!
- Why would he come in here--

375
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,293
- Windows!
- Windows!

376
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,438
Put that down!

377
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,562
No.

378
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,650
I'll put this right through your head.

379
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:28,728
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

380
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:30,402
You gonna let him give the orders?

381
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,360
I mean,
he could be one of those Things.

382
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:35,072
Windows.
Wait a minute.

383
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:38,123
Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.

384
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,577
Put it down.
Garry, you don't want to hurt anybody.

385
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:43,367
Right.
On the floor.

386
00:59:57,804 --> 00:59:59,264
It's on the floor.

387
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:09,307
I don't know about Copper,

388
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:12,525
but I give you my word I
did not go near that blood.

389
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,330
But I guess you'll all
feel a little easier if...

390
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:27,997
if somebody else was in charge.

391
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:32,008
Norris, I can't see anybody
objecting to you.

392
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:38,178
I'm sorry, fellas,
but I'm not up to it.

393
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,927
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

394
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:45,561
It should be somebody a little
more even-tempered, Childs.

395
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:58,072
All right.

396
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:22,465
I know I'm human.

397
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:29,563
And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

398
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,939
So some of you are still human.

399
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:34,438
This Thing doesn't
want to show itself.

400
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:36,821
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

401
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,701
It'll fight if it has to.

402
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:44,158
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

403
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,620
If it takes us over,

404
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:50,672
then it has no more enemies,

405
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,747
nobody left to kill it.

406
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,800
And then it's won.

407
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:02,514
There's a storm
hitting us in six hours.

408
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:05,312
We're gonna find out who's who.

409
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:09,056
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

410
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,410
Norris, you and Childs
shoot 'em up with morphine.

411
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,656
Tie 'em down in the
rec room and watch 'em.

412
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,080
Fuchs, you start working
on a new test.

413
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,866
- I need Doc's help.
- Yeah, you don't wanna drug me.

414
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:33,172
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

415
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,975
Let me do it. You're gonna
break the needle in my arm.

416
01:02:56,983 --> 01:03:00,533
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

417
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,711
I'm gonna hide this tape
when I'm finished.

418
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:16,036
If none of us make it at least
there'll be some kind of record.

419
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:20,263
Storm's been hitting us
hard now for 48 hours.

420
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:22,586
We still have nothing to go on.

421
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,480
One other thing:
I think it rips through your clothes

422
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:41,113
when it takes you over.

423
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:46,070
Windows found some shredded long
johns but the name tag was missing.

424
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,373
They could be anybody's.

425
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,831
Nobody...

426
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:56,286
Nobody trusts anybody now.

427
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:00,552
And we're all very tired.

428
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,389
<i>Nobody trusts anybody now.</i>

429
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,849
There's nothing else I can do.

430
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:18,232
Just wait.

431
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:25,112
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost number 31.

432
01:04:39,669 --> 01:04:42,339
You come up with anything yet?

433
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:44,548
One or two ideas.

434
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:50,095
But MacReady,
I've been thinking.

435
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,104
If a small particle
of this Thing is enough

436
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:54,226
to take over an entire organism,

437
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:56,273
then everyone should
prepare their own meals.

438
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:59,017
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

439
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:02,153
All right.

440
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:36,725
Who's that?

441
01:06:13,763 --> 01:06:16,143
Anybody see Fuchs?

442
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,346
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

443
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:22,864
Lights were out in there for an hour.

444
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,612
Any one of us could've gotten to him.

445
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:26,187
All right, we gotta find him.

446
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,690
Nauls, why don't you come
with me and we'll look outside.

447
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:32,065
Palmer, you and Windows
check the inside.

448
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:35,243
I ain't goin' with Windows.

449
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:38,542
I ain't goin' with him.
I'll go with Childs.

450
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,826
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't goin' with you!

451
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,418
Who says
I want you goin' with me?

452
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,875
Alright, cut the bullshit!

453
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:49,881
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

454
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,222
Any of them move, you fry 'em.

455
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:52,425
You hear anything,
anything at all,

456
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:53,385
you cut loose on the sirens.

457
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:56,314
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

458
01:06:57,473 --> 01:07:01,603
And everybody watch whoever
you're with... real close.

459
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:25,794
Hey, Blair.

460
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:30,545
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

461
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:37,011
I don't wanna stay out here any more.
I wanna come back inside.

462
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:43,230
I hear funny things out here.

463
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,977
- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.

464
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,110
It ain't Fuchs.

465
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:55,855
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

466
01:07:55,865 --> 01:07:59,695
And if there was, I'm all better now.
I'd like to come back inside.

467
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:02,002
Now you've got my promise.

468
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:06,628
We'll see.

469
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:10,132
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, man.

470
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:13,799
I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

471
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:18,009
I'm all right. I'm much better...
and I won't harm anybody.

472
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:21,102
You gotta let me come back inside.

473
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,650
Hold it!

474
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,709
Is it Fuchs?

475
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,593
Yeah.

476
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:58,006
Why would it burn him?

477
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,430
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

478
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,847
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

479
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:18,157
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

480
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:22,487
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.

481
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,873
- We'll be in as soon as we can.
- Where are we going?

482
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:28,331
- Up to my shack.
- What the hell for?

483
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:31,542
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

484
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:56,896
How long have they been out there?

485
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,821
40, 45 minutes.

486
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:02,872
We better start closing
off the outside doors.

487
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,859
Hey! All of you, come here!

488
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,170
Open up! Open up this door!
Open up! Open up!

489
01:10:59,215 --> 01:11:01,175
Close that door.

490
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:05,513
Where's MacReady?

491
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:08,851
I cut him loose off
the line up by his shack.

492
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,519
- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.

493
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:14,187
When we were up checkin'
around his place I found this.

494
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:19,943
Look.
It was stashed in his oil furnace.

495
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:23,824
Wind must've dislodged it but
I don't think he saw me find it.

496
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:27,742
I made sure I got ahead of him
on the towline on the way back.

497
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:29,082
I cut him loose.

498
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:31,788
- MacReady?
- He's one of 'em.

499
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:34,079
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.

500
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,503
It could've been anytime, anywhere.

501
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,752
If it did get to him.

502
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:40,844
- Hey, look, Childs, come on.
- When the lights went out.

503
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:42,048
That would've been
the perfect time.

504
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,968
Right, you said guys were missing.
And Windows, where were you?

505
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,847
Hey, Palmer,
I told you to shut your mouth!

506
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:53,024
This is just what it wants!
To pit us against each other.

507
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,816
- Let's open it.
- Hell no!

508
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,528
You think he's changed
into one of those Things?

509
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:03,566
He's had plenty of time.

510
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,070
Nothing human could've
made it back here

511
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:06,741
in this weather without a guide line.

512
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,530
Let's open it now.

513
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,700
Why are you so damned
anxious to let him in here?

514
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:10,742
Because it's so close.

515
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:13,623
- Maybe our chance to blow it away.
- No, just let him freeze to death.

516
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:16,502
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?

517
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,380
Well then, we're wrong!

518
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:21,498
The supply window!

519
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:25,545
All right, all right,
we got no choice now!

520
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,974
Damn it! He's got the keys!

521
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,933
<i>What's going on?
The towline snapped.</i>

522
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:37,694
That's bullshit, Childs.
He's got to know damn well I cut it!

523
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,568
You're a dead man, MacReady!

524
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:44,985
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

525
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:58,041
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

526
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:01,672
Come on, Childs, burn me.

527
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,630
Put those torches on
the floor and back off.

528
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:17,193
Back off.
Way off.

529
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,567
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.

530
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:32,083
Don't argue with him.

531
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,201
Where's the rest?

532
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,455
Come on, man, I mean it!

533
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:42,749
It's cool, MacReady.
It's cool, man, come on.

534
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,213
Yeah.
Yeah, man, just relax.

535
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:49,434
Anybody touches me... and we go.

536
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:05,192
- He's not breathin'!
- Go untie the doc.

537
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,909
Get him in here. And bring the others.

538
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:15,117
From now on nobody
gets outta my sight.

539
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,758
Let me at him.

540
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,507
So, you sweethearts

541
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,180
were about to have yourselves
a little lynching party, huh?

542
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:41,733
I might just have to put an end to
you on general principles, Nauls.

543
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:43,938
Did it ever occur to the jury
that anybody could've gotten

544
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:45,688
some of my clothes
and stuck 'em up the furnace?

545
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,819
We ain't buyin' that.

546
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,736
Quit that bickerin' over there!

547
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:52,355
Windows,
wheel that defibrillator over here.

548
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,871
Put some of that gel
on those paddles!

549
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:57,367
You're gonna have
to sleep sometime, MacReady.

550
01:14:57,369 --> 01:15:00,369
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

551
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:06,461
If anyone tries to wake me... Uh-uh.

552
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:10,054
Clear!

553
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,812
- Clear!
- Clear.

554
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:21,874
We're on fire, MacReady! We're
on fire! Get back! Just wait!

555
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:31,922
All right, go!

556
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:55,696
Windows! Windows, get in here!

557
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:23,854
You gotta be fuckin' kidding.

558
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,660
What do you got in mind,
MacReady?

559
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:45,870
A little test.

560
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,919
And Windows, you and Palmer
tie everybody down real tight.

561
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,875
- What for?
- For your health.

562
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:54,384
Come on, let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!

563
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,428
No, no, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

564
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:03,558
Let's... Let's do what Mac says.

565
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,440
I mean, uh, he wasted Norris
pretty quick, didn't he?

566
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:10,232
That's close enough, Clark.

567
01:18:10,228 --> 01:18:14,318
- He ain't tyin' me up.
- Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

568
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,034
Then kill me.

569
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,659
I mean it.

570
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:35,957
I guess you do.

571
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:50,429
Geez. This is bullshit, Mac!

572
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:53,265
- Finish it, Palmer.
- They're dead, Mac!

573
01:18:58,318 --> 01:19:01,198
- Windows?
- Yo?

574
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:03,445
You tie up Palmer over here.

575
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:10,786
We're gonna draw a little
bit of everybody's blood...

576
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:15,589
'cause we're gonna
find out who's the Thing.

577
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:21,761
Watchin' Norris in there
gave me the idea that...

578
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:24,087
maybe every part of him was a whole.

579
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:29,469
Every little piece was
an individual animal...

580
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:32,734
with a built-in desire
to protect its own life.

581
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:39,025
You see, when a man bleeds...

582
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,532
it's just tissue.

583
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:47,239
The blood from one of you things
won't obey when it's attacked.

584
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:49,662
It'll try and survive.

585
01:19:51,163 --> 01:19:53,333
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

586
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:17,687
Now you.

587
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,964
That's good.

588
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:45,594
All right, move back, over there.

589
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:35,231
I guess you're okay.

590
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:40,232
All right.
Put that on and watch them.

591
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:52,326
Now I'll show you what I already know.

592
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:58,865
It's a crock of shit.

593
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,090
Let's try the doc and Clark.

594
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,733
Now Clark.

595
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:33,581
Then Clark was human, huh?

596
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,790
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

597
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,790
Palmer now.

598
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:48,089
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

599
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:50,128
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

600
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:53,052
You were the only one
that could've got to that blood.

601
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:55,393
We'll do you last.

602
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,101
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

603
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:04,813
What is it?

604
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,370
Come on!

605
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:25,166
Get me outta here!

606
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,430
Windows, blast him!

607
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:38,846
Get me outta here!
Get me outta here!

608
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,134
Windows!

609
01:24:28,648 --> 01:24:30,728
Get me outta here!

610
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:55,376
MacReady, get in here!
Come on, hurry up!

611
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:58,723
He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

612
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:01,308
Hurry up, MacReady!
Burn it!

613
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:35,755
Let's do it.

614
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:53,443
Get me outta here!
Cut me loose!

615
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:55,691
Cut me the hell...
Come on, get me outta here!

616
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:57,282
Come on, get me outta here!

617
01:25:57,278 --> 01:25:59,778
Cut me loose, damn it!

618
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:20,973
I know you gentlemen
have been through a lot,

619
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:24,179
but when you find the time,

620
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,190
I'd rather not spend the rest of this
winter tied to this fucking couch!

621
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,750
Childs.

622
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,667
We're goin' out to
give Blair the test.

623
01:26:54,878 --> 01:26:56,498
If he tries to make it back here

624
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:59,344
and we're not with him... burn him.

625
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:21,402
Mac, the door's open!

626
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:37,297
How'd he get out?

627
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,883
The door was bolted from the outside.

628
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:26,175
Blair?

629
01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:33,805
Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got somethin' for ya!

630
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,620
Blair's been
busy out here all by himself.

631
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,843
- What is it?
- Something he's been making.

632
01:29:00,837 --> 01:29:03,167
It's a ship of some kind.

633
01:29:04,424 --> 01:29:06,724
He stole the parts
from the helicopter.

634
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,546
The smart S.O.B. put it
together piece by piece.

635
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,020
Where was he tryin' to go?

636
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:16,599
Any place but here.

637
01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:58,193
Hey, you guys, come here.
Come here.

638
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:08,742
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

639
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:11,278
- What's he doin' outside?
- I don't know.

640
01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:24,502
Got a flare?

641
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:29,090
He got back inside
and blew the generator.

642
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:34,972
In six hours it'll be
a hundred below in here.

643
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:37,022
Well, that's suicide!

644
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,515
Not for that Thing.

645
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:43,307
It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way outta here.

646
01:30:43,523 --> 01:30:46,573
It just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it.

647
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:51,573
What can we do? What can we do?

648
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:55,832
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that Thing freeze again.

649
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:01,615
Maybe we'll just warm things
up a little around here.

650
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:08,209
We're not gettin' outta here alive.

651
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,472
But neither is that Thing.

652
01:33:02,203 --> 01:33:04,123
Generator room.

653
01:34:11,314 --> 01:34:13,194
The generator's gone.

654
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:15,777
Any way we can fix it?

655
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:19,906
It's gone, MacReady.

656
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:29,501
All right.

657
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:33,086
We gotta bring this whole
place right down into the ice.

658
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:37,468
Garry, plant yours
in the old storage room.

659
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:39,803
Nauls, down by the generator.

660
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,439
Ah, God.

661
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:44,384
How's it comin' in there?

662
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,890
I said, how's it...

663
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:35,332
Yeah, fuck you too!

664
01:40:00,913 --> 01:40:02,543
You the only one who made it?

665
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:06,418
Not the only one.

666
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:09,593
Did you kill it?

667
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:12,799
Where were you, Childs?

668
01:40:14,176 --> 01:40:16,136
Thought I saw Blair.

669
01:40:17,179 --> 01:40:21,559
I went out after him and
got lost in the storm.

670
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:34,698
Fire's got the temperature
up all over the camp.

671
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:39,032
Won't last long, though.

672
01:40:40,077 --> 01:40:41,367
Neither will we.

673
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:45,459
How will we make it?

674
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,960
Maybe we shouldn't.

675
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:56,053
If you're worried about me...

676
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:59,220
If we've got any surprises
for each other...

677
01:41:00,848 --> 01:41:03,768
I don't think we're in much
shape to do anything about it.

678
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,440
Well... what do we do?

679
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,900
Why don't we just...

680
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,159
wait here for a little while?

681
01:41:21,869 --> 01:41:23,829
See what happens.

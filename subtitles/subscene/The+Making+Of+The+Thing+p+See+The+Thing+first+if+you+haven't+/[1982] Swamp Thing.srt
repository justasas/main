1
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:27,026
Not long ago, in the unexplored
reaches of an unmapped swamp,

2
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:30,386
the creative genius of one man

3
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:36,946
collided with another's evil
dream and a monster was born.

4
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:44,867
Too powerful to be destroyed,
too intelligent to be captured,

5
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:49,506
this being
still pursues its savage dream.

6
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:19,426
So there's the swamp.
Where's the nearest good restaurant?

7
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,828
Depends. If you're a human,
it's back in Washington.

8
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:27,146
But if you're a 'gator,
could be right where we land.

9
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:31,827
Thank your lucky stars
you're comin' in at the end of this.

10
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:45,908
Holland insisted on building it all out here.
He said this is where the life is.

11
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:49,587
One of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

12
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:57,267
What? They sent a woman out here?

13
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,147
-Where are you goin'?
-Couldn't take it anymore.

14
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,787
Well, he lasted longer than most.

15
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,667
Boo.

16
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:19,867
No!

17
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:31,667
Weird, isn't it? The local fishermen
say this place is haunted.

18
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,948
I don't know where we are, Toto,
but this sure isn't Kansas.

19
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,628
What?

20
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,227
Nothing.

21
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:52,388
Used to be a church until
about 50 years ago, then the levee broke.

22
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,468
It's just been us and the deer flies
for the last ten weeks.

23
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:59,027
Welcome back, sir.
What did Washington say?

24
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,468
That's confidential.

25
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,748
<i>-It's ok, miss. I got it.
-But you can start packin'.</i>

26
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,348
All right.

27
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,748
<i>Where's this go?
Give me a hand over here with this.</i>

28
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,787
What does Holland think
about going back to Washington?

29
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:19,027
I doubt he's been told. Ritter couldn't
believe me when I gave him the news.

30
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:23,827
-Do you think Washington's paranoid?
-Do you think the Pope is Catholic?

31
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:26,148
This is your place.

32
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:41,988
You probably haven't seen half this stuff.
It's all new. This is a laser...

33
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,188
laser-induced subsonic field generator.
Gives double readings in the 3200 band.

34
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:48,868
I got a trick for fixing that.

35
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:52,308
They send someone who knows what
she's doin' the week they pull us out!

36
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,507
What's he working on?

37
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,107
-Who?
-Holland.

38
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:59,348
This thing is so hush-hush, no one asks.
Something to do with plants.

39
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,146
<i>Where the hell's my man?
I thought he was back.</i>

40
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:04,067
Hey, Charlie!

41
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,947
The emperor calls. Come on.

42
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:09,107
Hey, you know there's a...

43
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,707
What's going on here?
Get those crates into the church.

44
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:22,307
You men in the boat! What are you doing?
Get that damn thing outta sight!

45
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:23,749
Lamebrains!

46
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,867
Charlie, welcome back.
And this is Hank's replacement?

47
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,667
Cable, Harry Ritter,
project field supervisor.

48
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:32,147
One of your sensors
is reading malfunction.

49
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,028
Not surprising.
they rot in a week in these swamps.

50
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:38,147
Charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

51
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:41,907
No. They want him and the substance
in Washington where they can watch him.

52
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,347
Anything wrong?

53
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:47,667
A rumor. Somebody's heard
Arcane's gotten wind of the project.

54
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:51,987
-I thought Arcane was dead.
-He is. Who said that Arcane's onto this?

55
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,587
Nobody's taking credit for it.
You know Washington.

56
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:59,509
All it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to Holland

57
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:02,227
and the whole project goes to hell,
do you know that?

58
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,827
Yes, sir.

59
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,068
That goes for you, too.

60
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:13,108
Come on. I keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

61
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,548
This admits the three of us,
and the Hollands.

62
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:20,068
It was programmed for your prints
this morning. Try it.

63
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:33,828
The stuff I have put up with-alligators,
bugs, snakes, and now rumors.

64
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:38,947
Charlie, I want to hear everything
about the Arcane business, now.

65
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,347
What about that sensor in sector three?

66
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:45,908
Get somebody to take you there
and take a look.

67
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,108
Me?

68
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,308
In the swamps?

69
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,508
-Any luck there?
-Wiggle your fingers.

70
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,228
Lose a contact lens?

71
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,187
Funny.

72
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,668
Well, don't just stand there.
Give us a hand. Right about in the middle.

73
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:16,707
Please?

74
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:24,388
I dropped a Cooper's digger.

75
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:27,228
Would you look under the rocks, please?

76
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,708
Go ahead.

77
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,708
What's a Cooper's digger? A shovel?

78
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,068
Nah,

79
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:39,348
just Alessandro.

80
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:46,108
He's got a little one-celled animal living
in his fur that makes a terrific host.

81
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,428
Terrific. I'll remember that
the next time I throw a party.

82
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,388
Oh, not bad. Not bad.

83
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:57,109
-You don't have to be crazy around him...
-But it helps?

84
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:01,028
Alice Cable, new kid on the block.
You part of Holland's crew?

85
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,347
I'm Linda Holland.

86
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:04,789
<i>You're Dr. Holland.</i>

87
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:08,668
<i>I'm a Dr. Holland, but not the Dr. Holland,
boy genius and oddball.</i>

88
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:12,388
That's Alec. He's the brains.
I just cook up what he invents.

89
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:15,428
Don't believe her.
She's got an IQ like a phone number.

90
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:20,308
I want you to run up a variation on the
formula with the host on Alessandro's fur.

91
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,827
Ok.

92
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:29,989
Hello. I understand you have a sensor out.
Do you wanna go out and take a look?

93
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:35,108
Well, I guess I could ask Charlie
to give us an escort.

94
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,468
We could ask your mother
to come along, too. Come on.

95
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:42,788
The only dangerous thing out there is the
government agents with their popguns.

96
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,588
It's your first day.
I'll take you on a cook's tour.

97
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,788
Ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air. He'll be tickled pink.

98
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,667
What do you say?

99
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:03,507
Oh, man.

100
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,909
You look like a tree.

101
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,908
Sometimes I feel like a tree.

102
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,949
-Like the swamps?
-Hate the swamps. Hate bugs.

103
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:14,388
-Hate things without legs.
-A neatness freak, huh?

104
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,148
-You could eat off my kitchen floor.
-You could eat off the swamps.

105
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:21,029
Maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.

106
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,748
More than likely,
the swamps will eat off us.

107
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,308
Like, what happened
to the guy I'm replacing?

108
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:31,669
The 'gator was only following his
natural way. Can't blame a guy for that.

109
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,988
I paid a fortune for these boots.

110
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,748
You'd better keep movin'.
There's quicksand around here.

111
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,908
-Keep your eyes open, too.
-For what?

112
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:53,588
One of these just might
jump out and do you in.

113
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:56,228
<i>There's over 100 species
of genus orchids here.</i>

114
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:59,908
So much beauty in the swamps,
if you open up your eyes to it.

115
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,748
Take a look into your own body,
one of God's most magnificent creations,

116
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,949
and what do you see?

117
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,388
Straight lines and deodorant,
chrome and Formica? No, no, no.

118
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,029
You see blood and bone, pump and flow,
and a million messy miracles.

119
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:16,148
Look at the most creative thing
man and woman can do together

120
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:19,668
and you'll see
something growing, unpredictable,

121
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:21,988
magical, hot.

122
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:27,268
Save the malarkey for your wife, Holland.

123
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:30,229
If you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

124
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,308
It's right over there.

125
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,068
Looks ok to me.

126
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,229
Here, let me help.

127
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:56,309
Well, it doesn't look ok to me.

128
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:58,307
-Let's get back.
-All right.

129
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,428
Charlie?

130
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,429
Charlie!

131
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,988
Cable, what the hell is your story?

132
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,549
Anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

133
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,348
<i>You're damn right.
Something suspicious did happen.</i>

134
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:42,309
A stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

135
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:47,349
takes a scientist we're supposed
to be guarding for a romp in the bush.

136
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:50,548
-Hold it. Just cool it.
-You think you're on a picnic?

137
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:54,068
Wait. It was my idea to take her out there.
She was doin' her job.

138
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,869
-Why do you have to be so worried?
-It's my job to worry.

139
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,868
And if I have my way, you'll be
on the next chopper back to Washington.

140
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:04,069
A woman has no place
around a guy like you.

141
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,749
There's a cut sensor out there.

142
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,988
-Which sector?
-Sector three.

143
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:13,109
Hank was working on that
when he was bitten by the 'gator.

144
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,829
He didn't put it all back together again
before we took him to the hospital.

145
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:26,308
-"Tickled pink", huh?
-I'm really sorry, Cable.

146
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:32,148
Well, I guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

147
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,669
Did either of you see
one of our guys out there? Ronnie?

148
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,989
-No. Why?
-We seem to have lost contact with him.

149
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,069
-Linda, are you all right?
-It's ok, it's ok.

150
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:59,749
The damnedest thing.

151
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:03,909
You know this new batch you had me
cook up with the host from Alessandro?

152
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:08,790
I knew we were up to something
revolutionary, but this is dynamite.

153
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,069
Watch.

154
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,828
-Incredible.
-Weird, huh?

155
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,229
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

156
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:25,349
You've managed to reinvent nitro. let's
hope this project doesn't end with a bang.

157
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,989
Come on, Charlie, please.
I gotta write this down.

158
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,949
<i>I thought you were
working on a weapons system.</i>

159
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:35,669
-I knew it wasn't just plants.
-Plants, plants.

160
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,788
The only way I thought my work
would be explosive was socially.

161
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:40,950
It's never been this volatile before.

162
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:45,029
Linda, prep a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

163
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:48,948
-And be very careful with it.
-What is it you've been doing here?

164
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,869
Come over here. I'll show you.

165
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,109
You see those little guys?

166
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,990
<i>DNA chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli e. coli.</i>

167
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:12,949
Now, you see that one? Another simple
bacilli. Plant matrix called d complex.

168
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:17,669
Each of these organisms have existed in
the labs for years, but always separately,

169
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,149
since one is animal, the other's vegetable.

170
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,429
This is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

171
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,469
See that little guy? Never existed on the
face of the Earth before. That's my baby.

172
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,950
A simple vegetable cell with
an unmistakable animal nucleus.

173
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:35,188
Recombinant DNA?

174
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:37,109
Hey, that's very good.

175
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,709
I am very close to developing a plant with
an animal's aggressive power for survival.

176
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,468
A plant for the 21st century.

177
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,028
You want watermelons
the size of weather balloons

178
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,469
or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick?

179
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:55,109
Or a tomato that could grow in the desert.
or soybeans that could thrive in biafra.

180
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,829
Or corn that could grow in the USA
in the year 2001,

181
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:01,508
when there'll be 6.5 billion people
on this planet, all of them hungry.

182
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,509
-How you doin' there, Linda?
-It's all set. Vector 3379.

183
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,509
Ok.

184
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,829
-It's replicating like mad.
-It certainly is.

185
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,030
Let's try it on something.

186
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,188
Cable, would you bring that flask of water
over here, please?

187
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,669
Thank you.

188
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,069
If it would work on plants the way
you want it to, what will it do to people?

189
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:34,550
-And what if it falls into wrong hands?
-Arcane boogieman mentality, huh?

190
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,589
Ok, now we begin. 2000 water,

191
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,429
one part formula.

192
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,869
2000 water, 6:30 March 20th.

193
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,629
How long before you'll know?

194
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,628
What do you want it to do,
jump out and dance a fandango?

195
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:02,229
I don't know.
A week maybe, maybe longer.

196
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,989
This has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

197
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:09,429
Aren't there some sensors
you could be working on?

198
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,789
Oops.

199
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:17,829
Forget it. He's just ridiculously sensitive.
Our dad was the same.

200
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:18,990
Your dad?

201
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,389
You've never heard of Walter Holland
the biophysicist?

202
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,549
Nobel prize. He used to throw
a mean Bunsen burner, I can tell you.

203
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:30,790
Alec and I spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

204
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:34,229
Perfectionist to the day he died.
Alec's the same.

205
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,189
-Oh, my god.
-What is that?

206
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,670
Cable, I don't believe this.

207
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,231
All the places that Linda dropped
the formula, the boards grew.

208
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,550
-Who are you kidding?
-No, I'm not kidding.

209
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,509
Alec...

210
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,110
Linda! Get in here quick!

211
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,390
This is fantastic. This is incredible.

212
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,590
Oh...

213
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,549
Alec, the formula?

214
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,869
Ritter. He's got to be told right away.

215
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,709
I wanna see that bastard's face
when he realizes we've done it.

216
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,230
Ritter?

217
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,709
Ritter?

218
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,070
-You guys seen Ritter?
-He's in the command shed.

219
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:48,109
Thanks.

220
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,030
Ritter!

221
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,149
Charlie.

222
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,749
Get up!

223
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,430
Hold it!

224
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,470
-I'm holding.
-It's over, lady.

225
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,509
-Arcane, right?
-Shut up.

226
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,630
Alec, watch out!

227
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,869
-Very interesting, Dr. Holland.
-On your feet.

228
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,110
-Who are you?
-Interesting.

229
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:44,630
Now, I know I haven't seen
anything like this before.

230
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:51,870
Have you?

231
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,471
What the hell do you want?

232
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:58,550
I represent a certain party
that's interested in your formula.

233
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:00,709
He'd give an arm and a leg for it.

234
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,270
<i>Your arm and leg, if necessary.</i>

235
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,189
Get outta my lab! Get out!

236
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,390
Alec!

237
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,630
What's the hold-up?

238
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,671
He's being difficult.

239
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,550
No, Ritter. Not you.

240
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,750
No, Dr. Holland, not Ritter.

241
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,349
Ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

242
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,630
You have heard of but never seen me,
so I will introduce myself.

243
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,950
My name is Arcane.

244
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,391
Linda, come here. Here.

245
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,710
Leave her alone.

246
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,670
Thank you.

247
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:50,951
All materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

248
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:52,470
or she dies.

249
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:56,550
What sort of rejuvenation
will you be able to perform on her then?

250
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,390
-Don't, Alec.
-It's all right.

251
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,511
The actual solution as well.

252
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,429
Linda!

253
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,431
Linda! Linda

254
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,630
What is best for you is not
to be born, not to be, to be nothing.

255
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,030
But the second best for you
is to die soon. Nietzsche.

256
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,710
-The notebooks.
-I never seen anything like that.

257
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,989
The notebooks, good.

258
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:55,431
Strip it. No bodies.

259
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:58,070
No witnesses.

260
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,791
No survivors. No trace of them.

261
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:07,030
You, come here. Burn the papers.

262
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,512
Burn everything. Come on, get a move on.

263
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,990
Somebody help Bruno with the bodies.
I want this place clean by dawn.

264
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,871
-Is that the last of 'em?
-That's it.

265
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,110
Then get the lead out.

266
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:53,190
-A final check, then vacate the premises.
-Right. Take that to the boat.

267
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:57,351
Hurry it up.

268
00:25:57,511 --> 00:26:00,711
Wait a minute.
I'm finding lots of stuff down here.

269
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,991
What kind of stuff?

270
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:06,071
A little of this, a little of that.
Come on down and take a look.

271
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,831
What you got?

272
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:15,190
-Found some money, a watch, and...
-No, this.

273
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:17,671
Oh, that. I took it off the girl.

274
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:21,190
You can have it. Ain't worth nothin'
compared to the watches.

275
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,910
Get out in front.
We're getting out of here.

276
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,431
Ferret?

277
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:07,430
Plannin' on goin' somewhere?

278
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,471
Come on, let's take a little walk.

279
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:11,510
Bastard!

280
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,030
My, haven't you gotten dirty?
My goodness!

281
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,431
Tyrone, come here.

282
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,270
I think this lady needs a bath.
Let's take her down to the dock.

283
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,710
Where'd she come from?

284
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,151
Help!

285
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,111
Help!

286
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,151
Get the boat ready.

287
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:37,030
Move it. We don't have all day,
and I wanna teach this lady how to swim.

288
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,591
The first lesson's called the dead man's...

289
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,191
Ow!

290
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,271
You wanna play rough, huh?

291
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,271
Say hello to your boyfriend, baby.

292
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,671
What the hell was that?

293
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:53,912
Willie! Tyrone! Shoot the damn thing.

294
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:10,632
Get it! Kill it! And her!

295
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,551
You, too!

296
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,791
Back in the swamps.

297
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,591
Willie, go that way.
Tyrone, cover that area.

298
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,591
So long, baby.

299
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,111
Willie?

300
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,551
Flank right.

301
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,432
No, no, no! What are you doin'?

302
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,151
What the hell are you doin', Danny?

303
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,752
Spread out.

304
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,312
Keep your head.

305
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:50,792
-Where's Danny?
-Where's Willie?

306
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,992
-Maybe Willie's with Tyrone.
-Danny shot Tyrone.

307
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:54,871
Oh, yeah.

308
00:31:58,472 --> 00:32:01,671
-Maybe we should
-Get the hell outta here.

309
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,791
The work with DNA, I expected.

310
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:21,591
But the combining
of plant and animal is astonishing.

311
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,191
Astonishing.

312
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:31,272
-You should sleep, sir.
-I can't.

313
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:35,512
It was all so near,
right there in the palm of my hand, and...

314
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:40,312
But it's lovely not to sleep,

315
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:45,672
knowing that I'll soon
make the substance for myself.

316
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,831
Have some coffee, sir.

317
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,912
Thank you.

318
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,552
Holland had great talent.

319
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:01,592
But talent does only what it can.

320
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:08,632
Genius does what it must.

321
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:12,792
It is master of man, power absolute.

322
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,912
And in your hands, sir, how magnificent.

323
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,511
-How beautiful.
-Yes.

324
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,872
The world will bow, or starve.

325
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:24,792
Yes.

326
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,232
Yes.

327
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:41,752
Four, five, six.

328
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:46,072
-How many notebooks were there?
-Six, I think.

329
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:50,631
But six ends with notes two weeks old.

330
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:53,192
It's unfinished.

331
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:57,272
There must be another,
a seventh notebook.

332
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,193
Ferret has just radioed, sir.
something's happened.

333
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:04,952
What?

334
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,791
Something about a...

335
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:10,073
well, you'd better
speak to him yourself, sir.

336
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,072
-What?
-You're not gonna believe this.

337
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,553
Something incredible
came out of the swamps.

338
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,152
What came out of the swamps?

339
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:33,113
Some kind of animal or something.
It got the men.

340
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:36,072
We wouldn't be here
if it hadn't gone after the girl.

341
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:39,272
Girl? You mean you let her get away?

342
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,073
Uh-huh, here comes trouble.

343
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:16,313
Hi.

344
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,472
You in a plane crash?

345
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,712
Just been out walkin'.

346
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,672
Uh-huh.

347
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:27,192
You got a phone that works?

348
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>Operations.</i>

349
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:47,433
This is 5-17. Operation Mount Pisba.

350
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:49,952
Get me my next immediate superior,
and hurry.

351
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:53,192
<i>Hold on. I'm putting you through to Ritter.</i>

352
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:55,953
<I>I think he's been neutrali...

353
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:03,032
Yes?

354
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:06,433
<i>This is mobile operator 3-4.
I have an emergency call for you.</i>

355
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,553
Put the call through.

356
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:12,672
<i>Ritter, this is cable.
We've had a catastrophe out here.</i>

357
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:13,672
What happened?

358
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,953
<i>There was a hit on the compound.
Holland's dead. The lab's gone.</i>

359
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:20,472
<i>-I thought they got you, too.
-Uh, no, I was called away.</i>

360
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:25,192
<i>I think you were wrong about Arcane.
They knew what they were looking for.</i>

361
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:28,473
Hold on, we'll get to you.
You can explain later. Where are you?

362
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:31,112
A gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

363
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:32,632
Right.

364
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:35,751
Oh, uh, did you manage to save anything?

365
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:38,632
Damn right. I got the last notebook.

366
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:42,312
Very good.
I'll be there before you know it.

367
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,513
Turn around.

368
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,433
-Doesn't anything work around here?
-Just me.

369
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:15,992
Kickin' it don't help nothin'.
You gotta punch it.

370
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,153
-Thanks.
-Nothin'. Name's Jude.

371
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,753
Cable.

372
00:37:39,353 --> 00:37:41,753
Nice station. Your dad own it?

373
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,153
Look like your ride's got here.

374
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:54,071
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

375
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,232
Don't be afraid.

376
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:07,753
Say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

377
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:11,753
Is there a gun here?

378
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:15,272
Wwhat kinda place do you think this is?
Course there is.

379
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,192
Gun's a museum piece.

380
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:24,552
Stay here.

381
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:28,553
Took the words right outta my mouth.

382
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:34,073
Hey, greaseball!

383
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:35,512
She's mine.

384
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,273
She's got a gun.

385
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:43,353
Some gun. It blew up on the first shot.

386
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:59,833
Jam it. Jam it to the floor.

387
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:06,433
Wait a minute. There she is.

388
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,353
Go, go. Go get her. Go on.

389
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:11,513
Go on.

390
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:18,674
Watch the trees.

391
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:22,072
Go, go. Come on,
She's gainin' ground on you.

392
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:52,713
Faster.

393
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,513
Got her in the sights.

394
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:09,753
-It's back! Stop the jeep!
-Run him down.

395
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:11,033
Don't stop!

396
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,993
Help!

397
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:57,273
Shoo.

398
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:03,513
Go!

399
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:29,593
It's ok, it's ok. It's just me.

400
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,513
Jude, what are you doing here?

401
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:36,233
You think I'd stay at the station
while they're pumpin' it full of holes?

402
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:39,673
What happened to that thing?

403
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,073
It, uh

404
00:41:42,192 --> 00:41:44,714
hit a tree.

405
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:50,193
Must have been one of those hit-and-run
trees. It don't seem to be there now.

406
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,113
Some tree, all right.

407
00:41:55,194 --> 00:42:00,153
There's a trapper's cabin nearby. Maybe
we can get you a fresh change of clothes.

408
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,433
Swamp's no place to be at night.
Come on.

409
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:21,353
The last patrol is in. Whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

410
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:24,794
Some of the men say it's one of them
abdominal snowmen or something.

411
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:29,594
<i>It was like hittin' a tree.
Bullets hurt it, but they don't stop it.</i>

412
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:32,474
I say we forget this notebook.
It's not worth it.

413
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,954
What are we killin' ourselves for?

414
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:38,872
Just to find a formula
to some ordinary plant fertilizer?

415
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:45,273
"Ordinary"? Something extraordinary
came out of the experiments already.

416
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:50,434
Something that Holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of. None.

417
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:05,354
Would you recognize immortality
if it knocked on your door, gentlemen?

418
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:08,674
Obviously you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

419
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,834
I want this swamp thing,

420
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:13,673
and I want the notebook.

421
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:15,954
-Now.
-I'll get rid of him.

422
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:21,195
You will not get rid of him.
You will simply get him.

423
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:30,873
Pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there,

424
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:32,234
in his veins.

425
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:36,193
But how can we find it?

426
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:39,753
It's gone into the swamps.

427
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:43,514
Every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

428
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:44,794
That's right.

429
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:48,634
Then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

430
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:53,194
<i>It doesn't exactly maintain a low profile.</i>

431
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:26,474
He was right. It is beautiful.

432
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:29,034
Who was right?

433
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:30,794
A guy I knew.

434
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:33,033
He loved these swamps.

435
00:44:33,113 --> 00:44:36,713
Can't you call him?
Maybe he could come and get you.

436
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:41,514
Ain't got nobody you can call, huh?

437
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:46,153
Thought I had, but when I did
those goons showed up back there

438
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,994
and started making Swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

439
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:54,074
-Didn't pay your bookie or somethin'?
-Or somethin'.

440
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,393
Much farther?

441
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,914
A little ways.

442
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:06,153
-Stay here.
-Don't worry.

443
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:10,954
-If you hear anyone, you yell.
-Don't worry.

444
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:15,033
And if I don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

445
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:17,194
I can handle myself. Don't worry.

446
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:20,394
I'm not worried.

447
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:22,954
Well, I am.

448
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:55,754
-What happened?
-Just go. Go!

449
00:47:57,035 --> 00:48:01,594
We're just gonna do our job and get
this notebook back to Washington.

450
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:03,514
The rest isn't my business.

451
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:31,675
Local people
say this place is full of ghosts.

452
00:49:33,194 --> 00:49:37,674
Well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through. There she is.

453
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:43,673
Who's that?

454
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:49,195
<i>Who's that?</i>

455
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:52,075
That was that thing. Let's go. Come on.

456
00:50:01,194 --> 00:50:03,434
What the heck's goin' on here?

457
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,874
Cut the engine.

458
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:20,235
Units one and two. Sector four.
on the double. We got him cornered.

459
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:29,194
Where is he?

460
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:31,755
<i>What is he?</i>

461
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:35,755
Shh.

462
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,355
I think I see him.

463
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:49,675
Hit it!

464
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:59,434
Units one and two, where are you?
Get over here on the double.

465
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:02,876
<i>Split up. Go in the back way.
We'll come in straight.</i>

466
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:13,835
There he is. Over there.

467
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,874
Open up on him.

468
00:51:18,714 --> 00:51:21,194
Hang on.
I'm gonna knock him outta there.

469
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:29,595
Jesus! Unit two.

470
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:33,196
<i>Use the grenades if you have to.
Maybe we can stun him.</i>

471
00:51:47,835 --> 00:51:49,115
I think you got him.

472
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:54,395
He's still goin'.
Give him everything you got. Come on.

473
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,275
We've got him now.

474
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:26,875
-Where'd he go?
-I don't know.

475
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:43,434
<i>-Do you see him?
-Yeah, I see him everywhere.</i>

476
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,116
Any sign of him over there?

477
00:52:47,195 --> 00:52:51,275
<i>Nothing. We think maybe he bought
the farm or the vegetable patch.</i>

478
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:08,875
What the hell is that?

479
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:31,275
He's smart. That thing is smart.

480
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:37,196
Very smart, Bruno. Very smart.
This thing has considerable intelligence.

481
00:53:37,275 --> 00:53:41,594
He's like a brilliant chess player.
He anticipates every move.

482
00:53:43,275 --> 00:53:46,555
A strong adversary
is like a beautiful, dangerous woman.

483
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:49,835
I can't resist, either.
Tell the captain to weigh anchor.

484
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:53,436
-We're going home.
-No, we are not.

485
00:53:53,516 --> 00:53:55,835
Captured our knight.

486
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:59,195
Exposed his queen.

487
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,036
Our move.

488
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:32,794
Awfully quiet now.
We'd better get outta here.

489
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,036
I've gotta go back and help.

490
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:42,156
You just take the notebook and get
to safety. I'll come back for you later.

491
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:44,315
Go on, do as I say.

492
00:55:04,155 --> 00:55:05,916
-Cable!
-Shh.

493
00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:11,756
Jude, go and do what I told you.
It's not safe here anymore. You hear?

494
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:12,875
Jude?

495
00:55:22,796 --> 00:55:24,075
No!

496
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:24,555
Oh, shit!

497
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:27,596
There goes the neighborhood.

498
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:32,956
Wait a minute. You're the dude
who saved us back there, right?

499
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:35,675
You a friend of Cable?

500
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:37,996
Then I got something for you.

501
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:40,636
She said I ought to put it someplace safe.

502
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:57,275
-Where's arcane?
-Below.

503
00:56:57,355 --> 00:57:00,156
Tell him we've captured his queen.

504
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:06,636
Walked right into our hands, didn't you? Real smart.

505
00:57:06,796 --> 00:57:10,077
Thanks. I knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

506
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,915
What I couldn't do for you.

507
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:18,556
Tell you what,

508
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,155
tell me where the notebook is
and I'll get you outta the swamps.

509
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:25,837
-Deal?
-I don't mind the swamps.

510
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:29,435
It's the slime that crawls out from
under the rocks that turns my stomach.

511
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,037
Nasty mouth.

512
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,116
But a pretty one.

513
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:38,235
<i>What do you say to that?</i>

514
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:39,756
Not much.

515
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:11,996
Cable!

516
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,116
Cable...

517
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:37,997
Ferret!

518
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:48,716
Ferret!

519
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:53,516
Ferret!

520
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,476
-Maybe we should go and check.
-No, we go home now.

521
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,116
-Sir, but...
-Home!

522
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,196
That's very kind.

523
00:59:43,836 --> 00:59:45,757
Nice orchid.

524
00:59:47,036 --> 00:59:50,477
<i>Family orchidaceae.</i>

525
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:52,396
<i>Genus orchids.</i>

526
00:59:53,436 --> 00:59:57,117
Over 100 species here.

527
00:59:58,076 --> 01:00:00,716
Much beauty in the swamp,

528
01:00:01,757 --> 01:00:04,236
if you only look.

529
01:00:13,037 --> 01:00:14,716
Alec?

530
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:27,276
Oh, I'm sorry.

531
01:00:29,036 --> 01:00:30,796
-It must...
-Hurt?

532
01:00:33,516 --> 01:00:35,677
Does it?

533
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:40,716
Only when I laugh.

534
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:05,756
Have I gone crazy?

535
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,996
Isn't this a dream?

536
01:01:10,076 --> 01:01:13,836
That's what I keep asking myself.

537
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,596
Everything's a dream

538
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,437
when you're alone.

539
01:01:28,236 --> 01:01:29,677
Oh, Alec.

540
01:03:56,877 --> 01:03:58,317
Now.

541
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:12,716
Get the hand down!

542
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:20,957
A man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

543
01:04:31,677 --> 01:04:33,037
Alec.

544
01:04:33,197 --> 01:04:35,517
Alec Holland.

545
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:38,637
You knew, didn't you?

546
01:04:38,716 --> 01:04:40,717
You knew we'd be caught.

547
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:46,557
The only way out is through.

548
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:42,077
The occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

549
01:06:42,158 --> 01:06:48,157
We have captured the dragon,
and rescued the damsel in distress.

550
01:06:48,317 --> 01:06:50,557
We regret the loss of our friend Ferret.

551
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:54,158
His frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

552
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:57,197
Nonetheless we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

553
01:06:57,276 --> 01:07:00,637
But to speak the truth, which is essential,

554
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:06,158
regrets are trifles
when one considers the grand design.

555
01:07:06,237 --> 01:07:11,357
And we are here tonight in celebration
of an event of profound significance.

556
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:14,157
The duplication of the Holland formula.

557
01:07:20,718 --> 01:07:24,397
For this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

558
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:26,558
Dear, dear Bruno.

559
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:30,798
Who won the notebook
from which we extracted the final secret

560
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:33,837
and topped it by capturing the beast.

561
01:07:42,877 --> 01:07:47,198
So I propose a toast
to the keystone of our success.

562
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:51,998
to our conquest of the world. to Bruno.

563
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:54,237
Bruno!

564
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:06,157
But, sir,

565
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:11,278
have you tried it out on a plant? I mean,
when are we going to see the results?

566
01:08:11,357 --> 01:08:12,878
Tonight.

567
01:08:13,037 --> 01:08:17,038
Tonight, dear Bruno. Immediately.
But not on a plant.

568
01:08:17,918 --> 01:08:19,678
<i>Have you taken it?</i>

569
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:25,757
No, I have given the privilege
of taking the first dose of our formula

570
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:28,038
to our guest of honor.

571
01:08:28,118 --> 01:08:31,078
He deserves the privilege thoroughly.

572
01:08:31,197 --> 01:08:33,837
It is you, dear Bruno,

573
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:37,677
who will tell us
whether or not the formula works.

574
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,957
Bruno, what's the matter with you?

575
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,437
-Calm.
-Help me!

576
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:13,599
<i>Help me!</i>

577
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:37,677
Calm.

578
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:05,038
What have you done with Cable?

579
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,918
Holland?

580
01:10:08,318 --> 01:10:10,037
Holland.

581
01:10:11,558 --> 01:10:13,518
You're there.

582
01:10:13,598 --> 01:10:16,399
Brain intact.

583
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:19,077
All your abilities, everything.

584
01:10:19,197 --> 01:10:22,559
Plus the power, the physical strength.

585
01:10:25,277 --> 01:10:27,198
Bring him in.

586
01:10:29,677 --> 01:10:31,078
Some friend you are.

587
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:35,078
Sorry, Bruno. It's every man for himself,
and god against all.

588
01:10:44,717 --> 01:10:47,078
Why doesn't Bruno have your strength?

589
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:54,638
We followed the notebooks religiously.
There can be no margin for error.

590
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:58,598
Why doesn't Bruno there
have your strength?

591
01:10:58,718 --> 01:11:01,558
Because he never had it.

592
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:03,678
No riddles, please.

593
01:11:05,358 --> 01:11:07,679
You will tell me,

594
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:09,278
or you'll pay.

595
01:11:09,438 --> 01:11:12,317
And through a very dear agent.

596
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,038
Bring her in.

597
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:23,439
The explanation, or her.

598
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:25,598
Alec, don't.

599
01:11:29,438 --> 01:11:30,878
Which?

600
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:34,238
You don't understand.

601
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,119
There's nothing hidden.

602
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,158
No secrets.

603
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,518
The formula works in so simple a way.

604
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:46,718
<i>What Bruno took was what changed me.</i>

605
01:11:47,557 --> 01:11:51,077
It only amplifies your essence.

606
01:11:52,318 --> 01:11:58,038
It simply makes you more
of what you already are.

607
01:11:59,839 --> 01:12:03,438
Bruno's essence
was stupidity and timidity.

608
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:12,718
The formula simply extended, amplified
this to ridiculous forms and proportions.

609
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:19,679
He shrank.
He shrank to what he actually was.

610
01:12:21,918 --> 01:12:26,719
But if the essence is, let us say, genius,

611
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:32,319
then this genius shall be monumental
in body as well as in spirit.

612
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:34,398
Is that what you're saying?

613
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:07,919
Cable.

614
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:10,518
Alec.

615
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:57,759
Not to be the phenomenon,
but the thing in itself.

616
01:14:57,838 --> 01:15:03,558
Eternal, absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power,

617
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:07,438
physical and spiritual.

618
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:11,758
To be the world,

619
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:13,558
and own it.

620
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:16,120
Yes, sir?

621
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,439
Darling,

622
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:22,079
tell Karen
to bring me a glass of brandy, hmm?

623
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:53,078
Reach for it.

624
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,398
You thrive on the light. Reach for it.

625
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:06,478
Alec.

626
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:25,919
Come. Come.

627
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:37,279
What's the matter with you?
Go. Go. Leave me.

628
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,119
Your arm.

629
01:19:06,799 --> 01:19:08,799
Listen.

630
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:10,959
He's taken the formula.

631
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:27,199
Please! There is a way.

632
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:32,799
I can't reach it, but you twist it
to the right and then to the left.

633
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:39,079
Put there in case a guard
ever got shut in by mistake.

634
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:44,880
Come on, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

635
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,639
You'll have to trust me here,
if you wanna survive.

636
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:06,399
If you don't

637
01:20:06,519 --> 01:20:07,440
tell us.

638
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,680
This is the well of the estate, fed by
a spring from the bottom of the swamp.

639
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,039
If you follow it,
you'll come out in the swamp.

640
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,720
Go!

641
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:18,800
Watch your step.

642
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,360
Have a nice trip.

643
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:27,280
<i>See you at the ball.</i>

644
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,799
Alec.

645
01:21:48,559 --> 01:21:49,600
Alec!

646
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,599
Behind you.

647
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:59,201
I don't understand.

648
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,280
It's healed.

649
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,961
What is it?

650
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,081
It's over.

651
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,080
Alec, let me go with you.

652
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,720
You can start your work again.

653
01:25:30,799 --> 01:25:33,120
With these?

654
01:25:34,161 --> 01:25:36,881
I'll be your hands.

655
01:25:38,401 --> 01:25:39,921
Please?

656
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,601
You need to heal.
You need to tell our story.

657
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,441
I'll see you soon.

658
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,440
Until then...

659
01:25:55,921 --> 01:25:57,361
I'll always be with you.

660
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,041
Alec?

661
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,681
Cable!

662
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,281
Jude.

663
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:26,520
You ok?

664
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:28,961
Mm-hmm.

665
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,641
He told me to come and get you.

666
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:38,800
He'll be back, though, right?

2
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:25,843
You think you can manage going shopping for dinner?

3
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:26,844
Or should I do it?

4
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:27,845
No, it's okay. I can do that.

5
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:30,332
Ben is bringing someone?

6
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,298
Nuh-uh

7
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:32,299
Again?

8
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:34,362
This time he was caught.

9
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:38,680
The girl saw with B girl in your favorite Italian restaurant.

10
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,227
(Sarcastic) Nice movement.

11
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:43,379
Go ahead.

12
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,469
The girl turned, began to make a scene ...

13
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,972
... and poured a glass of wine over his head.

14
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:52,036
Girl B drank their wine and left with him.

15
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,557
Interestingly, things like this happen only with boys.

16
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:57,278
And not for women?

17
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,279
Nope.

18
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:13,831
Bye. Have a nice day.

19
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,074
Ah, it's good to get a hold on you.

20
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,590
Good morning, Dr. Kühne.

21
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:19,591
Good day.

22
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,705
I still have not received a response from you.

23
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:23,265
You are my preferred candidate

24
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,655
and I have not heard from you in a long time.

25
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,173
I'm really sorry. I ...

26
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,709
I have not had time to think about it.

27
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,036
Come on. Pull yourself together.

28
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:33,618
It's a great opportunity.

29
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,029
But I have to tell you, I?

30
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,487
I really appreciate your offer.

31
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,999
Good morning, Dr. Kühne.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,635
11 hours in my office. Do not forget.

33
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:42,115
Sure.

34
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,988
(Medical alderman?)

35
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:45,767
Sounds good, does not it?

36
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,244
We never had a woman in that position.

37
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,252
Oh, and a new colleague is coming today.

38
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,253
Mobile Task Force.

39
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,266
Any anormalies?

40
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,643
Not that I know of.

41
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,122
But you're always good for a surprise.

42
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:04,678
Wait a second.

43
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,707
Good morning, Linda.

44
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,806
I am not sure if this will be good.

45
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,727
I can not classify its rail chaos.

46
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:13,579
Life is not just about cleanliness.

47
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,617
That is why chaos is so attractive.

48
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:16,618
Maybe for you.

49
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,961
So? What we have today?

50
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:23,913
There are some employees who had time to think about their complaints.

51
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,760
M-hm. Especially one.

52
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,625
I put official Langmüller second.

53
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,507
Even if he was here first thing in the morning.

54
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,176
You're so good to me.

55
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,182
Hello

56
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,133
Hello

57
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,033
Sit.

58
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:20,330
Ah, yes. Detective Franziska Hansen.

59
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,007
You're from Hamburg.

60
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,610
Is this your first job in a task force for mobile?

61
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:27,611
Yes.

62
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:31,561
Good.

63
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:38,543
At first glance, I do not see anything unusual in your file, bu -

64
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,399
oh, wait a minute.

65
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,004
A whiplash injury after a car accident.

66
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,047
That was how long ago?

67
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:50,997
Sept. 200 -

68
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,217
17 months and 2 weeks to be exact.

69
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:57,817
I understand.

70
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,211
Was there any sequels?

71
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,759
So you have no problem with him anymore?

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
No.

73
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,012
Good.

74
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,887
But I still have to examine it.

75
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,599
Please sit up there on that bed and take off your shirt.

76
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,426
This happened on a mission?

77
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,638
No, it's from the accident.

78
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,250
After effect.

79
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,445
You can dress.

80
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,679
Are you doing some kind of sport?

81
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,444
All we have to do.

82
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,346
That's not enough.

83
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,484
The back muscles are not very evolved.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,754
Swimming is good for that.

85
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:20,770
Good.

86
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:25,110
Ms. Weber will have a blood sample and she will be doing an EKG.

87
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,944
It will take some time until we get the results.

88
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:32,238
If we're not getting back at you, then it's okay.

89
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,239
Okay.

90
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,769
I wish you a nice stay in Munich, Ms. Hansen.

91
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:42,318
Thank you.

92
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,782
Good morning Doctor.

93
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,620
Mr. Langmüller.

94
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,035
You have to check my eyes again.

95
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,999
With more than -8 can forget the mobile task force.

96
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:06,938
The glasses that you pre-set -

97
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,526
The results are unmistakable.

98
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,834
No, I think there is an error.

99
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:12,516
I'll prove it to you.

100
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,629
Look, one plate of the car down there.

101
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:19,300
The silver BMW.

102
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,332
That's at least 90 to 100 meters, maybe more.

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,182
M - N - S - 1753

104
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,738
And from this moment. What do you think?

105
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:32,740
Mr. Langmüller

106
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,890
This is your car down there.

107
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,533
Not bad.

108
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,518
And on photo 13?

109
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,032
Maybe I do not like that number.

110
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,269
That's what I call perfect timing.

111
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,734
Max Hansen this is Siska

112
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:05,095
Detective department drugs in Hamburg.

113
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,162
Detective Max Zollner, his new partner.

114
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,825
I'm sure you already knew his wife this morning.

115
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,134
She will help with the case Seligmann.

116
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:16,716
Excuse me?

117
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,577
Hansen is capable of the Serbo-Croatian language

118
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:22,563
and has a broad knowledge of Eastern Europe.

119
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:24,837
What is definitely an advantage for us.

120
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:28,552
For good teamwork.

121
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:30,831
Yeah, sure, why not.

122
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,229
Good.

123
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:39,487
Zollner?

124
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:41,467
Ella.

125
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:43,526
No, I can not.

126
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,006
He just left?

127
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,504
Okay, listen. I need to go in one operation.

128
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,158
And maybe I can stop later.

129
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,149
When I know how long it will take.

130
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,578
Ok, so far.

131
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,962
What?

132
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,457
The task force is mobile going bust two drug dealers armed.

133
00:09:58,887 --> 00:09:59,825
And?

134
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,557
Within the next 15 minutes.

135
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,897
So here we go!

136
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,274
Linda? Please reschedule all my appointments for tomorrow.

137
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,236
I need to help my aunt in her practice.

138
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,190
His receptionist quit.

139
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:37,311
Oh, and please, find out which department he worked in accident Ms. Hansen.

140
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,809
No, it's official now.

141
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:42,665
Yes, thank you.

142
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,916
Very brave, little man.

143
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,728
Done. But you need to take your meds.

144
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:08,729
Okay.

145
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,730
Bye.

146
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,987
Ella, listen.

147
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,532
Something like today is not working.

148
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,238
I can help once in a while

149
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,278
but if you can not do it on your own

150
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,379
you have to hire another doctor

151
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,756
or reduce patients or ... I do not know.

152
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:38,715
I can not do well.

153
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,088
Why not?

154
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,645
First, I do not want anyone else here

155
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:45,964
and second I do not want anyone but you.

156
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,223
You should not smoke.

157
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:58,173
Taking practice and I'll quit.

158
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,435
Ella!

159
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,422
You're not happy with your work.

160
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,899
Listen, I talked to my bank

161
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,315
and we're talking a six-figure loan

162
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:08,721
to suit practice with modern technology.

163
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:12,429
Ah, all this crap technique can not replace a good doctor.

164
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,284
And you're a natural.

165
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,217
Numbers like that scares me, you know?

166
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,400
This is the last bottle.

167
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,496
I would not have guessed.

168
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,045
Hm?

169
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:49,090
You do not hold it against me.

170
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:50,171
What?

171
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,097
Siska Hansen.

172
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:56,736
I really do not know why someone just plonked in front of me without telling me.

173
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:59,462
I do not have "plonked" someone in front of you, Max

174
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:04,425
I just ordered the best and most qualified agents to the case.

175
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:06,648
Hey, you're the boss.

176
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,763
You've seen it, too, right?

177
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,661
What?

178
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:13,767
Hansen.

179
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:14,890
What do you think?

180
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,656
Interesting woman.

181
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:18,695
Interesting?

182
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:20,529
What do you mean?

183
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,994
In what way?

184
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,721
Well, she has this odd mix.

185
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,753
Cool and vulnerable.

186
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,058
I do not know.

187
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,876
Well, I think you read way too much into it.

188
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:34,888
Occupational disease.

189
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,443
To me it does not seem very professional.

190
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,571
My God, Max!

191
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,197
You just asked about a first impression. What's wrong with you?

192
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,053
I just do not want to spend the night analyzing Franziska Hansen.

193
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,322
In any case, it has excellent references.

194
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,505
The main point is that it does not spoil my case.

195
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,135
So let's change the topic, ok?

196
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,188
He definitely enjoyed dinner.

197
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,517
Not surprising. You cooked after its revenue.

198
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,300
True.

199
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,880
You really thought Kuhne on offer?

200
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:27,751
I do not want to force things.

201
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:32,842
Come on.

202
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:34,707
Do not be angry with Ben.

203
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:38,195
I mean it also has its advantages to be friends with your boss.

204
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,410
Yeah.

205
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:40,985
As you can see.

206
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,969
Tell me ...

207
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,854
How long has it been since we had sex?

208
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,903
Well, her birthday is coming.

209
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,531
Well, congratulations.

210
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,022
Ah-ha.

211
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,028
It's about time that I came back.

212
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,097
I'm not saying anything.

213
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,796
I do not want to rip off the woman of my dreams.

214
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:27,304
Actually, why not?

215
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:31,069
Let's grow old and fat together, ok.

216
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,501
Oh, that sounds terrible.

217
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,836
Let's go somewhere.

218
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:38,731
Something different.

219
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:44,548
I guess it's not a good idea to take a vacation now.

220
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,559
Then Hansen is taking on the case Seligmann

221
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,222
Seligmann and is my case.

222
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:52,916
Yup.

223
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,490
I'm not like you.

224
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,820
I want to succeed in my work.

225
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,229
What does this mean?

226
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,362
For two weeks Kühne has offered him his replacement.

227
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,663
So what?

228
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,225
Do you accept?

229
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,523
You always think things will resolve themselves.

230
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,056
I'll take a shower.

231
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:18,297
A second more and my lungs would burst already.

232
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,446
You do not have to stay down for so long.

233
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,405
But it felt good.

234
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,346
You're already set in?

235
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,149
I found an apartment.

236
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,141
If you can call it that.

237
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:43,009
You are a very good diver.

238
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,279
I like the depth.

239
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,367
Have you ever been diving in the ocean?

240
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:49,625
No. Too deep.

241
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:51,391
Very dark.

242
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,814
Does that scare you?

243
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:57,619
Maybe it's something we should talk.

244
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,740
You do not want to talk.

245
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:19,050
We think Seligmann is the central figure.

246
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,142
He is a former police officer.

247
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:28,068
He is familiar with our methods, touched coverage of an agent a year ago

248
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,197
and shot in cold blood.

249
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:35,417
From this secret agent, we know that Seligmann

250
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,455
ran a ton of cocaine to Germany.

251
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:41,619
What we do not know is how he does it.

252
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,523
What we know is that he has excellent contacts in the Balkans.

253
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,331
Any questions?

254
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:07,641
Seligmann is to be observed 24/7, now six weeks.

255
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:12,131
That's how he is saying that we have much to do. Here.

256
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:17,337
You are the first policeman I meet who do not drive.

257
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,010
You do not want to drive or you can not drive?

258
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:25,556
I do not want.

259
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,154
I do not understand.

260
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:29,777
I mean, there must be a reason.

261
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,119
I do not get anything out.

262
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,486
You do not gain anything by it?

263
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:37,977
Yeah. I do not get anything out.

264
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,967
What? No skid marks?

265
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:48,077
Ok, but what has Hansen explanation?

266
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,472
I understand.

267
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:55,096
Can you tell me who treated Hansen?

268
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,375
Yes, the hospital.

269
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,055
I also got to know who was in charge of their medical care in police.

270
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,885
Someone died?

271
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,337
It's about time.

272
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,529
(Bavarian accent) It's really about time, Max! It's getting cold.

273
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,530
What?

274
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,292
It's cold. You're late. I want to go home.

275
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,309
He is doing drugs, too?

276
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,692
Seligmann is a control freak.

277
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,929
He is not on drugs.

278
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,212
But?

279
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,005
Prostitutes.

280
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:58,226
He likes to pay for it.

281
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:11,190
It seems important to you.

282
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,498
Can you get me some water?

283
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:21,124
What is holding you back?

284
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,042
It's a big step forward.

285
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,528
Yes, I know.

286
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,096
Is that the problem?

287
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:32,470
What do you mean?

288
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:36,742
You talked to Max about it.

289
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:38,576
Not true.

290
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:43,265
You know you make a quick career than him.

291
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,541
Do not underestimate the vanity of the male brain.

292
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,921
It's not about that, believe me.

293
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,166
I just want to be a doctor. And a good, you know?

294
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,071
Sure.

295
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:59,043
Tell me ...

296
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:03,189
They are good together?

297
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,285
Very good.

298
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:11,406
Jealous?

299
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,549
Where is my car?

300
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:20,895
Go!

301
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:25,532
Put your weapon!

302
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:42,417
What the fuck was that, Hansen?

303
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:44,996
You partner would be dead now!

304
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,413
It's kind of absurd to persuade someone to a promotion.

305
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:57,960
You will not find the answer in the tea leaves.

306
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:02,905
I do not know why you are hesitating. Perhaps for private reasons.

307
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:06,475
But I know that acceptance by staff,

308
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:09,383
his experience and his extraordinary sense

309
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,001
shows that you are perfect for the job.

310
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,788
That's why I want you.

311
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:20,480
For everything you're saying I feel honored

312
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,641
and that is what makes it also difficult for me to decide.

313
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:25,378
Look, Dr. Kühne

314
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:31,258
I see my purpose in occupational less administrative stuff

315
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:35,762
I need direct contact with patients.

316
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,363
The situation is so.

317
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:40,026
I have to say a name or I have to advertise the position.

318
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:42,486
I need your answer until next week.

319
00:27:11,106 --> 00:27:13,727
Come, I'll help you.

320
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,708
Max Max, please!

321
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:36,091
I have so many things on my mind.

322
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,386
I love you.

323
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:45,086
Only three more weeks until my birthday.

324
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,293
What time is it?

325
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,377
You have not found an apartment yet?

326
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:38,025
I have, but I got stuck in custom reports.

327
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,718
In custom reports?

328
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:43,376
Seligmann means in Serbo-Croatian xxx

329
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:47,605
And this name appears with other animal transport.

330
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:51,940
Transport of animals that are shipped in Trieste on Croatia.

331
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,826
They are legally imported.

332
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:54,827
And?

333
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:58,190
Maybe they smuggle stuff like this.

334
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,696
Forget it.

335
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,525
Transportation like this are handled very good.

336
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:09,208
It is impossible to hide this much unnoticed cocaine in a truck.

337
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:12,069
I was not thinking about the trucks.

338
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,611
What do you mean?

339
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:16,371
Animals.

340
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:17,569
Animals.

341
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,209
Do you think they feed the cows with this material?

342
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,877
Unlikely.

343
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:23,325
Enlighten me.

344
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,240
Cows are ruminants.

345
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:29,853
True. They regurgitate and chew packets in two.

346
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:32,878
But what -

347
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,865
Pigs.

348
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:42,110
The more I think about it, it's brilliant, you know?

349
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:43,355
Coincidence.

350
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:44,766
Combinatorics.

351
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:47,848
Intuition.

352
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:50,668
Ok, I admit. I'm a genius.

353
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,807
Good. In the mood for a drink?

354
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,717
Destroy some cells genius?

355
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:59,292
It is not new. I could not find anything online, if pigs are suitable as courirs drugs.

356
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:00,592
Ok

357
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:03,114
Digestion times and stuff.

358
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:47,029
I have to ask a national title in the library.

359
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,059
And how long would it take?

360
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,305
At least 8-9 days.

361
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:55,683
We could make him an express mail and you would get it on Monday.

362
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,185
No, that is too long.

363
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:58,787
I need the books this week.

364
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:00,314
Faster is not possible.

365
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:03,835
Hi

366
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:07,523
Where do you come from?

367
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,091
From the outside.

368
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,532
Ah, yes.

369
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,882
I am looking for information on veterinary medicine.

370
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:20,469
Second floor.

371
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,754
You wanna come with me? I'll show you.

372
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,811
They told me that Munich is a city, but this small?

373
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:48,577
But, so you will not lose sight of anyone.

374
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,899
Uhm, I can give you a ride somewhere?

375
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I got my bike.

376
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:56,730
Well, good luck then.

377
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:59,922
Oh, excuse me.

378
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,123
Hello?

379
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,738
Hello? Who's there?

380
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:09,305
My god, Ella. Please calm down, can not in -

381
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,915
Okay, stay there. I'm going.

382
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,936
Unbelievable, my aunt had a car accident.

383
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:17,238
Is she hurt?

384
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,645
No, I do not think so, but ...

385
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,016
She is so out of it these days.

386
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,944
I think she needs my help.

387
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,859
You want me to go?

388
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,387
Can you remember everything?

389
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:34,803
Could you please leave the car?

390
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:36,729
I'm talking to the patient.

391
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,469
Can somone please get Mrs. confusing to leave the car?

392
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,671
Now, not insolent.

393
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:43,538
The woman is a doctor.

394
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,045
And who are you?

395
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,575
I am also a doctor.

396
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:49,230
You see, you're not needed here.

397
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,482
Should I give you a ride home?

398
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:00,513
No thanks.

399
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,892
Glad you're laughing again.

400
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,165
You are the driver of the car?

401
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,166
Yes.

402
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,823
Driver's license and registration, and please drive your car to the side of the road.

403
00:33:07,824 --> 00:33:09,849
With or without registration?

404
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,363
So you're driving without a license for years?

405
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:17,007
The car was the pride of Peter and I did not have the heart to sell it after he died.

406
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,851
You can always request a driver's license.

407
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:23,000
And as fit as you are, you can drive for over 10 years.

408
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,143
Grande.

409
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:25,992
You're just playing with me.

410
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:28,229
So now let me out.

411
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:32,930
I just want a whiskey and bathtub.

412
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,005
We must take him upstairs?

413
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:36,221
No, it's okay.

414
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,004
The car suits you both.

415
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:20,049
You do not speak Serbo-Croatian, is not it?

416
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,244
Do you live alone.

417
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,994
Not true.

418
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:08,717
Fish were my husband.

419
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:25,901
When you lose the person you love most

420
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:28,532
is probably the worst that can happen.

421
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,978
How do you know?

422
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,591
I know.

423
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,079
Uh-uh.

424
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,178
You know.

425
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:55,066
What do you know?

426
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:23,570
At first I thought it could not get through it.

427
00:36:27,178 --> 00:36:31,098
But you keep on living.

428
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,915
Whether you want to or not.

429
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,759
The nights are difficult.

430
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:46,816
You keep waking up and

431
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:49,132
you expect

432
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:53,558
it was just a dream.

433
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,225
You think, My God

434
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,936
do not let him be dead.

435
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,690
But you know it's not a dream.

436
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:19,367
I uhm

437
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:23,903
I do not know what I would do.

438
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:26,986
I tell you what you would do.

439
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:29,296
Work.

440
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:32,760
Work. Work.

441
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:38,776
Without breaking. No thought. Just working.

442
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:46,083
Then you forget.

443
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,601
Are you sure that is the right way?

444
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:52,925
Yes.

445
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,437
I tried.

446
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,916
Where have you been?

447
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:38,827
I've wondered where you were when you came home late?

448
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:40,335
I'm on duty.

449
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,251
Well, I was too.

450
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,870
You do not want to tell me what is happening?

451
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,263
Ella had an accident.

452
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,798
What?

453
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,317
Ella had a car accident.

454
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:19,055
I had to care for her half of the night.

455
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:21,056
What happened?

456
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:22,424
Is she hurt?

457
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:24,699
No, no one was injured.

458
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,855
What's with the inquisition?

459
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,413
I'm dead tired.

460
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:49,603
I have to sleep now.

461
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,193
Why do I have the feeling you're not telling the truth?

462
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:06,161
It's nothing. Believe me.

463
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,807
Good day.

464
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,120
What are they doing with the car of Ella?

465
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:30,112
Katrin asked me to bring him back to her.

466
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,916
How do you know which car is Ella?

467
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:38,895
I met Katrin yesterday and took Ella home.

468
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:56,321
Linda, you could find a doctor that hospital in Hamburg?

469
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:57,462
That the teacher ...

470
00:41:57,463 --> 00:41:58,263
Bäumer.

471
00:41:58,264 --> 00:41:59,264
Yes.

472
00:41:59,265 --> 00:42:01,264
I found him, but he has not called back yet.

473
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:04,448
Could you please call him again. I really need to talk to him.

474
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:05,249
Now?

475
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,747
Yes, now.

476
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:09,047
Hello, Katrin.

477
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:12,975
Hey.

478
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:17,070
Ms. Hansen results are already here?

479
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:18,471
I put them on his desk.

480
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,817
Oh, yeah, right.

481
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:23,832
Well then, follow me.

482
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:36,620
Franziska.

483
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,078
I. ..

484
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,279
Oh

485
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,354
Franziska.

486
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:45,164
Siska. I'm sorry.

487
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,904
But out there ...

488
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,839
Linda hears coughing fleas.

489
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:52,772
Sure.

490
00:42:58,087 --> 00:42:59,599
Doctor.

491
00:43:00,563 --> 00:43:02,525
Yes, exactly.

492
00:43:15,704 --> 00:43:16,879
Siska, listen.

493
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,857
What happened last night ...

494
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:22,254
I think it should ...

495
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:23,455
Yes?

496
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,842
Well ...

497
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,917
I think it's better when we forget it.

498
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:44,913
Jeez, Siska. We are not disposed of in this manner both.

499
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,562
For most people as something that happens during puberty.

500
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:50,922
And for us a little later.

501
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:54,665
I do not need psychological explanations.

502
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,394
I'm not your patient.

503
00:43:57,395 --> 00:43:59,430
You are also my patient.

504
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,828
And what else?

505
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:08,032
Ah, yes.

506
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:11,379
Something you better forget.

507
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:24,810
Shit!

508
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Pigs?

509
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:27,764
Exactly.

510
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,634
Pigs as drug courir, not bad.

511
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:33,233
And it fits much of the stomach of a child.

512
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:35,445
And you save the ticket.

513
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,561
Is everything okay with you two?

514
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:42,422
Sure.

515
00:44:42,423 --> 00:44:44,013
Sure.

516
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,841
Seligmann is taking charge next night somewhere on the border near Salzburg.

517
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:49,122
Salzburg?

518
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,407
There are actually police in charge of Austria.

519
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:53,205
Come, forget Austria!

520
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:57,056
Already did.

521
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,733
Siska? Hello? It Katrin.

522
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:41,708
What are you doing?

523
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:43,620
I gotta go.

524
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,999
But we'll have dinner together right?

525
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,732
You can not. I'll get picked up anytime.

526
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:54,637
What's wrong? Why are you so grumpy?

527
00:45:54,638 --> 00:45:57,918
I have a reason?

528
00:45:57,919 --> 00:45:59,671
I do not know.

529
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:02,597
His story about the accident Ella was very thin.

530
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:05,240
Why do not you tell me Siska was with you?

531
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:07,526
Because I. ..

532
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:10,198
Gee, Max, I do not think it was important.

533
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,607
I just forgot about it. It was not important. It was Ella.

534
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:18,664
She would have been the perfect alibi. My partner. What a coincidence.

535
00:46:18,665 --> 00:46:20,808
But you should have planned better.

536
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,748
Are you crazy?

537
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:25,884
Where you been all night really fucking after the accident?

538
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:27,495
Max I. ..

539
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:32,553
Shit.

540
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:39,172
Hey, come on in. I'm almost done. Katrin is cooking.

541
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,753
Mhm, smells good.

542
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:45,434
If you want you can join us for dinner.

543
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:49,792
No, you do not want.

544
00:46:49,793 --> 00:46:52,113
I'd love to.

545
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:56,049
Great.

546
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,363
Delicious.

547
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:15,569
I'm glad you like it.

548
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,273
I thought I blew it.

549
00:47:19,274 --> 00:47:22,943
I can not imagine you ruin anything.

550
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:26,650
To me you look so ...

551
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:28,291
perfect.

552
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,716
I'm sure you have everything under control.

553
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,703
Job. Domestic.

554
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:39,204
Marriage.

555
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:43,698
You really appreciate it?

556
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,228
I think we should go.

557
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:55,547
Goodbye.

558
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:57,833
Doctor.

559
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:02,127
And thank you for that wonderful dinner.

560
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:13,890
Bye.

561
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,011
I guess I do not have to wait for you.

562
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:17,072
No.

563
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:01,368
What is that over there? Is that a house?

564
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:03,848
Forget it. It is inhabited. The lights are on.

565
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:11,711
Could you please not smoke in here?

566
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:14,467
Thank you.

567
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:19,091
Somehow Oyu strike me as someone who is just passing through.

568
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:22,568
I'm just passing through.

569
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:27,487
You really live alone?

570
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:29,760
You want to force a conversation about me?

571
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:32,045
Blimey, what's happening with you?

572
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:35,558
We work together. We are partners. It's completely normal I ask you all this.

573
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,500
I wonder what you're doing. From where you are.

574
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,640
Why?

575
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:11,524
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

576
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,226
It's the only reasonable thing to do.

577
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:20,735
It's an hour from the border and the fifth single vacancy there.

578
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,508
This can not be.

579
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:41,577
It's total crap that we are doing here.

580
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:46,798
Just think. What is the probability to choose between hundreds of farms -

581
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,344
(Translates) They are dead. Let them inside.

582
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:06,979
What?

583
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,969
Shit! Why are not they coming out?

584
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,696
Now let's not get out and we will lose Seligmann.

585
00:52:38,832 --> 00:52:42,563
Truck transport grayish yellow animal. Number plate ...

586
00:52:55,158 --> 00:52:57,464
Pigs poor.

587
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,141
I could smoke one too, now.

588
00:53:35,052 --> 00:53:37,388
You will get burned.

589
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:23,959
Thank you for taking some time to myself.

590
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,531
This is very good.

591
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:27,912
My pleasure Dr. Zollner.

592
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:31,782
I'm always happy to help a colleague.

593
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:39,962
Especially when I feel - as in the case of Mrs. Hansen - I've forgotten something.

594
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:44,775
I do not think you have to blame yourself for anything.

595
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:52,640
You know she is a woman who possibly saw her husband die.

596
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:54,387
And something like this can evoke -

597
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:57,556
posttraumatic disorders, yeah, I know.

598
00:54:57,557 --> 00:54:58,974
That's right.

599
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:01,290
But what I'm most interested in is -

600
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:02,920
Yes, yes I know.

601
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:05,047
The time later.

602
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:10,432
The most important thing is to regain emotional stability.

603
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:18,027
In case of a chronic disease that can lead to a hostile and suspicious attitude against society.

604
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:21,631
The result is a retreat and social alienation.

605
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:25,971
It occurs excessiv reactions of shock, panic attacks.

606
00:55:25,972 --> 00:55:32,672
In the case of Ms. Hansen I have recommended a ban of 6 weeks of work and therapy.

607
00:55:32,673 --> 00:55:34,248
And?

608
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:38,698
Hansen cut the brief therapy.

609
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:41,361
I understand.

610
00:55:41,362 --> 00:55:45,534
You neurologically examined Hansen once again?

611
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:46,535
No.

612
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:49,844
She has already been transferred.

613
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:52,511
Maybe that was the mistake.

614
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:57,452
In the accident report, said there were no skid marks, you know?

615
00:55:57,453 --> 00:56:04,584
I mean, I wonder ... she lost consciousness? She just let it happen? Or ...

616
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:07,858
She did it on purpose.

617
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:17,172
Gee, Max! We have nothing!

618
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,084
We just could not get out of there.

619
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:21,151
Which means you could not get out of there?

620
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:23,693
What did you do there?

621
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:27,400
Playing Hide and Seek in the barn?

622
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:41,937
Hey, honey.

623
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,873
You ate it.

624
00:56:53,096 --> 00:56:55,454
I mean why not?

625
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:58,729
She is a woman erotic.

626
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:06,848
I do not know what I would do if I spend one night with her ... watching.

627
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:13,242
Do not do it. Do. It.

628
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:38,756
A broken soul, hm?

629
00:57:38,757 --> 00:57:40,312
My ass!

630
00:57:40,313 --> 00:57:44,040
After catastroph in your life that you want to spoil everyone else.

631
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,582
But not on my watch! I swear to God!

632
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,313
Shit!

633
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,972
You sleep with me. With Max What's next? A trio?

634
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:56,495
Is this what you want?

635
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:00,827
You both use me.

636
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:04,052
To distract their problems.

637
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:10,236
Oh yeah? And you use us to get messed up on his life.

638
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:42,341
At that time

639
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,932
when we sat in the car

640
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,454
Martin and I

641
00:58:54,834 --> 00:59:01,461
and he told me that he is sleeping with someone else

642
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,531
he wants to live with her

643
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,528
I hated him.

644
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:19,834
It's my fault that he died.

645
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:27,073
Back then, I swore to myself I would not fall in love again.

646
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,866
Up to now.

647
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:45,327
You touched something in me that I thought had died with him.

648
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:55,229
But damn! By Max?

649
00:59:59,051 --> 01:00:01,422
I wanted to hurt him.

650
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,335
Ella?

651
01:02:34,303 --> 01:02:37,833
Why dresses give us a sense of being someone else?

652
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:38,834
Good day.

653
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:42,680
In this dress, for example, I feel Russian.

654
01:02:49,008 --> 01:02:52,296
You look worn. Is there something wrong?

655
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:54,672
Why do you think?

656
01:02:54,673 --> 01:02:56,219
Not true?

657
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,977
Yes, it is.

658
01:03:01,304 --> 01:03:03,385
I'm totally confused.

659
01:03:03,386 --> 01:03:04,832
Why?

660
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:10,643
Do you remember this woman?

661
01:03:10,644 --> 01:03:13,602
The one on my car?

662
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:15,699
Siska, yes.

663
01:03:22,074 --> 01:03:24,047
You know ...

664
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:30,575
I'm making your hiring exam and came across something.

665
01:03:30,576 --> 01:03:32,557
What are you holding?

666
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,558
Yes.

667
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,635
Why are they doing this?

668
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,721
Because I'm not sure about that.

669
01:03:37,722 --> 01:03:42,582
Siska had a car accident where her husband died.

670
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:46,918
I can not shake the feeling that she wanted to kill herself.

671
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:49,843
Maybe her and him.

672
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:54,502
Maybe it was just an accident. I just do not know.

673
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:57,706
But you have to do your job.

674
01:03:57,707 --> 01:03:59,662
Yes, but what if I'm wrong?

675
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:01,602
She could lose her job.

676
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:03,630
But otherwise you will lose your.

677
01:04:10,336 --> 01:04:13,414
You fell for her. That's the point.

678
01:04:14,872 --> 01:04:18,730
I never felt attracted to women.

679
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,864
I do not mean like that.

680
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:38,590
Sometimes people come into our lives that we can not explain.

681
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:43,948
That help us on our way, however.

682
01:04:50,272 --> 01:04:51,388
Who is this?

683
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,110
You do not know her.

684
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,859
I'm not gay.

685
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,866
Neither do I.

686
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:07,211
Here. Dieter and me.

687
01:05:07,212 --> 01:05:10,677
Married for 10 years and suddenly the spark was gone.

688
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:13,745
But it was a mistake to stay together.

689
01:05:13,746 --> 01:05:16,199
And then there was her.

690
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,664
Not that he had a mistress, but I did.

691
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,955
But why would a woman?

692
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:27,629
Maybe hopefully be understood by a woman without explaining ourselves.

693
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,930
Ella!

694
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,637
This is just mean.

695
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:32,418
No, no, no, no ...

696
01:05:32,419 --> 01:05:36,140
You should not get rid of some inconvenient truth as a line.

697
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:39,910
What's wrong with you?

698
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:41,886
Nothing.

699
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,169
Just a headache.

700
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,290
That does not sound right.

701
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,439
I want to examine next week.

702
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,581
No, it's okay.

703
01:05:49,582 --> 01:05:51,967
Come to the table.

704
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,200
For the lamp.

705
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:02,870
The registration documents of your car?

706
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:04,419
Just take it.

707
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,875
The car is yours.

708
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:06,957
Ella!

709
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,233
I can not accept that.

710
01:06:08,234 --> 01:06:10,451
Let the breeze of the wind through your hair.

711
01:06:17,297 --> 01:06:20,876
Actually, I'm on guard.

712
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:21,877
So what?

713
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,376
When something happens we'll be back soon.

714
01:07:28,146 --> 01:07:30,929
You know, when I was four ...

715
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,152
I came here with my parents too.

716
01:07:33,153 --> 01:07:37,455
And there we always had a break.

717
01:07:37,456 --> 01:07:39,159
Then what?

718
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,928
Then we went inside.

719
01:07:42,929 --> 01:07:44,360
Here.

720
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:47,971
He knelt.

721
01:07:47,972 --> 01:07:49,356
And he prayed.

722
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:02,390
Do you believe in God?

723
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:08,810
No more.

724
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,138
Katrin?

725
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,198
Max, I need the weekend to myself.

726
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:45,699
Hello?

727
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,285
Hellooo?

728
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,106
Who's there?

729
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:17,655
Max?

730
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:21,311
Get out of there!

731
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:24,278
Can I help you?

732
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:25,159
It's ok honey.

733
01:09:34,493 --> 01:09:36,888
What is happening to you?

734
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:38,740
Katrin is gone.

735
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,641
She never did this before.

736
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:49,409
Then you marry for love?

737
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:52,340
Yes, we really did.

738
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:56,500
But there was a party or a honeymoon.

739
01:09:57,382 --> 01:10:00,034
We were kinda broke at the time.

740
01:10:01,226 --> 01:10:03,877
Max was not promoted.

741
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:10,435
We always wanted to make up for it.

742
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:12,002
But?

743
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,403
But ...

744
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:19,672
I do not want to talk about Max now.

745
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:23,600
I just lost sight now.

746
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:30,536
I mean you think I'm capable of something like this is bad enough

747
01:10:31,681 --> 01:10:33,753
But we're talking about his wife.

748
01:10:33,754 --> 01:10:35,655
Benno, there is something happening.

749
01:10:35,656 --> 01:10:38,259
Shit! I do not want to lose her.

750
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,112
If you want advice from me as your friend ...

751
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:51,562
So do not try to change it.

752
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:56,080
Give her the feeling that you love her as she is.

753
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:57,904
I have to find it first.

754
01:10:59,258 --> 01:11:03,434
Concerning find. We have a clue where Seligmann.

755
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:05,932
Some slaughterhouse outside Munich.

756
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:08,605
I'll give you the details when I have them.

757
01:11:19,574 --> 01:11:21,566
I fell in love.

758
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,871
With us.

759
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:26,287
Yes?

760
01:12:27,216 --> 01:12:28,708
Where is this?

761
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:30,957
Ok, I know.

762
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,847
I can not get a hold on her too.

763
01:12:33,848 --> 01:12:35,909
No, no, I'll do it.

764
01:14:50,173 --> 01:14:52,343
I love you.

765
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:08,399
It's like a tug.

766
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:16,621
I really do not understand all this.

767
01:16:36,129 --> 01:16:41,894
I try to understand that everything is a disease that destroys all the beauty.

768
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,661
Here, so you will not forget me.

769
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,062
I will not forget you.

770
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,999
I. .. I have to tell you something.

771
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,589
You can not work in the police.

772
01:17:45,668 --> 01:17:48,234
I need my job.

773
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:50,555
The police are all I have.

774
01:18:53,393 --> 01:18:58,251
I think 5 is more appropriate.

775
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:02,896
Times are tough.

776
01:19:02,897 --> 01:19:07,354
The controls are increasingly stringent, what can I do?

777
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:09,339
So what now?

778
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:16,853
If you're trying to pull something I'm personally reduce your stomach.

779
01:19:16,854 --> 01:19:19,265
Hey! You got me?

780
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:22,716
You'll make tonight your work as always.

781
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:26,566
And I hope that their action skills are as sharp as his criminal energy.

782
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:28,434
I knew it.

783
01:20:28,435 --> 01:20:30,907
I knew that if someone is caught I would.

784
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:33,634
I could feel that this whole thing was about to explode.

785
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:35,350
After the latter I wanted to stop.

786
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:39,192
You know what? Whoever sits here wanted to stop now.

787
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:42,855
I can not do that.

788
01:20:42,856 --> 01:20:45,757
You can remarkably reduce his sentence.

789
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,209
If you work with us.

790
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,799
I can not handle the pressure.

791
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,928
Then, a drink for sedation. You're a doctor.

792
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,945
Medical huh?

793
01:20:52,946 --> 01:20:54,475
What do you think?

794
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:57,492
With a villa in Grünwald and a Porsche in the garage.

795
01:20:57,493 --> 01:20:58,493
Exactly.

796
01:20:58,494 --> 01:21:00,855
It's a shitty job with a payment of shit.

797
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:01,983
Hey! Calm down ok?

798
01:21:01,984 --> 01:21:03,631
Not that tone.

799
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:21,548
I have to go back to Munich immediately.

800
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:36,468
It will never be like that again.

801
01:21:36,469 --> 01:21:38,982
I do not think so.

802
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:55,598
Where have you been?

803
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:59,742
Seligmann has been in during 5 minutes.

804
01:22:59,743 --> 01:23:02,487
It can not be long until he returns to the material.

805
01:23:02,488 --> 01:23:03,488
Shit!

806
01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:05,186
Is everything okay?

807
01:23:05,971 --> 01:23:06,907
No.

808
01:23:07,432 --> 01:23:09,631
Have you talked with Katrin?

809
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:13,073
I do not know where she is.

810
01:23:13,074 --> 01:23:15,089
I'm sure she's home again.

811
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,593
Probably not.

812
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:21,091
And just from that moment you appeared here.

813
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:23,072
You do not make it just a little easier?

814
01:23:23,073 --> 01:23:23,975
Easy?

815
01:23:23,976 --> 01:23:25,839
I wonder what my wife is doing.

816
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,152
You want to know what his wife is doing, but I'll tell you one thing.

817
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:30,579
The last thing you need is a Katrin guy.

818
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:31,936
And what does she need?

819
01:23:31,937 --> 01:23:34,361
Devotion.

820
01:23:34,362 --> 01:23:37,105
Are you crazy? What is the point of that?

821
01:23:37,106 --> 01:23:42,410
First you sleep with me and then tell me how you wanna take my wedding?

822
01:23:42,411 --> 01:23:46,581
Listen, if it should be a little fucked up game, forget it!

823
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:47,943
I love Katrin.

824
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:49,824
Me too.

825
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,179
Go! Go!

826
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,748
Go, get a car.

827
01:24:01,963 --> 01:24:03,401
Come on!

828
01:24:03,402 --> 01:24:08,438
I'm counting to 10 and all must have disappeared.

829
01:24:09,777 --> 01:24:12,295
If someone does something stupid I'll shoot this guy.

830
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:26,394
C'mon, c'mon!

831
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:34,718
Put your weapon!

832
01:25:07,992 --> 01:25:12,376
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaax!

833
01:25:45,254 --> 01:25:46,765
Wait a second.

834
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,998
I thought I would never return.

835
01:25:58,066 --> 01:25:59,370
Caution.

836
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:29,955
Please, let's grow old together and fat.

837
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:57,297
How is he?

838
01:26:57,298 --> 01:26:59,283
You must have covered.

839
01:26:59,284 --> 01:27:01,727
But you did not.

840
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:03,484
Why?

841
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,305
You could not do it, right?

842
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:12,191
Damn, Siska!

843
01:27:12,192 --> 01:27:14,940
You acutally know what you did?

844
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:17,321
He could die.

845
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:24,052
When I lose it, then ...

846
01:27:27,811 --> 01:27:30,490
I would never forgive myself.

847
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:33,432
He will not die.

848
01:27:41,438 --> 01:27:44,694
I should not have allowed you to report on duty.

849
01:27:44,695 --> 01:27:46,432
You are sick.

850
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:49,835
In dangerous situations, you always fail.

851
01:27:49,836 --> 01:27:52,951
You do not belong to the police.

852
01:27:57,229 --> 01:28:00,485
I do not know where you belong.

853
01:28:03,485 --> 01:28:05,669
I thought I belonged to you.

854
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:14,015
I love Max

855
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:18,004
I can not help myself.

856
01:28:30,631 --> 01:28:33,602
You helped me.

857
01:29:44,483 --> 01:29:47,597
Max is more worse.

858
01:29:50,422 --> 01:29:51,547
What?

859
01:29:51,548 --> 01:29:55,210
They could stop the bleeding.

860
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,290
My dear son.

861
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:21,229
I am writing to you because I do not know how long I'll be able to.

862
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:26,326
The head is round so that thoughts can change direction.

863
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:31,587
With a tumor on the road was no longer possible.

864
01:30:31,588 --> 01:30:35,787
As a doctor I know what is ahead of me.

865
01:30:35,788 --> 01:30:38,117
And I'm afraid.

866
01:30:38,118 --> 01:30:45,137
Unfortunately I can not be here when you give this practice a facelift dusty.

867
01:30:45,138 --> 01:30:50,227
But I know he will be a human.

868
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:55,553
I love you like the daughter I always wanted.

869
01:30:55,554 --> 01:30:59,310
Whatever you do, the decision is yours.

870
01:30:59,311 --> 01:31:02,337
And with that right.

871
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:09,612
Speaking of which ...

872
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:11,757
Today is my birthday.

873
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,258
Forget it.

874
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:16,153
I have a headache.

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,916
Coral reef adventure

2
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,721
the south Pacific

3
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:13,227
lagoons that hint paradise

4
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:15,146
magnificent coral reefs that

5
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:21,404
light the dream in corners of minds

6
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,997
this is the world as we wish and could always be

7
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,039
in this great corner of life

8
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:01,877
thousands of colorful characters coexist

9
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,840
diversities strengthens coral reefs

10
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,258
the more species

11
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,262
the more survival systems

12
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:15,521
coral reefs be going strong for sixty million years

13
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,569
some corals wave like flowers in the breath

14
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,199
others masquerade the stones

15
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,458
but all corals are animals

16
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:34,631
this under order playgrounds are built by hard corals

17
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:39,304
which produce lime stone and turn it into homes

18
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:41,766
stack one on top of the other

19
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,227
millions of coral homes

20
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:49,486
gradually form a gigantic reef

21
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,073
how wonderful that the largest living structure

22
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:59,332
are built by tiny animals

23
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,051
coral reef protect all tropical coast

24
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:13,351
standing between islander's homes and violent seas

25
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:26,870
one may injured

26
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,917
doctors use calcium carbonate from coral

27
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,796
to mend our broken bones

28
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,214
when we were sick

29
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,008
chemical components from the reef

30
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,471
may restore our health

31
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:40,723
no place on earth

32
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:46,982
holds greater potential for medical curers

33
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:47,899
reefs

34
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,151
feeders

35
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,112
over three hundred million people

36
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:55,118
rely on fish from reefs

37
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,831
for Pacific islander like me

38
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:04,089
our coral reefs are as necessary as the air we breath

39
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,062
Russy coral a native of Fiji

40
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:21,321
has always lived close to the sea

41
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,995
for centuries

42
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,915
my ancestors were careful not to overfish

43
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,585
so our reef was healthy

44
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:32,754
but this year

45
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,090
something happened

46
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:41,349
something terrible

47
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:48,067
a blacker death set over the reef

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,577
what was killing our reef?

49
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,671
I made up my mind to find the answers

50
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:04,255
I decide to reach up to

51
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:08,595
some of my death partners around the world

52
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,514
Howard and Micheal Hall

53
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:14,312
has spent thirty years exploring and filming reefs

54
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:18,108
their underwater photography is world known

55
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,821
when Howard and Micheal got Russy's message

56
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,239
they voyaged the mountains

57
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,498
far from the reefs they loved

58
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,636
I was drawing that flight I kept wondering

59
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,306
what we could do to help Russy

60
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,641
then I realized that

61
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:43,894
our friend Richard Pile might know what to do

62
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,523
he is a marine biologist

63
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,692
across the world

64
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:52,447
red sea east Africa Maldives Philippines

65
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,244
we seeing this kind of problems showing up

66
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:56,912
in unprecedented rate

67
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:59,332
Richard showed us how coral reefs to die

68
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,087
and the alarming rate all around the world

69
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,262
ocean warming is the major cause

70
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,889
Richard urged just document coral reefs

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,223
in film for science

72
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,562
before they disappear

73
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:17,816
we knew the Max camera with a credible clarity

74
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:22,990
was the best way to do this

75
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:26,370
our mission was clear

76
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,416
bring back images of inside

77
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,004
and why Russy's reef was dying

78
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,799
we need to compare Russy's reef

79
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,844
to other reefs all across the south Pacific

80
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:40,473
starting with the largest of them all

81
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:46,732
the Great Barrier Reef

82
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,006
the prospect of diving coral reef

83
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,134
all across the south Pacific

84
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,055
was a bit like a dream come true

85
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,226
we will make hundreds of dives

86
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,812
and some of these would be deeper and more dangerous

87
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:17,149
than anything we have done before

88
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,611
it would be a most important expedition

89
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:25,870
in our thirty years' diving together

90
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,291
parts of the Great Barrier Reef

91
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:33,422
had been protected from overfishing for two decades

92
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:36,091
the first goal of this ten-month expedition

93
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:42,350
is to see how well that protection really worked

94
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,956
when I first dove here 22 years ago

95
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:00,084
these giant clams were not here

96
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,465
they had been fished up by commercial fishmen

97
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:07,385
today we have seen 12 giant clams

98
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:08,512
that's a great sign

99
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:14,520
that means this reef spells its back

100
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:17,441
a local marine biologist named Tracy Medway

101
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:21,697
let us to the giant potatocut

102
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,615
they were called potato cut

103
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,077
because they had these patchy potato shape

104
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:31,336
marking on the sides

105
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,255
throughout most of the Pacific

106
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:36,425
the really large fish had been wiped up by fish men

107
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:42,684
under the laws that protect them

108
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:51,697
this vegetarian protect the reef

109
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,162
neighboring a wave seaweeds that smudged the

110
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,874
if too many of this kind of fish are removed

111
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,628
corals will die

112
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,759
that's why overfishing destroy reefs

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,427
we often realized

114
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:09,555
how each species benefits each other

115
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:14,603
until one of them disappeared

116
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,899
just as the fish protect the reef

117
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,779
the coral offers homes and hiding place for the fish

118
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,990
anything from a simple shark

119
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:29,249
to a custom dream home

120
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:47,107
gobies often share a home with shrimp

121
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,611
whenever he ventures out of the burrow

122
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:53,783
the shrimp keeps at least one antenna on the goby

123
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,204
the goby get a unpackable burrow to live in

124
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,539
without lifting a fin

125
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:02,504
and the very near sited shrimp gets a bodyguard

126
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,047
with flicked its tale

127
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,306
the goby warns the shrimp of approaching foes

128
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,434
this hundred year old coral

129
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,811
makes a nice dinner's office

130
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,024
for potatocut

131
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,068
a small fish

132
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,070
a clean arrester

133
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,156
swims right into the coral's mouth

134
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:58,415
to feed and parasites

135
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,502
the coral's gets grunt

136
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,506
and arrester gets dinner

137
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:09,055
partnerships like this seem to require mutual trust

138
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:13,603
lots of trust

139
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:16,106
Cart Hollerway a coral researcher

140
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:22,365
joined Michael to study interest species communication

141
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,452
I was afraid I was going to heaven

142
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,038
maybe swollen with

143
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,248
but I didn't

144
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,507
it just chin and a little bit

145
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,762
I was studying animal behavior for so many years

146
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:08,888
this was

147
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,806
this was different

148
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,266
this was a chance for meet it

149
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:16,356
actually be part of it

150
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,571
cooperation between species sustained lives here

151
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:24,326
but sometimes it is almost invisible

152
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,913
the coral's most important partners

153
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,333
are tiny microscope alga

154
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:35,341
that actually live inside the coral and most tissues

155
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:38,680
this help alga use sunlight to produce sugar

156
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,098
the primary food source

157
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,229
that give coral the energy to build reefs

158
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,275
most corals cannot survive without helper alga

159
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,652
but worldwide

160
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,655
abnormally warm seawater

161
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:55,535
threaten this partnership

162
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,622
time-up photography can show us how

163
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,249
and just one week

164
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:05,508
that changed two centigrade drives the alga out

165
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:08,012
without its main food source

166
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:13,478
the coral bleaches as ghostly white

167
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,313
if the alga don't return

168
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:21,572
the corals starves

169
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,535
here in Australia we went to some places that

170
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:26,453
we have been to 22 years before

171
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,914
and we are surprise to see that

172
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:34,173
some of the reefs so damaged by ocean warming

173
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,555
part Australian survey give us a baseline

174
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,018
for understanding what was going wrong

175
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,019
at Russy's reefs

176
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,278
2000 miles away in Fiji

177
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,706
when we got to Fuji

178
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:33,965
it didn't take five minutes to reconnect with Russy

179
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:40,098
Howard makes me smile again

180
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,518
Micheal and I were eager to help Russy

181
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,519
but first

182
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:49,778
we have to pay our respect to local tradition

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,535
before outsiders can direct my home island

184
00:14:54,576 --> 00:15:00,459
the elders must grant permission

185
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:04,674
my people have always limited fishing

186
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,802
this tradition of reef conservation

187
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:09,096
has worked well for centuries

188
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,311
till now

189
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:16,065
first I wanted Howard to see village reef

190
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:22,323
as it used to be

191
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:33,255
the reef looks great with plenty of small fish

192
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:35,550
but we didn't see many big fish

193
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:38,054
as we did in Australia

194
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:44,104
and that worried me

195
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,732
but time had come

196
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:52,991
I took Howard and Michael further down the reef

197
00:15:56,162 --> 00:16:02,379
I wonder where all the animals gone

198
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,426
these reefs are dying

199
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:12,685
and all just makes me very sad

200
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:17,233
seeing so much of these reef destroyed

201
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,818
we realized that

202
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,407
Russy's reef may be what all coral reefs look like

203
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:28,249
in thirty years

204
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,045
our reef was to be home of so many creatures

205
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:38,304
but now they almost all gone

206
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,061
after seen all these destruction though

207
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:49,319
I saw an octopus

208
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:52,157
octopus is made like a tent with the body

209
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:54,076
they put up their eight arms and

210
00:16:54,117 --> 00:17:00,335
actually traps shrimps and crabs live on the reef

211
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,178
here octopus figure out

212
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:10,640
how to survive

213
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:16,899
not many reef to do that

214
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,241
for islander survive by fishing

215
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:26,455
the death of the reef is really hit us hard

216
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:32,713
especially when you have children to feed

217
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:39,680
but what kills Russy's reef?

218
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:44,187
Foreign fishing fleets have overfished this water

219
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,481
and thermometer tells us that

220
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:50,946
the ocean is two degrees warmer than normal

221
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:54,994
I found more bleached coral and no big fish

222
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,455
but I had a hunch that

223
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:58,290
ocean warming and overfishing

224
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:04,549
were not the only problems

225
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,391
ten mile inland

226
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,102
when tropical rain forest were cut down

227
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:19,361
the river turn muddy with silt

228
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,788
two rivers merged

229
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,167
one with logging upstream

230
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,087
one without

231
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:38,346
there was only place for all that settlement to go

232
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:40,849
at the mouth of the river

233
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:41,892
silt block the sun light

234
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,357
that the coral needs to growth

235
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,025
Russy's reef had been hit

236
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:51,906
by a combination of stresses

237
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:56,997
ocean warming overfishing and siltation

238
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,874
corals may fight off one threat

239
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:03,590
but three at once proved too much

240
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,925
now I understand the problem better

241
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,053
but what could I do

242
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,723
Howard thought a healthier reef

243
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:12,143
might give us some answers

244
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,399
we set quest to another island

245
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,194
there we joined up with John Michealgusto

246
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:23,158
who is the son of the legendary explorer

247
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,703
John Michealgusto comes to Fuji every year

248
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,164
to help marine biologists

249
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:32,546
like marine's world read records

250
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:35,717
we guild Howard and Michael to a nearby reef

251
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,054
where siltation is not a problem

252
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:42,435
thanks to mangrove trees

253
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,647
their roots traps the silt

254
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:50,196
protecting the reefs

255
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:52,533
many fish sees mangroves as nursery

256
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:58,791
to protect the young

257
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,296
my fellow Fijians

258
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:05,300
have set aside this beneficial as mangroves

259
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,636
as part of marine preserve

260
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,515
making the reef offshore a wonder land

261
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,774
healthy beautiful and strong

262
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:24,660
this is the way I want my reef to be

263
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:30,001
tropical coral reefs are found worldwide

264
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:36,260
Fuji is the soft coral capital of the world

265
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,662
corals are beautiful

266
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:23,583
but they are also beneficial

267
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,668
chemical components from coral reefs

268
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:27,421
have been reproduced in the lab

269
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,842
to provide relief from pain

270
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,385
ease child birth

271
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:36,768
and even extend the life of AIDS patients

272
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,355
corals share their foods

273
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:45,614
in fact many of them share the same stomach

274
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,431
when the current fix up speed

275
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:06,100
time lap photographs shows

276
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:09,730
how these soft corals inflate like balloons

277
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:15,988
to trap passing animals

278
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:20,037
on a healthy reef like this

279
00:22:20,078 --> 00:22:26,295
you see so many different creatures

280
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,469
we preferred not to approach these animals

281
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,975
it's better of they come to us

282
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:37,727
this distant cousin of the cobra

283
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,357
can kill a person in a matter of minutes

284
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,571
but they rarely bite humans

285
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:50,829
Michael is counting on that

286
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,713
we learned a lot of our reef from its animals

287
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:59,048
and so do the children

288
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:05,307
there is more to the reef than meets the eyes

289
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:33,555
observation is the first step in science

290
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,309
who would notice

291
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,438
that yellow fish got their tiny eggs

292
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:42,651
before they hatch

293
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:45,363
all that the sea cucumber eat the waste

294
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:51,621
leaving the reef clean up for all

295
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:57,129
some of the finest marine biologists are Fijians

296
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:03,388
we could expect scientists mixed

297
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,008
we've learned that we don't inherit the earth

298
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,761
from our parents

299
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:36,977
we borrow it from our children

300
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:41,149
children love this spot fish they've never seen before

301
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,820
that same discovery drives many scientist

302
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:50,787
like Richard Pile

303
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:54,292
Richard Pile calls himself a fishman

304
00:24:54,334 --> 00:25:00,009
he study fish on the deepest parts of coral reefs

305
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,386
the deeper down we go on the coral reef

306
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:03,471
the less we know

307
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:07,645
I want to find out who lives there

308
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,814
you can't get a true picture of coral reef

309
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,192
if you only look at part of it

310
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,862
but deep dives could be really dangerous

311
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:17,199
even using a special breathing devises

312
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,703
we could still get a fatal disease

313
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:24,876
called "the bangs"

314
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,671
we nearly lost Howard on a deep dive

315
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:28,965
only two months ago

316
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,928
ha had a bad case of "the bangs"

317
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,349
it could have killed him

318
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,644
to stop the progression of the illness

319
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,856
I began breathing pure oxygen

320
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:41,733
but it didn't seen to help

321
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:45,739
I was losing all the feelings in my right legs

322
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,992
one of the terrify moment for me

323
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:51,872
was actually seeing him stumble

324
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:55,461
I just thought it can't be happening

325
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:58,047
Michael rushed Howard to the hospital

326
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,718
hoping the specially pressurized chamber

327
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,888
might hold the illness

328
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,603
and save his life

329
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,313
thank god for the communication system

330
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:15,571
because at least then I could talk to him

331
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:18,826
Howard survived

332
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,746
but his closest call was on my mind that

333
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:26,629
we prepare for the dive to the 350 feet

334
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:29,215
the next day on the deep dive

335
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:31,302
Howard and Richard would face pressures

336
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:34,557
nearly 12 times greater than the normal

337
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:37,144
but they are expert divers

338
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:39,730
and there is much to learn by exploring regions

339
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:45,989
where so little was known

340
00:26:57,172 --> 00:27:00,384
support divers attached safety tanks to a life line

341
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:06,642
every 50 feet

342
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:35,933
as we descent

343
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:38,646
too much oxygen is bad

344
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,857
too little is worse

345
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:47,116
both can kill you

346
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,210
the safety divers go down as far as he can and stop

347
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:56,420
after that

348
00:27:56,462 --> 00:28:02,679
we are on our own

349
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,059
as we drop down the reef wall

350
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,104
it gets darker and colder

351
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:13,403
and in a way we are going back in time

352
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:14,905
at 200 feet

353
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:18,034
we pass lime stone deposited the lay down

354
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:20,287
twenty thousand years ago

355
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:26,546
back when this was the top of the reef

356
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:32,805
at 350 feet

357
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:37,436
we entered the twilight zones

358
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:39,689
it's sort of spooky but wonderful

359
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,233
to look around the reef that

360
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:47,533
no one has ever lay eyes on for

361
00:28:56,754 --> 00:29:02,972
it's starting to get interesting

362
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:10,398
it's that we could see fan corals and weed corals

363
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:16,072
this community definitely appeared to be thriving

364
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:18,744
in his quest to find out what lives down here

365
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:22,456
Richard can only bring a few back to the surface

366
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:28,715
to be documented for science

367
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:31,678
looking around I see at least a dozen of new species

368
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,722
I have never seen before

369
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:39,981
I doubt that anyone has seen them before

370
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:44,946
scientists like Richard

371
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,865
are mapping the web of life that

372
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:49,036
we are all part of

373
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:51,497
each new fish Richard finds

374
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,501
told millions of years of genetic engineering

375
00:29:54,543 --> 00:30:00,759
for medical research

376
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,647
then the intense water pressure

377
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:11,524
caused the primary camera

378
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:15,530
to no function

379
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:20,412
I was glad that Howard coordinate into the dive

380
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:21,998
we hope that Howard's images

381
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,042
would let scientist explore reefs

382
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:28,966
that they might never be able to dive on the rope

383
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,969
it's not everyday you can witness

384
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,140
that a discovery of a new species of fish

385
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:35,933
you see the red one with the long tale

386
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:36,977
that's what I was really excited

387
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,188
that's definitely live

388
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:45,447
oh I see those all the time

389
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:09,898
until quite recently

390
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:12,734
the deep coral reef was

391
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:15,906
the big dark boy on the map of life

392
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:17,325
but each new discovery

393
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:21,121
leads us to the new connection

394
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:23,875
this may seen like just some magnificent red fish

395
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,627
but it's very important piece

396
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,505
to the biodiversity puzzle

397
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,967
as soon as I saw I knew it's something different

398
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:35,600
the months of hard work in Fiji paid off

399
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:37,436
Russy have seen first time

400
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,108
how corals can thrive when reefs are protected

401
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,615
he is now ready to return to his home island

402
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,409
my fellow Fijians have shown me

403
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:50,705
how to set up a marine preserve

404
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:52,373
protect the mangroves

405
00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:55,837
and even cut logging operations

406
00:31:55,878 --> 00:32:00,343
I really want to get started

407
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,054
here in Fiji we have seen some amazing reefs

408
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:06,309
but we have also seen a lot of coral damages

409
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,771
the siltation we saw in Russy's reef

410
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:11,566
let us to a next question

411
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,068
is closeness to shore

412
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:19,327
a major risk factor for corals?

413
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,372
French Polynesia is a perfect place

414
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:27,631
for answering this question

415
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:46,448
in French Polynesia

416
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,242
Howard and Michael started with

417
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:51,664
the heavily populated islands of Tahiti and Maria

418
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:55,711
where the reefs are close to shore

419
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:58,590
but with only six weeks left in the whole expedition

420
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:04,849
Howard had to get the big picture fast

421
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:16,532
I’m used to hang gliders

422
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:19,954
I’m used to fly around like this

423
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:22,332
but there is still something not quite right

424
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:28,591
about the engine that was fit in my back pack

425
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:37,686
Maria is sort of like Russy's island

426
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,481
the coral here is very sensitive

427
00:33:39,522 --> 00:33:41,359
to siltation and pollution

428
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,822
because the corals are great close to the shore

429
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:49,161
after checking out the north side of Maria

430
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:55,419
we crossed the mountain to survey the south coast

431
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,845
even near towns

432
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:35,309
we didn't spot much reef damages

433
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,479
coastal development put reef in jeopardy

434
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,859
siltation pollution and the lose of mangroves

435
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,446
are all serious risks

436
00:34:44,488 --> 00:34:46,324
but resource like this proved that

437
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:49,244
respecting the environment is a good business

438
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:55,503
because tourists avoided damaged reefs

439
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,141
our flight over Maria

440
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,144
just gave us a first impression

441
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,730
so was time running out

442
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:11,316
I turned to recheck board survey boat

443
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,653
the Quicksilver Crossing

444
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:18,118
reef check has over 4000 sport divers in 60 countries

445
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,290
the health of coral reef

446
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,959
we ask three check voluntaries

447
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,754
to check the coral damage here in Maria

448
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,340
to find out if the reefs close to shore

449
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:34,598
are the most severely damaged

450
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,362
from the air

451
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:47,409
it's clear how these volcano islands formed

452
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:53,667
and how coral reefs formed around them

453
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,798
the steepest youngest islands Tahiti and Maria

454
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,926
stands tall

455
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:03,347
these islands have not eroded and subsided much

456
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:09,647
so the coral reefs ringing them is not far offshore

457
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,660
the volcano has subsided and eroded somewhat

458
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:24,627
and the reefs are farther from shore

459
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:25,879
the final stage

460
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,385
is this flat and the island called and atop

461
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:34,140
the volcano has completely subsided back into the sea

462
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:40,399
leaving a ring coral which one circled a top mountain

463
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:46,532
the team headed for the second largest in the world

464
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,159
Rangeroa

465
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:54,418
to survey the remotest reef in French Polynesia

466
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,088
10 years ago

467
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,385
a cyclone wiped out most Rangeroa's coral

468
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,095
but storms are natural events

469
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,766
and coral reef still recovered from them

470
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:09,856
as long as human impacts don't interfere

471
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:16,115
here the coral seems small but healthy

472
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,870
right away we saw two male fish

473
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:23,793
fighting over territory

474
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:30,093
this was a sign of large thriving fish population

475
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:34,766
but why haven't we seen the huge sharks

476
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:40,566
in great reef shores Rangeroa so famous for

477
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:44,321
their absence is not necessarily a danger sign for corals

478
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:48,243
but it could single and balance the whole reef eco system

479
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:54,335
so finding the shark became our main goal

480
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:56,880
we search the shark's favorite hangouts

481
00:37:56,921 --> 00:38:03,139
but they didn't see to be home

482
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,269
we use caution because

483
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,897
one thing you don't want to do

484
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:15,155
is catch a great reef shark by surprise

485
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,828
if the shark louse around the water

486
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:21,455
the quickest way to spot them

487
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,669
is from the outer light

488
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,836
throughout the Pacific

489
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,340
whole population of sharks had been wiped out

490
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:30,510
by commercial fishermen

491
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:33,222
great reef shark are especially vulnerable

492
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:36,936
and that's what worry me

493
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:39,940
the airy search for sharks turns out nothing

494
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,734
and we are running out of time

495
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:43,987
but there is one last place to look

496
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:46,199
to Puta Pass

497
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,457
here the current just screams

498
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:28,216
hundreds of starve sharks are hang out

499
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:30,927
like street gang in the canyon

500
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,722
we were being swept into them

501
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:38,981
and there is nothing we can do about it

502
00:39:57,297 --> 00:40:00,302
could they be mating

503
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,678
this is when you try very hard

504
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,183
not to look like a shark

505
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:11,442
I have two friends badly bitten by great reef sharks

506
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,987
the most social of all sharks

507
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:20,246
graze tender swimming tight groups

508
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,595
I’ve been diving for 35 years

509
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:35,225
but I’ve never seen the life like this

510
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,645
there must be 300 sharks in this school

511
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:42,902
and that's a healthy number

512
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:45,364
this big school doesn't close the book

513
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:47,617
but it is a favorable sign

514
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:53,876
for the health of this reef ego-system

515
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,547
we party with the sharks for nearly an hour

516
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,300
knowing that on our way home

517
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:00,761
we have a current on our backs

518
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:07,019
so we can go with the float

519
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:04,641
for ten exhausting but magical months

520
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:05,935
Michael and I explored

521
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:11,484
some of the most magnificent coral reefs on earth

522
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:12,444
during that time

523
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:18,703
our concern for coral grew into a share passion

524
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,836
my people look at the reef

525
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,131
and we don't want to believe such a place

526
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:31,303
could be gone forever

527
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:33,305
my friends Howard and Michael

528
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:39,356
have given me new tools to heal my village reef

529
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:44,154
Howard's love to the reefs nearly cost his life

530
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:46,407
but after making more than 500 dives

531
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:50,204
we came back with some really powerful images

532
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:51,999
one image I can't get out of my mind

533
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,879
is that alone octopus crawling to the rubble

534
00:42:55,921 --> 00:43:02,138
soon it may not have a home

535
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,475
no one set out to kill a beautiful thing

536
00:43:05,518 --> 00:43:07,186
but when a reef dies

537
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:11,818
billions of living things die

538
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:14,697
corals appears to be dying faster than normal

539
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:20,038
and the trend is rapidly accelerating

540
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,958
most living coral reefs as we know today

541
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,422
could be gone in 30 years

542
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,132
if that happens

543
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:34,390
then something inside of me will die too

544
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:41,025
after all the coral reefs have given to us

545
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:44,613
more and more people are now returning the favor

546
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,618
their supporting leaders who fight global warming

547
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,080
joining teams like "Reef Check"

548
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:54,543
getting involved

549
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:56,129
we may have great potential

550
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,340
of finding new medicines on

551
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,303
coral reefs than any other environment on earth

552
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:07,561
to save them is really saving ourselves

553
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:21,248
it take a long long time to build a coral reef

554
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:23,751
step by step

555
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,463
the reef survive on partnerships

556
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:28,466
and the most important partners

557
00:44:28,508 --> 00:44:34,724
that the corals have are you and I

558
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,217
what we must to do is

559
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:00,969
encourage a sea change in attitude

560
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:02,638
one that acknowledges

561
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,183
we are a part of the living world

562
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:07,481
not apart from it

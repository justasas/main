I'm hoping to sell them.

392
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:36,410
I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever.

394
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:41,456
I mean, part of my profession

It's not all for art's sake, you know.

396
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,963
I know, but why do you take pictures
of women this way?

397
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,217
I like to make them look beautiful.

398
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,261
No. I think it's more
to preserve them.

399
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,847
You see, the beauty
is already in the model.

400
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,099
Frank, don't be silly.

401
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,685

Right.

[Chuckles] So I should know
what I'm doing, shouldn't I?

403
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:09,192
I know, but to me, you know,
things change, people die.

404
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:12,529
But in a painting or a picture,
they're yours forever.

405
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,200
There's no way you can
possess someone forever,

406
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,286
even in a photograph.

407
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,079
There's no way.

408
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:25,584
Well, I was noticing this picture
of this old lady here.

409
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,546
At one point in her life,
she was someone's sister,

410
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,132
someone's wife, someone's mother.

411
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,343
And when the photographer took her picture,
he had her the way he wanted her.

412
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,387
She could never leave him.

413
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,600
She couldn't grow old,
and she couldn't die.

414
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,852
Tell me, Frank.
What do you do for a living?

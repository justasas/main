ride him around for a few hours.

Here, keep this in the evidence locker.

712
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,375
I'll take care of it.

713
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,418
Now turn around
and walk out of here naturally.

714
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:13,837
Naturally.

715
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,675
Hey! How you doing, fart-head?

716
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:21,510
Mr. Big Shot with the cops, huh?

717
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:24,429
Don't you morons have anything else to do?

718
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:28,348
What did you do that for?

719
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,182
'Cause you called me a moron.

720
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:33,184
So throwing your jacket
on the ground makes you smarter?

721
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:35,560
This kid's making me nuts.

722
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:40,438
Hey, guys. I can't kid around anymore.

723
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:42,481
I'm watching my grandma's car.

724
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:45,608
Oh! So you're here with Grandma?

725
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:46,775
Mmm-hmm.

726
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,235
Oh, so this is Grandmommy's car, huh?

727
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,236
Guys, please.

728
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:53,529
Bust me up, but not the car. Please.

729
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:55,697
You mean, don't do this?

730
00:43:57,824 --> 00:43:59,826
That's exactly what I mean.

731
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:00,993
Or this?

732
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,452
Oh, too bad.

733
00:44:03,327 --> 00:44:04,369
McNALLY: My turn.

734
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:07,454
This is your kiss goodbye.

735
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:15,711
(EXCLAIMING)

736
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:17,378
What are you doing?

737
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:18,878
Get out of here, boy.

738
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,879
I'll break your face when I get you!

739
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,254
Punks that you are!

740
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:24,964
We'll get you, you stupid little brats!

741
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,049
Let's get back in the car.
Come on, let's go.

742
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,010
Ah, look at this. Oh, man!

743
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:32,511
These punks got no respect nowadays.
Get in the car.

744
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:36,848
Hi, Grandma.

745
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:40,226
It finally caught up with you.

746
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:41,518
What did?

747
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:44,186
The new school counselor
is here to see you.

748
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:47,438
I hope you're happy.
Just answer everything.

749
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,855
Truthfully.

750
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,945
There you are. Hi, Devon.

751
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,237
Hi.

752
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,073
You recognize me?

753
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,449
No.

754
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:08,703
I'm Mr. Goodman,
the new counselor from school.

755
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:13,624
You haven't seen me around school, huh?

756
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,500
No.

757
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,919
Well, let's sit down.

758
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:21,421
So...

759
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:23,756
You know why I'm here?

760
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:25,966
Missing school today?

761
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,424
Exactly.

762
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:29,597
Now, your grandmother
tells me that you've been

763
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:32,344
helping the police find
a very dangerous man.

764
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:34,971
You won't believe the dirtbags we're...

765
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:41,936
Hello? Devon?

766
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,103
You were saying?

767
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:50,317
I said I didn't see him.
I didn't see the bad guy's face.

768
00:45:51,276 --> 00:45:53,778
That's good. I mean, that's bad.

769
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:56,947
Probably, the police are disappointed.

770
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,698
Oh, very disappointed.

771
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:01,450
And mad, too, because I wasted their time.

772
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:02,950
(SCOFFS)

773
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,243
I'm afraid we're out of cream.

774
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:08,120
Oh, gee. You know what?

775
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:11,122
I'm gonna take a rain check on this
because I've got...

776
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,725
Ooh. I think I will take one of these.

777
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:14,832
I've got a few stops I have to make.

778
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:18,793
Is everything all right?

779
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:20,460
Oh!

780
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:22,503
I'm very pleased with Devon.

781
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:24,545
As a matter of fact,

782
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:27,547
Devon's a good boy.

783
00:46:35,846 --> 00:46:37,472
You have a good day.

784
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,266
(SHOUTING) Grandma!

785
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:46,979
Hey, mister.

786
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,188
(WHISPERS) Damn.

787
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,480
Come here.

788
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:52,023
What? Excuse me, madam? Come here?

789
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:58,028
I overheard your conversation.
That woman can't control...

790
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,988
Get your arm off me, madam,
or I'll put you in a home.

791
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,081
NICK: I cannot do my job with a kid around.
RUBIO: Nick!

792
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,040
- I do not like kids.
- Nick!

793
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,958
Why does he have to stay in my house?

794
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,709
Why can't he stay with somebody else?

795
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,503
Believe me, you wouldn't even be
my second choice for him to stay with,

796
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:21,837
but the kid is comfortable with you.
Come on.

797
00:47:21,878 --> 00:47:24,755
How long can it last? Give me a break.

798
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:30,552
Besides, you have such
a lovely rapport with him.

799
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:36,891
Let's go.

800
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:42,979
You're going to listen to Mr.
McKenna, right?

801
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,313
- Detective McKenna.
- Detective McKenna.

802
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,024
Look at me. Devon, look at me.

803
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:54,153
You won't leave here without him, right?

804
00:47:54,194 --> 00:47:55,737
Grandma, he's got a gun.

805
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,404
I'm sure he has.

806
00:47:58,113 --> 00:48:01,741
And you won't leave him here
and go around playing cowboys and Indians.

807
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:04,034
Lady, the next time somebody
breaks into your apartment,

808
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:07,495
why don't you call the bunkhouse
and ask for a cowboy?

809
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,972
I'm sure they'd come a lot faster than you.

810
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:12,140
(LOUDLY) I've been busting
my chops all my life...

811
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,516
Has anybody seen <i>Barnyard Cop?</i>

812
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,975
What?

813
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:18,643
He always asks his partner,
"What comes after 'L'?"

814
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:20,394
I don't know.

815
00:48:20,477 --> 00:48:22,020
Bow. Don't you get it?

816
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:24,146
- Elbow!
- (COUGHING)

817
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:32,695
You hit me one more time with your elbow,
I'm gonna rip it off and wave it at you.

818
00:48:33,028 --> 00:48:35,697
You keep pulling that attitude
with my grandson...

819
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,657
I don't have an attitude, lady.
I'm just a police officer.

820
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,616
I do not have an attitude.

821
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:44,494
Come here.

822
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:48,705
Take care of yourself, Devon.

823
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:49,955
I will.

824
00:48:57,003 --> 00:48:59,296
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

825
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:32,787
- Hey, Nick.
- Mmm-hmm?

826
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,163
Is a hundred grand the same as 100,000?

827
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:36,747
Yeah. Why?

828
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:41,668
The guy in the warehouse said it.
"A hundred grand."

829
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:48,382
NICK: I heard it was more like
a hundred million.

830
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:52,510
- Wait.
- Hmm?

831
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:54,260
Swords.

832
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:55,427
What swords?

833
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,011
Come on. It's fun.

834
00:49:57,052 --> 00:49:59,137
My friend Raymond can piss eight feet.

835
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:01,889
Well, Raymond's my new hero.
Just watch what you're doing.

836
00:50:01,972 --> 00:50:03,473
Come on, this will be...

837
00:50:03,556 --> 00:50:04,890
(URINATING)

838
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:12,063
Sorry.

839
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:20,237
Good night, kid.

840
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,405
Hey, Nick.

841
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:23,906
Yeah?

842
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:26,575
Aren't you gonna read me a story?

843
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:28,075
You want to be a police officer,

844
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,076
you gotta get your batteries
recharged, all right?

845
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:33,411
And besides, you're eight years old.
I'm not going to read to you.

846
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:35,579
Don't you know anything about kids?

847
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:36,954
It relaxes us.

848
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:04,313
Once upon a time,

849
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,940
"Randy Milligan was released
from the Kansas City Hospital

"after he ran into second baseman,

Give me a break. It's a story.

Actually, the doctors

Boss, these are beautiful.

867
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,372
What did you find out, Chu?

868
00:53:01,455 --> 00:53:03,039
Sir, the kid is with McKenna.

00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,212
Why?

871
00:53:11,587 --> 00:53:12,879
Because I'm boiling.

872
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,885
Are you gentlemen capable
of doing anything right?

873
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:21,218
Absolutely.

874
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,434
With McKenna, huh?

875
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:32,979
Erase them like a bad grade.

876
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,856
You got it, boss.

877
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:40,235

878

(PANTING)

879
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:34,997
I just wanted a glass of milk.

881
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:48,508
So you're dumping the kid?

882
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:52,803
I gave him to McPhail.
McPhail already has some kids, all right?

883
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:54,095
I'm not used to this kind of stuff.

884
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:55,303
What kind of stuff?

885
00:54:55,344 --> 00:54:58,180
Look, I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm not a babysitter.

886
00:54:58,263 --> 00:55:00,515
I have a routine. I have a routine to do.

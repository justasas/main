1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,832
Ten days ago, a woman was killed
in strange circumstances

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:14,457
My blood will be shed.
And many will die along with me.

3
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:19,415
- What does Special Branch say?
- Raben was their squad leader.

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,749
- There wasn't anyone called Perk.
- Perk...

5
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,540
Put the gun down.

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:31,040
- I had to shoot.
- Strange was in Special Forces.

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,749
I think he was an officer.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,332
We're wasting time.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,707
He has a tattoo on his shoulder.

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:43,957
- He couldn't know about it.
- Was he with you during the murders?

11
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:49,290
- You and Jonas are my world.
- I'm seeing Søgaard.

12
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,999
You never told me
about that message.

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:58,540
Special Forces were only 150km
from Raben's group.

14
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:04,582
Søgaard isn't the problem. Did you
help Raben evade Special Branch?

15
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:09,957
You've been in office seven days.
God created the Earth in seven days.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:14,540
Unlike him, you're destroying it,
so you have to step down.

17
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:20,374
- We can't give up.
- What was my predecessor doing?

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,332
- And you slept with him!
- Check the dates on the reports.

19
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,832
The Prime Minister
was preparing extra funding

20
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,624
for our effort in Afghanistan.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,790
Tighten up the terrorism package
and the wrong people will suffer.

22
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,957
According to military records,
the man you pointed out

23
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,124
wasn't in Afghanistan at the time.

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,415
- I'm sorry.
- It was Raben's fault they died.

25
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:53,207
Sebastian sent a video diary home.

26
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,707
Raben sees the Taliban everywhere.
All he thinks of is killing.

27
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,165
- It doesn't matter.
- There couldn't have been a Perk.

28
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,749
His big brother is in Afghanistan.
They found this.

29
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,040
You have 36 hours.

30
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,999
THE KILLING

31
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,124
The drama around the Minister of Justice
took a new turn

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,374
when the passing of the terrorism
package was postponed.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,040
The Prime Minister has made
no comment, but sources say

34
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:31,249
that the Minister of Justice
was stepping down.

35
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:37,499
However, he has called party
leaders to an emergency meeting.

36
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:42,415
No comment,
but I'm still a Minister. Goodbye.

37
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,249
Were we to overthrow
the Government?

38
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,290
Is everyone coming?

39
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:55,374
Get hold of the others. Tell Plough
I want an update from the police.

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,207
Tell them we can't spin our way out
of this. It's the worst scandal ever.

41
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:06,332
- I can't believe it!
- You've done the right thing.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,665
I hope so. Get back to me
when the meeting is over.

43
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,374
I said I'm on my way.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,332
I want to talk to you about
the agenda you sent the group.

45
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,499
It sounds like
you're out to get the Prime Minister.

46
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,915
I am. You and Karina said
to be prepared to go all the way.

47
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,207
But not on such shaky grounds.

48
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:42,124
Every time he went straight
to the Minister of Defense.

49
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,374
If everything points
to the Minister of Defense...

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,790
If the Prime Minister is screwing us over,
people have to know.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,457
- What did the police say?
- Nothing new from Raben.

52
00:03:55,583 --> 00:04:00,957
Last night they got an investigative trip
to Helmand cleared.

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:06,665
I don't know what it's about, and
neither did the Deputy Commissioner.

54
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:14,374
Keep me informed about that.
And get someone to move these chairs.

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,207
I just talked to Gitta Spalding.
The meeting might not be held.

56
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,415
Where is everybody?

57
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,374
The Prime Minister
hasn't said he'd come.

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,249
Then get hold of him!
The meeting is about him.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,332
As I just told the Minister

60
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:46,540
calling a meeting at such short
notice is completely inexcusable.

61
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:51,957
We'll hold the meeting. I have an item
for the agenda. Have a seat.

62
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,665
Let's hear what Thomas
has to say in his defense.

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,999
Talk to everyone who's been
in contact with Frederik Holst

64
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:07,957
while he was home on leave.
Check his phone records, etc.

65
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,582
Track his movements
from day to day.

66
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:15,582
Where was he
at the time of the murders?

67
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,124
The Ministry called
asking for an explanation

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,540
for a trip to Afghanistan.

69
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:34,832
We had to act quickly. But Strange
has been cleared, and Lund found...

70
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,749
I don't give a shit about
Lund and Strange right now.

71
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,665
We found out that a suspect
had been to Afghanistan.

72
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,790
- Why wasn't I informed?
- Frederik Holst.

73
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,749
A doctor at ISAF's hospital
in Lashkar Gah.

74
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:59,207
- And brother of one of the dead men.
- You know this has to go through me.

75
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,749
- I don't understand why...
- Because you'd have said no!

76
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:07,499
You would have had to push
papers around, and I couldn't wait.

77
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,624
We're pretty sure he's our man.

78
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:17,957
At any rate, it's too late now.
They've already left.

79
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,582
The Ministry of Justice
wants an update.

80
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,374
Frederik Holst...

81
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,790
- What's your relationship to him?
- None. He's not important.

82
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,624
Just tell me what you know.

83
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,249
How's it going?

84
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,874
He's sticking to his old story.

85
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:03,874
I talked to the prison. Frederik Holst
wanted to visit you there.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,707
Five times.
You refused to see him every time.

87
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,790
I want to see my wife.

88
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:19,457
We found several letters in his home
that were addressed to you.

89
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:24,374
You returned them.
He wanted to express his anger

90
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,332
about your responsibility
for his brother's death.

91
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,082
- Ask him yourself.
- We plan to.

92
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:39,374
- It's in your interest to help us.
- I have.

93
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:46,540
An officer executed that family
and killed the others.

94
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:51,915
You claim it was one of our Chief
Inspectors, but he wasn't there.

95
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:58,957
- I want to talk to my wife.
- Reconsider your testimony.

96
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,165
As it is, it won't do you any good
as we move forward.

97
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,457
Talk to Colonel Jarnvig.
He believes me.

98
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:13,124
He's being questioned by the military
because he helped you get away.

99
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,999
Your preliminary hearing
is tomorrow.

100
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,457
Why did Jarnvig check
the old messages?

101
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:31,415
I don't know.
He didn't seem to be himself.

102
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,915
- Just a minute.
- Wait while I talk to Søgaard.

103
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,999
Hi.

104
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,832
- Isn't he back yet?
- No.

105
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,207
Your father has been taken in
for questioning.

106
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:54,249
He talked to Jens at the ball and
helped him evade Special Branch.

107
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,624
But that's nonsense.
We were there.

108
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,790
They were seen.
Someone told General Arild.

109
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,707
- Who?
- I don't know. Your father confessed.

110
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,499
Your father doesn't seem
to be himself.

111
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,749
Tonight he accused me
of various things.

112
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,374
- He's preoccupied by the murders.
- What did he accuse you of?

113
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:28,957
Of concealing radio messages
from Special Forces.

114
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,832
It was as if he believed
all the things Jens made up.

115
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:39,874
He'll be held accountable,
but I'll do what I can to help him.

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,665
- Did he suddenly believe Jens?
- Yes, but it seemed far-fetched.

117
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,832
- But what about you?
- I want to see my father.

118
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,957
If you hear anything,
let me know right away.

119
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,374
Louise, you don't think
I'm involved, do you?

120
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,082
No. Why?

121
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:21,582
For two months, the Minister
did nothing about the hand

122
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:27,082
and the suspected killing of civilians,
which I find incredible.

123
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,332
However, that allowed
the Prime Minister enough time

124
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:36,124
to get the deployment of 200 troops
passed in Parliament.

125
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,207
The investigation just took
longer than expected.

126
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,957
How can we believe you?
You should have spoken up long ago.

127
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:52,249
Instead, five people are dead,
and we've wasted time on scare tactics.

128
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:59,165
We have to get to the bottom of this,
even if it's within our own ranks.

129
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,957
You keep carping on the same thing...

130
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,082
...and now you're smearing
the Prime Minister.

131
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:11,249
The People's Party would also like the
Prime Minister's responsibility assessed.

132
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,374
There's no proof.

133
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,249
Let's see, if there's any proof.
If I messed up, I will step down.

134
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:24,040
You have stepped down. I'll be glad
to repeat that in front of witnesses.

135
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,457
Please tell Thomas
what this meeting is actually about.

136
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,749
Many of us believe
you're damaging the party.

137
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:36,665
We'd like to vote on excluding you
from the parliamentary group.

138
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:43,499
I refer you to party statutes, section 12a.
Here's a copy for you.

139
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,332
As you can see, we already have
the necessary signatures.

140
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,790
If that's all for today,
let's resolve the matter now.

141
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,790
Would you please take part
in the meeting you've called?

142
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:12,999
Before we go on, you should know
the civilian casualties are confirmed.

143
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,915
The police have sent people
to Helmand to investigate.

144
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:24,957
They'll talk to the doctor
who can comment on the extra hand.

145
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:32,707
- Excuse me, I haven't been informed.
- Investigators are sent for a reason.

146
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,207
I think we should
get the vote over with.

147
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:42,457
- When will we know the results?
- They'll fly back tomorrow evening.

148
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:47,749
Have a preliminary conclusion ready
tomorrow afternoon. Then we'll vote.

149
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:54,165
I'm going to a memorial service for
the fallen soldiers, so I'm not coming.

150
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,540
Right. Let's get it over with now.

151
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:08,415
We'll have to wait.
They won't find anything

152
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,665
but it could be misunderstood
if we take action tonight.

153
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,874
Thank you.

154
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,457
Will you cancel my appointment
with Her Majesty?

155
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,582
Did the police know what the doctor
might say about the hand?

156
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:41,915
- No. He's a murder suspect.
- Will they ask him about the reports?

157
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:49,082
We need all communication between
the military and the Ministry on this.

158
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:55,707
- Don't we have right of access?
- Yes, but the system is slow.

159
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:02,540
The Minister of Defense is the only
one who can give us the Prime Minister.

160
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,624
Why would he talk to us?

161
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,332
Unless we can drive a wedge
between the two of them.

162
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:17,957
- When will we hear from the police?
- They'll land there in the morning.

163
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:23,499
- There are two officers...
- One of them must be Lund.

164
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,624
If we can be of help,
let me know. Buch here.

165
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,290
Stop calling me, you little bitch!

166
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,374
WEDNESDAY, 23 NOVEMBER
7:10AM

167
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,124
DAY 10

168
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,207
This is a bad time for us.

169
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,457
This morning we had
two suicide bombers.

170
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:11,415
The hospital is very busy.
Buckle your helmet.

171
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,457
And your vest.
Otherwise it's useless.

172
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,040
Do you want to freshen up
at the base first?

173
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:27,665
No, take us to the hospital.
We want to talk to Frederik Holst.

174
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,707
Frederik Holst.

175
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm going home soon.
In a week.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,790
I went home on leave
for three weeks.

177
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:04,165
None of your friends saw you
and you didn't visit your parents.

178
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:10,165
- Where were you?
- Why do you want to know?

179
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,624
- Korselitze.
- It's in Falster.

180
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,582
- Who was with you?
- I was alone.

181
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,624
Could you tell me
who you think I killed?

182
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,540
They all stopped breathing
while you were on leave.

183
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:38,207
I spend my life saving people.
Will that be all?

184
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:43,332
Two years ago, you tried
to save your brother Sebastian.

185
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,707
We saw his video diary.
We found this in your home.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,499
Your interpretation is that Raben
was responsible for his death.

187
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:07,374
You tried to contact Raben,
but your letters were returned.

188
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,499
Then what did you do?

189
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,374
You're wasting your time.

190
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,790
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Don't give me that shit!

191
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:24,540
- You didn't cross them out for fun.
- Call it a pastime.

192
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:29,165
You were on duty
when your brother came in.

193
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:34,582
You saw him lying there
among the dead and wounded.

194
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,207
It must have been a shock to find out
that Raben and others were to blame.

195
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,999
Yes.

196
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:46,832
They should have been on the slab,
not your brother.

197
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,707
Yes. And I hope they burn in hell.

198
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,915
I couldn't touch them.

199
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:02,082
There's no law that can sentence
them for taking him to that village.

200
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:14,207
So instead, I discovered that
there was an extra body part. A hand.

201
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:19,624
I tried to get them suspected
of murdering civilians.

202
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,915
No one believed their explanation
about an officer.

203
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:30,290
I thought they'd all go to prison.
But the judge advocate dismissed it.

204
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,707
The hand belonged
to a suicide bomber.

205
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:38,582
- That must have pissed you off.
- There wasn't any DNA, but...

206
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:43,832
You sent the medical report. You wanted
to ruin the squad's reputation.

207
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,832
My brother died of a punctured lung.

208
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,165
That's curable.
He could have survived.

209
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,832
So am I angry
at that psychopath

210
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,332
who forced him
to go to that village

211
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,249
and the lawyer
who got them off scot-free?

212
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,624
You can damn well bet I am. Yes!

213
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,540
But that won't bring Sebastian back.

214
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,749
So what else can I do,
but try to save him

215
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,290
every single day
on that damn operating table?

216
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,957
He can't account for his movements
at the time of the murders...

217
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:46,165
- I'm asking you if he did it.
- No, he didn't.

218
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:53,207
- Has Raben said anything new?
- He's sticking to his story.

219
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,332
Major Søgaard's name
keeps turning up.

220
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:05,249
His testimony wasn't very useful.
Pack your sunglasses and come home.

221
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:23,332
I assume it was worth it.
Hopefully it wasn't a shot in the dark.

222
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,415
Special Branch and Parliament
are constantly calling me.

223
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,165
Someone thinks
we've made a break in the case.

224
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:40,290
- I'm sure the Minister of Justice...
- He's hanging by a thread.

225
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,665
Don't count on him.

226
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:48,832
The brass will look into this.
Do nothing till you've heard from me.

227
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,790
- What do we have?
- No officers.

228
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:01,249
If it's not this big brother,
we are left with Raben.

229
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:08,707
The perpetrator bought things
on the web using Per K's name.

230
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,415
Most of the things
were purchased from civilians

231
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,124
and paid in cash
and sent by mail.

232
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,207
A video camera, a laptop,
"The Anarchist's Cookbook".

233
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,332
It was all sent to a PO box
at the same place

234
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,499
where the perpetrator
had Kodmani rent a box.

235
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:34,415
Hasn't the alias been used
to rent a flat

236
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,207
or storage?

237
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,540
Not as yet.
But there is news.

238
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:46,832
The third victim was set on fire
by a stolen mobile.

239
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,707
This morning,
the phone was active again.

240
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,957
- There's one answered call.
- From where?

241
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:02,582
A payphone. The weak signal seems
to come from around Ryvang.

242
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:07,749
- The barracks?
- It's impossible to say.

243
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,415
Why would the perpetrator use a phone
he knows we're looking for?

244
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,082
Christ, the guy must be human.

245
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,999
Let's get out there right away.

246
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:26,749
- Isn't the memorial service today?
- We're doing this for their sake.

247
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,999
Maybe we should go by the base.
They might tell us about Søgaard.

248
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,374
We have some hours to kill.

249
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:50,624
What goes on when Special Forces
are on a mission?

250
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,915
How do you operate?

251
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Five men behind enemy lines.
We track his movements. Why?

252
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,415
Were you in radio contact
with the other units?

253
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,915
No, we shot at anything that moved
and hoped for the best.

254
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,915
Didn't the General say that
no Special Forces were involved?

255
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,999
Stop the car, please. Stop.

256
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,332
What's up?

257
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:50,457
- How far is the village from here?
- Not now, Lund.

258
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:55,290
- I just want to see it.
- We're not tourists here.

259
00:24:55,416 --> 00:25:00,457
- Can you take us there?
- You don't have authorisation.

260
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:05,749
- What are you on about?
- You can't leave the military zone.

261
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:10,624
Nonsense. Our authorisation
was faxed last night.

262
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,207
Not as far as I can see.

263
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:24,290
Get your act together. We wouldn't
come without authorisation.

264
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:29,374
- We have special permission.
- Give me your phone.

265
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,915
What was your name?
Siegler.

266
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,582
If I'm the one who fucked up,
I'm really sorry.

267
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,540
That's OK.

268
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,165
Shall we?

269
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:57,332
Get hold of the local head of police.

270
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,040
His name is
in the judge advocate's report.

271
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:08,374
You'll be charged with burglary,
car theft, possession of arms

272
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,707
false imprisonment, violence
and threatening someone's life.

273
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,582
How will you plead?

274
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:22,624
- Guilty on all counts?
- Has my wife contacted you?

275
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,499
No.

276
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,415
What about the police officers
who went to Afghanistan?

277
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:34,374
I advise you to forget
the story about the officer.

278
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,915
It can only hurt your case.
There's no need to provoke people.

279
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:45,915
Your sentence will be harsh.
You might be deemed dangerous

280
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:51,624
and get an indeterminate
sentence, so...

281
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,124
Do you know if my wife
has tried to visit me?

282
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,957
No, but someone else has.
The police have allowed it.

283
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,499
Hello, Raben.

284
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:27,832
I've heard so much about you.
I hope you don't mind this little visit.

285
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,790
I'm on official business.

286
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:41,957
You feel that we've let you down.
And I'm very sorry you feel that way.

287
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,915
- I want you to know that.
- And now I do.

288
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,540
If you stick to your testimony,
you're hurting yourself and the military.

289
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:58,374
Part of it is up to you,
but the other part is my business.

290
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,165
Perhaps we can help each other.

291
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,999
I'm not withdrawing my statement.

292
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:14,374
On behalf of the military,
I'd like to offer you compensation

293
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,332
by adjusting the insurance policy
you took out in your contract.

294
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,332
Fuck off.

295
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:29,790
I'm not thinking so much about you,
but about your wife and son

296
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,749
who were entitled to a pension
if you died.

297
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:40,999
We've managed to change
the premise

298
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,624
so it also applies
in the case of long-term illness.

299
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:52,707
I hope it can make life easier
for Louise and Jonas.

300
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,415
And all you have to do in return...

301
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:04,332
You know perfectly well,
but it's up to you.

302
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,499
My father has been with you
since yesterday.

303
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,165
Can you give him a message?

304
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:18,915
I see. Thanks.
For nothing.

305
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,540
- What is going on?
- Lennart Brix. Head of homicide.

306
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,999
We have reason to believe there
is evidence here. Here's the warrant.

307
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:41,332
What do you expect to find?
You've been here many times.

308
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,624
I hear that you're in charge now.

309
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:49,165
If you don't want trouble,
you'll let us do our job.

310
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:58,082
Don't let anyone leave.
Send someone to get the keys we need.

311
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,290
- What's up?
- Get hold of General Arild.

312
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:08,249
Get hold of him,
for fuck's sake.

313
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,624
Krabbe is being pressured
by his support base.

314
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,707
I'll talk to him. Are the police
coming home without any evidence?

315
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:24,915
- Plough has the details.
- Where the hell is he?

316
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:29,499
Take that cart first
and then the other one.

317
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,582
The press gave up on you.

318
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:37,915
Three members
have accused you of treason.

319
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:43,165
We need evidence that the Prime Minister
shelved the first medical report.

320
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:47,749
We haven't found a reason
why he would do that.

321
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:52,374
The doctor was content
with the revised report.

322
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,207
He hasn't murdered civilians. Your
accusations against the Prime Minister

323
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,082
seem more and more extreme.

324
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:08,499
I think we should spend our time
on the Minister of Defense.

325
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:15,124
I think I have something here.
The Prime Minister has a secret abroad.

326
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,207
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone
the memorial service for a while.

327
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,665
- What's wrong?
- The relatives are on their way.

328
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:46,499
But the barracks are being
searched. If it takes too long

329
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:51,082
we'll have to continue without
the personnel from the barracks.

330
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:11,540
What are you doing here?
Were you invited?

331
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:17,457
I know you don't trust me, but we
have more in common than you think.

332
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,624
I certainly hope not.

333
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:26,457
I hear your investigators' efforts
in Afghanistan were fruitless.

334
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,082
So no wonder you're stressed.

335
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,165
You think you've served
a greater purpose.

336
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:39,665
I have.

337
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,207
Every coffin reminds me...

338
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:48,540
...that we have to continue
until no death is in vain.

339
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:54,249
For the Prime Minister this was not
about fighting, but about the UN.

340
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:58,749
He hopes to be the next
Secretary General.

341
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:03,207
All he needed
was the support of the Americans.

342
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,707
That's why we deployed
more soldiers to Afghanistan.

343
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,332
A French news agency has confirmed
that he was offered the position.

344
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:22,790
Look at those coffins
and tell me that it was worth it.

345
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,915
The Prime Minister
turned the offer down.

346
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:33,040
He was encouraged to apply,
but he declined. Goodbye, Buch.

347
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:39,374
That doesn't change anything. I refuse
to believe you did this on your own.

348
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,707
The death of the soldiers is linked
to what happened back then.

349
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,332
You have a responsibility,
for fuck's sake.

350
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,582
Would you please leave?
Your behaviour is inappropriate.

351
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:11,332
- We haven't found a thing.
- What about the phone?

352
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:15,957
We keep trying.
The battery seems to be dead.

353
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:20,874
What about the underground areas?
The practice grounds?

354
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,707
- The area around the lecture hall?
- We don't have the manpower.

355
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,624
We'll stay till we're finished.
We'll go through the whole lot.

356
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,832
Wait a moment.

357
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:37,999
I know what you want to say.
You have nothing to do with this.

358
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:43,749
And you have no idea what's going on.
Good. That's all squared.

359
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,874
It's for you.

360
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:52,457
- I don't understand you either.
- This isn't a good time.

361
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:56,624
Pack your things
and get out of there. Now!

362
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,707
I will take full responsibility for
the situation, but we must continue.

363
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:06,249
I've talked to management.
You have no authority any more.

364
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,874
Lennart...

365
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,082
We have five minutes
to get out of here.

366
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,749
Brix, come in.

367
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,874
There's something in the basement.

368
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,332
What's in the box?
Open it.

369
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:27,540
The squad apparently entrenched
themselves on the second floor.

370
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:48,665
Calibre 5.56. They're used
in the Danish M-95s.

371
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:58,249
The soldiers slept in shifts.
In here.

372
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,915
- Is this where they were killed?
- According to Raben.

373
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:16,040
And he said that the bodies
were moved in here.

374
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:21,749
The soldiers who came
to their rescue found nothing.

375
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:29,249
- Did they drag the bodies outside?
- They would have been shot.

376
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,624
Aren't we all done here?

377
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:49,874
Some people thought he was
a drug lord who financed the Taliban.

378
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,374
Does he think the family
was killed by Danish soldiers?

379
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,624
No, there was no sign of them.

380
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:19,665
All right. Sorry to bother you.

381
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,124
What is this?

382
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,665
- It was a family of bakers.
- Where is the oven?

383
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:53,457
- He says everything was destroyed.
- I just want to see that oven.

384
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,915
I don't care. Just get it ready
before the meeting!

385
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,290
Rossing had his chance,
but now we're going after him.

386
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:12,124
- The lawyers are waiting for you.
- We have a problem.

387
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,124
The police have extended
their investigation in Afghanistan.

388
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:23,040
They've left the military zone
without authorisation.

389
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,832
Get them a visa.

390
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:31,374
It's against all international rules.
Operational Command is furious.

391
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,374
Where have you been? The Minister
of Defense is in your office.

392
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,457
- Help them, if you can.
- That's easy for you to say.

393
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:46,415
If this is about some trivial clearance
for my people there, forget it.

394
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:52,624
I've always been loyal
to the Prime Minister.

395
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,665
Congratulations.

396
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:59,374
Even when I've had to compromise
on my principles.

397
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:05,082
When we heard about
the death of civilians

398
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,540
we were in the middle
of a decision process.

399
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:14,582
We needed more money,
more soldiers.

400
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:20,540
The Prime Minister and I agreed
to put off the investigation of the hand.

401
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,874
I had no idea where it could lead.

402
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,249
Monberg... and all the murders...

403
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:39,124
Perhaps some of it
should have rung some bells.

404
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,707
- What bells?
- I'm not sure.

405
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:48,374
The examination of the hand
resulted in inconsistencies.

406
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,915
We felt it was inconclusive.

407
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,957
But in the meantime

408
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:57,999
military intelligence concluded that
none of the victims were civilians.

409
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,249
What inconsistencies?

410
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:09,124
There was something about
a special henna tattoo.

411
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:18,457
We consulted experts who said
it was typical of the Hazara people.

412
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,624
The Hazara hate the Taliban.

413
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,624
But the key factor is the gold ring.

414
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,582
The Taliban don't wear gold.

415
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:36,040
Therefore, it couldn't possibly
be a suicide bomber.

416
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,832
Did the Prime Minister
know about this?

417
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:48,582
- It's not on record.
- But did he know?

418
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,040
Gert knows everything.

419
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,082
He's the man in charge.

420
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,082
- What's going on?
- We're changing our strategy.

421
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,207
You and Rossing against
the Prime Minister?

422
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,582
Read this.

423
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:19,749
- You're sure he's not lying?
- I'll let Krabbe know.

424
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:25,540
Yes, it's my locker, but I haven't used
it for ages. I've said so many times.

425
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:29,999
The phone is linked with the murder
of Grüner last week.

426
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:33,582
That may be, but it's not mine.

427
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,457
I have nothing to do
with those murders.

428
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,249
Take a look.
The lab has examined the halves.

429
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,624
Each matches a half
found on one of the five victims.

430
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,499
I see.

431
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:59,374
- I haven't seen them before.
- What is this a key to?

432
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,915
- No idea.
- You're charged with all five murders.

433
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:12,082
- I'm innocent.
- So you never met the first victim?

434
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:15,165
Dragsholm?
And you had no idea

435
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,832
she was reopening the old case?

436
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:23,665
You'll be put in isolation pending
the investigation. Take him away.

437
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,624
I have met Anne Dragsholm.

438
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,540
She called me
and requested a meeting.

439
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:37,999
I thought it was best
to keep an open mind.

440
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:42,665
But she stuck to her accusations,
so I told her to go to hell.

441
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:46,790
Why would I kill my own people?

442
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:52,624
And be dumb enough to leave
a switched-on phone in my locker?

443
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,999
I bet you regret it,
but the judge won't care.

444
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:05,040
We didn't care about Dragsholm.
You know I have a watertight alibi.

445
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:08,290
- We?
- Yes.

446
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:10,165
Bilal was at that meeting.

447
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:18,040
He was my second-in-command
and can confirm my statement.

448
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,874
How did Bilal react
to the accusations?

449
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,957
He was angry and afraid
that it would ruin our cause.

450
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,915
Bilal is a Muslim, but he hates
the obscurants more than we do.

451
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:35,082
And that's understandable.

452
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,665
Does Bilal have access
to the basement?

453
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:47,707
- Knock it off. Bilal is a boy scout.
- Does he have access?

454
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:53,249
Yes, but he said not to go down there
because the ceiling might cave in.

455
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,582
The prosecutor will state the charges
and you'll plead guilty on all counts.

456
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:05,082
You'll withdraw your statement about
the officer and civilian casualties.

457
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,582
Afterwards, you'll probably
be taken back to prison.

458
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:13,457
At least until...
Excuse me a minute.

459
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:24,207
The hearing has been postponed.
They think they have the perpetrator.

460
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:29,249
They've found evidence
pointing to Major Søgaard.

461
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:34,999
You've claimed someone
at the barracks was involved.

462
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,707
OK. Let's go.

463
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,874
Don't let them question you
without me.

464
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,707
Søgaard might cover something up,
but no way is he the perpetrator.

465
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,665
It's not Søgaard.

466
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:56,582
All the ID halves were found
in his locker. Move it!

467
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:01,915
You have the wrong man.
My wife and son are at the barracks.

468
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:05,832
- Relax.
- My wife and son...

469
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:09,749
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

470
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,665
Get him in the car.

471
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:28,124
The investigators still won't tell me
when my father will be released.

472
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,457
- Any news from the police?
- The last one just left.

473
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,540
My father found out that someone
concealed the radio messages.

474
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:43,165
Who here would have done that?

475
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:50,999
Don't you see that it's important?
It indicates that Jens was right.

476
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:55,915
There were no messages,
and no one concealed anything.

477
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:59,040
But my father thinks so.
It must be the same person

478
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:03,290
who planted those things
in Søgaard's locker.

479
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:06,207
In his locker?
Then it must be Søgaard.

480
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:10,707
Who was the radio operator?

481
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,749
There's a log
that registers radio calls.

482
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:19,082
Let's say someone figured out
how to delete messages.

483
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:22,040
Who apart from Søgaard
could have done that?

484
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:30,832
- I have to inform the other officers.
- Call General Arild.

485
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:36,957
Find out who ratted on my father.
It must be the same guy.

486
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:42,957
My father was digging something up
and suddenly he was ratted on.

487
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,499
Make the call. Or call the police.
They have to be told.

488
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,540
What are you waiting for?

489
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:29,082
Lund... I talked to my superior.
We have to leave right now.

490
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:33,332
- There's nothing there.
- I want to see that oven.

491
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:37,790
I could get reported for this.

492
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:50,040
Yes? Hello? This is Strange.

493
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,999
There must be another one.

494
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,707
We have to remove all the debris
and check this out.

495
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:24,457
- He says you're crazy. I agree.
- What happened here led to murders.

496
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:28,624
If you know anything about it,
tell me now.

497
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:33,124
A family lived here.
Two adults and two children.

498
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,207
I have to know
if they were murdered.

499
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,457
People around here die every day,
in case you haven't noticed.

500
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,957
What the hell is that supposed
to mean? Hey...

501
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,915
Hey! Hey!

502
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:05,374
When people get killed, it's important.
What the hell is wrong with you?

503
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,874
Translate, damn it!

504
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:15,499
Tell me what happened here.
Is that uniform just a joke?

505
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:20,415
What happened to the bodies?
You must've seen or heard something.

506
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:23,999
Were they buried? Cremated?
Taken somewhere?

507
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,915
You don't care!
You don't give a...

508
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,832
Easy now.

509
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:38,249
We've been through everything.
There's no oven. No bodies. OK?

510
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:42,624
It's Brix. They think they know
who the perpetrator is.

511
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:47,665
Yes?

512
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:58,374
Get on a plane now. The Ministry
and the army are all over us.

513
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,540
- What's up?
- Bilal might be our man.

514
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,957
He knew Dragsholm
was opening the case

515
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:08,499
and we found the other halves
of the IDs at the barracks.

516
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:13,707
- We're going to arrest him now.
- At the barracks? Why would Bilal...?

517
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:19,124
We found out what the key is for.
It's not at the barracks.

518
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:24,874
The locksmith says it's to a rented place
in the name of Per K.

519
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:30,499
Let's start. Will all of you
have a seat, please?

520
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:53,999
Item one is the Minister of Justice's
summary of the Helmand investigation.

521
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:58,040
Next is the Prime Minister's
comment before we vote.

522
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:02,415
He'll have plenty to comment on.
As you've heard

523
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:07,457
nothing new has come to light
in the investigation in Afghanistan.

524
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:12,665
However, I've been made aware
of a scandal of historic proportions.

525
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,624
A stain on the history of the party
and on the Government.

526
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:22,915
That's it?
Haven't the police found anything?

527
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:26,249
No, but if I may continue...

528
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:31,082
Any further items will have to wait.
The Prime Minister has the floor.

529
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:36,040
His words are immaterial
if I am not allowed to continue.

530
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:42,499
The voting has been postponed.
This is not an easy thing to say.

531
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:48,249
I have just been given information

532
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:53,290
that clearly indicates that the
Minister of Defense has deceived us.

533
00:53:53,416 --> 00:54:00,165
The Minister of Defense has withheld
a certain expert's testimony

534
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:05,374
which concluded that
the hand found in Afghanistan

535
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,999
possibly did not belong
to a Taliban suicide bomber.

536
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:15,082
It was suppressed to avoid
the suspicion of civilian casualties.

537
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:19,124
- This is incorrect...
- It's shocking.

538
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,249
We'll see if that changes
our conclusions

539
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:28,290
but the Minister of Defense
is dismissed immediately.

540
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:32,332
His actions will be investigated
by Special Branch.

541
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:37,374
Tell them. The Prime Minister
told you to hide those papers.

542
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,874
The Minister of Justice
will have to wait.

543
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,165
Let me speak.
He just told me all about it.

544
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:49,290
With regard to the Minister of Justice,
the situation is equally grave.

545
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:54,040
He could have used his knowledge
to benefit his country

546
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:59,540
but instead he has abused
his office to raise doubts about me.

547
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:04,749
Listen! The Prime Minister instructed
the Minister of Defense to do that.

548
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:09,249
His motive is dubious.
He has conducted a smear campaign

549
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:14,915
and been very careless in his
handling of confidential information.

550
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:20,457
Special Branch will investigate
if he has committed acts of treason.

551
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:25,790
This is ridiculous!
What the hell is this?

552
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:31,915
Leave the building immediately.
You cannot take anything with you.

553
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:35,374
I assume it's evident
that you've stepped down now.

554
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:45,290
Take it easy!
I can walk on my own.

555
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:52,665
Are you under arrest?

556
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:58,332
Has the Minister of Defense
deceived Parliament?

557
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:15,957
Did they find everything
in Søgaard's locker?

558
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:19,499
But his alibis do check out.

559
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:24,624
Brix thinks that Bilal used
the locker or planted the stuff.

560
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,415
If there were no civilian casualties,
why commit the murders?

561
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:34,415
Ask Brix. That's all I heard
before you let that Afghan have it.

562
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:41,790
The main thing is we've got him,
whether it's Bilal or Søgaard.

563
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,415
Yes. I don't know...

564
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:49,040
It's a good thing you're going home
to solve the whole thing.

565
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,499
Shit!

566
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,915
Do as they say.

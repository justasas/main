00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,439
Yellowtail? OK.

752
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,769
Drunken boxing.

753
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,495
What does she know anyway?

754
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,731
Hey, Chang Tsan.

755
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,103
Huh?

756
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:12,106
What, Fei-Hong?

757
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,540
A fillet of salmon

758
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:17,101
and a pound of fish marrow, OK?

759
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,807
Hey, where are you going?

760
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,350
Really soft skin,

761
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,475
but the meat is tougher.

762
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,146
Hey, Fun, I'm going to need a few things,
OK?

763
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,916
- Ohh! - Hi.

764
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:27,921
Oh, it's getting away.

765
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,252
Oh! Ha ha ha!

766
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,452
One pheasant and two orders of har gow.

767
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,085
Ah, that would've been my choice.

768
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,187
I've been waiting for a long time.

769
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,196
[Chops]

770
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,698
- Here. - Thank you.

771
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,166
You want this or not?

772
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,896
I got a customer waiting.

773
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,062
Oh, yeah. I'll be right there.

774
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,298
Oh, Fei-Hong.

775
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,602
I hear drunken boxing is the best.

776
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,972
Would you be able to teach me?

777
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,101
How about it?

778
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:49,701
Of course. Anytime.

779
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:50,973
Hey!

780
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,776
How about I bone it for you, eh?

781
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,146
Oh, no. That's all right.

782
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:55,377
How about later with that?

783
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,943
We're discussing drunken boxing.

784
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,489
Fei-Hong, when do you think you could
teach me?

785
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,582
Anytime would be fine. You just let me
know.

786
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,058
Fun, you need real instructor

787
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,560
to learn how to fight.

788
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:10,121
Maybe Chang Tsan can give you a lesson.

789
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,791
He doesn't teach the style I like.

790
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,096
It's for fighting.

791
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,830
Drunken master just for show.

792
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,531
You cannot win fight that way.

793
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,767
Forget him. He's jealous.

794
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:19,830
I like your style.

795
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,070
Fei-Hong, time to admit it.

796
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:25,307
Your drunken boxing is no match for Choy
Li Fu.

797
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,406
Isn't that right? You agree?

798
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,041
Yeah! Right! That's right.

799
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:30,551
Master much better.

800
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,609
He knows.

801
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,120
Depends on who's fighting.

802
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,588
What do you say to a challenge, then?

803
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,591
Out of my way.

804
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,786
My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing.

805
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:40,488
And if I lose, you can have your fish

806
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,259
and anything else you want no charge, on
me.

807
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,959
Listen-

808
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,501
you can learn from Fei-Hong.

809
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,628
I don't need your help.

810
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,707
I appreciate the offer,

811
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,037
but there's too many people here,

812
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,236
and somebody could get hurt.

813
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:57,472
No way, Fei-Hong. You're going to fight
this time.

814
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,377
Attention, everybody!

815
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,211
Listen!

816
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,479
I'm Chang Tsan, and this is Wong Fei-
Hong.

817
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,678
It's your lucky day.

818
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,018
I have challenged him to a fight.

819
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,021
Come on.

820
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,022
I'll hold this.

821
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,184
Remember, it's an exhibition match,

822
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,727
so go on.

823
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,795
Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!

824
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,298
Oh.

825

[Both Grunting]

826
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,116

827
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,520
Haah!

828
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:12,715
Ah!

829
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,388
OK, OK, that's enough.

830
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,292
All right, that's enough. The winner is
Fei-Hong.

831
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,853
No. Really, it was a draw.

832
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:22,863
I think Chang Tsan would agree.

833
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:23,990
It's not over yet.

834
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,832

835
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:31,134
Yeah, I'm coming! It's my stepma.

836
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,970
- Come on! - I got to go. Thank
you, Fun.

837
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,033
See you tomorrow.

838
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:36,043
- Fish. - Why, thank you.

839
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,477
What do I owe you for this?

840
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,604
You can have it.

841
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,444
Thanks a lot.

842
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:42,279
Thank you. Excuse me.

843
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,478
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?

844
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,487
OK, OK, show over.

845
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:50,359
Don't tell me you were fighting for food
again.

846
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:51,358
Me? No way.

847
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:52,416
You know your father will kill you

848
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,621
if he hears about it.

849
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:55,856
How can I replace the ginseng?

850
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,330
Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.

851
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,367
But, why?

852
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,458
We'll be in big trouble

853
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,730
if Mr. Chan decides to brew that tree
root.

854
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:02,736
You would do that?

855
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:05,865
Just remember, you owe me one.

856
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:06,873
Yeah.

857
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:11,711
Hey, that's the guy we're looking for.

boss, OK?

Yes, sir.

860
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,345
Stop here.

861
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,649
Ah, OK, here's the money.

862
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,053
I'm sure they're high quality.

863

She got them from her husband.

864
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:25,116
Look, I'm late already. Let's go, OK?

865
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:27,822
So, was the drought very serious?

866
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,091
In that province,

867
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,099
rice and grain were scarce before there
was a drought.

868
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,601
With no rainfall, there will be no
harvest,

869
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,966
and that is serious.

870
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,197
We must act now.

871
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,398
It's so bad.

872
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:38,906
They're so poor that some families

873
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,737
have to share a single pair of pants.

874
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,402
Wow. Who gets to wear them?

875
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:44,412
If you have job, you wear the pants.

876
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,412
Oh, wow.

877
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:46,607
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

878
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,082
It's all right. How are you?

879
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,209
Good to see you.

880
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:52,083
Fei-Hong, don't you think we should be
going?

881
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:54,645
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

Oh, no, not mah-jongg again.

How can you say that?

884
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,292
It's our fund-raising meeting,

885
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,226
and you were supposed to remind me.

886
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,026
Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better be
going.

887
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,396
Ah. You don't want to keep them waiting.

888
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,399
You should go.

889
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,400
Of course. You're right.

890
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:07,663
- Bye. - Goodbye.

Go tell John.

It's been called to our attention

897
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,448
that Master Wong needs us to lend him
some money.

898
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,782
Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me.

899
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:26,287
I'm sure I speak for everyone.

900
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,287
We'll just take up a collection.

00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:28,345


902
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,255
I don't personally need any of your
money.

903
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:31,315
It's for the drought victims.

904

But your wife...

905

Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

906
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,152
This could happen to you.

907
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,664
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...

908
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,563
Nothing right now.

909
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:39,566
You sure?

910
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:40,567
You better not have said anything,

911
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:41,898
you understand?

912
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,370
I won't tell a soul.

913
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,031
Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.

914
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,597
Like you don't?

915
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:49,576
How dare you say that? I only told my
sister...

Whoa, ladies, somebody has been talking.

918

They always lie to me. Look at their
faces.

919

Now, that's enough.

920
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,477
Can't we just take a look?

00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,613

00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,199
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!

1121
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:37,103
Oh, no!

1122
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:39,198
Fei-Hong!

1123
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,038
- Ha ha! - Have you been drinking?

1124
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,574
You stop it right now!

1125
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,176
Down the Hatch!

1126
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,017
[Gagging]

1127
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,018
What are you doing?

1128
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:53,884
Uh, Father?

1129
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:59,025
Ohh...

1130
00:44:59,094 --> 00:45:01,654
Ha ha! You have the cutest little nose.

1131
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,358
[Laughs]

1132
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:06,333
Look how well they get along.

1133
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,734
How are you, Dad?

1134
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,066
Fighting again!

1135
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,629
Fighting? OK.

1136
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,504
You should have been here.

1137
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,271
Fei-Hong defeated all five of those
gangsters.

1138
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,175
What was this all about?

1139
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:18,679
They tried to steal the diamond necklace

1140
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:19,907
that Ling sold to me.

1141
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,574
What?

1142
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,777
You sold your diamond necklace?

1143
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,343
Why didn't you tell us Po Chi Lam needed
more money?

1144
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,617
We would have helped you. You know we're
all friends here.

1145
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:31,524
No. The school doesn't need money.

1146
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,926
Here, you can take charge of the funds
we raised.

1147
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:35,759
[Gurgling]

1148
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:38,527
Stop that! Fei-Hong!

1149
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,069
- Hi. - Hello, Madam Wong.

1150
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,433
I said stop it!

1151
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,267
No, please, Master Wong, don't hurt him!

1152
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,307
He's drunk!

1153
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,308
Mom, fetch me another bottle.

1154
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:48,604
Go home now!

1155
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:49,974
Now!

1156
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,036
Yes, dear.

1157
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:55,709
Do as he says. All right.

1158
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:56,910
See you.

1159
00:45:56,986 --> 00:46:02,686
Go home now, Daddy

1160
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:06,592
Go on. Follow him!

1161
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,095
Losers.

1162
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:09,665
You didn't do any better.

1163
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,426
And what were you trying to do?

1164
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,331
You've ruined the school's reputation!

1165
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:14,528
They think we're broke!

1166
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,969
And you, you idiot, what have I told you

1167
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,803
about drunken boxing and fighting in the
streets?

1168
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,708
Now, tell me, is everything here so bad

1169
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:24,006
you have to sell your diamonds?

1170
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,843
Come on! Do you really think

1171
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,507
I would have sold something

1172
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,982
that's precious to us? I would never!

1173
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:31,246
Don't lie to me!

1174
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,345
How much money did you lose playing mah-
jongg?

1175
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,616
Well, how much?

1176
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,459
I always win at mah-jongg.

1177
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:39,858
You don't know what you're talking about.

1178
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,362
Besides, who are you going to believe,

1179
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,397
me or friends?

1180
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,797
Stepma, I believe you.

1181
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,835
Shut up!

1182
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,166
Did you hear what I told you? Shut up!

1183
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:50,671
You disobeyed me!

1184
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,208
I said absolutely no fighting and no
drinking.

1185
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:55,743
And above all, no drunken boxing!

1186
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:57,142
[Hiccup]

1187
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:59,704
You even fought with me, your own father!

1188
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,807
You disgraced your family name!

1189
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:03,715
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

1190
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:04,718
Would you stop hitting him?

1191
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,186
He was just defending me!

1192
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,688
They tried to break my jaw.

1193
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,281
I guess that's something you don't care
about.

1194
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,657
Damn you, woman! It was forbidden!

1195
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:14,787
They could have killed him. Don't you
care about that?

1196
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:17,697
Oh, sure. Like it matters.

1197
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,861
You're beating him worse than those guys
ever did.

1198
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:23,700
You're driving me insane!

1199
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,432
I can't believe this!

1200
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:34,208
What's this?

1201
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:36,217
Oh, my God!

1202
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:40,585
What has happened to my 300- year-old
bonsai?

1203
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,283
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!

1204
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,757
Mr. Cho!

1205
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,726
Aah!

1206
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,695
What went wrong?

1207
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,163
You know this garden is your
responsibility

1208
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:52,325
and I expect an answer! Well?

1209
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,562
Just hold on!

1210
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,969
You shouldn't blame everything on him
that way,

1211
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,008
because I was actually the one who did
it.

1212
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:02,441
I was practising my kung fu

1213
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,139
and then I tripped over that statue
right over there.

1214
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,409
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.

1215
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:09,144
God only knows, I could have gotten
killed,

1216
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,516
but I see now you don't care. Oh, well.

1217
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,953
You know that's not it, Ling.

1218
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:15,718
I am so sick and tired of your deception!

1219
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,521
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

1220
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,761
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1221
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,198
It's time you showed me respect.

1222
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:28,600
[Sobbing]

1223
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,865
That's not gonna work this time!

1224
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:32,407
[Sobbing]

1225
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:39,279
You've been hurting me so I won't cause
any more trouble.

1226
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:40,838
You're driving me out of my mind!

1227
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,476
Aah!

1228
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,986
Hit me! Hit me all right!

1229
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,044
Over the head! Kill me!

1230
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:48,987
Kill me and the little one inside me!

1231
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:51,185
Little one?

1232
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,284
Is that so?

1233
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,885
We're going to have a baby?

1234
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,863
[Gagging]

1235
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,762
Why didn't you tell me?

1236
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,528
- Never! - Come inside.

1237
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:01,661
You told me to get on my knees, so here
I am!

1238
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:05,468
On my knees! It doesn't matter if I'm
pregnant!

1239
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,772
Mom has a little baby!

1240
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:10,641
I apologise. I wouldn't hit you.

1241
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,613
Get away! You said enough!

1242
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:15,047
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!

1243
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,585
- Then put me down! - OK.

1244
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:18,745
Leave me alone, I said!

1245
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,415
No! You have to stop this!

1246
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,048
All right, I will.

1247
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,183
Are you all right?

1248
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,693
There's no way I'll forgive you!

1249
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,228
What are you doing?

1250
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:29,787
This is all my fault. Please be careful.

1251
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:31,264
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!

1252
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,130
What are you waiting for?

1253
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,635
I'm begging you, Ling.

1254
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:36,432
Sit over there, you'll be all right.

1255
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:39,167
- Aah! - Ling!

1256
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,072
Oh! Sorry.

1257
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,075
[Coughs]

1258
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,338
Ling, I'm so sorry.

1259
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:44,572
How dare you?!

1260
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:47,616
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.

1261
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:48,615
Let me help you.

1262
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,844
You did it on purpose.

1263
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,250
Now, of course I didn't.

1264
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,448
Don't lie. Haven't you done enough?

1265
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,547
Is the baby all right?

1266
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,114
Stop it!

1267
00:49:57,192 --> 00:50:00,059
Eee. Ooh. Ugh.

1268
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:01,528
It's fine.

1269
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:03,531
Good. Are you comfortable?

1270
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,033
Master Wong, Mrs.. Chan is here.

1271
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,966
She has a bit of a problem.

1272
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:10,562
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

1273
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,767
Congratulations, Father. I'm really
proud of you.

1274
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:16,606
Thank you.

1275
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,340
Ah, Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

1276
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:22,510
Dr. Wong, uh, this really isn't ginseng.

1277
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,018
I showed it to another doctor

1278
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:27,055
and he says it's poisonous.

1279
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,113
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,

1280
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:30,886
but you've surely been misled.

1281
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,394
It has made my husband deathly ill.

1282
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:36,397
Mrs. Thank God he only brewed half
of it.

1283
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:38,990
You owe me, and you're going to have to

1284
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,094
take the blame for this mess. Now!

1285
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,297
Mm-hmm.

1286
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,864
Forgive me. Uncle Ho, get the snake
extract.

1287
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:48,807
I can assure you he will recover

1288
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,037
if you give him this.

1289
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,081
Ah, Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful.

1290
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,775
I promise I won't tell anyone.

1291
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,909
It must have been a mistake.

1292
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:58,419
Good day, madam.

1293
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:00,717
Mrs. Good day.

1294
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:02,222
Well?

1295
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,589
Mmm.

1296
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,684
Get over here, Cho!

1297
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:11,164

proverb

1479
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,946
that equates the drinking of alcohol
with water-

1480
00:59:58,016 --> 01:00:01,349
"Boats can float on water," or so it
says,

1481
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,320
"but they can sink in it, too."

1482
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:04,946
Now, that's a profound lesson.

1483
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,456
I have only one question.

1484
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:07,457
What?

1485
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:09,050
Whose boat are we talking about?

1486
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:10,924
[Chuckles]

1487
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,706
I will never drink again.

1488
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,954
Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong.

1489
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:43,858
I'm glad to see that you're OK now.

1490
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,863
Come on, let's get up and thank all your
friends here

1491
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,899
for helping you. Go on.

1492
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:49,900
Ho Sang: Fei-Hong, you OK?

1493
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:52,664
Thank you.

1494
01:00:52,738 --> 01:00:55,036
You OK?

1495
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:56,540
You should...

1496
01:00:56,608 --> 01:00:58,872
Don't ever give up. You'll be
better now.

1497
01:00:58,944 --> 01:01:00,343
Everybody makes mistakes.

1498
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:01,845
How's the baby today?

1499
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:03,744
He's just fine. Let him be.

1500
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:06,340
Oh. All right.

1501
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:24,258
Sorry, we are closed now.

1502
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:27,571
Where's Fei-Hong?

1503
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:28,628
Excuse me?

1504
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:29,901
Is he here?

1505
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:31,772
He might be. What for?

1506
01:01:31,843 --> 01:01:33,333
It's private.

1507
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:36,204
May I come in?

1508
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:39,740
Well, in that case...

1509
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:43,821
I know who sent you.

1510
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:47,052
What was that for? Keep your distance.

1511
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:49,320
That's enough. I want you to leave.

1512
01:01:57,669 --> 01:01:58,931
Hmm.

1513
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,033
You know, you're not bad.

1514
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,184
Huh? It's you!

1515
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:17,186
You!

1516
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:19,223
Fei-Hong, hold him for me!

1517
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,282
Unh!

1518
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,724
Help.

1519
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:28,365
Father, help!

1520
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:30,196
- Help him! - That's enough!

1521
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:32,236
Hurting me! Aah!

1522
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:34,169
Fei-Hong, are you all right?

1523
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,797
Yeah, I was just pretending.

1524
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:36,863
Fei-Hong, who is that?

1525
01:02:42,948 --> 01:02:43,880
Hey!

1526
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:45,678
Fei-Hong, hold it!

1527
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,650
We have you surrounded!

1528
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,152
I'm talking to you.

1529
01:02:49,221 --> 01:02:50,984
Yeah. Would you stop?

1530
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:52,489
Me?

1531
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:53,785
Please, sir, I hope you can
forgive us.

1532
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:56,521
I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologise.

1533
01:02:56,595 --> 01:02:59,393
You are very famous. Meeting you is an
honour.

1534
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,762
I am Fu Wen-Chi.

1535
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,698
Fu Wen-Chi?

1536
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:05,463
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

1537
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:07,300
Is it true?

1538
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:08,964
Yes, it is.

1539
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,302
It's an honour. Welcome.

1540
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,275
- Right this way. - Thank you.

1541
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:14,369
Good evening.

1542
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:16,778
I guess that man is someone important.

1543
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:18,782
Trust me, if he was important,

1544
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,250
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

1545
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:22,251
Oh.

1546
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,878
Think about it.

1547
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:24,887
What?

1548
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:26,685
Keep searching. We have to find it.

1549
01:03:26,758 --> 01:03:27,918
Look in the parlour when you're done.

1550
01:03:27,993 --> 01:03:28,925
Yes, ma'am.

1551
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,791
You have no idea where you left it?

1552
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:33,160
No, I don't.

1553
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:34,698
Where could it be?

1554
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,427
Cho might know.

1555
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:38,230
[Gasps]

1556
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:39,463
Hey!

1557
01:03:39,538 --> 01:03:40,766
Something's wrong?

1558
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:44,570
Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it.

1559
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:46,873
She's quite a handful.

1560
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:50,039
Oh, think I'll get some ice.

1561
01:03:50,115 --> 01:03:52,174
Cho, where's the jade box I had?

1562
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,274
What?

1563
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,909
Where did you put it?

1564
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:56,476
I don't know.

1565
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:57,487
What is that?

1566
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:59,319
Ground garlic.

1567
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:01,382
I mean there in your hand.

1568
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:05,523
We found it!

1569
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,962
Fei-Hong, where are you going?

1570
01:04:07,032 --> 01:04:08,829
- Mom! - I'm not finished with that.

1571
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,993
Fu: When you surprised me in the baggage
car,

1572
01:04:11,069 --> 01:04:12,730
I was trying to get back thejade seal

1573
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:15,170
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.

1574
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,299
I wound up with your ginseng instead.

1575
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,138
Tell me something,

1576
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,508
there must be a hundred jade seals in
our museum.

1577
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,740
Is this one so special?

1578
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,749
Fei-Hong, they all are special.

1579
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:27,512
Think about this.

1580
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:29,611
Today they plunder a seal.

1581
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,588
It seems small.

1582
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:34,181
Tomorrow they take another, and the next
thing you know,

1583
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:38,059
the Great Wall is gone. And what's next?

1584
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:42,589
Our children must travel abroad just to
see their history.

1585
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:45,830
So, don't you see that you and I

1586
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,873
are the only possible defence

1587
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,932
from governments trying to strip us of
our culture?

1588
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,307
So, I hope you can help me do this,

1589
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:57,337
if only for the future generations of
our people.

1590
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,976
All right. I'll be honoured to help.

1591
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:02,713
Thank you, Fei-Hong.

1592
01:05:05,123 --> 01:05:08,024
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

1593
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,082
Where is everyone?

1594
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,889
Yeah. There's no one here.

1595
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:13,628
I'll go take a look.

1596
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,200
What the...

1597
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,897
Yaah!

1598
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:26,101
- Aah! - Aah!

1599
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:28,668
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1600
01:05:28,747 --> 01:05:30,977
[Shouting]

1601
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:32,346
Uh-oh.

1602
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:34,214
What do we do?

1603
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,582
Follow me.

1604
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:42,554
Here I go!

1605
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:50,695
Get him!

1606
01:06:23,368 --> 01:06:24,630
Huh?

1607
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:34,210
All right, lift it!

1608
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,449
Fu: Here, Fei-Hong!

1609
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:48,313
Let's go!

1610
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:05,519
- Aah! - Aah!

1611
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:07,758
Oh, they started.

1612
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,733
Oh, I see the fun's begun.

1613
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,428
Sounds great.

1614
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:14,336
When you have the Ax Gang, you're sure
to get the job done.

1615
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,101
That's what we're paying for.

1616
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:24,708
Fei-Hong, here!

1617
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:25,772
Hai!

1618
01:08:08,326 --> 01:08:09,418
Unh!

1619
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,690
- Huh? - Fu: Fei-Hong!

1620
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:21,233
[Screaming]

1621
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,967
Oh, my God! No!

1622
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:26,369
Aah!

1623
01:08:34,686 --> 01:08:36,449
Hai! Yaah!

1624
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:42,016
Fei-Hong! Your shirt, take it off!

1625
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:43,583
OK!

1626
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,536
- Quickly, now, go! - This way!

1627
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:34,841
Go! Go! Move it!

1628
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:41,645
Run! Go on!

1629
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:52,057
What's this? What's going on?

1630
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,256
Don't get involved.

1631
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:56,228
Get on out of here.

1632
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,598
Now. Go on.

1633
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:58,601
Help.

1634
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,103
That's Fu Wen-Chi!

1635
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:02,571
Unh!

1636
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,271
Ow! That hurt!

1637
01:10:15,453 --> 01:10:16,852
- Hey! -

1638
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:19,356
[Fu Yells]

1639
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,448
Fu Wen-Chi!

1640
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:22,650
- There! - Master Fu!

1641
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:25,161
Huh? Come on! Let's go!

1642
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:28,130
Master Fu!

1643
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,498
- Get behind! - Help! Help!

1644
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:35,563
- Aah! - Easy, easy!

1645
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,107
Try to stop the bleeding.

1646
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:38,369
Don't die!

1647
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,933
Hold on! Master Fu!

1648
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,808
We'll go for a doctor! You'll be all
right!

1649
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,541
The royal seal...

1650
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,048
I know. We'll get it.

1651
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,242
Don't worry. I'll find it.

1652
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:49,253
The embassy. Go quickly.

1653
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,754
- What do I do? - Tonight.

1654
01:10:50,822 --> 01:10:53,757
Hold on, Master. My father will take
care of you.

1655
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:56,385
I promise. Don't give up!

1656
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,894
[Gasps]

1657
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:00,454
No, Master Fu! Come on!

1658
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:02,295
[Crying]

1659

01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:51,796
If we were to have a boy, he could be
Wong Tei-Pau.

1840
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:53,841
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

1841
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:55,432
Nice. Both names are fine.

1842
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,637
But do we really need to pick one now?

1843
01:20:57,712 --> 01:20:58,644
What if I'm early?

1844
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,044
That shouldn't be a problem

1845
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:01,706
if you take it easy till I get back.

1846
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:02,646
Of course.

1847
01:21:02,717 --> 01:21:04,685

1848

Water the plants.

1849

I will!

Remember, get lots of rest.

1852

We'll be fine. Don't worry.

1853
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:14,318
Fei-Hong and I will be just fine.

1854

Go! We don't have any time to spare!

1855

Hurry!

1856
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:23,693
We've got to get Chin out of there.

1857
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:25,432
I hope he's still alive.

01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,939
What can we do?

1859
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,942
I'm going to stop them. I'm going to do
what I can!

1860
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,672
I gave my promise to Fu and Chin!

01:21:34,115 --> 01:21:35,047
Let's go.

I'm going to battle!

But...

1866
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:41,884
Wait, madam, you can't go in your
condition.

1867
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:45,517
What condition? Come on, I'm only
pregnant.

1868
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:49,029
Oh, madam, please. Think about the baby.

1869
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,860
What if something were to happen?

1870
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:53,764
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.

1871
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:56,428
I'll go get my students. Meet me at the
mill.

1872
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,335
Right. I'll gather up the men.

Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong.

You're with us, right? Yeah, OK.

But what if Father finds out?

1878
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,315
Oh, go on. Who cares now what your
father thinks?

1879
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:12,750
Only make me proud.

1880

I will. OK.

- Oh! Fei-Hong! - Yeah?

1882
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:19,558
Something for good luck.

1883
01:22:22,096 --> 01:22:23,586

and we won't let them out of China!

1893

You're helping them steal our history,
our culture.

You mean these?

1925

sell.

1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,956
Ten days ago a woman was
killed in unusual circumstances

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,396
How many will follow me in death?

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,031
What does Intelligence have on the
group? Raben was the squad leader.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,159
They were praised for their work there.
I want to see that place.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,359
There was no officer.
There were no corpses.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,751
The Taliban don't wear gold.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,595
It couldn't possibly have
been a suicide bomber.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,356
This is nonsense.
I understand that you've resigned.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,398
You've got the wrong man.
My wife and son are in the barracks.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,031
Someone hid the radio messages.
Who?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,835
We've searched everywhere.
There are no bodies.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,792
Denmark woke up to the biggest
government crisis in recent history.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,839
The Prime Minister sacked
the Minister of Defence because...

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,030
... he was the chief architect behind the
cover-up of civilian killings in Afghanistan.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,034
These killings appear to be linked
to the terrorism-related murders.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,078
We're on our way. Bye.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,076
Bilal has fled in a jeep. There's increased
surveillance at all border crossings

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,190
Raben's wife has disappeared
from the barracks along with Bilal.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,115
There's no trace of Raben, but in his
condition he can't interfere very much.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,590
That's certainly true. Where's Brix?

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,311
Bilal rented the apartment where
he planned the five murders.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,473
Brix is waiting for us.
See you there.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,313
Lund... What gives? You haven't
said a word all the way home.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,758
What's wrong?
Hello, hello.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,310
How sweet of you
to come and pick us up.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,996
Where have you been?
Prague. It was bang on.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,518
What did you do?
I had a horrible dream.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,754
I dreamed you were lying dead
somewhere. I couldn't revive you.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,799
I cried and Mark cried.
I'll get the car.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,715
I'll be glad when you finish work.

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,793
Bjørn and I will come to visit you
in Gedser.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,511
It's Lund.
Where did that nice man go?

33
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,960
We found the remains of two adults
and two children in an oven...

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,914
...which was hidden under debris, well
concealed, clearly not wanting to be found

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,958
Well done, Lund.
I've forwarded your fax.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,352
Each skull had a bullet hole.
Everything points to murder.

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,959
Did you find anything on Bilal?
Not too much, he wasn't the focus..

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,960
We found Per K. Møller's ID tags
...also hidden in the oven..

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,918
...the officer Raben saw.
Did you ask if anyone had seen him?

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,596
Did we get a list of the commandos?
That's not our concern anymore.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,594
The civilian killings will be
investigated by the army.

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,754
We're not finished with that
officer. I saw what he did.

43
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,313
There was something ritualistic about it,
that resembled the killings here at home.

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,916
That's not now the focus Lund.
The suspect may still be a commando.

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,278
In theory it may still be Strange.
Check Bilal.

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,069
Brix...I think we should leave.

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,429
Mama... It was a nightmare, right?
Everything is okay.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,917
We found the key to the apartment
together with a mobile...

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,356
...and the five broken ID tags.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,757
There are no other tenants in
the building.

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,710
It's only used as a garage for storage
and stuff.

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,316
Maybe we should wait for Strange.
No, let's just move on it.

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,079
Camera, disks, computer, explosives
..evidence connected with the murders.

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,360
We found the murder weapon used on
Dragsholm and the chaplain.

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,399
It's their DNA.
Bilal is a Muslim.

56
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,872
His hatred of the Islamists is greater
than anyone ever imagined.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,113
He hates Islamists more than anyone.
He saw Raben's unit as traitors because...

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,638
...they wanted to reveal the civilian killings.
Bilal came up with the Moslem League...

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,031
and tried to wipe out Kodmani's group.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,115
He was inspired by military history.

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,349
Dragsholm was the first victim,
because she wanted to reopen the case.

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,799
They met a few months ago, and
he rented this place shortly after.

63
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,909
He arranged everything and used
hotmail and the name Per K. Møller.

64
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,436
He rented a post-box
with the same name.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,876
How did Bilal know Per K. Møller?

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,110
From Team Aegir.

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,829
Has anyone seen Bilal coming and going?
Do we have his fingerprints, DNA?

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,231
He was very careful. It's very clean that way

69
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,996
The key is the only evidence
that links the murders to Bilal.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,234
He got the colonel arrested because he 
wanted to examine and destroy radio logs.

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,153
Afterwards, he left with Louise Raben.

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,348
Radio messages? The officer?
Isn't getting Bilal important enough for you?

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,390
He can lead us to the officer.
He doesn't have to be the murderer.

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,076
Why would Bilal hide the key and
 the mobile at the barracks?

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,519
Who tipped you off and got you to do
a search?  You were in Afghanistan.

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,399
We still don't know who 'Faith brother'
was. Dragsholm said she found the officer.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
We can't get the list of commandos.

78
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,433
Lund..all the evidence we need is all here

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,594
This proves nothing. Raben was right.
He accused Strange.

80
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,834
Lund! Because you went away, I
double-checked on Strange.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,879
All the military authorities confirmed
independently that Strange was...

82
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,398
...demobilized a long time before.
What the hell is wrong with you?

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,076
What's wrong with you?

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,676
Perhaps because I haven't slept.

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,910
Jet lag.

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,234
I have a feeling that there's
something about me you like.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,473
But you have a strange way
of showing  it.

88
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,991
Now we've cleared the air, so...
Of course I'm sorry if...

89
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,280
Where do we go from here?
We need to find Bilal?

90
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,117
Yes. We must also question Søgaard
about the radio messages.

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,512
If it's Bilal, it must be
because he hates the Islamists.

92
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,071
The video was posted
exactly as Ramadan ended.

93
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,518
The man must be an extremist
in the opposite direction.

94
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
If it is Bilal, he didn't have to go very far
to get the idea...

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
The Muslim league.

96
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,355
His jeep was seen on the bridge,
heading towards Fynen.

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,279
Any clues? No. She was focussed
on the same thing as you.

98
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,911
My daughter is missing.
What are you doing to find her?

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,155
Bilal may be hiding more?
Ask military HQ.

100
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,030
Do you know where Bilal is?
No, otherwise I'd go there.

101
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,194
Are we ready?
Did you know he hates Islamists?

102
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,993
We fought the same enemy.
He seemed to be the perfect soldier.

103
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,356
Look! It seems to look different now.
Let us know if you hear anything...

104
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,910
...also about Jens Peter Raben.

105
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,799
Well, Jonas...get your coat.

106
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,353
Are you going outside to play.
Go with Joakimand and his parents...

107
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,629
...to take a trip to the zoo.
When you get back, mom will be here.

108
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,349
I know. Dad says that too.

109
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,479
It's a secret.
He's waiting for you outside at the gate.

110
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,031
Did the police find anything?
The police don't know a damn thing.

111
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,274
Bilal isn't in any of the buildings.
You must have an idea.

112
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,479
It's Jarnvig. Hold on.
Have you contacted the barracks?

113
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,270
Stay away.
We need to help each other.

114
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,479
It's your fault!
She tried to help you.

115
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,155
Stay away.
You've caused enough misery. Hello?

116
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,589
We have to fight the enemy.
The enemy isn't us.

117
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,230
Where are you?
I've only done my duty.

118
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,157
Where is Louise?
I'm not to blame.

119
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,758
Bilal, come back. 

120
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,554
Why did you betray me? 

121
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,555
No. The police found evidence.

122
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,654
Someone is trying to frame me make
it look like it was me.

123
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,355
You need to come in and we can deal..

124
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,210
Call General Arild and say he needs to
get me out of here, right now.

125
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,711
Give up now..

126
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,349
Let me talk to Louise.

127
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,050
Let me talk to the general

128
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,251
 We won't do a damn thing until we hear her voice.

129
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,714
Louise...

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,875
We drove three or four hours.
Somewhere remote..

131
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,476
You fucking pig..

132
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,036
I'll call you tonight. If you
contact the police, she dies.

133
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,311
She said they drove 3 - 4 hours.
Somewhere remote..

134
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,519
Where can that be?
Maybe a military facility.

135
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,913
There are a number in Zealand,
but they're only an hour away.

136
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,551
Bilal, let me go.
Bilal What's wrong with you?

137
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,679
The prime minister knew I had something
on him. The Minister of Defence...

138
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,315
...wanted to reveal everything at the
meeting, but the Prime Minister blamed us.

139
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,316
He will stop at nothing to avert blame
 from himself and push it on me and  Rossing

140
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,436
The Minister of Defence refuses
 to speak about any of it

141
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,195
How could the Prime Minister know?
He was warned.

142
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,636
You detained me overnight for no reason.

143
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,351
Is national security not reason enough?
I haven't compromised national security..

144
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,310
Let's take the key points one by one.

145
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,773
A confidential Intelligence memo
was leaked from your office.

146
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,074
That has never been proved..

147
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,157
You talked to a suspended police officer.
Sarah Lund.  About what?

148
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,558
It was her mothers wedding..

149
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,911
You visited Frode Monberg, who
subsequently took his own life.

150
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,598
Your secretary accessed information illegally from
another department at your behest...

151
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,309
You undermined Intelligence
investigations.

152
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,153
You even had König fired.

153
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,915
You defended Islamist associations.

154
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,573
You had contact with a person
inside the PFLP...

155
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:13,874
Who..when?

156
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,519
...a journalist, formerly employed by
Ministry of Defence, Connie Vemmer.

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,470
Everything indicates that during
war-time you have undermined...

158
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,077
the elected Government
and our democracy.

159
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,917
Whether Afghan civilians were slain,
has nothing to do with it.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,358
Do you maintain your accusations
against the prime minister?

161
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:50,480
No. I'll go even further.
He's the traitor.

162
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,868
What's going on here?

163
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,869
Tell me what's going on...

164
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,396
Are you okay?
Yes. What happened?

165
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,270
We've been informed of a discovery
in Afghanistan, as you shall see.

166
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,673
Found by Sarah Lund. The police are
currently looking for a Danish soldier.

167
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,516
He committed the murders, to prevent
the investigation of civilian killings.

168
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,356
And the officer who did this?
The military is working on it.

169
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,469
It's going to come out now..Why 
didn't they find the bodies at first?

170
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,575
I'll arrange a meeting
without the Prime Minister.

171
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,276
I think right now we have something solid

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,512
You can get what you want
if you play your cards right.

173
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,958
The Prime Minister is fireproof and in a strong
position.The Minister of Defence withheld ...

174
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,793
I heard that yesterday.

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,555
It was the Prime Minister who
ordered you out of here.

176
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,998
Well let's get his wishes followed quickly.
So..let's meet with the group.

177
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,476
Are you back in parliament?
Do you support the government?

178
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,395
Will you continue your accusations?
What did Intelligence say?

179
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,949
Hello, Buch. Good to see you.
Yes, thanks. Good to see you too.

180
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,319
Excuse the mess. I've been busy
I've been away.

181
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,393
Yesterday, we had our problems.

182
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,998
But the need to protect the party was paramount.
At the expense of truth?

183
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,914
lndeed. But now we know a lot more.

184
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,198
We want to give you
an unreserved apology.

185
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,592
Excellent. We must look forward
and act to do something quickly.

186
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,335
There are two possibilities. Either
the Prime Minister resigns...

187
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:53,236
in the face of this unacceptable cover
 up and does the right thing

188
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,237
and he falls on his sword, or we 
gather up enough support..

189
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,197
...and we force him to do so.

190
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,639
Start the process, Gita ring round and find out how
many party MP's want to get rid of him.

191
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,032
There will have to be a dissolvement and elections

192
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,159
Yes, of course that's how it works..
It's not necessary.

193
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,395
The Minister of Defence said
Gert is the architect behind this.

194
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,396
I am right to do demand..

195
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:18,597
Don't you understand that nothing is
going to stick to the Prime Minister

196
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:23,798
The way it stands is that Rossing is prepared to take
 all the blame and not say a word about it

197
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,278
...and your predecessor, Monberg,
is also to blame 100% all the way

198
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,879
Minister..you can't win on this,
we can't defeat him.

199
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,873
The Prime Minister wants to talk to you.
He's planning a cabinet shuffle.

200
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,511
Rumour has it that you'll get
a nice promotion.

201
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,777
You don't want to dissolve this corrupt
 parliament. Get out of here.

202
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:48,378
Buch..listen.

203
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,589
I understand you're happy with your job.
An election now would shatter the party.

204
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,198
Buch, I'll have a word with Krabbe.
Yes, you seem to side with Krabbe a lot..

205
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,199
Is he the best hope we have as a
 guardian of our democracy?

206
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,319
Krabbe is fully in line with the Prime
Minister.  Until I've talked to him.

207
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,631
Thank you very much. Good luck. Bye.
Thank's for coming..come come come come.

208
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,632
It can't be Bilal, I've known
 him since training school

209
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,916
Do you know any contacts?
Friends, family?

210
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,676
None outside the military. It can't
possibly be Bilal.

211
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,893
Our technicians have examined all the logs and
confirmed that some messages were deleted.

212
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:26,394
So someone who knew their way around
the system could have done it

213
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,076
Who was responsible?
Yes, Bilal. But...

214
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,758
...there were civilian killings.
And there was an officer.

215
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,596
Bilal covered up reports.
Tell us what you know.

216
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,797
I didn't know about the messages.

217
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,351
Like you never knew or
 talked to Dragsholm.

218
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,636
You'll have to ask Bilal.

219
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,515
You must've known about the
message five days earlier.

220
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:56,516
No, wasn't my remit

221
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,595
Commandos went into that village for a reason
Who were those people, why were they killed

222
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,189
No idea. Did Dragsholm
mention commandos?

223
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,353
Did they withdraw? Was someone left at the village?
I don't know, dammit.

224
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,918
The killer called himself Per K. Møller and 
used that identity. Did Bilal know him?

225
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,278
Not personally.
Was Bilal there when he died?

226
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,874
No.

227
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,430
Was anyone there from the commandos?
I don't think so.

228
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,799
He was alone when the incident happened,
and was brought to the ISAF hospital.

229
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,915
The Military Hospital in Lashkar Gar?
Yes. I think so.

230
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,471
And if he had ID tags on?
It's usual they would..

231
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,431
...be taken off and sent to
relatives or placed in the coffin.

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,270
Lund...

233
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,313
Hey, what's happening? Hello!
They've found the jeep on Fynen.

234
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,828
Bilal switched license plates on the jeeps.
We've bugged Jarnvig's phone.

235
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,949
Bilal called him from north of Copenhagen,
we're working on a precise location now..

236
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,989
What did Bilal say?

237
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,990
The Colonel had to find the 
solution to the situation.

238
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,755
The Colonel and Raben are
working together on this now

239
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,390
We'll try to stop them.
Bilal will have a place to hide.

240
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,632
What military bases are in that area?

241
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,236
Look for something remote, out of the way

242
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,520
There's a deserted military
facility from the Cold War era.

243
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,041
Has it been checked?

244
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,990
Get in touch with Fred Holst. He's a
doctor at the ISAF hospital in Lashkar Gar.

245
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,157
Ask if he can find out what
happened to Per K's ID tags.

246
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,158
We need to know if they
were with the body

247
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,159
Lund..come on now.

248
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,148
Oh, ask him to check if there were any commandos 
hospitalised the same time or before the incident

249
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,249
Yes, I'm on it..

250
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,111
We can't keep looking. Call the police.
Drive on.

251
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,750
Arild may negotiate
something with Bilal.

252
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,674
We're going through.
He's not here, damn.

253
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,316
Stop!

254
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,590
Get the police.

255
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,436
The People's Party won't support
the government at any price.

256
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,388
We always go for the truth.

257
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,953
You're welcome. What now?
I've already spoken with you.

258
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,079
I wanted to call you,
but I have a meeting.

259
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,759
Tell me you'll join the opposition
and overthrow the government.

260
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,278
Krabbe, We had an agreement. The Prime
Minister can't be allowed to stay on.

261
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,238
They've found evidence of civilian killings which
the Prime Minister must have known about..

262
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,238
The Minister of Defence has already accepted
responsibility and he takes the blame, ok.

263
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,188
Krabbe...Krabbe..
Hey. Hello...Krabbe wait..

264
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,033
What's going on?

265
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,159
The polls were favourable when Muslims
were thought to be the killers.

266
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,995
I had lots of discussions
with the press about it.

267
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,789
In retrospect, perhaps it wasn't
such a good idea.

268
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,193
I don't think resorting to elections
is the wisest course right now.

269
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,509
Thomas, I don't know yet.

270
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,516
I refuse to give it all to the opposition
without thinking about it first.

271
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,153
Your grandfather was in the Resistance.
You said he fought for rights and freedoms..

272
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,552
The Prime Minister did what?
He dismissed the Minister of Defense....

273
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,235
...once he knew the truth.

274
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,672
Did you brief him? I informed you,
then you went to the Prime Minister...

275
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,119
...because you were scared to death
of those idiotic polls.

276
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,274
What are you talking about?
I was at a party meeting all day.

277
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,911
You're the only one I told, beside
my confidants.

278
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,471
You know, Thomas?
You can't trust anyone.

279
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,909
It's not the first time your personnel
have been led down the garden path.

280
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,594
I'll call you.

281
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,159
The Prime Minister wants to meet.
I said no.

282
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,189
Who prepared the papers yesterday?
Plough.

283
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,533
What about here, any secretaries? 

284
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:24,534
No, why?

285
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:27,535
So nobody here who may have alerted
the prime minister about the papers?

286
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,077
No, I had the documents while Plough
was over in the Cabinet Office.

287
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,351
It was about the post in Skopje.
Ask him when he returns, he'll be back soon

288
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:50,074
On my first day here I found a file in my 
papers about the Dragsholm murder.

289
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,553
Monberg's Intelligence memo...
Could anyone have leaked it?

290
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,713
No..no..Plough said it had
vanished into thin air.

291
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,396
Where's the information on the
group of soldiers?

292
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,790
Thomas, what's going on?

293
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,155
Did Plough say anything to you about the
soldiers or the Minister of Defense?

294
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,834
No. Why?

295
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,317
What's going on?

296
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,476
Thomas..Plough was angry at the Minister of Defence.

297
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,758
He didn't care if you went after the Prime Minister.
Plough couldn't have done it.

298
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,233
Does Plough have a son?
Yes. But he died last year.

299
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,039
In a car accident?

300
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,998
I still have a chauffeur,
so call and say that I'm coming.

301
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,795
They're down there. He has my daughter.
Where is Raben?

302
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,111
He went after him.
Is he armed?

303
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,195
Monitor all the exits.
Tell Brix that nobody should go in.

304
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,516
Louise!

305
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,355
Step forward, so I can see you.

306
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,513
Step forward, or I'll put
a bullet in her head.

307
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,477
Put the gun down

308
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,393
Where's the colonel?
He said you wouldn't look for me.

309
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,473
Let her go. Now you have me.

310
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,272
Just kept your mouth shut.

311
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,150
There were no civilian casualties.
They were Taliban collaborators.

312
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,711
Bilal, calm down. Put the gun away.
We're going to talk about it.

313
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,870
Put the gun down. We'll go outside
and talk about it.

314
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,068
I've only done my duty.
She has nothing to do with it.

315
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,435
She's innocent.

316
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,789
I can only help you,
if you let her go now.

317
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,630
Go.

318
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,192
I've only done my duty.
What exactly did you do?

319
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,070
You hid radio messages.
Do you know who the officer was?

320
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:48,571
Put it down now..

321
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,833
Good.

322
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,073
Lund, something's wrong.
Come. Now we'll walk out of here.

323
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,872
Lund!

324
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,670
For God, king and country.

325
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,156
Plough...

326
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,276
Plough?

327
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,148
His name was Hans Christian.

328
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,791
Hans Christian Vedel Plough.
Vedel after my wife.

329
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,428
In the army he was called HC.

330
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,151
He was one from the group who got out.
He escaped with superficial wounds.

331
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,393
But when he came home, we discovered
he had a problem.

332
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,509
He said there had been
an episode in the village.

333
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,389
Something about an officer
and civilian killings.

334
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,680
We supported the investigation which
concluded that it didn't happen.

335
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,470
My son's demeanor changed.
And he became increasingly ill.

336
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,509
A year ago, he drove into
oncoming traffic on the highway...

337
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,638
...and was killed.

338
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,271
My marriage broke down,
and I buried myself in debt.

339
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,830
Until the lawyer Dragsholm reappeared...

340
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,870
...to meet with my minister.
She had a breakthrough in the case.

341
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:11,797
She identified the officer.
I suddenly realised...

342
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,919
...that my son had told the truth.

343
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,512
I trusted Monberg, when he said
he would do something about it.

344
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,275
But Dragsholm was killed
and nothing happened.

345
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,319
Instead, he tried to end his life.

346
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,508
I put you on the track of the cover-up.
I leaked the Intelligence memo.

347
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,949
I made sure Karina took Monberg's private calendar.
Made sure that you found it out and would act.

348
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,956
Dammit Plough, you should have given
the information to the police.

349
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,592
I had no choice. The Minister
of Defence pulled strings.

350
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,515
I had no proof until yesterday.
It was a relief for me...

351
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,071
...to give it to the Prime Minister.
He responded decisively.

352
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,993
Very different from you.

353
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,676
Why were you so sure?
Monberg told me that....

354
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,549
...he had discussed it
with the Minister of Defense.

355
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,554
When he returned,
the case was closed.

356
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,472
Thanks for the loan.
It wasn't exactly my taste.

357
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,350
Too bad it's over for me,
but you and Karina will do fine.

358
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,868
The meeting about the anti-terrorism
package will be in the cabinet office .

359
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:46,549
You'll be the crown prince. Karina will take over 
the Ministry. I'll go to the New York consulate.

360
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,633
It was in Monberg's private calendar.

361
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,351
If someone put a lid on the matter,
it was the Prime Minister.

362
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,631
Monberg said it was the Minister
of Defence. He had you fooled.

363
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,110
Do you want to know more?
What are you doing?

364
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,196
Now ,I think you should go.
You've helped the wrong way.

365
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,069
You helped the man who caused
your son's death.

366
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,229
The right people were punished
That was what I owed my son.

367
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,392
Go now, damn it!

368
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,638
The military prosecutor will believe
you this time.

369
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,158
You should drop all the accusations
against the policeman.

370
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,995
Your other accusations were true.

371
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,312
You were imprisoned for two years,
on false grounds.

372
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,771
Whatever punishment you get for your crimes ...

373
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,672
...any time that you have already served
falsely will be taken into consideration

374
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,276
...you've served too long
because of a mistake.

375
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,035
You can look forward to
being released very soon.

376
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,670
I encourage you to sue for damages.

377
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,515
Can we have some privacy here?
Of course.

378
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,356
I have more good news. You will
be transferred to Horserød...

379
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,593
...where you'll have a family home,
so you can be together.

380
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,759
We'll talk.

381
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,595
I'll do anything.
Not necessarily.

382
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,556
I just want you to come home.

383
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,991
Every stone in that village must be
turned over. Keep me informed.

384
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,671
Any news about General Arild?
No. The new team is meeting tonight.

385
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,310
They'd like to welcome you back General.

386
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,349
Thanks, but I'll do ok by myself.
Your daughter wants to talk to you.

387
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,876
She's over at the house, packing.

388
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,390
We're leaving now.
Where to?

389
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,590
Up to Jens. We've been allowed
to be with him tonight.

390
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,356
We need to get away from here.
Where are you staying then?

391
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,433
We'll arrange that with his dad,
Jonas huh?

392
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,194
See you, Dad.
Be good.

393
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,111
I'm going.

394
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,236
Come on, baby.

395
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,075
Hello there..

396
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,915
I'm glad that nothing happened
to Louise.

397
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,108
What a story. Bilal made sure
that none of us knew anything.

398
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,158
Not even you?
No.

399
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,676
If you know something,
you need to tell me now.

400
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,119
I'll do everything I can
to get this mess cleared up.

401
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,796
It's a bit more complicated than that.
What's so complicated

402
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,279
Either you lied to me, the police and the
whole world. Or not.

403
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,750
The police didn't get any information...

404
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,879
...until we thought there had been
civilian killings.

405
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,476
What are you saying?
The police suspected a single commando.

406
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,155
I confirmed that
he had been sent home.

407
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,835
But it wasn't the whole truth.

408
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,836
He was sent there again shortly after.
But the mission was top secret.

409
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,838
Therefore, all the radio messages were
deleted. There's no evidence of his existence.

410
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,755
I checked his CV
when the police asked questions.

411
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,356
The guy was missing for a few days...

412
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,593
...but that doesn't
make him a war criminal.

413
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,595
We had received intelligence that the
father was a Taliban sympathizer.

414
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,228
Stop

415
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,837
You should've never shown up here
again. Stay away from my people.

416
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,798
Is that understood?

417
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,150
I'll put in a good word for you so you
can continue to stay at the barracks.

418
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,111
Make sure the next team
is as strong as the last one was.

419
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,031
The lawyers would like to see the
files. Can we take them? Of course.

420
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,034
Did the doctor in Lashkar Gar get
my message?

421
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,829
He has your number.
Should I contact him again?

422
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,391
No. It doesn't matter. But there
actually was something else.

423
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,350
When we searched the barracks
the first time, a few days ago.

424
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,436
Why didn't we find anything there?
There was nothing. Bilal planted it later

425
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,311
Did you check the room and the locker?
Yes, we searched everywhere.

426
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,119
Did you find out how
Dragsholm located the officer?

427
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,799
No. We've reviewed her records.
Meetings with clients, lawyers and police.

428
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,478
Meetings with the police?
Yes. With the prosecutors office.

429
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,318
So she had contacted us
before she was murdered?

430
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,870
Not about any of this.

431
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,068
She didn't want contact with the police.
She had a private security service.

432
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,569
Hmm..yes I guess so..

433
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,391
Can I have the box?

434
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,152
Who led the first search in the barracks,
near the lockers?

435
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,233
I don't know anymore.
Wasn't it Strange? Think now..

436
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,995
Yes, it was Strange. Why?

437
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,077
Can I have that box?
Yes.

438
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,954
Lund...The powers that be told me that
I should commend you. Well done!

439
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,477
I had my doubts when Brix sent for you.

440
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,839
And that continued after I met you.

441
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,393
Chances are that you won't be sent
back to Gedser. Congratulations.

442
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,438
Brix...

443
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,229
The day Strange was at the refugee
center in Elsinore...

444
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,712
Was it checked?
When I ran after the offender.

445
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,714
Yes. we were busy..
but it was checked.

446
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,350
Where is he?
He's driving Raben to Horserød...What now?

447
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,197
Lennart... are you going to say goodbye
to my husband? He has to leave early

448
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,989
Don't look disappointed.

449
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,554
I'll take him back.
Go up and get yourself a beer.

450
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,430
Are you sure?
He's no longer difficult. Just save one for me.

451
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,479
I'm going.
Okay.

452
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,269
We need to talk. Let me drive.
What?

453
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,512
Give me the key.
Yes, yes.

454
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,275
Shall we hear some music?

455
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,079
You have something to talk about?
Later.

456
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,028
I'll show you something.
Okay.

457
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,594
Horserød is straight ahead.
My wife and son are waiting for me.

458
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,998
What is it?

459
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,553
There's something wrong.
I think Brix is hiding something.

460
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,632
Brix?
Come on, let's go.

461
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,635
Lund, dammit. What now?
Lund!

462
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,512
I want to be alone with you,
but it's not very romantic.

463
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,037
This is a memorial for resistance
fighters. War Heroes...

464
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,273
...for whom Bilal had great respect.

465
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,078
Yes?

466
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,712
He would never put Dragsholm here.
He saw her as a traitor. Whoever beat...

467
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,911
...Dragsholm and the others to death
wouldn't care about such things.

468
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,030
What does Brix have to do with that?
Brix is protecting the murderer.

469
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,838
What?

470
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,358
Dragsholm was scared before she
was killed. She lived right over there.

471
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,196
The house was packed with alarms.
She had sensors installed in the garden.

472
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,876
She had her own private security.

473
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,318
But she didn't call the police
a single time.

474
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,075
Maybe she was under protection.
No.

475
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,471
She found the captain, the officer...

476
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:55,158
...and found out he worked for us.
That explains her silence.

477
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:01,270
That explains why we found the mobile at the barracks
when the search was conducted by him

478
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,150
Although we had searched just a few days earlier
and it wasn't found. Can't you see it?

479
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:12,589
The perpetrator planted
those things during the search.

480
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,993
But Lund ... I led the search.
I didn't plant anything.

481
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,915
Good. Then it must be someone
on the other team.

482
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,550
I don't know what to say.

483
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,237
Have you talked to Brix about this?
No. Not yet.

484
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,359
He'll send me back to Gedser.

485
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,878
Okay, so I think we have to talk with Brix.

486
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,309
You'll definitely not go back to Gedser.
But until then we'll maintain...

487
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,871
...that Bilal dragged her over the
railway yard and hung her up.

488
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,476
Ok, Come on. Let's get going.

489
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,957
How do you know...?

490
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,029
...that she was dragged over the track?
We never found that out.

491
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,317
Come on, that's...

492
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,431
What do you mean?

493
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,158
Why?

494
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,595
I was at a minor court in summer.
It was hot.

495
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,070
She saw my tattoo.

496
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,315
I don't know why,
but she started asking questions.

497
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,668
Like you...

498
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,032
Yes? Holst here.
Is Sarah Lund there?

499
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,317
She is just away for a moment.
What's it about

500
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,430
I'm calling from Afghanistan. I am a
physician at the ISAF military hospital.

501
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,751
I haven't found out anything about the ID tags.
I'll let her know.

502
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,118
However,  a commando was hospitalised...
at the same time from a different unit...

503
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,556
...with some wound's but he was soon flown back home.

504
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,030
Fine. Thank you.

505
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,795
It may not be true.
I was with him every day.

506
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,919
Plough was only thinking of revenge.

507
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,359
He must have said something...
Not a damn thing.

508
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,593
No, Plough believes
he did the right thing.

509
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,957
Thomas, we know it was the Prime Minister.

510
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:46,958
After all you've been through
you can't give it up now

511
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,432
I do give a damn what Plough
is arranging for my future.

512
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,673
I won't give up.
Good. What do we do?

513
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,417
Just a moment.

514
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:00,418
The press is ready and the ministers
are arriving for the meeting.

515
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,708
Say we're coming. Line up as many
microphones as possible.

516
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,518
Hi, Thomas. Come inside.

517
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,993
We'd like to present the Ministerial
re-shuffle this evening.

518
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,314
I'm just glad I can talk to you.
I'm sorry for that night with Intelligence.

519
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,600
I owe you an explanation.
I won't listen to your explanation.

520
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,311
Keep your ministerial post.
Plough has told me.

521
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,758
He also talked about my predecessor
and the Minister of Defence.

522
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,549
I'll unveil it at the press conference.

523
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,475
The turn of parliament, the police
and Intelligence comes later.

524
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,078
I'm going to give them
every confidential document.

525
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,879
You covered up the murders.

526
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,477
People were killed because 
of your political ambitions.

527
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,350
I know you're behind it.
And I'm going to prove it.

528
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,879
We haven't covered up civilian killings.

529
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,710
We could probably survive if we had...
The public can forgive anything..

530
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,395
The officer was the problem.

531
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,398
The officer wasn't there.

532
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,997
The incident occurred during a top secret mission.

533
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,357
We didn't have
parliamentary approval.

534
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,559
Commando missions require
parliamentary approval.

535
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,678
Reality is, it's impossible.

536
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,791
It's not five minutes before the info
is on the streets in Kabul.

537
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,832
You've always known.
You knew who the officer was.

538
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,197
I had to choose. It wasn't difficult.

539
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,593
At that time, we lacked
money and troops.

540
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,437
You could have stopped it
there and then...Get real!

541
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,798
We're at war!
What could we do?

542
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,830
Can discussions and a show of hands
make inroads in the fight against terrorism?

543
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,870
Will a scandal console families whose
sons have come home in coffins?

544
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,233
The Taliban is getting stronger.
At times we need to ignore democracy...

545
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,916
...to carry on the struggle
FOR democracy.

546
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,517
You ought to be the first
to appreciate that.

547
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,200
I appointed you because I figured you were 
harmless. But now I want to keep you.

548
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:09,195
If you think I've made mistakes,
help me so it doesn't happen again.

549
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,716
You're insane.

550
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,510
When I tell this to Krabbe
and the public, you're finished.

551
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,832
Go ahead.
But there's nothing to tell.

552
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,516
And you won't be alone this evening
when the new cabinet is sworn in.

553
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,038
Say hello to the MPs who agree
the most important thing is...

554
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,636
...that we continue the fight.

555
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,038
You beat them all to death.

556
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,796
Killing an innocent is better than
having doubts about killing the enemy.

557
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,192
Haven't you learned that yet?

558
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:13,276
You can't get away with it here.
I've escaped from worse things.

559
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,513
And it was you who shot the little girl.

560
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,673
You left that out of your statement.

561
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,836
You forgot it.
You're lying.

562
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,952
You shot her.

563
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,114
Suddenly you began to snivel.
Don't you remember it? Well?

564
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,750
What? What?

565
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,558
It's Strange. Raben has escaped.
He's shot Lund.

566
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,077
Raben, take the gun.

567
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,715
Don't move.

568
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,031
Stay down.

569
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:54,032

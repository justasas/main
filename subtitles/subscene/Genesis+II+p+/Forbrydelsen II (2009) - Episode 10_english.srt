1
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,790
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,415
My blood will be shed.
And many will die along with me.

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,249
- What does Special Branch know?
- Raben was squad leader.

4
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,832
- They excelled in Afghanistan.
- I want to see that place.

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,624
No officer Perk. No corpses.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,749
A Taliban doesn't wear gold.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:34,165
Therefore, it couldn't have been
a suicide bomber.

8
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:40,124
- This is ridiculous!
- I gather you have resigned.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,582
You've got the wrong man!
My wife and son are at the barracks.

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:48,415
Bilal, someone erased
the radio messages. Who?

11
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,374
We've searched the place.
There are no bodies!

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,874
THE KILLING

13
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:07,999
The Government is facing
its worst crisis ever.

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,082
The Prime Minister
has fired the Minister of Defense

15
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:18,582
for covering up the killings
of civilians in Afghanistan.

16
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,790
The killings seem to be connected
to the terrorism case.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,915
We're on our way. Bye.

18
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,457
Bilal escaped in a jeep.

19
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,249
The entire force is after him
and the borders are guarded.

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:39,582
Raben's wife is missing
from the barracks. Bilal took her.

21
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,749
There's no trace of Raben,
but he can't do much in his condition.

22
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,249
You're probably right.
Where is Brix?

23
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,207
Bilal rented a flat
where he planned the five killings.

24
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,582
- Brix is expecting us.
- I'll meet you there.

25
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:06,790
Lund? You haven't said a word
during the entire journey.

26
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,957
- What's wrong?
- Hello there!

27
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,707
How sweet of you
to come and meet us.

28
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,749
- Where have you been?
- In Prague. Living it up!

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,749
What have you been up to?
I had a terrible nightmare.

30
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:32,207
I dreamt you were lying alone and lifeless.
I couldn't revive you.

31
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,499
- I was crying, Mark was crying.
- I'll get the car.

32
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:41,499
I'm so glad
you no longer have that job.

33
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,124
Bjørn and I will
visit you often in Gedser.

34
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,999
- Lund here.
- Why did your nice partner leave?

35
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,290
We found the remains
of two adults and two children.

36
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:57,415
They had been burnt in an oven
which was hidden by debris.

37
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,499
Well done, Lund.
I passed your fax on.

38
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,624
Each skull has a bullet hole.
It looks like an execution.

39
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,915
- Anything on Bilal?
- We found Per K. Møller's dog tag.

40
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:15,124
- The one Raben saw on that officer.
- Ask if anyone here has seen him.

41
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,040
- Did we get a Special Forces list?
- That is no longer our concern.

42
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,207
The killings of civilians
will be investigated by the army.

43
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,415
We're not finished with the officer.
I saw what he had done.

44
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:35,374
It was like a ritual killing.
Like the killings here.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,165
- Focus on the present.
- It could be an officer.

46
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,582
- It could be Strange.
- Check Bilal.

47
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:46,874
- Brix!
- We'd like to get off soon.

48
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:56,332
Mum... It was just a nightmare.
Everything is all right.

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,499
We found the key to the flat,
a mobile phone

50
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,040
and the broken-off halves
of the five dog tags.

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,999
There are no other tenants
in the building.

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,790
It's used only
for parking and storage.

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,874
- Shouldn't we wait for Strange?
- No, let's get on with it.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,832
Camera, discs,
a computer, explosives.

55
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:29,207
They all match
the evidence from the killings.

56
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,790
We found the murder weapons
used on Dragsholm and the chaplain.

57
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,832
Forensics confirmed it's their DNA.
Bilal is a Muslim.

58
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,832
But he hates Islamists
more than anyone knew.

59
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,374
He saw Raben's squad as traitors

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,749
for attempting to reveal
the killing of civilians.

61
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,832
Bilal invented the Muslim League

62
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,707
and tried to frame
Kodmani and the like.

63
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,790
He was inspired
by his knowledge of military history.

64
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:09,165
Dragsholm was his first victim.
She wanted to re-open the case.

65
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,707
They met a few months ago.
Then he rented these premises.

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:20,165
He arranged it all, using Hotmails
and Per K. Møller's name.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,582
He opened a PO Box
in the same name.

68
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:28,707
- How did Bilal know Per K. Møller?
- From Team Ægir.

69
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,540
Did anybody see Bilal?
Any fingerprints or DNA?

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,915
No. He must have taken great care.

71
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,999
The only proof that this is Bilal's
is the key at the barracks.

72
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:47,457
He gets the Colonel fired because he
was investigating old radio messages.

73
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,374
Then he takes off
with Louise Raben.

74
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,040
- Radio messages? From the officer?
- Is Bilal of no significance?

75
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:01,665
Yes. He can help us find the officer.
But he may not be the killer.

76
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,999
Why would Bilal hide a key
and a mobile phone at the barracks?

77
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,415
Who called it up
to make you search the place?

78
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:15,207
- You were in Afghanistan.
- We don't know who Faith Fellow is.

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,707
Dragsholm said
she'd found the officer.

80
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:24,249
We won't get that Special Forces list.
It's not our jurisdiction.

81
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,040
This proves nothing.
Raben's been right in everything.

82
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:34,415
- And he accused Strange...
- I double-checked Strange!

83
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,915
All the army authorities confirm

84
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,207
that Strange was demobilised
long before the incident.

85
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,415
What the hell is wrong with you?

86
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,665
What is the matter with you?

87
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,165
Maybe it's lack of sleep.
Jet lag.

88
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:39,832
Sometimes I get the feeling
you like some things about me.

89
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:44,374
But you have
a bloody odd way of showing it!

90
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,082
Now that we have cleared the air...

91
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm really sorry, if...

92
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,790
Right. Where do we go from here?

93
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,915
- It's important to find Bilal.
- Yes.

94
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,249
And we must talk to Søgaard
about the radio messages.

95
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:10,415
If it's Bilal,
he must hate Islamists.

96
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:15,207
The video was sent
just at the end of the Ramadan.

97
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,790
He must be an extremist in reverse.

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,665
If it's Bilal,
he needn't look far for inspiration.

99
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,374
MUSLIM LEAGUE

100
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,665
The jeep was seen on the bridge,
heading for Funen.

101
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,832
- Have you no clues?
- No. Maybe she was on to something.

102
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,707
My daughter is missing.
What are you doing to find her?

103
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:03,165
- Could Bilal be hiding more?
- Ask Operative Command.

104
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,290
- Do you know where Bilal went?
- No! If I did, I'd be there!

105
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,957
- Are we done here?
- Did you know he hated Islamists?

106
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:21,707
We shared the same enemy.
He seemed the perfect soldier.

107
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,915
Look at this.

108
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:36,874
It doesn't seem so now.
Let us know, if you hear anything.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,540
Also concerning Jens Peter Raben.

110
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:48,790
Jonas... You've got your jacket on.
Have you been playing outside?

111
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:54,082
Joakim and his parents
are taking you to the zoo.

112
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:58,624
When you get back,
Mummy will probably be here.

113
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,915
I know. That's what Daddy says too.

114
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:07,165
It's a secret.
He's waiting for you by the fence.

115
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,957
- Have the police found anything?
- The police know nothing.

116
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,749
Bilal isn't at any of the facilities.
You must have some idea.

117
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:33,207
- Jarnvig. Just a moment.
- Did you contact the barracks?

118
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,249
She mustn't be hurt. Keep away.

119
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,040
- We must help each other.
- It's your fault!

120
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:46,332
She was helping you. Stay away.
You've done enough damage. Hello?

121
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,749
We must stick together
against the enemy.

122
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,040
We are not the enemy!

123
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,957
- Where are you?
- I only did my duty.

124
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,540
- Where is Louise?
- I won't take the blame.

125
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,582
- Bilal. Come back.
- Why did you turn against me?

126
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,499
- We didn't!
- The police found evidence.

127
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,457
- Someone is trying to frame me.
- Let Louise go!

128
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,999
Tell General Arild
to get me out of this!

129
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,165
What are you talking about?

130
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,457
- Let me talk to Louise.
- I'm talking to the Colonel!

131
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,374
We'll do nothing
until we hear from Louise.

132
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,457
- Louise?
- We drove for three to four hours.

133
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,457
- A place underground.
- Don't you touch her!

134
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,290
I'll call again this evening.

135
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,582
If you contact the police,
she dies.

136
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,999
She said a three to four hour drive.
A place underground.

137
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,457
- Where could they be?
- It could be a military facility.

138
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,832
There are many in North Zealand,
but that's only an hour away.

139
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:33,124
Bilal, let me go.
What's wrong with you?

140
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,290
The Prime Minister knew
I had something on him.

141
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,665
The Minister of Defense
was about to reveal it all

142
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,957
but the Prime Minister
put the blame on us.

143
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,540
The Minister of Defense
refuses to comment.

144
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,540
- How could the Prime Minister know?
- Someone warned him.

145
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,124
You've detained me all night,
for no reason.

146
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,040
- For the sake of national security.
- I've done nothing to jeopardise it.

147
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:06,207
Let's sum it all up
and see if it adds up to anything.

148
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,707
A confidential Special Branch memo
gets leaked from your office.

149
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,207
You met with a suspended
police officer, Sarah Lund. What for?

150
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,499
You visited the former Minister
of Justice, who then took his own life.

151
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:31,332
Your Personal Secretary
accessed data, illegally.

152
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,290
You undermined
Special Branch's investigation.

153
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,207
You fired König.

154
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:42,082
You defended Islamist organisations
and their rights.

155
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,082
You have been in contact
with a member of the PFLP.

156
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,165
Journalist, formerly employed in
the Defense Ministry, Connie Vemmer.

157
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,332
Everything indicates that you,
at a time of war

158
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:03,124
have been undermining the national
interest and our elected Government.

159
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,874
It doesn't enter in to it whether
or not civilian Afghans were killed.

160
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,207
Do you maintain your accusations
against the Prime Minister?

161
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:24,790
No. I'll do even worse.
He is the traitor!

162
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,915
What is going on?

163
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,499
Tell me what's happening!

164
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,124
- Are you all right?
- Yes. What is going on?

165
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,749
They found something in Afghanistan.
You should see this.

166
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:54,040
Sarah Lund found it. The police
are chasing a Danish soldier.

167
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:58,874
He committed the recent murders
to prevent the case from being solved.

168
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,957
- And the officer who did this?
- The army is taking care of it.

169
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,332
Why didn't they find the bodies,
in the first place?

170
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,915
Call a meeting with my parliamentary
party, but without the Prime Minister.

171
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,832
They're anxious to see you too.

172
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,415
You can get what you want
if you play your cards right.

173
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:26,499
There is nothing on the Prime Minister.
The Minister of Defense was lying.

174
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,790
That's what they all say.

175
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,082
The Prime Minister
wanted you out of here.

176
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,749
He'll get no brownie points.
We must arrange that meeting.

177
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,499
Are you back at Christiansborg?
Do you support the Government?

178
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:50,457
Do you maintain your accusations?
What did Special Branch want?

179
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:58,624
- Hi, Buch. Good to see you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

180
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,499
Excuse the mess.
I left in a bit of a hurry.

181
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,207
We were rather pro-active yesterday.

182
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:14,332
- But we had to protect the party.
- At the expense of the truth?

183
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,415
Yes, right.
But we are much the wiser for it.

184
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,957
On the part of the parliamentary party,
I wish to apologise.

185
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:27,540
Very well.
It's important to look ahead.

186
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,332
We must act quickly.
There are only two options.

187
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:37,457
Either the Prime Minister resigns,
or we force him to do so.

188
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:43,165
Gitta, you know the rules. Find out
how many it takes to topple him.

189
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,540
That would mean an election.

190
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,957
- Of course!
- There's no need for that.

191
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,832
The Minister of Defense said
Gert is behind all this.

192
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,374
He wants the Prime Minister
to take the blame.

193
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,415
We can blame
the Minister of Defense

194
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,374
and Monberg
to get this matter sorted out.

195
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,207
But there's no need to throw
the baby out with the bath water.

196
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:17,832
The Prime Minister wants to see you.
He is preparing a reshuffle.

197
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,290
Rumour has it
you may be promoted.

198
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,874
- You wanted us to sort it out.
- Leave!

199
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:35,249
- So you like being a minister!
- An election would ruin the party.

200
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,832
I'll talk to Krabbe. Is he really
the guardian of our democracy?

201
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,124
- Krabbe and the Prime Minister agree.
- Only until I've talked to him.

202
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,915
Thank you!
Goodbye. Chop, chop!

203
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:57,207
- Do you know Bilal's contacts?
- Friends, family?

204
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,499
- I don't know him that well.
- Contacts in the army?

205
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,290
- I don't know. It can't be Bilal.
- We have evidence.

206
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:10,332
Radio communications.
Some messages were deleted.

207
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:15,290
- Who was responsible?
- Bilal was, but...

208
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:21,165
Civilians were killed.
And an officer was there.

209
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,999
Bilal concealed the messages.
Tell us what you know.

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,624
I never knew about the messages.

211
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,582
Just like you had never
talked to Anne Dragsholm?

212
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,582
You'll have to ask Bilal.

213
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,832
The message, five days previously.
You must have known about that.

214
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,874
Special Forces were heading
for the village. Who were they?

215
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,249
- I don't know.
- Did Anne Dragsholm mention them?

216
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,165
- Did they split up?
- I don't know, damn it!

217
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,040
The killer used
Per K. Møller's identity.

218
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:11,415
- Did Bilal know him?
- Not personally.

219
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,707
- Was Bilal there when he died?
- No.

220
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,290
- Were Special Forces there?
- I wouldn't think so.

221
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,665
He was alone in the explosion
and was taken to the ISAF hospital.

222
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,374
- The one in Lashkar Gar?
- Yes, I believe so.

223
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:38,499
- Was he wearing his dog tag?
- Normally, a part gets broken off.

224
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,790
It is sent to the bereaved,
or put in the coffin.

225
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,457
Lund?

226
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:02,124
- Hey! Now what?
- They found the jeep.

227
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,499
No Bilal, no Louise Raben.

228
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,332
Bilal changed the number plates.

229
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,540
We've tapped
Colonel Jarnvig's phone.

230
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:16,957
Bilal phoned him from
somewhere north of Copenhagen.

231
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,249
- What did Bilal say?
- The Colonel must find a solution.

232
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,957
The Colonel and Raben
are chasing him.

233
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,999
- We're trying to stop them.
- Bilal must have a hiding place.

234
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,415
What military facilities
are there in the area?

235
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,832
We've got that covered.

236
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,582
There's a derelict
Cold War facility in this area.

237
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,624
Has that been checked?

238
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:54,540
Get Frederik Holst.
He's army surgeon at Lashkar Gar.

239
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:59,999
Ask him what happened
to Per K. Møller's dog tag.

240
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,040
Come on, Lund!

241
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:08,874
And ask if any Special Forces
officers were in hospital then.

242
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,832
Yes, will do.

243
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,457
We can't keep looking.
We must call the police.

244
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:23,540
- Drive on.
- Arild could cut a deal with Bilal.

245
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,749
- We'll continue.
- He's not here, damn it!

246
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,415
Stop!

247
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,749
Call the police.

248
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:58,624
The People's Party won't support
the Government at all costs.

249
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,332
We always aim to get to the truth.

250
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,582
You're welcome. Goodbye.

251
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,874
- What's up?
- I've left you a few messages.

252
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,290
I meant to call you back,
but I'm on my way to a meeting.

253
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,832
Just tell me,
if you'll join the Opposition

254
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,999
in bringing down the Government.

255
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:26,040
Damn it, Krabbe! We made a deal.
The Prime Minister mustn't stay in office.

256
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:31,415
The Prime Minister is guilty.
They found proof that civilians were killed.

257
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,415
You only have
the Minister of Defenses word for it.

258
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,374
He has chosen to take the blame.

259
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,665
Krabbe... Hey! Hello?

260
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,374
What is going on?

261
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:51,790
The polls were in our favour when
Muslims seemed to be the killers.

262
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,999
And I played it up in the press.

263
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,040
In retrospect, I'm not so sure
it was a good idea.

264
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:05,415
I don't think we'd be wise
to push for an election.

265
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,915
Thomas, I haven't decided yet.

266
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:17,957
But I won't give it all up to the Opposition
before thinking it over.

267
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:24,165
Your grandfather fought
in the Danish resistance...

268
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,957
The Prime Minister
did the right thing.

269
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:31,665
He gave the Minister of Defense
the boot the moment he knew the truth.

270
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:40,332
Did you spill the beans? I told you, and,
you went straight to the Prime Minister

271
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:45,124
because you were terrified
of those ridiculous polls.

272
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:51,082
What are you talking about?
I was at a party meeting all day.

273
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:55,082
You are the only one I told,
apart from people in my trust.

274
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,499
Do you know what, Thomas?
There is nobody here you can trust.

275
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,624
It won't be the first time
your staff lead you up the garden path.

276
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,832
I'll call you.

277
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:17,165
The Prime Minister's office
wants to call a meeting. I declined.

278
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:21,165
Good. Who prepared
the documents yesterday?

279
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,499
- Plough.
- Who else? Any secretaries?

280
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,040
No. Why?

281
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,374
Could anyone have warned
the Prime Minister?

282
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,499
No. I had the documents

283
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:35,499
while Plough popped over
to the Prime Minister's office.

284
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:42,582
It was about that post in Skopje.
Ask him when he gets back.

285
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,957
But I don't know where he is.

286
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:51,832
On my first day, I received
a file on the killing of Dragsholm.

287
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,249
Monberg's Special Branch memo.
Who leaked it?

288
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,582
Plough said it couldn't be traced.

289
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:07,540
Where is the information
on the military squad?

290
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,040
Thomas... What's going on?

291
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:18,374
Did Plough say anything about
the soldiers or the Minister of Defense?

292
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,915
No. Why?

293
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,249
What's going on?

294
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,540
I know Plough was angry
with the Minister of Defense.

295
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,124
He didn't want you
to go for the Prime Minister.

296
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,124
But it couldn't have been Plough!

297
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:43,832
- Does Plough have a son?
- He did. He died last year.

298
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,582
In a traffic accident?

299
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:52,915
If I still have a driver,
then tell him I'm on my way.

300
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,707
- In there! He has my daughter.
- Where's Raben?

301
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,915
- He ran after him.
- Is he armed?

302
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,582
Cover all exits.
Tell Brix nobody is to enter.

303
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,332
Louise!

304
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,999
Step forward,
so I can see you!

305
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,624
Step forward,
or I'll shoot her head off.

306
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,332
Put down your weapon.

307
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,165
Where's the Colonel?
I told you not to look for me.

308
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,457
Let her go.
You have me now.

309
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,082
If only you'd kept
your big mouth shut!

310
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:50,457
There were no civilian killings.
They were informers to the Taliban.

311
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:55,582
Bilal! Easy now. Put down the gun.
Let's talk this over. Put it down.

312
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:01,957
Put the gun down.
We'll walk out of here and talk it over.

313
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:08,290
- I merely did my duty.
- She has nothing to do with it.

314
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,415
She's not guilty.

315
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,124
I can't help you
unless you let her go.

316
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,124
Go.

317
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,332
- I merely did my duty.
- What exactly did you do?

318
00:29:55,583 --> 00:30:00,499
You erased some radio recordings.
Who was the officer? What were they?

319
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,540
Good...

320
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:18,165
- Lund, something is wrong.
- Come on. Let's leave.

321
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,332
Get out!

322
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,457
For God, king and country!

323
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,040
Plough...

324
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,415
Plough?

325
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,874
His name was Hans Christian.

326
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,832
Hans Christian Plough Vedel.
Vedel was my wife's name.

327
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,457
In the army he was called HC.

328
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:34,249
He was the only one in the squad
who got out unharmed. A miracle.

329
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:38,624
But we realised
he came home with a problem.

330
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,040
He too claimed there had been
an incident in the village.

331
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:48,207
Involving an officer
and the killing of civilians.

332
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:53,665
We followed the investigation.
It couldn't have happened.

333
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:58,499
My son changed his statement.
But he got increasingly ill.

334
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:05,040
A year ago, he drove
in the wrong direction on the motorway

335
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,124
and he was killed.

336
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:13,957
My marriage broke up,
and I buried myself in guilt.

337
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:20,415
But then Dragsholm turned up
to see my Minister.

338
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:24,040
She'd had
a breakthrough in the case.

339
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,874
She'd found the officer.

340
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,999
I suddenly realised
my son had been telling the truth.

341
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:41,415
I believed Monberg when he promised
to do something about it.

342
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,665
But Dragsholm was killed,
and he did nothing.

343
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:52,624
Instead, he tried to take
his own cowardly life.

344
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,082
I had to lead you to the case.
I leaked the Special Branch memo.

345
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,499
I made sure Karina found
Monberg's private diary.

346
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,707
So you'd help me find out
what had happened.

347
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:11,040
You could have helped
the investigation by informing the police.

348
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:16,915
I had no choice. I was convinced
the Minister of Defense was behind it.

349
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:20,082
But I had no proof, until yesterday.

350
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,040
I was relieved to give it
to the Prime Minister.

351
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:28,749
He reacted resolutely. Without hesitation.
The opposite of you.

352
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:34,665
- How could you be so sure?
- Monberg told me so.

353
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:38,665
He had a meeting
with the Minister of Defense.

354
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:42,457
When he returned,
the case was shut down.

355
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:48,040
Thanks for lending me this book.
Not exactly my taste.

356
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:54,082
I'm sorry about the course of events,
but you and Karina will do all right.

357
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:58,749
That meeting was cancelled
and moved to the Prime Minister's office.

358
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,665
- It was about the terrorism package.
- You're the crown prince.

359
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:08,790
Karina will take over the Ministry.
I'll be Consul General in New York.

360
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,957
It's in Monberg's private diary,
damn it!

361
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,582
If anyone shut down the case,
it was the Prime Minister.

362
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,582
No. Monberg said
it was the Minister of Defense.

363
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:27,040
He was fucking with you!
Do you know anything else?

364
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:32,082
- What do you know, damn it?
- I'd like you to go now.

365
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,624
You have been helping
the wrong man.

366
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,999
You helped the man
who caused your son's death.

367
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:49,207
The right people have been punished.
I owed that to my son.

368
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,374
Now leave, goddamn it!

369
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:09,457
The judge advocates
will believe you this time.

370
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:14,832
Drop your accusations
against the police officer.

371
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:19,082
Your other allegations were correct.

372
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:23,582
So you've served two years
in custody on the wrong grounds.

373
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:29,915
Whatever penalty
you may be given for your crimes

374
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:35,999
you've already served so much time
that you are covered.

375
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,124
You can look forward
to being released very soon.

376
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,999
And I advise you
to sue for damages.

377
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:47,874
- May we have a moment's privacy?
- Yes, of course.

378
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,332
I have more good news.

379
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:54,832
You're to be moved to Horserød
where you'll have a family room,

380
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,957
so that you may be together.

381
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,624
See you later.

382
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,915
- I will do anything.
- You don't need to.

383
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,915
As long as you come home.

384
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:37,332
Every stone must be turned in that village,
and keep me informed.

385
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:43,249
- Any news about General Arild?
- No. The new team arrives tonight.

386
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:48,082
- I'd like to bid them welcome.
- Thanks, but I'll do it myself.

387
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,290
- Your daughter wants to see you.
- Show her in.

388
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:55,415
She's in the house,
packing her things.

389
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:06,915
- We're leaving now.
- Where are you going?

390
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:12,040
To visit Jens. They let us spend
the evening with him.

391
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,207
- We have to get away from here.
- Where are you going to stay?

392
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,874
We'll work that out with Daddy,
won't we, Jonas?

393
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,790
- See you soon, Dad.
- Right...

394
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,374
I'll call you.

395
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,040
Come along, dear.

396
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,082
Hello, old sport.

397
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,790
I'm so glad
Louise came to no harm.

398
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:13,249
What a business! Bilal made sure
none of us knew about the incident.

399
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,332
- Not even you?
- No.

400
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:20,040
If you know anything,
now's the time to speak up.

401
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:24,582
I'll do everything I can
to clear up this mess.

402
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:31,332
- It's more complicated than that.
- What's so complicated about it?

403
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:39,832
Either you lied to me, the police
and the whole world, or you didn't.

404
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:43,124
The police didn't need
to get all the information

405
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,332
so long as we didn't believe
civilians had been killed.

406
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:51,165
- What are you saying?
- The police suspected one officer.

407
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,040
I confirmed
that he'd been sent home.

408
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,457
But that was not entirely true.

409
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,832
He was sent back, shortly after.

410
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,124
But that mission was secret.

411
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,499
That's why
the radio messages were deleted.

412
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,415
There was no evidence of his guilt.

413
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,874
I checked his CV when the police
were asking questions.

414
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:22,249
The guy went AWOL
for a couple of days.

415
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,957
But that doesn't make him
a war criminal.

416
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:31,707
We received intelligence
that the father was pro-Taliban.

417
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,582
Get out.

418
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:44,582
Never show your face here again!
And don't come near my men!

419
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,957
Understood?

420
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:58,915
I'll put in a word for you, so that
you can stay on at the barracks.

421
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,707
We need you.

422
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:05,749
We expect you to make the next team
as strong as the last one.

423
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,790
- May we take the case files?
- Yes, of course.

424
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:33,749
Did the doctor at Lashkar Gar
get my message?

425
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:37,665
Yes, he got your number.
Shall I follow up on it?

426
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:42,332
No. Never mind.
But there is one other thing.

427
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:47,707
We searched the barracks
a few days ago.

428
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,707
- Why didn't we find anything?
- There was nothing there.

429
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,582
Bilal must have put
those things there later.

430
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:59,124
- And the room and the locker?
- We searched the whole lot.

431
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:10,499
Did you find out
how Dragsholm found that officer?

432
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:14,540
No. We went through her case files.

433
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:18,415
Nothing but meetings with clients,
lawyers, and the police.

434
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:25,332
- Meetings with the police?
- Yes. At the magistrate's office.

435
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:32,207
Is that how she contacted us
before she was killed?

436
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:38,790
- She didn't contact us.
- She must have contacted the police.

437
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,457
She hired her own security people.

438
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,999
May I take that box too?

439
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:51,082
Who was in charge of the first search
at the barracks, around the lockers?

440
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,207
- I don't remember.
- Are you sure it wasn't Strange?

441
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:00,165
That's right. It was Strange.
Why?

442
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,582
- Can I take that box?
- Yes...

443
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:29,249
Lund? My superiors want
me to say "well done" to you.

444
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:35,040
I admit I had my doubts
when Brix sent for you.

445
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,582
And no less so when I met you.

446
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:44,749
But now there is a good chance
you won't be sent back to Gedser.

447
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,374
- Congratulations!
- Brix?

448
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:54,124
That day Strange visited
the refugee centre in Helsingør...

449
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:58,082
The day I chased the killer.
Did they check his alibi?

450
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,207
Yes. They had split up,
but it was checked.

451
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:06,249
- Where is he?
- Escorting Raben to Horserød.

452
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:10,499
Lennart... Come and
say hello to my husband.

453
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:14,082
He's ready with a glass of wine.
Won't you come?

454
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,999
I'll take care of it.
Go and have a beer.

455
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:34,249
- You sure?
- He won't make any more trouble.

456
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,582
- Save one for me!
- No way!

457
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:41,040
- I'm coming with you.
- OK.

458
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,749
- We need to talk. Let me drive.
- What's happened?

459
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,957
- Give me the key.
- All right.

460
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,082
How about some music?

461
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,999
- What do you want to talk about?
- I'll get to that.

462
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:21,040
- I want to show you something.
- OK.

463
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,415
- Horserød is straight ahead.
- My wife and son are waiting for me.

464
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,124
What's going on?

465
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:10,124
Something is wrong.
I think Brix is hiding something.

466
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,040
- Brix?
- Come here.

467
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,290
Bloody hell, Lund!
Now what? Lund!

468
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:38,290
I'd love to be alone with you,
but this is not very cosy.

469
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:41,874
This is a memorial park
for the Danish resistance.

470
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,999
War heroes
for whom Bilal felt great respect.

471
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,332
Yes. And?

472
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:54,540
He'd never place Dragsholm here.
He regarded her as a traitor.

473
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:59,540
But whoever killed Dragsholm and
the others doesn't care about that.

474
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,624
It means nothing to him.

475
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,665
What has that got to do with Brix?

476
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,540
Brix is protecting the killer.

477
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,665
What?

478
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:16,749
Dragsholm was scared before
she was killed. She lived just over here.

479
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,707
Her house was full of alarms.

480
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:24,832
She ordered sensors for her garden
and hired her own security guards.

481
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:30,999
But she never called the police.

482
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,290
- Maybe she felt she was covered.
- No.

483
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,874
I think it was because
she found the officer.

484
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,624
She discovered he was working
at our police station.

485
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:50,082
It sounds crazy,
but it explains her silence

486
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:54,207
and why, suddenly, we found
those things at the barracks

487
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:59,374
even though we'd already searched
the place once. Don't you see?

488
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,832
The killer planted the things
during the search.

489
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:09,457
But, Lund...
I was in charge of the search.

490
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,499
- I didn't plant anything.
- No, all right.

491
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,832
It must be someone else
on the team.

492
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,957
I don't know what to say.

493
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:31,915
- Have you talked to Brix about it?
- No. Not yet.

494
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,374
He's going to send me back
to Gedser.

495
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:42,832
Right. You and I
should have a talk with Brix.

496
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,040
You're not going back to Gedser!

497
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,540
But, for now, we'll stick
to the official version.

498
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:54,290
Bilal dragged Dragsholm across
the railway tracks and strung her up.

499
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,999
Come on. Let's drive on.

500
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,665
How do you know that?

501
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,624
That she was dragged
across the tracks.

502
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:11,207
We never discovered that.

503
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,457
Give it a rest!

504
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,999
What do you mean?

505
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,457
Why?

506
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:56,749
At an unimportant court sitting,
last summer.

507
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,582
It was hot.

508
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,999
She caught sight of my tattoo.

509
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:11,332
I don't know why,
but she started asking questions.

510
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,582
Just like you.

511
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:58,290
- Yes?
- Holst. Is Sarah Lund there?

512
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:01,582
No. She just popped out.
What is it?

513
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:05,249
I'm calling from Afghanistan.
I'm an army surgeon at ISAF.

514
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:08,874
I was asked to inquire
into a certain dog tag.

515
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,540
- I found out nothing.
- I'll pass it on.

516
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:16,040
But I can confirm that
a Special Forces officer was here.

517
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:20,665
- He was treated for a cut.
- That's fine.

518
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,624
- OK.
- Thank you.

519
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:29,874
It can't be true.
I was with him every single day.

520
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,749
Don't you see? All Plough
could think of was revenge.

521
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,207
He must have said something
that proves it.

522
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:43,540
No! Plough believes
he did the right thing.

523
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:47,374
Thomas, we know
it was the Prime Minister.

524
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,790
He mustn't get away with it.
I don't care about my future career.

525
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:57,415
- I'm not giving up!
- Good! What do we do?

526
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:03,374
- Just a moment.
- The press will be waiting.

527
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,082
Tell them we're on our way,
and get all the microphones you can.

528
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:14,832
Hi, Thomas. Come right in.

529
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:18,832
We're busy. We want to present
the cabinet reshuffle this evening.

530
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:22,707
I'm glad to have
a chance to talk to you.

531
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,165
I'm sorry about
your night with Special Branch.

532
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:31,624
- I owe you an explanation.
- I don't want to hear it.

533
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,415
You can keep
your ministerial offices.

534
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:40,374
Plough told me about my predecessor
and the Minister of Defense.

535
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:45,207
I'm going to disclose it all
at a press conference.

536
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:50,249
And then I'll tell Parliament,
the police and Special Branch.

537
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:56,165
I'll give them every single
confidential document I've seen.

538
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,082
You've been covering up murder.

539
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:03,790
People were killed because of you.

540
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:08,957
I know you were behind it.
And I'll prove it.

541
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:15,082
We weren't covering up
the killing of civilians.

542
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:24,874
Things like that happen,
and people can forgive that.

543
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,832
The officer was the problem.

544
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,332
The officer wasn't there.

545
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:42,874
The incident took place
during a secret mission.

546
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,374
We hadn't cleared it
with the Parliament.

547
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,665
Special Forces missions
must be passed by Parliament.

548
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,874
That is practically impossible.

549
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,415
Secret decisions made
in the Foreign Policy Committee

550
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:01,040
quickly reach the streets of Kabul.

551
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:09,582
You knew it all along.
You knew who that officer was.

552
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:12,332
I had to make a choice.
It wasn't difficult.

553
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:16,374
At the time, we were
short of money and troops.

554
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:21,207
You could have done
something to stop it.

555
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:25,165
Get real! We are at war!

556
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,665
What could we have done?

557
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:34,749
Do you think round table discussions
are any use in the war on terror?

558
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:40,707
Would a scandal comfort the families
whose sons return in coffins?

559
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,249
The Taliban are gaining strength.

560
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:49,790
Sometimes we have
to put aside democracy

561
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:54,165
in order to fight for democracy.

562
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:58,999
You should be
the first to appreciate that.

563
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:11,707
I took you for being harmless.
But I'd like to keep you on.

564
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,082
If you think I've made mistakes

565
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:19,124
you could help
preventing me making more.

566
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,582
You're out of your mind.

567
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,540
When I tell this to Krabbe and the world,
you'll be finished.

568
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,540
Go ahead.
But there is nothing to tell.

569
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:37,999
You are not the only one I have
chosen to initiate this evening.

570
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:41,374
Meet the people
who have all agreed

571
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,749
that it is of utmost importance
to continue the fight.

572
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,332
You killed them all.

573
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:17,457
Better to kill an innocent person
than to hesitate to kill the enemy.

574
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,540
Didn't they teach you that too?

575
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:27,540
- You won't get away with this.
- I got away with worse.

576
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:32,957
And you were the one
who shot the little girl.

577
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,999
You left that bit out
in your statement.

578
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,957
- You've forgotten!
- You're lying!

579
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,624
You shot her.

580
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,082
Suddenly, you started sniveling.

581
00:56:57,333 --> 00:57:00,749
Don't you remember?
Don't you?

582
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:19,249
Strange here. Raben escaped.
He shot Lund. I'm following him.

583
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,332
Raben, take the gun.

584
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,957
Don't move!

585
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,749
Stay down!

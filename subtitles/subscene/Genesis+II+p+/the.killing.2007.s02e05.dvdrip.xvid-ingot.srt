1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,956
Ten days ago a woman was killed in
 unusual circumstances.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,955
The Muslim League
will punish Denmark.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,511
"My blood will flow.
Many shall follow me in death."

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,276
He called Kodmani.
The video was on his site.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,753
Brix wants to hear your views on the case.
David Gruner 28, a former soldier.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,038
What does Intelligence know about the unit?
3-2-Alpha had eight members ..

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,718
.. with Raben as squad leader.
There were allegations of civilian casualties.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,431
The report exhonerated them.
And the rest of the unit?

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,512
Raben is a fugitive and
we're looking for Lisbeth Thomsen.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,116
A third died last year
in a traffic accident.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,354
The government has put a lot of effort
into the anti-terrorism package.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,115
Do you want to be
the Minister of Justice.?

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,955
Neither we nor Intelligence
had reason to foresee this.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,715
Do you want to try negotiating an
agreement with the People's Party alone?

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,309
We're working on a broad compromise.
The Prime Minister wants consensus.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,272
Monberg possibly had
knowledge of the first victim.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,639
We have to intervene. Agree to
the demands of the People's Party.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,588
The Directorate of Prisons
has rejected your application.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,356
Why can't I see him?
Myg Allan Poulsen was found murdered.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,310
Raben knew both victims.
He lied about it and has escaped.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:50,318
I need to get in touch with Thomsen
She is the last of the group.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,917
If Jens contacts you
it's important that you tell me.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,596
She had an uncle somewhere.
Sweden...an island.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,278
Has he been at the barracks?
Someone took 5 kg. of plastic explosives.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,712
Lisbeth Thomsen lives on an island
in southern Sweden...Skogö.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,351
Raben may show up.
That's pretty unlikely.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,036
We're looking for something
which may explain the anger...

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,478
Raben and Myg risked their lives.
You shouldn't slander them.

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,558
You're not alone on the island.

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,669
Please have a seat.
Something happened in the village.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,358
The others said so. Now they are dead.
There was an officer who fucked-up...

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,876
He's called Perk.
The lawyer believed them.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,838
Come out or I'll shoot!

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,636
Krabbe is getting impatient.
We have to hold a press conference.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,079
It wasn't Dragsholm who had
an affair with Monberg... It was me.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,277
So you saw Dragsholm?
No.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,513
It's a report about an incident in Afghanistan.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,116
I'll have to resign.
The names of those killed.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,193
What happens?
Go back to Thomsen. Now!

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,519
It was me who stopped you.
Have you been in here?

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,829
They can't just disappear.
What's that?

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,355
Nothing, just woods.

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,436
It is all the same.
8000 hectares of forest...

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,797
...and Thomsen knows it
like the back of her hand.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,919
Bertil and Ralle have driven down
the road to cut him off.

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,594
Where the hell are they?

47
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,790
About a half hour away, they said.
But it'll probably be longer.

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,475
But my brother-in-law is on his way.
Your brother-in-law?

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,632
If we had known that they'd escaped,
we'd have been better prepared.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,633
We could have prepared better.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,272
It wasn't a problem to enter the house.
The kitchen window was unlocked.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,718
No trace of the perpetrator?
Only Raben.

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,874
We're not sure that he isn't the only
one who was involved. He's former military.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,953
It's a booby-trap with a kilo of explosives.

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,671
If Thomsen had touched the rifle,
the hut would have blown to hell.

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,628
The checkpoint could have been Raben,
but not this.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,511
We have to find Thomsen and Raben.
Why can't they find out...

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,319
This is my brother and his friends.
Thomsen's car was found on the north side.

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,278
They must have headed out on foot.

60
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,396
Come on!

61
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,073
What happened?
I  can't...

62
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,595
Come here.

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,313
How far is it?
A good distance yet.

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,074
Be careful.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,675
Someone's been in your house.
Who do you think it could be?

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,628
I haven't used the rifle in days.
What's going on?

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,713
The lawyer who came to ask
if I wanted to testify.

68
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,635
She wanted to have the case re-opened.

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,999
She found some new information.
What information?

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,154
She wouldn't say anything about it.
What happened in the village?

71
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,314
I don't know. Where did she go?
I don't know.

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,838
Did you do anything? What happened?
I can't remember.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,836
I remember the screams.
The stench of death. The children who tried to...

74
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,478
He said the officer was called Perk.

75
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,155
Is it a survivor seeking revenge?

76
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,712
They've found the car. Come on!

77
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,554
Why did he need the explosives?
He didn't. I've said that already

78
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,315
Your father has the codes for the
ammunition depot in his computer.

79
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,758
Jens hasn't been here.
I checked on the computer.

80
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,391
He knew nothing about explosives.
He wanted to find Thomsen.

81
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,109
I found an address
of an uncle in Sweden...

82
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,513
How did you? It doesn't matter.
He's a fugitive.

83
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,673
You're an accomplice.
In a parking lot.

84
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,437
He just popped up.
I have no contact? No deals?

85
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,195
You know where he is now?
No.

86
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,590
Come in.

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,869
The investigators have searched the depot.
The codes used weren't the Colonel's.

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,957
They've found explosives from the same
lot-number we've lost.

89
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,195
The explosives were used in a
house belonging Lisbeth Thomsen.

90
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,388
Where was Jens going?
He didn't say...

91
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,395
But he asked about Thomsen's house
in Sweden...right?

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,878
As long as the explosives have been found,
there's no danger.

93
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,909
Will you let me know,
if the police say anything about Jens?

94
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,359
The police will want speak to you.
But that's not as bad as this.

95
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,348
"The number you are trying to call
is currently unavailable."

96
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,839
They were here not so long ago.

97
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,314
They may have taken the path.

98
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,359
Where does it go?
It leads to the harbour and the ferry.

99
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,593
What is that way?
There's a campsite, but it is closed.

100
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,513
There's a harbour?
There's only one jetty.

101
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,028
Thomsen has a boat.
Call the Coast Guard.

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,670
We need the area searched.
We're on the west side. Come on.

103
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,557
They have my car and they know where
I moor my boat.

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,069
Then they'll contact the coastguard.
Okay. Come on...No, here.

105
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,037
They're sailing northward. I'll sail the other way.
The Coast Guard will follow.

106
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,875
We'll stay together.
It'll give you a head start.

107
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,910
The police will let me go.
It's the only chance we have.

108
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,313
We'll stay together. Come on.
We have no fuel.

109
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,952
There's a reserve canister in my boat-house.
You can't miss seeing it.

110
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,352
There really are no monsters.
Come on. We're stuck.

111
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,354
Thomsen!
Stop!

112
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,712
Stop!
Don't start it!

113
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,877
Take the kayak. See you.
Stop!

114
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,676
The Minister will come when he's ready.
Time is running out.

115
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,118
The prime minister is on the plane.
TV news goes live.

116
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,874
What's happening here?
Keep him on hold. I'm sorry.

117
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,478
There's something that I must discuss
with the prime minister.

118
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,918
What happened?
It's confidential, but very important.

119
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,359
I'm not sure the prime minister will
be happy with the delay.

120
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,469
The investigation may have an impact
on the banning of associations.

121
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,792
Buch...
Stop now, what... damn it.

122
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,351
The country's waiting for us to take action.

123
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,355
Don't start your humanitarian nonsense.
Krabbe, I'm tired ...

124
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,231
I'm 100 % sure the prime minister is.
I demand an immediate explanation.

125
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,599
Should I go in there and say that
the government is paralysed?

126
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,519
I'm sorry, but it's your problem.
I won't be held responsible for your decision.

127
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,719
If you don't go on now,
then it'll be too late for the news broadcast.

128
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,876
Nervousness is normal during such a crisis.
But let's announce what we've decided.

129
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,513
Good evening and welcome. The Government
announces the new anti-terrorism law agreement...

130
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,912
...reached with the People's Party. Terrorism
has unfortunately become part of our everyday lives...

131
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,073
so we must be continually vigilent
to improve the safety of the public.

132
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,234
The threat must not encroach
on our democratic values.

133
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,872
But we must safeguard our freedom
against the dark forces...

134
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,754
Since the recent murders of former
military personnel ...

135
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,755
...have tragically brought this issue into focus
we have all worked together on this bill.

136
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,075
Before we go into details of the package,
Erling Krabbe will say a few words.

137
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,595
Thank you.

138
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,199
There has been lengthy and tough negotiations...

139
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,037
...but we've now succeeded in reaching an agreement.

140
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,594
I want to commend the government
on good political work...

141
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,753
...and for having the courage to
take the bull by the horns...

142
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,199
...although the opposition has thrown in the towel.

143
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,071
For the People's Party,
defense of our freedom is the highest priority.

144
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,518
We won't be bullied by medieval fanatics...

145
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,390
...who repeatedly emerge from
Koranic schools and associations...

146
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,554
..funded by Danish tax payers.
We must crack down...

147
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,840
...on groups that try to undermine our society.

148
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,996
Otherwise we squander our identity as Danes.
This must not happen.

149
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,838
Therefore, the Peoples Party
is proud to support the new law...

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,471
.. that the Minister of Justice will
now outline in detail.

151
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,314
Buch...

152
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,596
This won't do.
We need to stop.

153
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,034
Yes...Sorry.
I can't go into details. I apologise.

154
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,112
What's this?

155
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,348
The announcement of the anti-terrorism package
took a surprising twist.

156
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:51,200
Justice Minister Thomas Buch walked away from
a press conference with the People's Party.

157
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,277
The Minister of Justice has so far
refused to comment on the situation.

158
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,513
I can't reach König in Intelligence.

159
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,152
Ask Karina to find out what's available
on the military action in question.

160
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,029
I'll take care of it myself.

161
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,432
It's possible that it'll raised ...

162
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,957
I haven't been here...since Monberg turned 50.

163
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,471
These portraits remind the minister
that he has some responsibility.

164
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,760
It seems strange, but ...
Did you hear the reactions.

165
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,038
Do you realise the magnitude of the crisis?
Terrorism is a mistake .. Monberg

166
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,100
Don't blame Monberg.
You started those rumors?

167
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,797
I understand that you're still flinging
around lots of accusations.

168
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,875
They're not just accusations.
It's in black and white.

169
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,913
Monberg knew the first victim...

170
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,438
She was a lawyer who wanted Monberg
to reopen an old military criminal case.

171
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,832
The case is about the soldiers
who have now been murdered.

172
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,596
A group of soldiers accused
of killing Afghan civilians.

173
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,312
The group was exonerated,
but the lawyer wanted to reopen the case.

174
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,349
She gave Monberg a file...
Five days later she was murdered

175
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,754
How did you get this?
Monberg sent it to himself in the post.

176
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,255
We opened it when it was delivered to the office
 and saw what it contained

177
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,198
Monberg should have taken this up long ago.

178
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,115
We can ask him when he wakes up,
but we have to decide here and now.

179
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,510
Monberg didn't have a heart attack.
According to his wife, he swallowed pills.

180
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:07,836
He was depressed.
We gave the press a cover story.

181
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,712
It doesn't make the situation better.
What did Monberg have to hide?

182
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,477
Why was he worried about an old
military matter? I don't understand.

183
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,110
Get to the bottom of it.
But, keep these cards close to your chest.

184
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,239
We need to know what's going on
as soon as possible...

185
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,598
...Especially considering the latest rumours.

186
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,752
Rumours?
Something happened in Sweden.

187
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,549
They've found another dead soldier.

188
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,235
We couldn't know she would run away.
There's no trace of Raben.

189
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,598
He may have escaped on another boat

190
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,675
The Coast Guard and the Swedish Navy
are conducting a manhunt

191
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,276
We'll do our best. Okay?
Bye

192
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,677
Explosives were stolen in a burglary
at the barracks.

193
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,311
They're investigating, whether
they came from the same batch.

194
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,558
We couldn't prevent it.
We wanted to help, but she ran away.

195
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,473
Let's go and check the boathouse for traces.
It may be...

196
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,799
Where you going?
Lund!

197
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,436
Okay. Thank you.

198
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,630
Sources suggest the Danish Citizen
murdered in Sweden...

199
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,191
...was directly connected to other recent
terrorist-related killings.

200
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,799
The woman was formerly
a member of the armed forces.

201
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,317
In this case, we are now talking
about a fourth victim.

202
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,438
Neither Intelligence nor the police have...

203
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,234
What the hell are they talking about?

204
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,272
Hedeby is there too.

205
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,475
We can't give up now.
We're onto something.

206
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,156
We don't have anything at all.
We're the ones who found the bodies.

207
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,429
We're not sure what happened in Afghanistan.

208
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,593
In fundamentalist circles...

209
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,197
...the soldiers are guilty despite the
findings of the official enquiry.

210
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,638
We've found fatwas against the
military on websites and against ...

211
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,316
...the system that acquitted them.
That's what we are concentrating on.

212
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,156
The investigation hasn't brought us
any closer to a solution.

213
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,395
I've asked Brix to reorganise his team,
effective from today.

214
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,432
What does that mean?
You're still on the case.

215
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,400
But first you need to take some days off.
We're just ...

216
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,311
You let your witness escape
with the suspect in the area.

217
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,199
We couldn't tie her down!

218
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,388
You knew that religious fanatics
had their eyes on that unit.

219
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,075
So, shouldn't we have lunch.

220
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,239
Or could someone else disappear from that unit?

221
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,710
has everything been arranged...staged?

222
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,591
The flyers, video 'Faith Brother',
Kodmani, Muslim League.

223
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,957
What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

224
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,229
Dragsholm wanted Thomsen to testify
if the case was reopened.

225
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,757
What if someone isn't interested
in having the case reopened?

226
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,674
Who could it be?
They're all dead.

227
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,834
The last one has
a pretty good alibi in Herstedvester.

228
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,755
Consider the army.
Explosives were stolen from the barracks.

229
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,151
And the detonators they needed.

230
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,713
We don't know if the incident is closed,
or if the case will be re-opened.

231
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,112
The case is about to be re-opened.

232
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,353
I've just heard.
It's a political issue now.

233
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,957
But it has no connection to the killings.

234
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,032
It would explain a lot.
The army doesn't kill its own people.

235
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,512
Someone in the army has a motive.
Insane speculation.

236
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,279
I suppose I'll get a briefing,
when you've restructured the team.

237
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,878
It's already been done. Lund and
Strange continue to investigate the matter.

238
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,515
It's in everyone's interest that this
case is concluded. Understand.

239
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,754
Otherwise, we're going to end up with more bodies
filling the refridgerators in the morgue

240
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,069
Don't make any mistakes.
Are we completely agreed?

241
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,270
The team has to go through everything
related to the old Afghan case.

242
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,276
And we need to find that officer, Perk.
that Thomsen told us about

243
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,955
As long as it's discreet.

244
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,588
What's she doing here?

245
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,515
She's had no contact with her husband.
How do you know? We're having her followed.

246
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,710
She told him about Thomsen's house in Sweden.

247
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,112
I have a search warrant.
Shall we go?

248
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,349
The police have been here twice,
and Louise called.

249
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,000
A fourth Danish soldier's been killed

250
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,993
I need money.
Can you lend me some?

251
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,789
For what?
Just a few thousand.

252
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,033
This has to stop now.
You're the last person left.

253
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,591
Can I get the money or not?
Turn yourself in.

254
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,117
Thomsen said the lawyer
wanted to reopen the case.

255
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,192
Which case?

256
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,832
What happened out there.
She must have found something new.

257
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,313
If I give up now, they died for nothing.

258
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,395
Did Dragsholm ever contact you?
Who?

259
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,997
The lawyer who was killed in Mindelunden Park.
I've never met her.

260
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,956
You think I'm crazy.
I was in the camp.

261
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,113
There was no officer...
Someone might have put a lid on it.

262
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,317
It'll be the same people behind this.

263
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,273
You can't just think about yourself.
You have a wife, a son.

264
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,956
Give me the money now.
We can drive to the police now.

265
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,432
I can tell them that you are innocent.
Trust me.

266
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,433
I saw Thompsen blown into thin air.

267
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,311
Don't tell me to turn the other cheek.
Give me the money.

268
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,553
Don't you have a debit card?
Bloody hell, don't you have a debit card?

269
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,591
We've tried to explain away your behavior
at the press conference...

270
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,959
...about the need to discuss the matter,
with the safety committee...

271
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,398
...but speaking after the latest killing
was an enormous press blunder.

272
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:01,078
Some colleagues are distancing themselves from you.
Not the least of which is Erling Krabbe.

273
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,429
What about the prime minister?
He expects a lengthy statement this evening.

274
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:15,393
There's nothing that connects
Monberg to the Afghan military matter.

275
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,394
But I've been wrong before.

276
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,711
Did you notice anything about him?
No.

277
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,830
It dawned on me that
I really might not have known him.

278
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,709
It's probably best you go in alone.

279
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,311
If there is a disciplinary matter,
shouldn't we talk about this in private.

280
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,792
As it stands Plough,
she just had an affair with the minister.

281
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,476
We're not sure if there's more to it.

282
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,590
You won't hear about his sex life.
It would be nice to avoid that.

283
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,273
Hello?


284
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,758
Hello.

285
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,835
Please sit here, darling?
Go and read a book.

286
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,676
I'll just help the babysitter discard it.
Just a moment.

287
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,357
Hello. What's your name?
Merle.

288
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,991
Come on baby, Lotte's helping
to get you dressed.

289
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,392
I need to go to the post office.
Remember, she has to pee.

290
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:56,114
If it's about my resignation,
I'll go by the Ministry's wishes.

291
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,479
You have a daughter.
It's not the first thing I expected the ministry to care about

292
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,551
And her father is a musician?
No, it's mine.

293
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,159
His father is a lawyer.
He went to earn tons of money. In Dubai.

294
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,154
I want you to come back.

295
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,235
I have unintentionally misled
both you and my secretary.

296
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,837
Plough believes you've done nothing wrong.

297
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,997
He would jump at a chance for a "roll
in the hay". Sorry, but I need your help.

298
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,915
Before this evening, I need to find out
what Monberg's role was in this.

299
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,677
Don't you have any idea why
Monberg wanted to keep it hidden?

300
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,233
If I did, then I'd have told you.
Why all the secrecy?

301
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,155
Something that could explain why he
tried to kill himself. What?

302
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,713
He took pills.
Apparently he had a guilty conscience...

303
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,634
...but I want facts.

304
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,516
I don't know what to say.

305
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:21,437
If you remember anything, please call.
Bye.

306
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,838
The Minister of Defence Minister
has requested a meeting...

307
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,438
...if possible in the afternoon.
Tell him that I don't have time.

308
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,790
Major Søgaard isn't answering his phone.

309
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,351
He is busy sending off the officers today on deployment.

310
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,116
Myg Poulsen was responsible for
his platoon's ammunition.

311
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,829
The access code and password
that were used, were his.

312
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,515
The murderer must have
tortured him to get it.

313
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,753
Aren't those codes cancelled
when the person dies?

314
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,870
The technicians hadn't yet
reset the passwords

315
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,160
When I downloaded the auditors report
Thursday evening, there was no guard.

316
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,155
The depot is electronically locked.
Only seven people have the password.

317
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,279
Normally, monitoring isn't necessary.
What time was the burglary?

318
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,197
According to system logs, the lock
was opened at 0:39 Thursday night.

319
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,638
And again at 01:04...
25 minutes later.

320
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,237
The thief took his time..

321
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,758
I presume that your technicians
can explain how ...

322
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,751
... the explosives were taken
off the shelf over here.

323
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,873
We made a list of people
with knowledge of the barracks area.

324
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,309
How did Lisbeth Thomsen die? Might it be
from the same explosive as this one?

325
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,554
Nobody noticed anything because
Intelligence is often here.

326
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,050
A hole was cut in the fence.
Perhaps to distract us.

327
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,551
This looks like an inside job made
to look like a burglary

328
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,391
Who else has access?
Three platoon leaders.

329
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,075
And two officers.
What about yourself?

330
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,711
You have to come with us to the office.
We still need to talk to you.

331
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,953
Why?
So we can ask you more questions.

332
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,033
That'll have to wait.
Do it voluntarily...

333
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,192
...or else we'll arrest you.

334
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,638
Yesterday you said that
no civilians were killed at the village.

335
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,554
According to Thomsen, 3-2-Alpha
reported otherwise.

336
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,396
Yes, but that turned out to be wrong.
You'd lost three of your unit members.

337
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,989
Maybe your focus was somewhere else.
What was the soldiers' explanation?

338
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,371
They had received a message from a
patrol in distress behind enemy lines.

339
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,672
They said it came from a Danish officer,
Perk.

340
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,270
He was under fire.
And they were coming to his rescue.

341
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:40,271
Go on...explain.

342
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,352
They sought refuge in a building,
but were under siege for two days.

343
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,356
During this siege
something happened to a family.

344
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,399
They claimed that the Danish officer
had killed them.

345
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,510
How did you feel about that?
The story was pure fabrication.

346
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,834
Nobody could confirm the distress call
that group claimed they had received.

347
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,711
There was no officer named Perk.
There were no corpses.

348
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,796
Why would they lie?
The mission had cost three lives.

349
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,799
It was an attempt to shift the focus
from the tragedy they had caused.

350
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,196
Do you think it was Raben
who was to blame for the tragedy?

351
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:35,797
Nothing was ever established

352
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,238
What about the family in the house?
They all fled.

353
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,837
It was a very dangerous area.
We had done everything we could...

354
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,551
Have you checked all of this out personally?
Yes, It's part of my job.

355
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,953
I wasn't in the camp at that time,
but I'm familiar ...

356
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,398
Just a moment...
You weren't in the camp?

357
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,111
I was in a consultation meeting
with the Afghan government in Kabul.

358
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,479
My second in command kept me informed.

359
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,598
Who was your deputy?

360
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,991
Captain Søgaard.
Today, he's Gen. Søgaard.

361
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,711
Søgaard was in command?
I came back two days later.

362
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,713
Thank you.

363
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,670
Jarnvig here.
Yes, hello. Just a moment.

364
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,319
Has Søgaard reported back?
No, but I have called him on his mobile

365
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,789
He's not answering.

366
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,717
Intelligence has identified
the Islamist groups...

367
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,271
...who have alleged that Danish soldiers
committed atrocities in Afghanistan

368
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,989
Is there any concrete evidence?
I don't know.

369
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,315
König will brief you later.
They've nothing on Monberg and the military issue.

370
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,511
They complain about lack of cooperation from
the police.  Why?  I'll check into it.

371
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,234
I'll have the job-posting for the
new secretary distributed internally.

372
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,474
I know that there are two ...
Do you have a moment?

373
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,428
Now isn't a good time.
See you later.

374
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,239
Two minutes.

375
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,556
I was just talking to the Prime Minister.
It's best that we have this chat.

376
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,632
Rossing, I know that Monberg is your friend.

377
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,909
This has been an unpleasant experience,
but we have to investigate.

378
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,596
I remember the time when I was just appointed.
You're nervous.

379
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,233
You want to make a good impression
on the Prime Minister... Like back at school.

380
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,758
I'm a little busy, so...
You'll ruin the whole country.

381
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,472
I don't know of any connection between
Monberg and the military issue.

382
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,714
Fine... If you say so.
There is one thing you must understand.

383
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,919
Frode has been under a lot of pressure
for a long time.

384
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:34,269
Anti-Terrorism Package Negotiations.
A very unhappy marriage.

385
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,954
Can I?

386
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:45,037
In this situation, he was approached by
Anne Dragsholm, his great love.

387
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,196
They met at university.
He was a guest teacher... she a student.

388
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,912
He had a wife and children,
and broke-off their relationship.

389
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,438
I really don't think that
they've had any contact since...

390
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,799
...not until recently, when she decided
to use their old connection.

391
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,070
Is there a point to all of this?

392
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,153
Monberg wasn't interested in this case,
but in Dragsholm.

393
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,599
When she was killed a few days later,
he collapsed.

394
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,873
I ate lunch with him a few days before he...

395
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,194
..he talked about the mistakes
he had committed in his life.

396
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,352
I had other things on my mind.

397
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,956
But he talked about his breakup
with Anne Dragsholm.

398
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,032
So I need to put the matter to rest.

399
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,079
No, I'm not saying that.

400
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,869
Things need to come to light;
but not just yet.

401
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,670
If the scandal only concerns
Monberg's privacy ...

402
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,995
...you might as well make everything public.
It's your choice.

403
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,630
Better think twice about it.

404
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,951
Thanks for the coffee.

405
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,918
Is this your address book?
Yes. But he's not in there.

406
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,835
We'll have to borrow it.
You'll get it back as soon as we finish.

407
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,879
Mama...
Hello, darling.

408
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,715
Hello.
Did you have fun?

409
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,275
They were helping mom clean up.
But now they're going.

410
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,750
Was the museum interesting?
Please sign here.

411
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,516
Hello. Jonas. Nice bag.
Did you get it from Daddy?

412
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,992
Where are they taking the computer?
Goodbye again.

413
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,312
It's okay, honey.
They're just borrowing it.

414
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,109
We'll buy a new Play Station on Monday,
right?

415
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,748
Louise... Hello?
It's me.

416
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,310
Come right over to my office.

417
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,314
Come in.

418
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,870
He's really not well.

419
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,070
He needs to be helped,
before it's too late.

420
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,870
Call him and tell him you'll meet him.
The police will arrange the rest.

421
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,077
He isn't there...
...Try again.

422
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,836
Try this one
It's smaller

423
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,239
How much will you pay?
Just 600.

424
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,472
You can't get an air pistol for 600

425
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,234
I'll take it.

426
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,273
I'll use it. OK?
Get out.

427
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,319
Louise?
Dad knows I have the phone number.

428
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,790
Did he find out from the chaplain?
They're worried about you.

429
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,875
Are you okay?
Are the police still there do they know about the phone?

430
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,479
Not yet. Are you okay?
The chaplain says something's very wrong.

431
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,557
I know what I'm doing..
We can't talk now.

432
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,352
I'm looking for Major Søgaard.
Has anyone seen him?

433
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,516
No just looking for my wallet?
..and the bloke looks at him coldly and says..

434
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,913
"Oh..I thought you might have been the
bastard that shit on my tortoise."

435
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,473
Hello.
I've left messages all day.

436
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,839
This is the last day with the soldiers.
We run a fairly tight schedule.

437
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,120
I have a few questions about your
deployment with Team Aegir.

438
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:57,121
My deployment again..

439
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,591
Should we talk about it here?

440
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,154
I have to go to the toilet. You can come
if you want. Or We'll meet outside after.

441
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,156
Go ahead. Ask away.
But I know nothing more than the Colonel.

442
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,393
You must have heard the
soldiers' explanation.

443
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,996
I can't tell you anything
you don't already know.

444
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,835
The soldiers spoke of an officer Perk.

445
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,788
There was no officer.
Nobody called Perk.

446
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,078
And there was no distress signal.

447
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,475
The leader sent the group into action
without receiving confirmation.

448
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,636
You don't like Raben?
I didn't say that. He was a good soldier

449
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,078
How can you be sure nothing happened?

450
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,270
I led the operation to extract
Raben's group out of that shit.

451
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,718
So you were one of the first
to arrive at the village?

452
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,917
That's right.
And you didn't see anything?

453
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,358
I wouldn't say that..I saw..
three dead soldiers... The rest wounded.

454
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,308
But I didn't see any civilians...
...dead or alive.

455
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:26,955
You were decorated and promoted.
Did it have anything to do with that?

456
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,351
We saved the rest of the group.

457
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,594
If something happened in the village,
does it fall under your responsibility?

458
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,595
If something had happened,
it was no big deal.

459
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,070
War is dirty.
Innocents die.

460
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,633
The politicians sent us off to the front
to avoid blood on their hands.

461
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,076
Yes.

462
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,038
Lund here.
You should have checked Søgaards alibi.

463
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,954
Where was he at the time of the killings.

464
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,069
We have checked all the officers,
commissioned since 1996.

465
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,949
There's no one called Perk.

466
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,638
But some recruits were trained by
a lieutenant they called 'Perk'.

467
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,351
Okay.
His real name is Per K. Moller.

468
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,752
He was with the Aegir Team.
Do you have his address?

469
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:50,155
Thank you very much.

470
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,189
Monberg was a guest lecturer
when Dragsholm was going to university.

471
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:02,311
They may have had a relationship
before she applied for the army position.

472
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,395
I hope you were'nt too rough
on the Minister of Defense?

473
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,399
I've been trying to call you.
Where is he?... He's inside.

474
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,111
We can't talk about the case.
No, I need to see him.

475
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,477
This is important.

476
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,238
Thank you.
I want to talk to you.

477
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,234
Got a minute? ...Yes of course.
I just want to say thanks.

478
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,359
We have to see everything
as part of a greater cause.

479
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,437
I will suggest to the Prime Minister
that he makes a clean breast of it all.

480
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,151
Good to know that you are on-side.
Buch...

481
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,031
Karina.
You should take it up with Plough.

482
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,399
There's a connection between Monberg
and the old military issue in Afghanistan.

483
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,510
The lawyer complained to him that the
soldiers' version of events was ignored.

484
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,959
Monberg knew about it.
We've already discussed that.

485
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,831
I used the computer
to cross check the names on the list...

486
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,719
...that was provided by the ministry.

487
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,678
You shouldn't use that computer.
You don't have authority to access that data.

488
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,438
It was a Defence case, but the Minister
of Justice talked to some of the soldiers.

489
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,470
One of the soldiers he met was
Jens Peter Raben.

490
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,311
There's no record of that meeting.

491
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,076
But the Minister of Defence Minister
did convene the meeting.

492
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,151
Buch, we're waiting for you.

493
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,633
Come on, baby.

494
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,040
They were Per Kristian sunglasses,
his favorite. They were...

495
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,433
Please have a seat.
My husband is overseas, but maybe I can help.

496
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:40,118
When did your son die?
In May, about two years ago.

497
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,748
In May?
Yes.

498
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,912
It was a blasting accident.

499
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,952
He died three months before the others.

500
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,432
I tried to persuade him
to find another profession.

501
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,551
But he liked the army. He wanted to
travel and make a difference.

502
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,076
For a time, we heard
almost nothing from him.

503
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,394
Not until they phoned
and told us what had happened.

504
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,236
But he got the funeral he wanted.

505
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,029
Thanks for your time.

506
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,034
Do you have anything to do
with the investigation?

507
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,914
A lawyer came out here some time
ago and asked the same question.

508
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:31,915
A lawyer..?

509
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,398
We still have his stuff.

510
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:43,351
Sometimes we think of throwing it out
but then we change our minds.

511
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,914
The lawyer only wanted to examine his
documents about the accident.

512
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,915
But when I came back, she was
rummaging through his things.

513
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,312
She asked all sorts of questions.

514
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,552
About the funeral and stuff.

515
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,870
About the funeral?

516
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,589
She was very concerned...
that we hadn't seen him.

517
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,514
Seen him where?
In the coffin.

518
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,879
We would liked to have seen him,
but they said it was best not to.

519
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,478
Who said that?
Captain Søgaard and the chaplain.

520
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,399
They said that you couldn't
see your son in the coffin?

521
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,639
Where is he buried?
Down here in the cemetery.

522
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,737
I have a picture of the grave...
...if you want to see it.

523
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:41,238
Yes please..

524
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,873
Dragsholm was on the same trail as us.

525
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,160
Søgaard claimed he didn't know Perk.
I think he's covering for him.

526
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,154
Lund he died three months before
the Raben platoon incident.

527
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,396
Søgaard didn't let them see the corpse...
...If he's actually dead.

528
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:02,997
He was blown to pieces of course
 they shouldn't see the corpse

529
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:03,998
There's only one way to find out for sure..

530
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,310
We need to dig up the coffin
to see if anyone is in it.

531
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,759
You'd better leave.

532
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,119
Jens?

533
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,400
I never really did believe in God.
It always seemed very strange.

534
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,719
If God exists, what's the point
with everything that's happened?

535
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,677
I'd quite like to believe.
But it's not easy. Do you understand?

536
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,268
Let's go to the police.

537
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,912
You better take this from me.
I don't know what I was thinking.

538
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,158
You're doing the right thing.
I just have to get dressed.

539
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,674
Chaplain?

540
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,558
Chaplain?

541
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,478
K. Møller
Rest in Peace

542
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:08,479

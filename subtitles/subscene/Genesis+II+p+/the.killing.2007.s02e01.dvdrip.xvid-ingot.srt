1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,268
You're through to the alarm center.
I think something's happened.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,796
Yes? What's your name?

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,750
There's blood everywhere..
I can't find her.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,037
Okay. Where are you calling from?
Oh God!

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,752
Hello? I need your name & address.
Anne?   Anne?

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,935
There's no one at home.
I can't find my wife.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,019
Is anyone hurt?
I don't know.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,596
Tell me what happened
so I can help you. Hello?

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,788
What did I do?
Hello? Stay on the line.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,758
Anne?
Hello?

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,230
Hello?
Where are you?

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,393
Hello?
Anne!

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,113
She has 15-20 stab wounds
to the torso and throat.

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,913
Looks like she was killed elsewhere
and then brought here

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,677
It also appears that she was dead
when she was strung up.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,159
Get the dog to shut up.
Brix ...

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,109
Her husband was found in his car
down by the highway.

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,593
He was covered in blood.
Take him in for questioning.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,514
If he's covered with blood,
we're already halfway there.

20
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,475
It's seven a.m Monday,
November 14. Here is the news.

21
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,794
The Minister of Justice, Frode Monberg
has been admitted to hospital after
a suspected heart attack.

22
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,872
His condition is uncertain.

23
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,589
Parliament will sit to consider
the new anti-terrorism package.

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,788
The Prime Minister states Monberg's
absence won't affect negotiations.

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,511
This anti-terrorism package is needed.
The threat to Denmark has increased.

26
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,310
The fight against terrorism must be fought
both here and in Afghanistan.

27
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,678
In other news a suspect in the Mindelunden Park
murder is in custody.

28
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,675
Police so far have released few details
about the murder which took place ten days
ago

29
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,991
The suspect must be charged or
released by tomorrow

30
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,989
Anything happen Lund?
No.

31
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,550
Good night.
Thanks.

32
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,039
Hello. My name is Ulrich Strange.
I left a message for you...

33
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,795
...but I don't think
your voice-mail is working.

34
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,591
There's coffee in the pot if you'd like some
Yes, please.

35
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,078
I'm an inspector at Police HQ ...
You mean sergeant, right?

36
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,473
No, the title changed
after the last reorganisation.

37
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,236
There's something that we want to
talk to you about.

38
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,835
Ten days ago
a woman was murdered...

39
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,310
Under strange circumstances.

40
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,631
I'll just wait until you're done.
I can hear you.

41
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,598
We've withheld information...

42
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,756
We imagine that you've already
read about it.

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,832
Who is 'we'?
Brix, your former boss.

44
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,117
He believes that you can contribute
a new angle.

45
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,115
Lennart Brix?
Yes, He wants you to review the file.

46
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,275
Brix thinks you can offer new insight
we can discuss it.

47
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,515
As you can see, I'm no longer dealing
with files and suspects.

48
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,471
We think the murderer is the victim's
husband, who we're holding...

49
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,838
In another 32 hours we
charge him or let him go.

50
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,357
You'll be paid for the inconvenience.
Yes, that's fine.

51
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,274
Tell him it's no use
Why not?

52
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,996
Brix said I should stress to you most
strongly that he needs your help.

53
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,709
And you've done it, right?

54
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,399
I have to go.
It's been a long night.

55
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,759
Close the door when you're done
Okay.

56
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,079
How is his condition?
Will the minister come back?

57
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,234
I have no comment.
We hope his condition improves.

58
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,073
Thanks for your concern.

59
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,559
Won't you sit down.
The Prime Minister won't be a moment.

60
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,709
Hi, Thomas. How are you?
Fine, thank you.

61
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,031
How's the family?
Good, everything's fine.

62
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,351
Is there any news?
He's doing well.

63
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,752
But he's not coming back,
either now or later.

64
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,995
We're relieved that he survived,
but it comes at an unfortunate time.

65
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,675
That's clear.
So, I have chosen you...

66
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,991
..to get our anti-terrorism
package through Parliament.

67
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,119
There'll be a vote next week.
Right now it's a mad house.

68
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,114
Our coalition partners are flexing their
muscles, and the opposition ...

69
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,716
Sorry. There's something
I have to say first.

70
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,112
I'm truly honored by your offer...
Really...

71
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,477
But I have to say, no thanks.

72
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,629
Why?
I don't feel ready.

73
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,399
I'm not a lawyer. There must be
others who are much better suited.

74
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,509
But maybe in a few years,
when I've been here a little longer.

75
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,952
The government has worked
hard on the terrorism package

76
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,989
Someone must lead the negotiations.
Would you like to be that person?

77
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,154
For me it's very simple.  You have the skills.
So you have to do it.

78
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,589
I can nominate anyone from our party,
but it's you I need.

79
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,630
If you have no other reasons to
reject me, then I'll ask you again:

80
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,918
Will you be our new Justice Minister?

81
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,916
Raben, you have a visitor.

82
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,759
He wanted to be here, but there's "Colors
and Shapes Day" in kindergarten.

83
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,913
All the others will be there.
I understand.

84
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,675
I've brought some of his new drawings.
Would you like to see them?

85
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,435
Everything has to do with adventures
and role playing for the time being.

86
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,152
It's a very important dragon...
I can't remember its name...

87
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,312
...but it's huge and very dangerous.

88
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,314
He's good at it.
Yesterday we bought the shield and sword.

89
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,075
It was a gift from grandpa.

90
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,749
Otherwise, not much has happened.

91
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,679
Shall we ...?
Let's just wait a little while.

92
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,759
When is it?  soon.
I'll be nice and calm.

93
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,232
I'm having an interview with them,
and then they'll decide.

94
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,188
The lawyer is optimistic.
They can't say no this time.

95
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,751
The superintendent says
I've made great progress.

96
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,117
They can't say no this time.

97
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,958
What's up?

98
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,435
He's not here because..

99
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,029
Jonas doesn't want to come anymore.

100
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,357
I know you wanted to see him,
so I tried, but he won't come.

101
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,717
It's okay.

102
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,917
It's important not to push him.
I don't push him.

103
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,958
But he isn't a small child anymore.
He won't talk about you.

104
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,752
I think it's because someone has teased
him in kindergarten, you know..kids..

105
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,197
Sorry, honey. Just forget it.
I'll figure it out.

106
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,158
We'll figure it out..

107
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
It'll be fine. I promise you.

108
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,198
Soon we'll be together so much,
that we'll miss being alone.

109
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,114
Even If I snore and slurp...

110
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,353
...and put toothpaste on my upper lip.

111
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,870
This is Vibeke Lund. I'm not home,
please leave a message.

112
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,352
Hi, Mom. It's Sarah. I'll be coming by
train in a couple of hours.

113
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,913
And I can only stay until tomorrow,
so ... Yes. See you.

114
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,595
She said no. I think she had
a busy night with ferry traffic.

115
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,671
Brix.

116
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,118
It's Strange.
Sarah Lund. Is Brix there?

117
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,115
He's busy right now. Can I help?
I'm going to visit my family today.

118
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,352
It's not certain that I'll have time...

119
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,638
...but if he really thinks
I can help, then ...

120
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,475
Then what?
I need to run. I'll call you later.

121
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,437
Hello?

122
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,790
38-year-old Thomas Buch has today been
sworn in as the new justice minister.

123
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,317
Buch's appointment was seen as a surprise in
political circles.

124
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,669
His first task will be to create consensus to
push through the anti-terrorism package.

125
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,311
yes yes we shook hands and she put
her congratulations on record.

126
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,473
I have to run.
I'll talk to you later.

127
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,760
Karina Munk Jørgensen,
secretary. Congratulations.

128
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,514
Good afternoon.
Hello.

129
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,952
We fill the second and third floor,
and we have 170 employees.

130
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,079
This is yours, the office of the
Minister of Justice.

131
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,315
The rest of his stuff will be moved soon.
That's good.

132
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,957
My predecessor left it?
No. I brought it here.

133
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,955
So the Minister can just read it.
Carsten Plough, Permanent Secretary.

134
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,033
The reception's ready to begin.
That's good.

135
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,876
Can I have an update on the
progress of the negotiations?

136
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,113
It'll be a settlement between the
Government and the People's Party.

137
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,671
The opposition's rejected it, but you
can check the details in the file.

138
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:03,030
Yes. But first I'll tell you about my
position. We're at war.

139
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,751
Whether we like it or not,
The challenge is to find unity.

140
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,833
We must pursue a broad national
 reconciliation.

141
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,357
That's also been tried.
Your predecessor had to admit ...

142
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,389
... I understand. But it's very
important that this succeeds.

143
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,473
Unless there's a problem?
No, of course not.

144
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,668
Let me show you the welcome
gift from the People's Party.

145
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,278
''Never again 9th April.'' I'm not
an expert on political messages...

146
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,910
...but I don't think they've given up .

147
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,834
Well, we'll see.
Yes.

148
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,471
But you can discuss it
with your personal advisor.

149
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,794
I don't need a lawyer. The three of us
can handle it together.

150
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,195
Okay. I'll call the parties together
to meet as soon as possible.

151
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,955
That sounds wonderful.
Great..lets get going then

152
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,115
Stop fretting, things have changed now,
everything will be fine

153
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:38,116
They can't keep you here forever
Why don't they just give a sign?

154
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,195
Don't make a fuss, too much and you'll get
it in the ass. Do you understand?

155
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,433
Yes, I understand. See you later.

156
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,194
Superintendant Toft!

157
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,876
Raben! Stop there!

158
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,154
Away from the fence....
Away from the fence...It's okay.

159
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,119
How did it go?
I can't say anything about that.

160
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,912
You need to talk to your lawyer.
I don't have his number.

161
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,232
Then wait.
It's not my fault.

162
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,192
I need to call my wife. If it's
bad news, I want to hear it now.

163
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,310
We made a positive recommendation..
But it's not up to us.

164
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,189
The Directorate of Prisons will
make the final decision.

165
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,318
So, nothing is certain.

166
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,189
Raben, come now!

167
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,793
What did she say exactly?
The doctors think I'm ready.

168
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,111
When's the answer due?
In about a week or so.

169
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,718
It depends on the Directorate of Prisons.
You need to get hold of Myg.

170
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,190
Wait I need to move..

171
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,636
Myg? Why?
He can get me work.

172
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,839
It will help the decision, say it's urgent.
Ok I will

173
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,393
Jonas is there? Yes he's going to
show my father something.

174
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,997
I'll call you as soon as I can. Say
goodnight for me and remember Myg.

175
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,357
I will.

176
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,911
Hi. There's still some food.
That sounds good.

177
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,959
How did it go?
We need to send 200 men.

178
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,238
They can't understand that logistical
Services works so slow

179
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,473
Usually you're good at
explaining things to them.

180
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,630
Jonas, you have to get into your pyjamas.
No, I need to fence with grandpa.

181
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,352
Hurry. Maybe he'll read a bedtime
story if you're quick.

182
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,717
I've looked at schools, Louise.
Sion Street sounds the best.

183
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,350
And it's not so far away.
That's good. Gravy?

184
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,958
Just a little bit.  Be sure
to register on time.

185
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,433
I'll check it out, Dad.
I'm not sure we're staying here.

186
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,434
Why not? The Infirmary wants you
to continue.

187
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,991
I need that personnel list with numbers,
do you know where it is?

188
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,958
It's over in the bureau.

189
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,550
I've said, I can move down to
the basement. I'll get it decorated.

190
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,917
That's fine, Dad.
We'll see, right?

191
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,751
You think he'll get out?
He seems to have a good chance.

192
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,077
And what if they're wrong?

193
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,078
You've waited over two years.

194
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,358
Two years in which both Jonas and you are suffering...

195
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,069
...he is his father and I love him.

196
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,478
If you have a problem with that
we'll pack our bags right away.

197
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,116
Sorry. The major said that the colonel
wanted an update on the armoured cars.

198
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,400
Yes, Bilal. Later.
I want to speak to the colonel.

199
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,031
Yes. Thank you. Later.
Yes.

200
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,515
We know she came home at 19:32 and
disabled the alarm system.

201
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,993
She spoke with her husband
Maybe I should wait outside until Brix gets here.

202
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,518
Brix is delayed.
He asked me to bring you up to speed

203
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,994
They were in the middle of a divorce
after he had an affair with his secretary.

204
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,073
She found out and threw him out a month ago.

205
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,314
She refused to talk to him..
even on the phone.

206
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,155
Where was his daughter?
With her grandparents.

207
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,156
At 19:41 she logged onto her laptop
here in the kitchen and went online.

208
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,950
She got a glass of wine, checked some
housing sites and went to the bathroom.

209
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,193
So she didn't hear the
basement window being broken.

210
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,471
She took a long bath, then came
back in her bathrobe to cook.

211
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Was it her routine? Arriving home late,
taking a bath and eating alone in the kitchen?

212
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,950
It's a hard to know. She lived alone.
Yes.

213
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,158
Looks like she was assaulted in
the middle of cooking.

214
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,830
They struggled and ended up in this room
where he went crazy with a sword.

215
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,075
She was stabbed 21 times. The fatal
wound passed through the heart.

216
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:02,153
She was forcibly put in the chair.
This shows the amount of blood.

217
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,314
The plastic wrap, did you find cigarette butts?
It's not from a cigarette package.

218
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,397
Chewing gum?
Yes, maybe.

219
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,272
The husband claims he arrived
here a little after midnight.

220
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,153
Does he have an alibi?
...His girlfriend.

221
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,915
...backs up his story as far as times etc.

222
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,232
He drank a lot, then came to talk to
his wife to bring her to her senses.

223
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,188
When he found the broken basement
window he went back to the road.

224
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,912
He got blood on himself.
Didn't he have a key?

225
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,153
His wife had the locks and alarms
replaced a few weeks ago.

226
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,992
She was very concerned about security.

227
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,119
She fired the previous alarm company
because they weren't good enough.

228
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,957
Under the new one, she  ordered
sensors installed throughout the garden.

229
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,988
Good to see you.

230
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,152
Can we look at the rest?
Yes, this way.

231
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,318
The victim was entitled to half
of her husband's fortune.

232
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,678
So we aren't lacking a motive.
Here is where she was found.

233
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,153
She had nothing to do with
Mindelunden Park.

234
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,190
But she was dragged over the fence.
There are photos at the back of the file.

235
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,999
Thank you.

236
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,230
The husband isn't stupid, we think most
of it is an elaborate diversion.

237
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,632
Everything points to him.

238
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,270
What are you thinking?

239
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,671
I think there's a mistake here.

240
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,628
I think I'm wasting your time.

241
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,076
I just want to hear your opinion.

242
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,949
Can't we sleep on it?
So we'll have a chat tomorrow...

243
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,715
I don't know if I have anything.
If you do,  let me know...

244
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,876
..if not, that's fine too.
Still, I could use your help...

245
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,237
...otherwise I'll let the guy go free
tomorrow morning.

246
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,558
It's Buch.  Karina speaking.
I've spoken to the opposition.

247
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,713
They can meet you and the People's
Party in the morning.

248
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,592
Fine. I need to read 700-800
pages, so I'll be up to speed.

249
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,957
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.
Wait a minute...

250
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:15,391
...I have a folder with some photos of a
dead woman. in the Memorial Grove

251
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,395
It's a mistake. I'm sorry.
What's it got to do with the Ministry?

252
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,430
Your predecessor wanted to be
updated, the Memorial Grove is a
national monument

253
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,229
The police don't believe
there's a political motive.

254
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,030
Yes, thanks. See you tomorrow.
Yes.

255
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,998
Hello.
Yes. Good night.

256
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,958
One Islamist association
pops up after another.

257
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,352
It's pure scaremongering.They're
determined to overthrow democracy.

258
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,832
They'll re-introduce the Middle Ages.
What about free speech?

259
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,233
The package doesn't consider
the current terrorist threat.

260
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,633
The People's Party stance is too rigid.
We cannot support it

261
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,713
I've got to go... But now
you have an insight into the problem.

262
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,270
Congratulations on your appointment.
Good luck with your task.

263
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,350
Bye, Agger.
Good day to you, Krabbe.

264
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,311
Nice try. I'll regret the outcome, but
some things have to be said.

265
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,758
We need to protect ourselves...
Think of London and Madrid.

266
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,156
The opposition is right. Intelligence
Service Reports don't support you.

267
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,472
Did you get our little gift yesterday?
Yes, thanks.

268
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,394
Since your drop in the polls ...

269
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,633
would a "scare campaign" help to
improve your ratings, put you in a safe place?

270
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,069
My grandfather was in the Resistance.
He ended up in Neuengamme.

271
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,516
Make no mistake. What I say is true...
That doesn't change anything.

272
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:29,358
Your proposal is problematic.
Who says it's only a proposal?

273
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,519
What do you mean?

274
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,676
We need each other to get
a majority vote. And right now...

275
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,196
As I see it, you have more need of
us than we have of you.

276
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,789
My party supporters want
an answer later today.

277
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,636
Is a couple of hours enough time,
to clear it with the prime minister?

278
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,354
...and thanks for coffee.

279
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,313
We'll take a five minute break...
then we'll start again.

280
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,591
Hello.

281
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,434
Give him something to eat,
then continue the interrogation.

282
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,598
The clock's ticking.
We need something more.

283
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,877
Hello.
Hello.

284
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,551
Yes, that's fine. I'm right in
the middle of something ... Yes.

285
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,793
So, I'll get back to you later, okay?
That's good. Bye.

286
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,951
Go ahead.

287
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,111
Deputy Commissioner Director,
Ruth Hedeby, wants to be here.

288
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,068
Sarah Lund. I've heard a lot about you.
Please sit down.

289
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,874
Mindelunden Park is
a national monument.

290
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,194
We'd like to dispell any speculation.

291
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,799
Despite the fact the suspect has an alibi.
We're laying charges today...

292
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,953
...If we're to bring charges today
...we'll need more.

293
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,636
I'd like to know if
you can help in this matter.

294
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,634
I don't know if I can.

295
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,236
I see no weak points
in the investigation.

296
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,188
The forensic evidence
is conclusive, so ...

297
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,875
But do you have any thoughts?
Yes ...

298
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,228
I don't think it's him...
...the husband, I mean.

299
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,109
Of course, it could have been him,
but I don't think so.

300
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,319
I don't think he has anything to do with it.

301
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:06,079
The report says that the offence
was a crime of passion..

302
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,199
yet he dragged the body to Mindelunden Park..

303
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,912
yes to hinder the investigation. According
to forensics, he was covered with blood.

304
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,676
I just want to hear what Lund
has to say, if that's okay.

305
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:29,716
The victim was afraid of the suspect.
She had been for some time.

306
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,356
Her husband had a motive
and was manipulative ...

307
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,594
but he wasn't violent.
There are no previous reported incidents.

308
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,877
And I think...

309
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,239
...that whoever did this wanted to say
something about where he left the body.

310
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,915
Yes.
What did he want to say?

311
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,669
What did she do before she was married?
A lot.

312
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,073
Partly educated in the U.S...
...NGO's in Africa and Asia.

313
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,872
During certain periods she was
employed by the Army and Amnesty.

314
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,352
What did she do in the Army?
Military Legal Adviser...

315
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,548
...sent to the Balkans, Iraq, Cyprus,
Afghanistan. It was several years ago.

316
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,951
Did she have military contacts?
No.

317
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,638
Aside from a monthly contribution
to a veterans' Association.

318
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,191
It was paid by automatic transfer
and ... Sorry, excuse me..

319
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,269
I don't know if I'm right in this...

320
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,197
...but if so, then there is something
you haven't found...

321
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,511
...or something's missing.

322
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,478
Yes ?...

323
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,671
The husband has just confessed.

324
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,868
He confessed to the killing
and the removal of the corpse.

325
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,996
Well then...

326
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,515
Good. Yes.

327
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,118
Prosecutors must have a detailed
confession to prepare the charge...

328
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,434
...so we can close this case.
Sorry. Thanks for your effort.

329
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,910
For a moment there,
I was getting worried.

330
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,599
I'm sorry ...
It's fine.

331
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,276
I would gladly pay for your costs...
No. I wanted to come anyway.

332
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,113
Congratulations.

333
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,875
He will live; he must live... Hurrah!

334
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,512
Time to blow out the candles. Ready?
I need a breath...

335
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,070
Really. Here we go...
Go ahead.

336
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,471
It was nice.

337
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,159
While we're all here, Bjørn and I
want to share something with you.

338
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,395
It's good news... In a moment of madness,
Bjørn asked me to marry him...

339
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,394
...and I said "yes", so you're all invited.

340
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,120
Congratulations!

341
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,308
It'll be a simple ceremony.
I'm not wearing white.

342
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,836
So that's out. Sit down.

343
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,234
Here, Mom. Thanks for the sweater.
- I'm sorry about the size.

344
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,756
It doesn't matter.
I'm just glad you're here.

345
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,469
When do you plan to leave?
Later, I'm not here for long

346
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,470
Weren't you here for an interview?
Grandma said you had a job.

347
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,798
No, no..She misunderstood.
How are you?

348
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,034
Fine, Dad. Ulla and the girls are in
Spain for a few days...

349
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,512
...so I have the house all to myself.
Mark.

350
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,831
Come on, Sarah.

351
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,149
Strange here.
Lund speaking..I can't get hold of Brix.

352
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,313
He's in the middle of an interrogation.
I think I have something about the case.

353
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,077
He is just explaining it all..
The plastic wrap..remember?

354
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,915
I think the killer filmed everything
So..unless you believe...

355
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,474
...the husband filmed the assault on
his wife, you have the wrong guy.

356
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,555
I just want to see the murder scene
again, if that's okay.

357
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,076
Raben, you have a visitor.

358
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,912
Raben, you old wanker.

359
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,319
Myg. How are you?
I'm doing fine. Yes, how about you?

360
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,109
Well thanks.
I have some books to read as they say.

361
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,352
Please, sit down.
OK.

362
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,359
I'm bloody sorry I didn't come
more often, but I've been busy.

363
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,193
It's okay.

364
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,636
You talked to Louise?
Yes. She called me yesterday.

365
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,828
I don't know if you can use it.
A job with a master carpenter.

366
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,237
An ex-sergeant.
He talks about the good old days.

367
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,109
He needs a man for a few months.

368
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,398
Does he know where I am? Yes,
he helps out Association members.

369
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,111
I'll get someone to call him,
so he can send a letter here.

370
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,271
Thanks, Myg.
Hey, we always help each other.

371
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,116
The Association can help
with an apartment.

372
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,910
I'll speak to Louise before I head off..

373
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,200
Where you going?
I'm being transferred next week.

374
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,474
Louise can call them herself.
Barracks life is not for me, right?

375
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,668
Too damn boring.
It's time for a change.

376
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,597
Where?
In Helmand. Maybe up north.

377
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,709
It all happened so fast.
I gotta go.

378
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,874
The last time you said you wanted out.
I have to go now.

379
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,397
What did you do? No matter what
it is, I can help you, Myg.

380
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,791
You don't know a damn thing.

381
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,794
When we got home,
I thought it was all over.

382
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,670
It's not over.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

383
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,276
Take care of yourself.
Guard! let me out.

384
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,080
Hello.
Hello.

385
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,437
Hello, darling.
He seems okay.

386
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,875
They dropped him off from kindergarten,
and I brought him up here.

387
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,319
Thanks, Søgaard.
Let me know if I can help.

388
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,755
See you, kid.

389
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,798
Come here.

390
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,712
I know the other kids can be idiots...

391
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,350
...but it's not good to fight with them.

392
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,071
You can only fight dragons...
...and grandfather.

393
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,550
They said things about my dad.

394
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,233
I'll talk to them.

395
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,358
Is dad coming home?

396
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,116
Yes, he will.

397
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,716
I just don't quite know
when that will be.

398
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,716
I've lost a tooth.

399
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,591
Really? That's a good one.
Can I see?

400
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,715
Did it hurt?

401
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,271
Let me give it to dad.
I would even give it to him.

402
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,399
Yes. I'll try to call and see
if they have a time today.

403
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,519
Intelligence's latest threat assessment?
It's still with the Prime Minister.

404
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,312
They just got him talking sense.
He's only been here for 24 hours.

405
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,109
That's enough to undermine our
government's parliamentary base.

406
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,229
This link can only be opened at 17.03.
The Ministry of Finance.

407
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,678
It's their turn to host the
Interdepartmental Friday Get-together.

408
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,594
I thought so too, but they deny it.

409
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,151
Am I disturbing you? No,
The Intelligence Assessment.

410
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,553
What did the prime minister say?
He wasn't there.

411
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,793
What about the People's Party?
Krabbe is on his way up.

412
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,918
Let's go inside.

413
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,436
Did you decide?
We did, yes.

414
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,197
That sounds good.
I'm sorry if my tone was a little ...

415
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,990
...but it's obviously very important.
Certainly, I agree.

416
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,232
But our position is quite clear...

417
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,597
...we refuse to compromise ...

418
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,719
...on the constitutional protection
of democratic principles.

419
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,479
No threat or intimidation by you or
by terrorists can change that.

420
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,909
Yes ... If the government wants
us to leave the coalition...

421
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,959
...then we'll have to think about it.

422
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,752
I need to tell the press, of course,
that the coalition has ended.

423
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,913
I'm not a historian,
but I think that only once before...

424
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,349
...a Danish government has prohibited
an otherwise lawful union.

425
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,673
In 1941 with the communist party.

426
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,038
Back then, however, we were
under pressure from the Wehrmacht.

427
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,158
This can't be compared with that.
I've spoken to constitutional experts.

428
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,438
I've enclosed their opinions...
...if you're interested.

429
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,069
Will you be part of a settlement
or stand alone with your views...

430
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,791
...which haven't been heard since
the Nazis were in the country?

431
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,239
Lund, I haven't got all night.
Why would he film it?

432
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,916
You said the victim was put
in the chair after the stabbing.

433
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,915
Yes, but the volume of blood suggests ...
...she was placed in the chair ...

434
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,958
..and then stabbed?

435
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,069
That doesn't fit a crime of passion.
Who said it was?

436
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,033
Only one stab wound was deep
enough to strike a vital organ.

437
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,431
Why didn't she defend herself?
She had no defensive wounds on her hands.

438
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,717
You think she was bound...
...he wanted to talk to her...

439
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,475
...and only the last stab was fatal.

440
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,156
You think he stabbed her...
to get her to talk. About what?

441
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,469
What is it?

442
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,029
A military dog tag.

443
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,875
One half is sheared off.

444
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,160
Do you have the address of the Veterans'
Association she was a member of?

445
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,113
Did you speak to the Director of Prisons?
I've completed your assessment.

446
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,229
You'll get an answer tomorrow.
I can't wait until tomorrow.

447
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,233
Relax now, dammit.

448
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,197
Hello. I asked for a phone call.
Has the Director seen it?

449
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,397
I don't know.
Raben!

450
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,917
An army buddy visited me.
He isn't feeling well.

451
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,950
I need to call him.
I'll say that it is urgent.

452
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,192
Thank you.
We should talk about something else.

453
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,592
Can I just call first?
No. Let's get started.

454
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,797
The Directorate of Prisons has
rejected your application. I'm sorry..

455
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,308
Normally it takes a long time and
they follow our advice, but ....

456
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,510
I haven't received an explanation.
You'll get it as soon as possible.

457
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,593
I'm sorry.
Why?

458
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,548
As I said...
I've followed the treatment..all that was asked.

459
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,475
You may apply again in six months.
You should value your progress.

460
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,475
Listen to me.. I have a young son.
Not so close to the director.

461
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,598
I just have to ...
Fuck off!

462
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,194
Raben... quiet, quiet.

463
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,195
You should take it easy.
I am calm. You don't understand.

464
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,990
I'm not a psychopath.
Raben, come on now...Now!

465
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,552
Calm down, calm down...
Let me go!

466
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,634
Calm, calm.

467
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,477
Yes. I'll tell him. Thank you.

468
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,316
The People's Party accepts the
revised text with minor modifications.

469
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,552
That sounds good.

470
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,828
You don't seem very happy.

471
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,834
The Law of 1941 can't be compared
to the People's Party proposal.

472
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,232
Next time you come to see me,
and not my lawyers.

473
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,916
You're right. Sorry.
There's something you have to see.

474
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,712
It's Karina Munk Jorgensen.
The Justice minister is delayed..Thanks.

475
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,352
I just opened that link.
What link?

476
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,876
Hang on for a minute.

477
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,237
It's just re-loading.

478
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,111
It says it's from hotmail.
Come on, what is it?

479
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,598
It's interesting, but ...
...wait a minute. Here it is.

480
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,037
"I accuse the hypocritical
Danish Government and...

481
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,228
...the infidel Danish people of crimes

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,310
Ten days ago a woman was 
killed in unusual circumstances


2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,271
The Muslim League
will punish Denmark.

3
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,990
My blood will flow.
How many will follow me?

4
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:24,236
Brix Thinks you will contribute a new angle.
David Gruner, 28 a former soldier.

5
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:28,839
What does Intelligence know of the group?
Raben was the squad leader.

6
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:35,522
And the rest?
Raben is a fugitive.

7
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:40,519
Thomsen lives on an island in Sweden.
Raben may show up.

8
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,079
The Directorate of Prisons
has rejected your application.

9
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:50,080
Why can't I see him?
Raben has escaped.

10
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:53,521
He suddenly showed up.
I have no documents?

11
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:58,396
Something happened in the village.
There was an officer who fucked-up.

12
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:03,117
They can't just disappear.
What happened in the village?

13
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:07,565
He was called 'Perk'.
Thomsen - don't start it!  Stop!

14
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:15,285
The government's put a lot of effort
into the anti-terrorism package.

15
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:20,522
Do you want to be Minister of Justice?
I had an affair with Monberg.

16
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:24,477
The report of an incident in Afghanistan.

17
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,278
I have to resign.
The names of the victims.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,179
I demand an explanation.

19
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,162
...or I'll tell the press that the
Government doesn't dare tackle terrorism.

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,969
Buch...

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,602
We need to stop.
Are you starting rumours again

22
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:48,050
It's available in print.
Monberg took pills.

23
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:55,366
What if everything is pre-arranged...staged?
The video, 'Faith Brother' , Kodmani?

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,049
The Army doesn't kill its own people.
Someone in the army does.

25
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:04,729
Lund and Strange continue with the investigation.
There was no officer 'Perk', no bodies.

26
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:10,333
Have you checked everything personally?
My deputy briefed me. stop stop stop

27
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,334
  Who was that?.

28
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:16,852
Innocents die too We do the dirty work.
The polititions don't want blood on their hands

29
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:24,007
I need your help.
Why did he try to kill himself?

30
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:27,486
Things need to come to light;
But now, just now. Monberg is involved.

31
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:31,444
The lawyer wanted the case reopened.

32
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:36,771
It was a Defence case but
the Minister of Justice was called in.

33
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:41,135
One of the soldiers interviewed was
Jens Peter Raben.

34
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:45,007
You can't get an air gun for 600.
I'll use it....

35
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:48,534
My father knows about the phone.
The chaplain says something is very wrong.

36
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,075
You better take this from me
I'll change as we go.

37
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:56,377
I don't know what I was thinking..

38
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,168
They were trained by a lieutenant
they called 'Perk'.

39
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:06,050
His real name is Per K. Møller.
He was with Team Aegir.

40
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,417
It was a nice funeral.
Did you have contact with the investigators?

41
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,573
A lawyer was out here asking
the same questions.

42
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,097
The man died three months
before the incident.

43
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:21,655
Søgaard didn't want them to see the corpse.
...If he's actually dead.

44
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:26,942
We need to dig up the coffin
to see what's inside.

45
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:37,138
Something came up.
You could help decorate tables.

46
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,640
I'll come and help tomorrow morning.

47
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,856
That's when I'm getting married.

48
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:47,223
Mom, I can't talk now.
I'll call you later.  Bye.

49
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:52,139
How deep do we need to dig?
About my own height.

50
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:57,460
Is the coffin still intact?
It's the first time, so...

51
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:02,416
Beware of the hedge.
Lund, there's a problem.

52
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:08,298
We can't do it before getting a warrant.
Most judges won't allow it.

53
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:15,056
We're about to speak to
the army chaplain and Major Søgaard.

54
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:21,258
The mother of the deceased will have to be there.
I can't support you on this

55
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,023
We don't have reason enough.

56
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:29,024
Get those people away.
I don't want any digging.

57
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,581
Can we just talk?
I've changed my mind... no.

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,623
There may have been a mistake
in connection with the funeral.

59
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:39,917
You have no right.

60
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,811
We want to be absolutely sure that
it's your son who's in the coffin.

61
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:50,507
We need your permission.
We will proceed with reverence.

62
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,008
why do you think he's not in the coffin?

63
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:57,182
There's evidence that he was seen
alive after his death.

64
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:01,312
Some soldiers in Afghanistan
saw something.

65
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:06,422
Your son could be involved in
the killing of civilians.

66
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,230
If you give us your permission,
We can start now.

67
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:16,467
Otherwise I'll get the permit
through other channels.

68
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,754
Are you, human?
I understand...

69
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:28,431
Lund, Brix wants to speak with you.

70
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:39,593
We talked about a suspect.
They weren't allowed to see the body.

71
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:44,593
The chaplain and Søgaard said...
It's not enough.

72
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:49,309
Not without the consent of the mother.
There is no one in the coffin.

73
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,267
If we are faced with an empty coffin...
Send these workers home.

74
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,112
Brix, wait a minute!

75
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,272
I know I'm right!

76
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,273
Trust me about this, dammit!

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,716
Søgaard refuses to
come in for questioning.

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,874
We need to talk with him.
What about the chaplain?

79
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,716
We're still looking for him.
We can't wait for more murders.

80
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,873
We have to do something!

81
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:43,362
You were restless and
went over to the church.

82
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:47,996
You wanted to talk to the chaplain about
your husband? He said things weren't good.
Can we go home now?

83
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:51,157
Was your husband angry with the chaplain?

84
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:56,275
He knows he was just trying to help.
They're friends.

85
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:58,082
Could your husband have hurt the chaplain?

86
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,283
I told you they are friends..

87
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:04,278
The chaplain never showed up for a meeting.

88
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,760
A witness saw the chaplain leave with
someone who looks like your husband.

89
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:13,398
Do you have an idea
where he would go?

90
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:17,481
He would never do anything to the chaplain.

91
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:21,078
Thank you.

92
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,444
The pizza's cold.
We'll buy another one on the way home..

93
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,840
Where are we going?
Just drive.

94
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:48,004
What did Dragsholm want?
Why did she contact you?

95
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:57,289
She wanted the case reopened.
Turn in here... Here.

96
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,332
Leave the key in the ignition.

97
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,051
Move away from the car...

98
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,130
...Farther away....

99
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:29,054
What are you doing?
You'll get no help out here.

100
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,855
The police will find out.

101
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:36,374
Yes, hello. Is this the police?
My name is Gunnar Torp.

102
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:40,689
I'm in Hareskoven
and want to report an assault.

103
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:48,048
A former soldier, Jens Raben,
threatened me with a gun.

104
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:54,055
I don't know where he is.
I'll wait by the main path. Thank you.

105
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:01,256
Leave me out of this. If you ever come back, I'll shoot you
What did Dragsholm want?

106
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,598
Go now, damn.
Chaplain, what did she say?

107
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,999
Just go...the police are on their way

108
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,330
She visited Myg, Grüner, Thomsen.

109
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,937
She wanted them to testify
about the officer.

110
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:19,655
I buried that officer, three months before
it happened. Go away now.

111
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:33,332
What had Dragsholm found out?
Why should the case be reopened?

112
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:37,417
She wanted me to testify.

113
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:39,702
I heard the others talk about the officer.

114
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,203
What did they say...?

115
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:47,144
Søgaard told the family that
they shouldn't see the body.

116
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:52,060
What did Søgaard say?
That it was all blown up

117
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:57,254
I've been imprisoned for two years
without my family and stuffed with drugs.

118
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:02,545
You need to talk to
Søgaard and the colonel.

119
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,817
No! No.

120
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,217
Raben...

121
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:10,855
Forgive me.

122
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,258
Think of your wife.
Think of your son.

123
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,665
I don't understand. Four murders.
Why don't we do something?

124
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:50,067
The investigation is complicated.
Everything points to fundamentalists.

125
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,668
We're being attacked by terrorists.

126
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,569
What is so damn complicated?

127
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,631
This meeting is 'off the record'...

128
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:59,032
Feelings are running high, we're all affected by it..

129
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:02,630
...but please lets keep calm

130
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,546
Yes, of course. Sorry.

131
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:11,027
But we're in the same boat.
There is no breakthrough.

132
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:14,630
The People's Party members
are sharpening their knives ...

133
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:19,664
...because the Minister of Justice
is delaying the anti-terrorism package.

134
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:24,192
We need to examine some things.
What things, perhaps you'll tell us?

135
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:29,874
I know the Muslim organisations that you're protecting.
While you fanny around they get stronger

136
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:34,827
They wouldn't hesitate for a moment
to introduce Sharia law.

137
00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:39,434
My foreign colleagues don't understand
why we're doing nothing.

138
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:43,307
And if these organizations
are involved with the killings?

139
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:46,914
That's why I have convened
this meeting.

140
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,789
Thomas is going to show us something 
that will explain it.

141
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:58,637
That part is no longer relevant.
It proved to be a misunderstanding.

142
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,110
What the hell is going on here?
Listen...

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,638
...We all know Buch had a difficult start.

144
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,637
But Buch would have finalized the package
if we let him work in peace.

145
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,713
We shouldn't beat each other
over the head about it.

146
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:21,637
Anyone of us could be in Buch's situation.
Sorry.

147
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,045
Rossing, here.

148
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:28,874
Protecting those organisations
is misguided 'pc' tolerance.

149
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,275
May I speak to you in private?

150
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:33,976
Nothing you can share here?

151
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:36,003
It'll only take a minute.

152
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:39,600
You should've informed the
police and Intelligence.

153
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:44,155
The police were apparently
busy with other things.

154
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:51,322
The Ministry of Defence just learned
you're about to exhume a dead soldier.

155
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:57,516
Tell us  about that?
The families are upset.

156
00:12:57,686 --> 00:13:01,122
Buch... Will you try to explain?

157
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,685
I'm not on aware of that.
If we could just...

158
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,764
You're new, but I can't protect you.

159
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:19,479
Yesterday you said something about Monberg,
you didn't follow up on that.

160
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:24,120
I need time.
Thomas tell me what it's about.

161
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:31,042
It's better if the Prime Minister
isn't aware of it.

162
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:37,399
Then no one can later say that
the prime minister was aware.

163
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,282
You'll be compromised.
What're you talking about?

164
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:50,244
Maybe I was mistaken about Monberg.
Maybe he hasn't been alone.

165
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:56,567
Meet with the People's Party.
Iron out the details with them.

166
00:13:56,732 --> 00:14:02,410
Say that we will investigate those
associations a second time.

167
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:07,244
How long?
A couple of days.

168
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:13,330
Blame me and my amateurism.
Krabbe will understand.

169
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:16,567
We're all very busy
Can we finish up?

170
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:23,006
I'll have a word with Krabbe.
I'm giving Thomas 24 hours to verify some facts.

171
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,307
May I ask which facts?

172
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:29,805
No, considering everything, not for now..

173
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:40,336
Earlier, you said that you didn't know
an officer called 'Perk'. True

174
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:46,971
Per K. Møller was nicknamed
'Perk' and was on Team Aegir.

175
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:51,489
Some of the men gave him that name.
Is that why I was brought in?

176
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,490
You were brought in to answer our questions..

177
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,572
Why were you and the chaplain
at his funeral?

178
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:03,097
We escorted the coffin home and
we wanted pay our respects

179
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,411
Respect...Why couldn't the family see the body?

180
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,090
He was killed in an explosion..ever seen one?

181
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,091
No, can't say I have..

182
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,454
His head was separated from the
rest of the body.

183
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:18,900
What's this about?

184
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:29,942
You must have worried when the others said
they'd came across an officer of that name.

185
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:35,052
Their explanation was even more unreliable
I had buried him.

186
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,240
Did you declare him dead?

187
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:38,741
He was dead..

188
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,780
Why was there no autopsy
performed in Denmark?

189
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:43,281
Operational reasons

190
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:49,102
We were careful with information because
it may have looked like a suicide.

191
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,660
He might have taken his own life?
We'll never know that.

192
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,661
he may have intentionally detonated the device

193
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,953
What an absurd statement.

194
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:02,095
At this moment the coffin is being exhumed
we'll see what it contains..

195
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,976
I'm not scared because you're
exhuming the body..

196
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:08,377
Lund...

197
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,508
They've called from the cemetery.
The coffin's out.

198
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,509
..and whats inside?

199
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,941
Hello, Lund.
Good to see you again.

200
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,625
I get these type of jobs only
when you're in the neighborhood.

201
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,668
Well?
White male, late twenties.

202
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,984
Femur bone indicates
a height of 180-182 cm.

203
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,305
He's had a rough ride.
I would guess an explosion.

204
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:49,229
It's quite a mess.
Like that time in the Balkans ...

205
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:54,910
You can't know for sure if he was
Per K. Møller.

206
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:59,749
All the evidence...
You can't be sure.

207
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:04,270
It may be someone else. They could've
swapped one body for another.

208
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:08,188
It doesn't have to be Per K. Møller.
What's that?

209
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:18,552
We need a DNA test. Or his teeth?
It just doesn't fit.

210
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:23,467
It can't be him.

211
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,432
Søgaard and the chaplain
didn't want them to see the corpse.

212
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:34,226
There's something wrong.
I know there is...

213
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:45,627
Wrap up and get it shut down.

214
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,994
Hey! What's happening?
Do you have someone buried around here?

215
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:13,278
Some deranged detective thought that...

216
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,717
...we had buried an empty coffin.

217
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:21,034
I thought they had better things to do.

218
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:34,595
"The dragon curled around the village,
grabbed its tail and fell asleep. "

219
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,757
Now you must sleep.
Tomorrow we'll make your room beautiful.

220
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:45,918
Why are they after Daddy?
Is he gone?

221
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:53,639
Daddy's playing hide and seek,
just like you do in kindergarten.

222
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:56,320
Go to sleep.

223
00:18:56,486 --> 00:19:02,038
Are they mad at Dad?
No. They just want to find him.

224
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:05,483
And if they find him,
we can go to visit him.

225
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,765
Do you want to try your new scooter tomorrow?

226
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,041
Sleep well, darling.

227
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:29,483
Yes, yes, of course. I understand.
Thank you. Goodbye.

228
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:37,960
They've found the chaplain.
He says Jens threatened him with a gun.

229
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,083
Nothing wrong with him, only some bruising.

230
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:51,167
I was just checking if everything's okay.
Don't go leaving the barracks.

231
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:56,372
I'd like to know what the hell is going on.

232
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:00,970
Explosives were found at the barracks.
You and Søgaard were interviewed.

233
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,911
Now the chaplain claims
Jens threatened him.

234
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,912
None of us know what's going on in his mind..
he is capable of anything

235
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:11,047
Something happened in Afghanistan,
which shouldn't have happened.

236
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,853
That's right.

237
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,371
Three soldiers from his group were killed.

238
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,372
Something else happened, it doesnt make
 sense..

239
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:20,593
There is a simple explanation for his behaviour
...it's not unknown

240
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:25,093
Jens was squad leader. He made
a wrong decision. I too feel guilty.

241
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,554
So he's acting out of guilt?

242
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,155
You are his wife and know him well but..

243
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:32,893
There are certain sides of Jens
you don't know.

244
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,810
I want you to go.

245
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,177
Why do you think he went into service
when Jonas was born?

246
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,178
He wanted to serve his country 
He volunteered for Iraq.

247
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:41,179
No

248
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:46,537
He simply had to leave, Louise..he had
no choice...

249
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:50,453
Jens isn't the man you think...
Go ..

250
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,413
Get out of here!

251
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,011
Rossing attended important meetings
with Monberg ...

252
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,934
...including one
where Raben was on the agenda.

253
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:15,812
Officially called, "the Prevention of
crimes among returning soldiers."

254
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:18,692
Raben is not the only soldier
mentioned as an example.

255
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:20,785
Eat. It's delicious.

256
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:27,575
My guess is that they have taken pains
to tarnish Raben's reputation.

257
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:31,955
Why aren't there any minutes?
Only Ministers were there.

258
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,455
I was working on a bill.

259
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:39,778
Monberg had promised his voters
cuts in the prison system.

260
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,617
Isn't there any dessert?

261
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,734
If Monberg had been aware of the
Afghan military case...

262
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:52,342
...and failed to inform the police
when Dragsholm was killed...

263
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:57,182
...what are the police and Intelligence doing?
They quarrel among themselves.

264
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:03,183
They disagree about the exhumation.
Intelligence thought it was a bad idea.

265
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:08,059
Keep me informed...
...and they need a kick in the ass.

266
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,793
What was Monberg told?

267
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:15,427
Did Monberg keep a diary?
I can call his wife.

268
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:20,424
Let me, then you can discuss it with Karina.

269
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:26,186
I have asked if we can start again.

270
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:29,228
But there'll be a disciplinary matter.
Her replacement is coming from personnel.

271
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,700
Make the call to Monberg's wife.

272
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:39,060
We can't just turn a blind eye to what she did.

273
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:43,304
Talk with her now.
No.

274
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:47,021
I won't speak to Karina.

275
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:52,425
Good evening. It's Thomas Buch.
Excuse me for disturbing you so late.

276
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:55,903
May I speak with Hannah Monberg?

277
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:03,986
Thomas said you wanted to talk to me.

278
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:07,464
No, it was his idea.
I knew nothing about it.

279
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:12,313
Okay.

280
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:19,707
I've enjoyed working here.

281
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:24,552
I admired you for your expertise.

282
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:29,790
But you can also be pretty annoying.
I've worn out three nannies, I'm...

283
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:36,954
...here all the time to meet your demands.
It was never good enough.

284
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:41,828
Everything must be done correctly.
But it all changed, huh?

285
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:47,948
When you learned I had gone to bed with
Monberg, you were really disappointed.

286
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:52,635
I was recently divorced...
But it's not something we talk about.

287
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,394
When have you asked about my private life?
I don't know.

288
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,997
Never. But you're on moral high ground
if something happens ...

289
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,073
...that falls within the rules and regulations.

290
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,677
I just think you're worth more!

291
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:13,835
What were you thinking...to destroy
your career in that way?

292
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,359
After everything I've taught you.
How's it going?

293
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:24,676
According to Monberg's wife he left
no diary, but now he's conscious.

294
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:27,676
His condition is stable.

295
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:32,678
We need to speak with him
as soon as possible.

296
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:35,836
We have to speak with him
before Rossing does.

297
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:40,475
Give me a status update on Raben...

298
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:46,038
...and find out how the police and
Intelligence investgations are going...get on it.

299
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,965
Do you have a nanny?
It's under control.

300
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:03,043
The pathologist has examined the teeth.

301
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:07,359
There's no doubt about the soldier's identity.

302
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:16,005
Either it will be your funeral or Lund's.

303
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:19,639
Do you understand what I'm saying?

304
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:25,525
I'll hand over your head if this isn't solved.

305
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:31,526
Intelligence have traced Jens Peter Raben.

306
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,923
He abandoned the chaplain's car
and continued on foot.

307
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,403
Have they been in touch with him?
König will tell us tomorrow.

308
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:46,122
Could you ask if we can do something?

309
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:56,322
Hard to think that you could
handle so much failure.

310
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,054
And your admission.

311
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:15,045
I'll give Gedser a message.
You can resume your work there.

312
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:22,286
Send Major Søgaard home.
I want to talk to you later.

313
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,936
Shall I take you home?

314
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:55,773
Thanks for...
Lund, I'm sorry that it...

315
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,850
I'll call tomorrow and then...

316
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,092
Say hi to your mom and
say congratulations...

317
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:15,574
Raben left the chaplain's car in Valby
and stole another car nearby.

318
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:20,054
We found that around 2.00.

319
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:26,617
He slept three hours, and drove further.
He's near the barracks.

320
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:31,937
Why don't we arrest him?
Raben is the last of the group.

321
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:35,699
He's the next potential victim.

322
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,494
You'll use him as bait?

323
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:44,863
At some point the perpetrators
will come after Raben.

324
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:49,416
Our people can assist.
Thanks.

325
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,137
We're better equipped for that.
You still have Lund ...

326
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:59,016
Our cooperation problems are over.
We can get back to normal.

327
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:04,341
The Ministry of Justice
will be very happy with that.

328
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:09,535
I'd like to show you this. Refugees from Helmand
who spent years in Denmark.

329
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:16,102
Maybe they're out for revenge.

330
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,462
They need to be monitored or interrogated.

331
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:25,419
They're alive, so they don't need to be dug up.
Got a minute? Lennart, we need to talk.

332
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,061
Why didn't Raben kill you into the woods?

333
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,146
No idea.
Perhaps because he know's he's wrong.

334
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:47,502
He must be under enormous pressure.
I tried to talk some reason into him.

335
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:51,745
War does strange things to people.

336
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:58,705
This was in your church.
Anne Dragsholm's card.

337
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:04,107
Why was it there?
Raben had it with him.

338
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:09,632
Did you know her?
No, Raben began talking about her..seemed obsessed

339
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:15,427
Can I go now?
It's Sunday and there's a service.

340
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:17,745
Yes, yes..ok

341
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:25,550
Intelligence has a lead on Raben.
They'll try to monitor him.

342
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:28,034
Why aren't we arresting him?
We do what they say.

343
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,035
Go through this list

344
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:34,991
We need to check the chaplain.
You check out the Afghan refugees.

345
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:37,374
Get on it immediately.
Lund also thought...

346
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,375
Lund..not here now.

347
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:43,877
My quota for hernias is used up.
Get going.

348
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:51,996
What do we say if anyone calls for Lund?

349
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,992
That she's gone to a wedding.

350
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,393
I've spoken with Møller's mother.
We support the need for compensation...

351
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,314
...because of the pain and suffering
the police actions have caused.

352
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,712
The chaplain is clearly shaken.

353
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:14,558
The question is what to do about Raben.

354
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:18,635
He must feel very pressured.
He's the last one left.

355
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:23,956
It's a good idea
if we keep our eyes and ears open.

356
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:29,436
Have you informed Louise?
He was one of the best.

357
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:32,754
Raben always did 10% extra.

358
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:36,963
But he couldn't handle it in the long run.

359
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:43,200
We found out the whole thing?
What Raben and others spoke about.

360
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:48,234
How safe are we?
We are 100% safe.

361
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:50,760
Why?

362
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:57,399
These last few days have been intense.
I can just take over.

363
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,957
That's not necessary.
Otherwise, thank you.

364
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:13,957
Are you hungry?
Would you like a sandwich?

365
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:18,999
Go ahead.

366
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,528
We only have a few minutes.

367
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:42,442
I have to get away from the barracks.
What did you do with the chaplain?

368
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:46,127
Nothing. They lied.
About what?

369
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:49,728
My dad says you feel guilty.

370
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,965
I want to know what happened.
An officer did something.

371
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:57,409
They're covering it up.
Who?

372
00:31:57,573 --> 00:32:02,727
Søgaard, maybe more.
Maybe your dad.

373
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:09,891
It's simply a lie.

374
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:17,326
You need to talk to Sarah Lund.
Tell her she should consider ...

375
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:22,524
Is it true that you joined voluntarily,
right before Jonas was born?

376
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:29,373
Who says so?
Just answer me honestly.

377
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:37,090
Yes it's true. Can't you see
they're trying to separate us?

378
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:40,216
It's not what you think.

379
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:46,330
After all I had seen and done...

380
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,936
I didn't deserve him.
He was so pure. I wasn't.

381
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,055
Let me go!

382
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,495
I just want to go home and be with you.

383
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,538
Let mom go! Let her go!

384
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:15,651
You've grown.
It's me. Daddy.

385
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:24,377
May I see?

386
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:28,900
It's nice.
Mom, let's go now.

387
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:35,740
Don't look for us again.
Ever.

388
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:49,980
Would you rather wait here?
It's okay.

389
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:59,419
There' a future for you after all.
It's good to see you.

390
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:03,899
How are you?
Fine.

391
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:09,142
I understand that everything
has developed into something of a storm.

392
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:12,300
Hi, Karina.

393
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:21,426
I'll be taking better care of this old heart.

394
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,707
I'm not even sure that
I can eat these anymore.

395
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,580
Okay, you're obviously aware.

396
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:44,220
I haven't had it good for a while.

397
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:48,590
I don't want to cause my family
any unnecessary misery.

398
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:54,623
We understand. But we are here
because of that old military issue.

399
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:59,821
The one where you sent in
the information before you...

400
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:02,986
There isn't so much to tell.

401
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:10,390
I forwarded it as a gesture
to Anne Dragsholm.

402
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:15,106
I had a meeting with her,
shortly before she was killed.

403
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:20,110
She gave me the folder when I left.
She was very committed to the case.

404
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:25,350
I couldn't help, unfortunately.
Why?  You already knew about the case

405
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:33,151
The Defence Minister called you to
a meeting about a soldier from that time,...

406
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:40,793
...Jens Peter Raben.
I... I don't quite understand.

407
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:45,156
Just tell me what you discussed with Rossing.

408
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:47,915
It was several years ago.
I can't remember all the details.

409
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,916
Ohh For Fuc...

410
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,031
Frode, you withheld information from
Police and Intelligence. Why?

411
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,752
What are you hiding, I need to know?
Karina, what's this?

412
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,912
Why would you have a chat about a soldier?
What did Rossing say?

413
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,413
How can I remember..

414
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:14,080
You spoke with the Defense Minister...
...two years earlier than Dragsholm.

415
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,275
You didn't say a damn thing...
...not even when she was killed.

416
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:19,576
It wasn't the first thing in my mind..

417
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:24,877
What did Rossing say at the meeting?

418
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:29,912
Will you come and visit again?
That's great.

419
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:35,363
Thanks for your sympathy, but the doctor
says my husband needs to rest.

420
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:39,039
This isn't very good for him.

421
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:47,323
My wife is right. I need to rest.


422
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,596
Yes.

423
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:08,478
Plough says Krabbe is still impatient.
He wants to talk to you.

424
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,924
I've got 24 hours.
Send him back to the Prime Minister. .

425
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:17,607
There's a complaint that the police have
had a soldier dug up for no reason.

426
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:25,801
Who was in charge of the exhumation?
It's academic, She's off the case

427
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:28,090
Some years ago she solved
a manslaughter case and she  ...

428
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,688
...broadened her investigation
into the role of local politicians.

429
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:40,879
I suggest you say that
they fired her and that we ...

430
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:44,647
I'd like to speak to her.

431
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:48,088
Maybe she knows something...she can't always
 be wrong.

432
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:52,404
It'll compromise your relationship
with the police.

433
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:58,364
If Monberg won't tell us what's going on
we'll try something else...get hold of her for me

434
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:06,726
I hereby pronounce you man and wife,
 for better or worse..

435
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:09,931
You may kiss the bride.
May I?

436
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:19,810
Thank you.
Much obliged.

437
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:25,130
Now, let's have something to eat and drink.
And another, and another.

438
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:29,336
He's good enough and was a soldier.

439
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:34,727
Congratulations, Grandma.
Thanks.

440
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:39,210
I'm the master of ceremonies ...
so, keep the speeches short.

441
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:44,372
We need time to dance.
We should do the photo-shoot.

442
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:49,329
Sorry. There's call.
We've put all the presents there.

443
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:53,128
Even the flowers for you.
The red bouquet.

444
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:59,773
Okay. Thank you.
We need to have you here with us

445
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,013
Congratulations!
Thank you. And now we'll smile.

446
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:51,942
Are you still at Police Headquarters?
No, no longer.

447
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:57,819
I just read that they had
exhumed a dead soldier.

448
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:08,783
Someone is looking for you.
She says it's important.

449
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,736
I'm quite tired waiting to make this speech ...

450
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:16,583
...so I'll jump right into it.

451
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,741
That's fine. Wait a minute.

452
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:26,745
Karina Munch, Justice.
Shall we toast? Cheers.

453
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,748
You need to have a confidential conversation,
it's important 

454
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:38,187
A conversation... with whom?

455
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,584
It's this way.

456
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:09,150
Hello. Thomas Buch. Karina has briefed you
that what we say here is confidential..

457
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:12,432
I desperately need some answers.

458
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,713
If it's about the exhumation...
I'm sorry.

459
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:21,590
Are you familiar with the allegations
against Danish soldiers in Afghanistan?

460
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,591
Er..yes..well..a little about it.

461
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:25,443
Yes, but maybe more than me...

462
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:28,955
Is there any evidence of civilian killings?

463
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:33,907
It's best if you call
Lennart Brix or Ruth Hedeby.

464
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:40,870
Their focus is on a certain officer.
Is it a coverup?

465
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:45,509
No. And there was probably no officer.

466
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:54,311
Why did you have the body exhumed?
It was a mistake.

467
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:57,597
I'll have to go in again.

468
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,357
What about  the squad leader,
Jens Peter Raben?

469
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,231
I thought maybe he knew something,
but...

470
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:13,941
They say he's mentally ill and
he'd just been denied release.

471
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:15,942
Denied release..how?

472
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:22,272
Doctors had given the green light...
but for some unknown reason

473
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:28,791
.. the Directorate of Prisons refused
his application several times.

474
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:33,601
He was just disappointed.

475
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,756
Just a moment.

476
00:42:38,884 --> 00:42:43,117
Monberg was working on a bill
about the prison system.

477
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:47,244
When exactly was  it dropped?

478
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:50,560
Shortly after the meeting between
Monberg and the Defence Minister.

479
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:52,261
Get me exact details

480
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:58,837
Thank you...
...and congratulations to your mom.

481
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,883
You make me so happy.
I just want to...

482
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:12,643
...break out in speeches and song.

483
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:18,042
Sometimes I wish that
we had met earlier.

484
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:25,047
But I think we first had to
grind down our sharp edges.

485
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,921
I'm so glad about the day I
went down to the thrift store...

486
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:18,687
Who came with the flowers?
A courier. Look at the card,

487
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:35,886
Now we're all together.
So I think...

488
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:40,768
It's what I was doing.
Dear Bjørn...

489
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,449
What is it?

490
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:58,970
"You're going now your mother is speaking"?
Yes, that's just what she does.

491
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,452
You'll probably get used to it, Bjørn.

492
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:09,298
The women in this family are very
busy, so tighten your buttocks.

493
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:12,977
And you're showing up just now?

494
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:16,771
Where was I?
Dear lovely Bjørn...

495
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:49,777
I want to apologise.
I know I can't make amends.

496
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:55,179
I hope you understand that
it was important to be certain.

497
00:45:56,426 --> 00:46:03,424
I understand that you don't want to talk
to me. But I must know something.

498
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:09,424
It's about your son's ID tag.
Chain... Metal plate with his name.

499
00:46:09,588 --> 00:46:12,580
Do you know where it is?

500
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:19,867
No. They said they never found it.

501
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:23,863
They said it was gone when he...

502
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:27,864
It didn't come home
with his other belongings?

503
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,828
Why you ask?

504
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,303
I think someone found his ID tag
...and used it.

505
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:41,989
Somebody who needed
to have a different identity.

506
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:45,508
I won't disturb you anymore.

507
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:50,666
Wait a minute.
There is something I need to show you.

508
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:54,189
I thought it might be a mistake.

509
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:59,666
Occasionally things crop up,
as if Per was still alive.

510
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:03,509
For example, bills for purchase
of different things.

511
00:47:03,674 --> 00:47:06,791
This one from two months ago.

512
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:25,990
You should only come
during visiting hours.

513
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:33,545
I have nothing more to say.
You don't have much to say.

514
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:39,587
According to Plough,
you promised your constituents...

515
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:42,354
to reduce the number of prisoners
and overcrowded prisons...

516
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,364
We have nothing to discuss.

517
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:48,717
...and fewer people
in preventive detention.

518
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:55,069
Some inmates would be reviewed
and given conditional release.

519
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,679
One of them was Jens Peter Raben.
That's what Rossing wanted to discuss.

520
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,950
Oddly enough, you withdrew the bill.
It ended up in a drawer.

521
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:12,239
No. There were other reasons.

522
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:17,954
I'll leave you alone. Plough and the legal experts
are examining all the files..they'll find out..

523
00:48:18,122 --> 00:48:20,431
Wait!

524
00:48:29,883 --> 00:48:34,241
What are you going to do now?
That depends on you.

525
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:39,034
But it doesn't look good.
It wasn't my decision.

526
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:42,402
I was just been doing my job.

527
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:47,962
Rossing didn't want Raben released, he was insistant
and didn't go into detail

528
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:51,441
It was in the national interest to keep him locked-up.
He didn't explain further?

529
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:52,442
national interests like what?

530
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,543
He didn't explain it to me, just insisted..

531
00:48:56,326 --> 00:49:00,525
Raben knew something had happened.
I don't understand it.

532
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,396
Rossing told me what I should do.
But you found out ...

533
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:10,484
...then Anne Dragsholm wanted
to have the case reopened.

534
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:14,482
What did Dragsholm discover?
nay nay nay nay nay

535
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:18,119
There isn't time for this Now, tell me!

536
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,838
There are people dying out there!

537
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:26,686
And you'll be blamed for it,
not Rossing.

538
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:39,609
She found proof that the soldiers
were telling the truth.

539
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,811
That there had been civilian killings.

540
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:48,170
That Raben had been wrongly imprisoned.

541
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:52,008
What else did she find out?
The officer...

542
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:58,043
...she found the officer who did it.
That's all I know.

543
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:03,282
What'll happen now?
Who was it?

544
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:06,446
She didn't say.

545
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:14,651
What am I going to do?
It'll be alright.

546
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:17,773
It was right to tell me.

547
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:22,815
I need to talk to you.
This is important.

548
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:29,570
Two minutes.
Rossing won't say anything.

549
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:34,208
You'll never get him to say anything.
You don't know him.

550
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:43,136
Monberg starts talking. Intelligence
comes and informs the Prime Minister.

551
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:48,214
Krabbe demands your resignation.
Is this something you know or...

552
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:53,055
He's told the prime minister.
You're out, or the government falls.

553
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:58,613
Monberg gives an official explanation
and then we take it from there.

554
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,738
Things will fall into place.

555
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:13,253
Where's Monberg?
He's gone out to stretch his legs.

556
00:51:22,823 --> 00:51:27,419
Is it hanging ok now?
Just move the right corner up.

557
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,974
How's this?
Yes, that's good.

558
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:34,181
Good. How's that?

559
00:51:35,344 --> 00:51:38,416
It's nice, huh?

560
00:51:43,305 --> 00:51:46,422
I'm going to be on my way.
Thanks for your help, Dad.

561
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:50,295
Sorry for what I said yesterday.

562
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:55,620
It's okay. I've been a fool.

563
00:51:55,786 --> 00:52:00,622
Are you coming to the cadets' ball?
I'd like you to. It'll do you good.

564
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:05,942
It could be good for you.
I'm not really in the mood.

565
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:09,657
Jonas is okay.
It's you I'm worried about.

566
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:15,985
Come on.
You'll benefit from it.

567
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:21,542
I'll call the babysitter.
It's only for a couple hours.

568
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:29,140
Ok...I can't force you
Bye.

569
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,070
What time are you going?

570
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:19,184
Why aren't you at the wedding?
You need to check something.

571
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:24,032
I'm here with an interpreter
at the refugee center.

572
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:27,314
I'll walk outside.
OK.

573
00:53:28,515 --> 00:53:30,315
What is it now?

574
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:34,596
Someone used Per K. Møller's identity.

575
00:53:34,757 --> 00:53:40,276
His ID tags are gone and someone
recently bought stuff online in his name.

576
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:45,991
Run his name through the computer
and see if anything more pops up.

577
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,391
I'm in Elsinore.
When will you be back?

578
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,711
In a few hours.
Have you talked to Brix?

579
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,510
No, not yet.
That's what I'll do. Of course.

580
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,638
Sorry. Bye.

581
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:10,993
Strange and the others are
still out talking to refugees.

582
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:16,077
Anything come out of it?
They've traveled a lot.

583
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:22,842
What does Intelligence know about
Raben?  He followed his wife and son.

584
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:26,962
It ended up in a quarrel.
Now he's back at the barracks.

585
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:31,163
There was no trace of the perpetrators?

586
00:54:31,324 --> 00:54:35,875
It's true that König is focusing
on Raben, last survivor of the unit.

587
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:40,277
He'll probably get something out of it.
Are you going to eat?

588
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,960
...or are you going to sulk all day?

589
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:49,200
This is from Technical Investigation.
Strange sent it in to be checked out.

590
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:53,396
The business card, the chaplain said,
he didn't know about.

591
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,396
I'm done with that pastor.

592
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:59,640
It's covered with
the chaplain's fingerprints.

593
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:04,437
Odd he said he didn't know about it.

594
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,687
Hello?

595
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:43,885
Anyone here?

596
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:49,168
Hello?

597
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,339
Sarah Lund. Send an ambulance
to Simon Church in Vesterbro.

598
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,621
I've found the pastor.
He's still breathing, but ...

599
00:57:55,622 --> 00:58:03,622

1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,610
Ten days ago a woman was murdered
under unusual circumstances.

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,856
The Muslim League will punish Denmark
for the suffering caused in Palestine and Iraq.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,935
Brix thinks you might help.
There's no point..

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,978
I could use your help.

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,055
The victim'm name is Myg Allan Poulsen.
Have you found murder weapon?

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,738
It's around his neck
You're not officially on the case.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,691
This is what I do best.
We will borrow you for a while.

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,093
His name is Abdel Hussein Kodmani.
The video was on his website.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,216
Police! Hands up.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,491
The government has worked hard
on the terrorism package.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,130
Someone needs to lead
the negotiations.

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,569
Do ypu want to be Minister of Justice?
The link was activated at 17:03.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,449
The woman was also in military service.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,171
How can it surprise us?
We were aware of the case.

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,175
But neither we, nor Intelligence had
reason to believe how it would end up.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,176
The three of us'll go out with our agreement
and show that we won't be intimidated.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,289
We'll make no commitment.
The package will be voted on.

18
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,250
I'll get the memo
Intelligence sent to your predecessor...

19
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,459
...when they warned of terrorism
connected to the first killing.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,299
The Directorate of Prisons has
refused your application.

21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,658
Why can't I see him?
Because of his outburst yesterday.

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,177
He won't take his medicine.
We have a meeting with the lawyer.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,733
There's nothing wrong with me.
Police want to interrogate you about Poulsen.

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,252
I've been contacted by someone
who calls himself a 'Faith Brother'.

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,939
He described a religious video
that he wanted to upload.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,855
We'll focus only on Kodmani and his
disciples. Do we agree on that?

27
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,456
I like football and opera.

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,930
Follow the links.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,298
Myg Poulsen was a good soldier.
Has he received any threats?

30
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,931
We receive threats constantly.
That was his bunk. His locker.

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,059
Who is Raben?
He was injured some years ago.

32
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,214
He suffered from delusions.
He took a nurse hostage.

33
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,250
He is here indefinitely.
Do you know Anne Dragsholm?

34
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,015
She's been murdered.
I don't know her.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,210
I'm sorry about Myg.
See you, honey.

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,534
What am I looking for?
Him, beside Poulsen. It's Raben.

37
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,208
Anne Dragsholm?
He said he didn't know her.

38
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,896
He left his room to go to an interview,
but never showed up.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,019
He bypassed security
and escaped through the sewers.

40
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,093
Any idea how far he could be?
-No.

41
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,058
He can't be that far.
It's pitch black down there.

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,775
The sewer ends at the water treatment plant.

43
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,933
Be like winning the lottery
to find the path.

44
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,494
All procedures were followed.
We're checking on how it could happen.

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,939
He'll soon become tired of the stench.
Yes, this is Strange.

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,048
They're searching the sewer.
He's probably smarter than they think.

47
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,816
What are you looking for?
Anything.

48
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,177
Brix is asking for us.
Is the superintendant here?

49
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,458
Yes, but Brix wants a report.
Intelligence has arrested three people ...

50
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,180
We'll interview the superintendant first.

51
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,138
Raben had expected that his application
would be approved.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,773
He's had a relapse.
Relapse into what?

53
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,889
PTSD, brought on by his experiences
he had as a soldier.

54
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,135
What experiences?
He was committed for psychiatric treatment .

55
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,610
He displayed aggressive behavior
when he returned to Denmark.

56
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,571
What had he experienced?
Our conversations are confidential.

57
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,892
You have no confidentiality
when others' lives may be in jeopardy.

58
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,735
You claimed the man could be dangerous.

59
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,736
Some of his comrades died in battle
and he felt guilty.

60
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,176
However, he suffered from amnesia.

61
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,970
He spoke of an army buddy
named Myg Allan Poulsen?

62
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,373
Not until yesterday after he had visited
..he was worried about him.

63
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,536
How worried?
He was afraid that he would harm himself.

64
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,293
Why do you ask?

65
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,294
What about the military legal advisor
Anne Dragsholm ...

66
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,376
Raben spoke very little about war and soldiers.
He was preoccupied with his family

67
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,729
Has he had contact with her?
No. I'd have known. Why?

68
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,132
We're trying to get an overview.
How can you be sure?

69
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,930
This is a record of his telephone calls and visits.

70
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:59,290
We're not trying to hide anything.
What has happened is unfortunate...

71
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,215
...and maybe we should have
anticipated it from the diagnosis.

72
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,976
Here's the visitation record,
since Raben arrived here two years ago.

73
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,212
Just so you have an idea.

74
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,618
We held him for nearly three weeks in
solitary, until he calmed down.

75
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,296
They've found where He's broken out of the sewer.

76
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,976
He's 5 km away. Should we hurry?
We have teams out in the area...

77
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,735
...and we must advise his wife and family.

78
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,054
He's a fugitive, but there's
no need for a manhunt.

79
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,817
He's on a photo with the two murder victims
but that doesn't say much.

80
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,974
But he knows them both.
He lied about it and now he's gone.

81
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,177
Is he connected to the Muslim League?
I don't know.

82
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,370
Intelligence is more interested in Kodmani
Brix agrees. Kodmani must be questioned.

83
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,692
Raben could have bolted long ago.

84
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,014
He could have escaped any time.
But he chooses now.

85
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,412
Let's go.
I'll admit that it's weird ...

86
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,495
I have respect for your work,
but sometimes it's a disaster

87
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,699
Are you now listening to gossip?
No. I'm just saying ...

88
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,696
Fine. I'll take it up with Brix.
I'm going. Give me the key.

89
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,649
No, he has no criminal record.
I have his file.

90
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,975
I sent you everything
so you could look at it. Thanks. Bye.

91
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,496
Hello.
I just talked with another lawyer.

92
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,417
Louise, do you have a moment?
He thinks we can appeal.

93
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,890
I've promised to send him all the material.

94
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,690
Everything indicates that he was planning
his escape for some time.

95
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,569
When did it happen?
After your daughter's visit.

96
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,131
If you have any idea where he'll go,
then tell us.

97
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,973
We have no clue.

98
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,655
Does he have contacts abroad?
Yes, he served in the army.

99
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,213
He's been deployed overseas
So yes, it is a possibility.

100
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,611
And you?
Has he said anything to you ...

101
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,295
If my daughter knew something,
she would say so.

102
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,739
I think I understand why he
is upset by this situation.

103
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,497
But .. here's my card if he contacts you.
He is dangerous.

104
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,619
Yes.
We understand the situation

105
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,329
Do you want a hand with that?

106
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,255
There must have been something.
He said he wanted to resume reading.

107
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,532
Whatever he has done,
there must be a reason.

108
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,295
He would say something to me.
He would never just run away.

109
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,928
Mom ...

110
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,854
Can't you sleep, Jonas?
Come on, baby.

111
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,338
Excuse me, can I get a lift?

112
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,970
Just hop into.
Remember to belt up, right?

113
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,849
I just have to go across the bridge.
I'm not crossing the bridge.

114
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,933
Can you give me a short ride?
My car is full.

115
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,095
Excuse me, are you going over the bridge?
Can I get a ride? I'll behave myself.

116
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,048
Minister of Justice Buch's attempt to create
broad consensus on the terrorism package -

117
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,452
is failing tonight. The Opposition
accuses the government of -

118
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:21,332
withholding information about two
possible terrorism-related killings.

119
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,051
There is an Intelligence service memo
which warned the Ministry of Justice -

120
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,099
of the possibility they were possibly
linked to terrorism.

121
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,935
I don't know anything about this memo
she is talking about.

122
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,255
And the government has done nothing.
-Yes. I'll call the Prime Minister if I know.

123
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,696
Krabbe.
I must first speak with Plough.

124
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,935
Where the hell is he?
He doesn't answer his mobile.

125
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,139
Plough can probably explain.
Yes, but where is he?

126
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,897
I can have him called.
I apologise for the delay. Shall we?

127
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,578
Our lawyers have investigated if
Agger leaked state secrets.

128
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,690
But is what she says true?
Nobody knows what's gone wrong.

129
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,739
Is what she says true?
That's my question.

130
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,377
Yes. There was a memo
and yes, it warned about terrorism.

131
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,579
No one can explain
how she got hold of it.

132
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,813
I don't give a shit about how she
got it. Why didn't I get it?

133
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,260
Lets be calm ...
I'd like to see the memo right now.

134
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,499
The memo came to me directly.
I gave it to your predecessor.

135
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,300
It's true you should have seen it
unfortunately it has been hectic

136
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,413
It outlines the circumstances about the
killing in Mindelunden Park.

137
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:55,422
The Intelligence service had concerns due
to the location and the woman's past.

138
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,935
Is the word 'terrorism' mentioned?
Yes.

139
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,854
You knew that I should have known?
Yes, in hindsight.

140
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,457
Your predecessor, Monberg, and I
removed the note from the record.

141
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,532
We didn't want it to get into circulation.

142
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,613
Information in it
could compromise national security.

143
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,313
What is this information?
Information about the victim's past.

144
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:20,314
The victim's past.

145
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,416
Monberg didn't elaborate and got ill.
So you do not know.

146
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,019
Monberg wanted to speak to Intelligence
about it. He knew what he was talking about.

147
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,855
Monberg was a very thorough Minister.

148
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,580
Then we need that information.

149
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,894
Set up a meeting with Kønig in Intelligence.
Yes. The Prime Minister will see you now.

150
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,931
You've done nothing about that memo.

151
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,730
The note was removed from the record.
Why?

152
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,937
It's still a little unclear.

153
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,854
Monberg fell ill. The case could
compromise national security.

154
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:03,855
How so?

155
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,457
I had actually hoped
you could answer, how.

156
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,977
Did Monberg say ...?
No, I can assure you.

157
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,655
Then it was not so out of hand.
No, it is clear.

158
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,258
Agger wants to discredit us.
Drop it and focus on the terrorism agreement.

159
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,378
Do you have the People's Party in hand?
Not really.

160
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,979
It's important that you deny Agger's allegation.

161
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,452
I spoke to the hospital.
Monberg is unconscious...

162
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,852
...so I need to wait instead for a report
by Intelligence. - Fine.

163
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,650
What has happened shocked everyone.
Instead of standing together...

164
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,610
...we quarrel. It will continue to grow
while the case is unsolved.

165
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,934
I'll get a handle on it.
I'm counting on that.

166
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,935
You have a tedious job on your plate
but my door is always open...

167
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,139
...when you need it.
Excuse me a moment.

168
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,292
I'll find out for myself.

169
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,016
Agger is more difficult than expected.
Why?

170
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,492
You'll have to appear at my committee
room tomorrow. About that memo.

171
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,930
They're hoping that you don't have
any answers and the dust will settle.

172
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,536
I have no answers.
Find them.

173
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,014
Find out what Monberg's national
security concerns were.  Okay.

174
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,974
Hello, darling. Well thanks.

175
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,689
Are the girls asleep?

176
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,012
I'm sorry I didn't call them to say goodnight.

177
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,411
Something came up.

178
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,250
Raben said he didn't know the first
victim. But then we found this.

179
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,488
Team Aegir consisted of approximately
500 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan.

180
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,255
including Jens Peter Raben, Myg Allan
Poulsen and Anne Dragsholm.

181
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,096
I don't know what it has to do
with the Muslim League.

182
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,732
The perpetrator obtained the list of names
of the entire Team Aegir.

183
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,939
So, we need to get Raben.
He knows what this is all about.

184
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,059
Intelligence printed the roster,
of those you're talking about.

185
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,089
They've arrested three suspects
linked to Kodmani's association.

186
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,650
During the raid on the Association's premises...

187
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,369
...they found a key to a post box in Vesterbro.

188
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,690
The box is registered in Kodmani's name.
The content speaks for itself.

189
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,336
Lennart.
Shall we get started?

190
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,733
You sympathise with the Taliban's battle
against international forces.

191
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,529
The Afghan people
have the right to defend themselves.

192
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,056
Is it okay to beat Danish soldiers to death?

193
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,259
What do you expect?
You are at war. You kill people too.

194
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,810
Do you save your photos for recognition?

195
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,859
This is ridiculous. I have an alibi.
This was in your box.

196
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,332
We also found a list of Team Aegir.

197
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,052
The post box was rented
just over a month ago.

198
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,814
It's not ours.

199
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,577
The photos made at the crime scenes are.

200
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,576
But they're not ours.
They were in your box.

201
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:20,215
Why did you rent the box?
Did you order these?

202
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,578
I didn't give any order.
Look straight at the photos.

203
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,855
'Faith Brother' wrote,
I had to rent a post box.

204
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,413
What bullshit. You preached to the
young members about injustice.

205
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,938
Why did you rent the box?
You let others do the dirty work.

206
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,378
What language did he write to you in?
You have to confess.

207
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,374
In what language did he write. English?
Shut up a minute.

208
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,737
Who wrote 'Faith Brother'?
What about Raben?

209
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,018
Did 'Faith Brother' write about a Team
Aegir member named Jens Peter Raben?

210
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,729
I won't say more.
So tell me something.

211
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,336
Who is 'Faith Brother'?
What do you know?

212
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,939
We'll have no problem holding him
and the three others in custody.

213
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,172
And we'll continue the same course.
Yes.

214
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,295
Lund is employed as a consultant ...
Thanks. I know who she is.

215
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,618
She has been with the Passport Police
for a few years.

216
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,013
Lennart, I wont interfere in your
investigation, but dammit ...

217
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,732
She was kicked out of here, for many
good reasons.

218
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,813
She was probably competent
but what we witnessed today -

219
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,290
is the most talentless interview
I have witnessed in many years.

220
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,575
I'm sorry.
It wasn't my intention ...

221
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,891
...Give us a moment.
Yes. Okay.

222
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,697
Maybe I should just say that
I stand behind Lund.

223
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,015
I find it hard to see how evidence
against Kodmani could be planted.

224
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,378
But we'd never have reached it,
if it were not for Lund.

225
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:57,137
If she feels so strongly about Raben, as
far as I'm concerned..it's worth checking.

226
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,736
Okay. Well, thanks.

227
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,020
Aside from his wife and son,
virtually no one visited Raben.

228
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,698
No friends?
Myg Poulsen and his lawyer.

229
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,897
Someone from Team Aegir may be
able to tell us something.

230
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:29,738
There are over 500 names.
We can begin at the barracks in the morning.

231
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,415
I'll check up on Raben before then.
I'll see about Team Aegir.

232
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,573
And thanks for ...

233
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,170
You're welcome.

234
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,935
But you'd have gone ahead with it whatever,
right?

235
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,775
Is this a problem?
Quite the contrary.

236
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,171
Strange, there is someone here for you.

237
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,779
I'm comimg. See you tomorrow.
Call if there is anything, okay?

238
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,137
Lund, I have to give you this.

239
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,418
Raben was seen at a gas station
south of Copenhagen.

240
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,617
He tried to hitch a ride.

241
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,896
Thank you.
You're welcome.

242
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,099
The church is closed.
You must come again tomorrow.

243
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,379
Hey! The church is closed.

244
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,218
Hi, Pastor.
Long time no see.

245
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,770
Is there anything that fits?
That's all I could find.

246
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,331
Besides wafers, the altar wine is just fine.

247
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,059
What in the world are you doing?

248
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,008
Have you been here since then?
Yes.

249
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,253
I found a nice little church here.
It suits me perfectly.

250
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,332
Do you ever see anyone from back then?
Not really.

251
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,699
But I've heard about Myg.
I don't know what you're planning...

252
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:07,379
...but think twice about it.
Think of your wife and your son.

253
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,852
I need your help, Reverend.
I gotta talk to someone.

254
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:19,012
This is important.
I don't know who else to ask.

255
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,853
Will you help me?

256
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,894
Raben has come over the bridge.
We're about to check his contacts.

257
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,858
The three suspects have been
remanded into custody.

258
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,572
I've got search warrants
for more of Kodmanis associates.

259
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,656
Yes. And what about Team Aegir?

260
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,895
I was out yesterday evening
so it was a little late.

261
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,211
Hold this for me please?

262
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,929
Team Aegis was deployed two
and a half years ago.

263
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,050
It seems that Raben and Myg Poulsen
were in the same group.

264
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,980
That's all?
Do you have any paracetamol.

265
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,177
No, I do not have any paracetamol

266
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,815
There's no reason to be jealous.
She's just a friend.

267
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,577
I'm not jealous.
Okay. What do you know about Raben?

268
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,529
Raben is 37 years old. He's been
in the army for most of his adult life.

269
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,251
He's a Staff Sergeant.
Trained in Sønderborg.

270
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,370
He's assigned to the barracks
and has been deployed several times.

271
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,895
Okay.

272
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,852
He was decorated several times,
but was wounded and sent home.

273
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,889
When he was recovering, he snapped.
You know the rest.

274
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,817
He's also married to Louise Raben,
and they have a son together.

275
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,895
Why is that important?
Louise is the daughter of Colonel Jarnvig.

276
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,133
Jens Peter Raben is his son-in-law.

277
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,610
Okay. Then it's damn small world.

278
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,693
The colonel was also with team Aegir.
He was the battalion commander.

279
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:45,216
He didn't know Anne Dragsholm.
Why didn't you say that before?

280
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,771
I had no chance, because you were
so jealous. Shall we go?

281
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,135
You claim you haven't met her?
I've never met her.

282
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,499
She is in a photo of Team Aegir and
was listed as a member of Team Aegir.

283
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,780
The photo was taken in Oksbøl shortly
before their redeployment.

284
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,651
Maybe she was there to lecture the men
on the legal aspects of war before they left.

285
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,893
She was not part of Team Aegir.

286
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,211
You surely can't remember all 500 of them.

287
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,690
If you don't believe me, check with HQ.

288
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,375
She was never one of my advisors.

289
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,896
So if theres nothing else ...

290
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,180
There is actually, tell me a little
about your son in law, Jens Peter Raben.

291
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,299
Why?
He was sent home.

292
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,611
What happened?

293
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,649
What are you saying here exactly?
There appear to be some coincidences.

294
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,690
I don't give a shit.
Two soldiers have been killed.

295
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,890
My people ask me what happened
and then you ask about Raben.

296
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,295
You do your own work,
and we'll look after ours.

297
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,414
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

298
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,098
Army Command confirms that Dragsholm
was there for a legal seminar.

299
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,378
She appears on the team list.
They said she jumped in.

300
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,250
If she has known to Raben and Myg,
it was very peripherally.

301
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,017
Is there anything new about Raben?
No. We need to move on Kodmani.

302
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,698
The search has paid off. Let's
round up the whole gang. Strange here.

303
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,412
Just drive. I'll come later.
What now? What are you doing now?

304
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,578
Yes, yes. But we're underway.
At least one of us. Bye.

305
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,176
It's a network related to Ahl Al-Kahf...

306
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,412
...founded by Abdel Hussein Kodmani.

307
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,496
We've arrested three more suspects.
There are more to come.

308
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,256
So the issue is almost resolved?
-Yes. There is incriminating evidence.

309
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,097
We will announce later today when
we have all the perpetrators.

310
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,653
Nice, but how did Agger get his hands on
a confidential Intelligence memo?

311
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,414
It didn't come from us.

312
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,370
But right now it's important that
we find out how.

313
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,499
What did my predecessor do?
What was done and why?

314
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,051
It's very simple.
We investigated the Mindelunden killing.

315
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,852
The victim was a former soldier, so we
advised the Minister by memo.

316
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,571
But you said nothing in our first conversation.
You weren't briefed...

317
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,858
...besides, we weren't alone in the room.

318
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,979
How did my predecessor get your note?

319
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,689
Can't he tell you this himself?

320
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,614
I shall, in consultation with the committee,
deal with this matter later.

321
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,534
My predecessor would appreciate it
if you could help us along the road.

322
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,253
Yes, of course.
The minister was very concerned.

323
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,698
Why didn't Intelligence inform the
police?

324
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,297
There's a good reason. Intelligence
investigated the possibility of a terrorist act.

325
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,692
But why would they  not inform the police
if it was terrorism related?

326
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,570
We weren't sure of anything.
It was the Minister who considered...

327
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,291
...it was too risky to inform the police.
Monberg thought...

328
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,739
...that certain information could
compromise national security.

329
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,098
What information? I'd like to hear more.
So would I.

330
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,058
Especially since it was my department.

331
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,691
He could have come back with a
explanation, but he didn't.

332
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,490
So you don't know?
No, Sorry.

333
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,052
There were two folders from last year.
There must be something somewhere.

334
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,248
Agger's right. We haven't
taken the terrorism threat seriously.

335
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,935
I was Monberg's Permanent Secretary
for nine years.

336
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,094
It wasn't his fault.
He told no one here about it.

337
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:37,415
He had his reasons.
Buch, the whole thing is unravelling.

338
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,608
I found something. I spent last week
reviewing the records.

339
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,979
Monberg requested material
about Anne Dragsholm.

340
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,213
What kind of material?
It came from the Department of Defence.

341
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:59,218
It only says that it was requested from
Defence and then returned.

342
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,899
I don't understand. The Minister shouldn't
have done that without going through me.

343
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,329
Maybe you've not been privy to it, Plough.
We're busy. What can you do?

344
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,096
I'll get hold of the permanent secretary.
Karina prepare for the Minister.

345
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,936
Take your questions up with him.
Hurry, though, damn.

346
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,135
Grüner ...
Hi, Reverend. Where's the choir?

347
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,614
The choir's been cancelled.
I know I said to come for the choir, but ...

348
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,298
I brought my own music with me.
There's someone who wants to see you.

349
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,459
It's an okay job.
It's not very interesting.

350
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,578
I'm still a little picky.

351
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,370
How's Marie?
We're doing fine. We're good.

352
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,897
And the little one?
Grown up, now.

353
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,814
She's everything to me.

354
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,452
She wants a wheelchair
when she's as big as dad.

355
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,731
And then I started making music again.

356
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,010
When the hell were you released?
I wasn't released.

357
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:59,131
Not the normal way, anyway.
Have you talked with anyone recently?

358
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,576
Have you seen Myg?
You escaped?..why?

359
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,495
Because he is dead. So is the lawyer.
Don't you watch the news?

360
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,209
Yes, but I don't exactly exchange
Christmas cards with them.

361
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,534
What's happening?
I don't know a damn thing.

362
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,692
Maybe it was God's will.

363
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,057
Myg visited me the day he was killed.

364
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,499
I don't know anything! I don't want you
stirring this shit up again.

365
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,936
What are you talking about?
Let me go, damn it.

366
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,649
I don't know a damn thing.
You know nothing!

367
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,414
Come here.

368
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,493
Let me go!

369
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,497
Bye, Raben. And good luck.

370
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:04,496
Grüner, if you want to talk to me
call the chaplain. Okay?

371
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,779
I need to get hold of the others.
I don't know where they are.

372
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,694
You have connections.
You can find out.

373
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,216
Can I borrow your phone?
What are you doing?

374
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,898
I have to explain to Louise why I ran away.
I don't think I get it.

375
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,779
Take care.

376
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,576
I've told the police what I know.
Can't you leave me alone?

377
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,653
The woman was named Anne Dragsholm.
Your husband must have known her.

378
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,414
I don't know who she is.

379
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,496
Was there something bothering him ...?
His friend had just died.

380
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,619
His request for release was rejected.

381
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,693
Do you think he escaped because of the rejection?

382
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,372
How long have you been married?

383
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,375
We've known each other for 14 years.
We married four years ago. Why?

384
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,293
How did you meet?

385
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,932
I was at the barracks to visit my dad.
Jens gave me a lift into town.

386
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,216
He had just started.

387
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,258
And so it was you?
No.

388
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,537
He wanted to see the world
and make a difference.

389
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,775
I didn't want a relationship with a soldier.
So it shouldn't have lasted.

390
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,135
It was the last time he was deployed.

391
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,451
What happened?

392
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,933
They were ambushed and were cut off
from the rest of the force.

393
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,812
He was at a field hospital until he could be
moved to a hospital at home.

394
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,019
It took several weeks before they knew
if he would survive.

395
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,931
Do you know anything that could explain
why he escaped?

396
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,614
No.

397
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,616
Do you know where he is?
Did he leave a message for us?

398
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,650
I have to go and pick up my boy.
Of course.

399
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,689
If he contacts you, please call me.

400
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,854
Gedser passport control?
My number is on the back.

401
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,089
The woman in the photo ...

402
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,290
...visited Jens in hospital.
She had a different surname.

403
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,695
Many people interviewed him about
what had happened.

404
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,455
It's Lund.
I've been trying to reach you.

405
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:54,252
Theres an e-mail urging Kodmani
to continue the war on Danish soil.

406
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,015
We've arrested all suspects
related to his association.

407
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,412
Anne Dragsholm visited Raben in hospital.

408
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,334
Louise Raben recognized her.

409
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,132
Dragsholm questioned Raben about
what happened in Afghanistan.

410
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,418
Okay. Why would she interview him?

411
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,016
You'll have to ask someone in the military.

412
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,297
Lund I've talked to them enough.
Go back there.

413
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,011
We need to know what Dragsholm did
in the army when Raben was in hospital.

414
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,819
Okay.
I'll ask her husband.

415
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,212
Bad idea.
The man has sued us for unlawful arrest.

416
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,728
Intelligence will give a Press Conference
about the arrests.

417
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,020
If you learn anything new,
please let me know right away, okay?

418
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,490
Lund, try just to listen here.
Lund?

419
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,460
Louise ...

420
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,490
Would you like a ride?
Yes.

421
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,972
I was just dropping someone off,
so that's okay

422
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,539
Yes?
It's Grüner.

423
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,451
Her lawyer contacted me
a few weeks before she was killed.

424
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,818
About what Grüner?
Can we meet?

425
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,498
Sarah Lund, police.
Please accept our condolences.

426
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,450
I need to ask you a few questions.

427
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,533
Look, I don't like doing this,
 but it is important.

428
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,295
I'm afraid that others will suffer
the same fate as your wife ...

429
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,529
Why did you confess?

430
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,376
Eventually I didn't care what I said.
The easiest thing was to confess.

431
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:00,170
The most important thing was that
she knew it wasn't me.

432
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,334
Did she talk about her time in the army?
Not particularly.

433
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,972
She never mentioned Myg Poulsen?
No. They've already asked me.

434
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,258
How about a Jens Peter Raben?
No.

435
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,370
Did she leave the army because you met?

436
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:27,059
No. We knew each other many years
before we got married.

437
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,179
I wanted her to quit but she liked her job.
Why did she leave?

438
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:38,576
She was fired.
Why was she fired?

439
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,612
She got into a conflict.
Some soldiers in Afghanistan or something.

440
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,568
What incident?
I don't know.

441
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,129
I have to go for the guests.

442
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,815
But the army got her to investigate.

443
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,656
That was part of the problem.
She did it on her own initiative.

444
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,450
She didn't believe the army took the
group's explanation seriously.

445
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,771
The group of soldiers.
She argued their case.

446
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,419
She was their lawyer?
Yes.

447
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,250
Thank you.

448
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,615
Okay.

449
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,459
I've inquired at Defence.
They're looking into it.

450
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,929
It doesn't matter now.

451
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:42,857
Did you get the list of Team Aegir members?
We need to speak to someone from Raben's unit.

452
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,491
The opposition claims the memo
wasn't taken seriously.

453
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,370
That's not true. Intelligence had
the matter under investigation...

454
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,978
...and had the group under surveillance.

455
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,931
Fine. But why was your predecessor
so sparse with information...

456
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,410
...that terrorists were behind it?

457
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,495
There were certain matters
related to national security.

458
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:20,010
I'd like to hear about that.
Exercise a little patience.

459
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,411
Karina will bring the documents.

460
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,096
Have all the suspects been arrested
Indeed, members of Ahl Al-Kahf?

461
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,490
That is correct. But ...

462
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,656
Ahl Al-Kahf, is one of the associations
the People's Party wants banned.

463
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,371
If your predecessor believed
there was no terrorism, explain...

464
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,852
...why the police held the murdered woman's
husband for ten days for interrogation.

465
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,616
Because Intelligence was
focusing on the trail of terrorists.

466
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,410
And police were obviously informed
about Intelligence's theory on terrorism?

467
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,449
No, not the police.

468
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,738
Who was responsible for that?
Intelligence was investigating.

469
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,897
So, your predecessor put the entire
operation at risk?

470
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:22,579
My predecessor can't answer, but
I've told the committee everything.

471
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,052
Yes, and national security.
But what about it?

472
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,338
The People's Party wasn't
briefed about that here.

473
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:38,656
We must conclude that the Ministry of Justice
deliberately concealed information...

474
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,813
...and thus misled parliament.

475
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:52,372
We understand the Minister is confused.
Can someone explain the rules to him.

476
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,660
Even though he'll hardly need it
for very long.

477
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,371
I regret that little interruption.
Where were we?

478
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,135
... the government's responsibility
in this tragedy ...

479
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,452
...the Intelligence memo was classified as secret.

480
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,819
Publication would have created dissension
at a time when we need to stand united.

481
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:33,577
The government has created mistrust.
We want a thorough Investigation.

482
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,858
There it is, but first
you need to view this document.

483
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,731
It outlines the risks of publication of
information about the slain woman.

484
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,418
In a public inquiry
information could get out...

485
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,415
...that could compromise our strategy,
for example in Afghanistan...

486
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,892
thus placing Danish soldiers' lives in danger.

487
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:06,694
We must investigate further.
It's secret information.

488
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,615
Please treat it with utmost confidentiality.

489
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,136
Then the media may not have access
to it, for good reasons.

490
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,612
Unless others want to question
my predecessor's motives...

491
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,649
I'll go back and do my job.
Thank you.

492
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,179
Damn,  were we good.
You got that settled nicely.

493
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,733
We weren't too much?
No. She asked for it herself.

494
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,530
Now we've got her to reveal
how she got hold of the memo.

495
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,091
It's the prime minister.
There will be a press release.

496
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,175
Hi, Thomas. Congratulations.
It went quite well, I understand.

497
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,371
They prepared me very well.
Now, that terrorism package.

498
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,372
There's still a lot of work to do, it's your priority

499
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,328
Tomorrow I'll talk with the People's Party.
Okay. Good luck.

500
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,095
Come, I'll pour some for you.

501
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,970
Krabbe is pushing for you to
ban that association.

502
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:24,216
Now they know who they're up against.
Karina come in. Have a drink with us.

503
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,454
I'll send Monberg's papers to his
residence, then join you

504
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:34,216
Send anything you need to
Cheers and thanks for the help.

505
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,056
Plough, Frode had a private agenda I knew
 nothing about, it's here in his diary

506
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:44,613
He knew Anne Dragsholm
personally. I don't understand it...

507
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,012
...but he met with her
on at least two occasions.

508
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,889
I also have confirmation that
he also had her mobile number.

509
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,690
The last time they met was in a hotel
the weekend before the murder.

510
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,373
Check it out.
Yes.

511
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,252
Shall we eat now?
Just a minute, honey.

512
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,050
I cut off the head of the dragon
but his blood is acidic.

513
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,133
That's good. Then you must be hungry.

514
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,218
What would you say to
getting your own room?

515
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,089
Grandpa says you can have his.

516
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,695
I think we could do it up
really nice with all your stuff.

517
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,613
Shall we?

518
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,489
I also found a school,
we'll have to go and check it out.

519
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,539
Could I start this summer?
- Yes, indeed.

520
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,373
Hello.

521
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,294
Should Dad have his own room?

522
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,772
Yes. But ...

523
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,577
We'll find out.
May I draw?

524
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,289
Yes, of course.

525
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,296
Someone found Jonas' glove.
I must have dropped it on the way home.

526
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,975
Luckily, his name was in it.
There's no name in it.

527
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,258
And we haven't lost it.
We drove with Søgaard.

528
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:06,178
In any case he was at the gate.
Hi there, Jonas.

529
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,688
Grüner?

530
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:53,410
Was Dragsholm the lawyer for the group?
That's what we should try to confirm.

531
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,299
But it was several years ago.

532
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,293
What's his name?
David Grüner.

533
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:04,409
He's on duty this evening.
Are you sure he's here?

534
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:10,337
Yes. You go in here, and I'll go
around to look for an entrance.

535
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,251
Hey!

536
00:56:11,252 --> 00:58:12,252

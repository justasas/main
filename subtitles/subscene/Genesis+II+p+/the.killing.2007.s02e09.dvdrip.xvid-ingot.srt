1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,356
Ten days ago a woman was killed
In unusual circumstances

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,831
How many will follow me in death?

3
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,597
What does Intelligence have on the group?
Raben was the squad leader.

4
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:21,798
There was no officer called Perk.
Perk...

5
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,111
Put the gun down now.

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:29,754
I had to shoot.
Strange was a commando.

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:36,555
I think he was an officer.
He had a tattoo on his shoulder.

8
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:42,116
He couldn't know.
Were you together at all times?

9
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:47,232
You and Jonas mean everything to me.
I'm starting to see Søgaard.

10
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:50,839
You never told us
about the announcement.

11
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:56,362
The Danish commandos were only
150 km from Raben's Group.

12
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:01,962
I do not think Søgaard's the problem.
Did you help Raben escape?

13
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:07,119
You've been a minister for seven days.
In the same time God created the Earth.

14
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:11,676
You have come close to ruining everything.
You'll have to resign.

15
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:17,124
We can't give up.
What did my predecessor know?

16
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,882
You slept with him!
Why don't you check the dates?

17
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:28,884
The Prime Minister was preparing
appropriations for Afghanistan.

18
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:32,881
If you extend the anti-terrorism
package, innocent people will suffer.

19
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:40,886
The man you identified, wasn't
in Afghanistan at the time.

20
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:45,166
Sorry. They were killed by Raben.

21
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:48,638
Sebastian sent his video diary home.

22
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,960
Raben sees Taliban everywhere.
He thinks only of killing.

23
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:56,757
It doesn't matter.
So there was no Perk.

24
00:01:56,928 --> 00:02:00,968
His older brother is in Afghanistan.
They found this.

25
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,802
You have 36 hours.

26
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,839
The drama surrounding Minister of
Justice, Buch, took a sensational twist...

27
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,685
...when the vote on the anti-terrorism
package was postponed.

28
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,199
The Prime Minister had no comment
but others say the Minister of Justice...

29
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:31,243
...should resign.  Party leaders are
meeting to discuss the crisis.

30
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,962
Of course I'm still the minister.
Goodbye.

31
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,568
We have to defeat the government..

32
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:42,644
Does everyone know?
Not everyone has reported in yet.

33
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:48,330
So get themall in then...and I need to
have an update from the police.

34
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:54,250
If we don't resolve it. This will be
the biggest scandal of all time.

35
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:58,770
It's incredible.
You've done the right thing.

36
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:06,123
I hope so. I'll make an announcement
as soon as the meeting is over.

37
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,407
I'm going.

38
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:17,094
Let me talk to you about the agenda.

39
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:21,291
It seems like you're going
after the prime minister.

40
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,992
Damn right we're going after the Prime Minister

41
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,293
Karina told you the plan don't change now..

42
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:29,789
Yes I know..but are you convinced the Prime Minister
would jeopardise his position by playing these games...

43
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:33,252
Each time he went directly to the
aid of the Minister of Defence.

44
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:38,250
Buch, everything points toward the Minister
of Defence and his department

45
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,534
If the Prime Minister is playing games,
then the people have a right to  know.

46
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:46,327
What's the news from the police?
Nothing new on Raben.

47
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:51,332
Last night they authorised a
research trip to Helmand.

48
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,777
I don't know why. Neither did the
Deputy Police Commissioner.

49
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:04,175
Keep me informed. And get someone
to remove these chairs.

50
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:08,810
I just spoke with Gitta Spalding.
There'll be no meeting.

51
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,738
Where is everybody?

52
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,209
The Prime Minister hasn't heard.

53
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,931
So get hold of the prime minister.
The meeting's about him.

54
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,132
I told the Minister of Justice a meeting
at such short notice is unacceptable.

55
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:40,250
We're holding the meeting. I have
an item for the agenda. Sit down.

56
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:44,494
Let's find out what Thomas
has to say in his defense.

57
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,940
Talk to anyone who's had contact
with Frederik Holst...

58
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:55,701
...in the few weeks that he was home
on leave. Phone, credit cards etc.

59
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,616
Map his whereabouts from day to day.
Where was he sleeping...

60
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,776
...where he was
at the time of the murders?

61
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:12,061
The ministry called.
They want an explanation ...

62
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:15,455
...about a police trip to Afghanistan.

63
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:21,938
We had to act quickly...... Strange is
innocent and Lund found out...

64
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:26,382
Right now I don't give a damn about
Lund and Strange..

65
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:28,939
We know that the suspect is in Afghanistan now...

66
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,940
He was here but redeployed two days ago

67
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,941
..and who is the suspect now?

68
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:38,737
...Frederik Holst. Doctor at ISAF
military hospital in Lashkar Gah, and...

69
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,676
...brother of soldier killed in Raben's unit.

70
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:44,577
This should have been approved by me.

71
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,478
I don't understand why you
 keep trying to undermine....

72
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,578
Because you would have said no. It 
would have taken too much time...

73
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:56,344
...to arrange documents and I had no
time to wait. We're pretty confident...

74
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:03,942
...that it's him.In any event, it's
too late now. They have left.

75
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:12,426
The Ministry of Justice
wants an update.

76
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,387
Frederik Holst...What's your relationship to him?
Do you know him?

77
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:20,388
Yes, I know him

78
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,545
No relationship. It's not important.
Answer the question..he was a colleague of yours.

79
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,940
How's it going here?

80
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:32,864
Just the same old excuses.

81
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,865
I've talked to the Institution.
Frederik Holst wanted to visit you.

82
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:51,582
Five times.
Every time you rejected him.

83
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:55,107
I want to see my wife.

84
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:01,904
We found letters at his residence,
addressed to you at the Institution.

85
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:07,271
You returned them.
He wanted to express his anger...

86
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:11,311
...about your responsibility for
his little brother's death.

87
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:16,547
You can ask him yourself.
We've also thought about that.

88
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:21,582
It's in your interest to help us.
I will.

89
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:27,865
The officer executed the family
and beat the others to death.

90
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:33,028
You said it was one of our police
inspectors, but he wasn't there.

91
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:39,783
I want to talk to my wife.
Think about your testimony

92
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:44,073
None of this will be beneficial in
the future of your cause

93
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:47,910
Talk to Colonel Jarnvig.
He believes me.

94
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:53,355
Colonel Jarnvig is being questioned because he
helped you escape from the PET.

95
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:57,668
You'll be charged and arraigned tomorrow.

96
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:07,713
Why are you examing
Jarnvig's old files?

97
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:11,790
No idea. It seemed as if
he wasn't himself.

98
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:16,917
Just a moment.
I'm going to talk to Søgaard.

99
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,154
Hello.

100
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:23,469
He hasn't come back yet?
No.

101
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:27,153
Your father has been pulled in
for questioning.

102
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:32,916
He talked to Jens at the ball and
helped him get away from there.

103
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,913
What is this nonsense?
You were there yourself.

104
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:41,038
They were seen together.
Someone informed General Arild.

105
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,873
By whom? No idea.
Your father's well-known.

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,230
I don't think he's feeling
so well at the moment.

107
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,439
Tonight he came in with
some accusations against me.

108
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,834
The murders keep him very busy.
What were the accusations?

109
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:06,314
That I hid radio messages we received
from the commandos.

110
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,715
It was as if he believed everything
Jens had invented.

111
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:16,160
He is responsible for this situation,
but I am loyal and try to help him.

112
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:22,239
Suddenly he believed Jens?
Yes. It seemed pretty far-fetched.

113
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:28,231
What about you?
I need to talk to my dad.

114
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,557
If you hear something, I want to
know about it immediately.

115
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,958
Yes of course.

116
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,193
Louise... Do you think
I had something to do with it?

117
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:42,924
No, why?

118
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,796
For two months, the Minister of Defence
did nothing to investigate the hand...

119
00:09:56,965 --> 00:10:02,040
...and the alleged killing of civilians.
I find that incredible.

120
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:05,835
But this gave the Prime Minister
enough time to work ...

121
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:11,558
...to get parliamentary approval
for an additional 200 soldiers.

122
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:15,720
The study took longer than expected.

123
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:20,119
How can we believe it? I could have
dealt with this long ago.

124
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,657
Instead, five people have been murdered
and we've been wasting..

125
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,658
..time chasing shadows, fake muslim groups
and invisible terrorists

126
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:29,042
We have to get to the bottom of this
within our own ranks.

127
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:33,043
This is a complete mess with grave consequences,
and the public will never forgive or forget

128
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:36,144
You're accusing the government of being
involved in a cover up, wheres the proof Buch..

129
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,245
It's a serious allegation against the
Prime Minister himself.

130
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,923
The People's Party wants to examine
the Prime Minister's role in this.

131
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:43,924
It needs a full investigation..

132
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:45,925
There is no case..

133
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,209
We'll see if there's evidence for a case.
If I've made mistakes, I'll resign.

134
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:56,763
You've already resigned. I'd like
repeat it in the presence of witnesses.

135
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,969
Tell Thomas why we're meeting.

136
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,247
Some think you'll damage the party.

137
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,185
We want a vote on
your expulsion from our caucus.

138
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:09,586
You can't do...

139
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:15,362
May I refer you to the party statutes,
Section 12A. Here's a copy.

140
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:20,003
As you can see, we already have
the required signatures.

141
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:23,926
That's it, all correctly done, so lets get started..
with an outline of the matter

142
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,771
When you're ready we'd all like to participate
in the meeting you've called Thomas.

143
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:43,643
The allegation of civilian murders is not
something I am standing alone on.

144
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:49,963
The police have sent officers
to Helmand to investigate and...

145
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:55,131
...to speak with the doctor who had
reported the anomily of the extra hand.

146
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,132
Where did the authority to do this come from?

147
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:00,574
I know nothing ... The police
investigators were sent for a reason.

148
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,575
They will let us know their findings

149
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,966
I think we should take the vote. This is clearly
a delaying tactic..

150
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:12,052
When will we hear about the findings?
They'll fly back tomorrow and deliver their..

151
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:17,131
Get the preliminary findings tomorrow
afternoon. Then we'll vote.

152
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:23,132
I can't attend because I'll be at
a military memorial ceremony.

153
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:27,290
I think we should get it over with.

154
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:36,890
We'll have to wait. They have not
found anything yet ...

155
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:41,009
But it could be misunderstood if we took action tonight
before we have the report from the police..

156
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,010
Thanks.

157
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:48,456
You say my appointment
with Her Majesty is still on?

158
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:02,137
Excuse me Plough, do they expect the doctor
to help with regard to the hand?

159
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:05,058
No. He's also accused of murder so it's unclear
what the outcome could be..

160
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,659
Yes Yes..but they'll still have to ask him about the reports
he sent back about the hand..we need

161
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,012
We need to be able to see all the communications
about the reports to and from the ministry.

162
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:16,013
That won't be easy with the controls in place

163
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,574
Can't we just see the reports?
Yes, but the system is slow.

164
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,575
..and it's not going to be easy working with defence..

165
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:24,216
I'm sure the Prime Minister will burn the Minister of Defence
He'll give him up..

166
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:28,217
It's obvious that of the two the Prime Minister has the most power
maybe we could speak to the Defence Minister...

167
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,692
Why would he talk to us? and what could
be achieved from such a strategy

168
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,415
Perhaps we'll be able to
drive a wedge between them.

169
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:39,216
Look, heres what we do..lets examine every scrap
of paper and find something we can use against him.

170
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:45,101
When will we hear from the police?
They're due to return tomorrow morning with their report

171
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:50,621
The two detectives, a man and a woman...
One of them must be Lund.

172
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:55,015
If we can help them let me know.
Yes, it's Buch.

173
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:00,621
Don't ever call me, you stupid fucking bitch..
Calm down there.

174
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:26,138
You've arrived at a bad time.

175
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:31,264
We had two suicide bombings
this morning..

176
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:36,262
It's very busy in the hospital.
Tighten the chin strap on your helmet...

177
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,997
...and your bulletproof vest.
Otherwise it's pointless wearing it

178
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:39,998
Come here..

179
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,221
Would you like to go out to
the base first to freshen up?

180
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:50,586
No, we want to go to the hospital.
We need to talk with Frederik Holst.

181
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,229
Frederik Holst.

182
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:53,868
I'll be home soon.
I'm going home in a week.

183
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:18,183
I was home on leave for three weeks.

184
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:24,703
Your friends and acquaintances didn't
see you. You didn't visit your parents.

185
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,073
Where were you?

186
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,074
Why do you want to know?

187
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,075
That's an easy question.

188
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,466
Korselitze. It's on Falster.

189
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:36,675
Who were you with?
I was alone.

190
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:43,269
Who is it that you think I've killed?

191
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,908
They were murdered,
while you were home.

192
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:55,948
I spend my life trying to save
human lives. Was that all?

193
00:16:56,117 --> 00:17:00,794
Two years ago you tried
to save your brother, Sebastian.

194
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,227
We've seen his video diary and
we found this in your house.

195
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,049
You hold Raben responsible for your brothers death.

196
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,050
You think that he was a maverick that lead his unit
into an impossible situation which killed your brother

197
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:23,988
You tried to get in touch with Raben,
but your letters were returned unopened.

198
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,799
What did you do?

199
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,713
You're wasting your time.

200
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,317
I didn't kill anyone.
What incredible bullshit!

201
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,794
You haven't crossed these faces out for fun.
Let's just call it a pastime then.

202
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:45,671
You were on duty when your brother was brought in.
weren't you.

203
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:50,915
You stood and looked at him
amongst all those killed and wounded.

204
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:54,715
It must have been quite a shock to
discover that is was Raben's fault.

205
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:57,616
Yes....quite a sight..

206
00:17:57,882 --> 00:18:01,875
They were his colleagues alive on the operating
table.... but not your brother.

207
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:06,355
Yes. And I hope they all burn in hell.

208
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:11,639
I couldn't touch them.

209
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:17,082
No law can try them for taking
my brother out to that village.

210
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:28,076
Instead, I found out that there was amongst all
the body parts a surplus limb. A hand.

211
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:31,173
I tried to raise suspicions that civilians were murdered.
There was clear evidence..

212
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:33,274
Maybe it was the phantom officer..

213
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,484
Nobody believed the group's story about the officer.
Just covering for themselves

214
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:43,515
I thought all of them would be charged, but the military provost
let them go..and nothing was done..

215
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:47,803
Are you sure the hand could not have been from
a suicide bomber, was a check not done for DNA.

216
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:51,104
I was furious that it wasn't done
There was no DNA taken for matching.

217
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:56,481
Did you send the first medical report to the defence
ministry so You could damage the group.

218
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:02,244
My brother died from a punctured lung.

219
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:06,366
It was nothing.
He could have survived.

220
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:10,157
I'm angry at the psychopath...

221
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:13,445
..who forced him to
go out to the village...

222
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:17,123
...and the lawyer who got them
acquitted of everything.

223
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,679
So the answer is yes!  YES!

224
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,759
But it can't bring Sebastian back.

225
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,799
So... What can I do,
other than to try to save him...

226
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,249
...every day,
on the damn operating table?

227
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,644
He can't say where he was
during the murders.

228
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:56,249
So did he do it?  No, it's not him.
Damn!  After all that effort.

229
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:03,121
Has Raben said anything new?
He's saying the same story over again.

230
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,088
Major Søgaard's name is
popping up again and again..

231
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:14,690
We brought him in.  He didn't give much.
Pack your sunglasses and come home.

232
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:32,127
So we got nothing..hopefully it was worth
going and it wasn't just a wild guess.

233
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:43,368
Now I've got to grovellingly call Intelligence and
parliament and tell them it's all been for nothing..

234
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,325
There is one minister who thinks we made
a break through. I'm sure the...

235
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,390
It's this minister who dangles by a thread.
I hope you're not counting on him...

236
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:57,330
I'll have to try to smooth this over with our superiors.
Don't do anything else unless I give the order.

237
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,172
What do we have?

238
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:06,673
Nothing on the fundamentalists, all dead end's,
and if it isn't big brother, that leaves only Raben.

239
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:10,728
The offender's bought stuff all over
the internet in Perk's name.

240
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,129
Mostly second-hand things
from civilians...

241
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:16,247
...paid in cash sent by post.

242
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:21,248
We've already looked into it all, it's difficult to trace
done online, sent to an anonymous post box

243
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:28,534
A camcorder, a laptop "The Anarchist Cookbook '
..other bits and pieces..

244
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:32,532
...all sent to a PO box, at the same place...

245
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:35,056
where the offender had Kodmani rent a postbox.

246
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:37,357
That doesn't make any sense to me at all..

247
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:43,090
Why not use an alias to rent an
apartment or storage space?

248
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,171
We don't know yet. But there is something new.
Telecom let us know..

249
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,615
The third victim was set on fire using a
call from a stolen mobile phone.

250
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,616
It has been switched off since the killing

251
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,654
This morning the phone
was activated again.

252
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,097
There's an unanswered call.
From where?

253
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:04,416
A phone booth...They are not on the digital network
so only a rough area can be given

254
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,717
Unlike the mobile network...
somewhere around Ryvang.

255
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:12,257
The barracks?
That's impossible to confirm with the information we have

256
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:17,655
Why would he turn on the mobile
that he knows we're looking for?

257
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:21,098
We all make mistakes..

258
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:25,175
We'll go back there right now.

259
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:30,542
Is there a memoria lservice today?
We'll do it for their sake.

260
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:38,013
Maybe we should drive past the base.
Maybe someone will tell Søgaard.

261
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:42,661
We have some time to kill.

262
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:53,533
How did it work when the commandos
were out on missions?

263
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,856
How did you operate then?

264
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:04,422
Five men behind enemy lines. We'd identify a
target and monitor their movements. Why?

265
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:08,625
Did you have radio contact
with the other forces?

266
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:12,938
No. We shot everything that moved
and hoped for the best.

267
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:19,536
Didn't the General say that the
commandos weren't involved?

268
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:30,342
Would you please stop the car?
Stop!

269
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:42,821
What is it?

270
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,858
How far is it to the village from here?
Not now, Lund.

271
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,545
I just want to see the place where it happened.
We're not tourists on a sightseeing trip...

272
00:23:55,709 --> 00:24:00,500
Can you take us there?
You don't have permission to go there.

273
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,585
What're you talking about?
You can't leave the military zone.

274
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,779
Nonsense.
Consent to do this was faxed last night.

275
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:19,425
Not as far as I can see.

276
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:23,380
Take a better look..what is it with all this..we come
on a special top level mission and get this.

277
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,342
We have dispensation direct from the Defence Minister.
Give me the phone.

278
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:32,425
What's your name?
Siegler.

279
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:45,742
If I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.

280
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:48,791
That's alright.

281
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,707
Shall we get going?

282
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:55,947
Call the local police chief.

283
00:24:56,114 --> 00:25:00,073
His name appears in the provost's report.

284
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:05,706
You're charged with burglary, car theft,
illegal weapons possession...

285
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:09,914
...kidnap, violence and death threats.

286
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,546
How do you plead to the charges?

287
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:19,392
Guilty on all points?
Has my wife contacted you?

288
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,194
No.

289
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:24,430
What about the police
who went to Afghanistan?

290
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:25,431
I don't know...

291
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:30,715
I'd advise you to drop the
story about the officer.

292
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:36,076
It's only harmful to your case.
There's no reason to make it worse.

293
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:41,790
The verdict will be harsher than last time.
You're dangerous.You might be placed...

294
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:47,191
...under indefinite detention. So...

295
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:51,397
Do you know if my wife has tried
to come to visit me?

296
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:58,156
No, but someone else did. Not the police. Someone from
the military and you should really listen to what he offers

297
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,036
Hello, Raben.

298
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,999
I've heard a lot about you. I hope
you'll allow me this little visit.

299
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:24,391
I'm on an official mission.

300
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:35,632
You feel that we've failed you.
I sincerely regret that.

301
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,477
I just wanted to say it.
You've done that now.

302
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:46,680
If you continue with your statement,
you'll hurt yourself and the army.

303
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:51,314
The first is your own affair,
but the second concerns me.

304
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:57,841
Maybe we can help each other out.

305
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:01,553
I'm not going to retract my statement.

306
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:06,673
On behalf of the defense, I would like
to offer you compensation...

307
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:11,793
...by adjusting the pension benefits
in your contract.

308
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,240
Go to Hell.

309
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:21,474
I don't like you much, I don't really care what happens
to you, but your wife and your son ...

310
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:25,957
...are entitled to a pension...
in case you die.

311
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:32,325
We've altered the wording slightly to change
the proviso's.. so that it...

312
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:37,480
... also applies to prolonged illness.

313
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:44,519
Hopefully that'll make life easier for
Louise and Jonas.

314
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:49,158
All you need to do for me in return...

315
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:54,641
You know very well.
But you have to decide yourself.

316
00:27:55,928 --> 00:27:59,603
My dad was with you yesterday.

317
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:04,885
Can you give him a message?

318
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:08,644
No.  Okay. Thank you.
For nothing.

319
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:20,758
What's going on here?
Lennart Brix. Chief of Homicide.

320
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,560
We have reason to believe that there
is crucial evidence at this location

321
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,201
What do you expect to find here?
You can't just waltz into a barracks..

322
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,523
I understand that you're the new guy,
in charge with your shiny cap on.

323
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:39,890
If you don't want too much trouble,
just do as I say.

324
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:46,500
No one is to leave the area. Send
someone for the necessary keys.

325
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:53,168
What now?
Contact General Arild.

326
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:57,245
Go directly to see him, damn it.

327
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:02,209
Krabbe's being pressured by his supporters to
commit to the vote, will he come through?

328
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,845
I'll take care of him. Have the police come back
with anything? There must be some news soon..

329
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,246
They'll be flying back tomorrow

330
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:12,007
Plough has the details.
Where the hell is he when he is needed...?

331
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:16,486
They have to go over there with that lot..
and then we need to start there..

332
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:22,066
The press report is out. Three members see your
stance as terrible and are accusing you of treason.

333
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,367
Probably a little over the top but
they don't know the full picture

334
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:29,532
We have evidence that the Prime Minister covered
up the story to help him manouvre defence...

335
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:33,927
The first medical report. We can't find a reason
in there that would make him complicit.

336
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:38,453
And the doctor was satisfied with the revised report.
He could find nothing at all to suggest a cover up..

337
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:45,030
Nothing points to the murder of civilians or wrongdoing.
Thomas your allegations about ...

338
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:48,452
...the prime minister
are becoming more and more extreme.

339
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:53,850
Thomas, maybe we should spend more
time on the Minister of Defense.

340
00:29:54,017 --> 00:30:00,126
I think I've found something.
The Prime Minister has a secret.

341
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:21,495
We need to wait a little longer for the memorial service.

342
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,413
What's wrong?
The relatives are coming and there's been a problem.

343
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:30,335
There's been a search at the barracks.
If it takes too long ...

344
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,652
...we can't start before anyone from
the Barracks is here to take part.

345
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:54,371
What are you doing here?
You don't have much faith in me,

346
00:30:54,541 --> 00:31:00,094
but we have more in common
than you think.

347
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:03,140
I hope not.

348
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:08,694
Your two investigators are on their way
back from Afghanistan with empty pockets.

349
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:12,936
No wonder you're under pressure.

350
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:16,874
Can you defend yourself because
there is a greater cause.

351
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,475
Yes..I can, The greater cause is real,
I can never forget that...

352
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:29,895
Each coffin reminds me that we must
continue, so no one has died in vain.

353
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:34,775
For the Prime Minister it wasn't
about the war, but about the UN.

354
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:39,735
The prime minister wanted to run for
the office of the UN Secretary General.

355
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:44,023
He lacked U.S. backing, and without that
he would never even be considered..

356
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:48,020
Therefore, we had to send more troops
to Afghanistan...

357
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,659
A French news agency confirmed
he had been offered the post.

358
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
It's all been about that post..

359
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:02,738
Look at those coffins and
tell me it was worth it.

360
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:06,820
The prime minister rejected the offer.

361
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:13,381
He was invited to apply, but said
no thanks. Goodbye, Buch.

362
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:18,702
It changes nothing. I refuse to
believe that you did this on your own.

363
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:22,986
The soldiers' deaths are linked
with what happened then.

364
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:26,345
You have a responsibility!

365
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:34,264
Would you please leave? this is a chapel..
Your behavior is inappropriate.

366
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,543
There is nothing, we keep coming up with nothing.
What about the phone?

367
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,909
We keep trying a trace
but the battery is running low.

368
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:58,542
How far are they with the search of the
underground plants? Training course?

369
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:03,182
The whole area down at the auditorium?
We have no manpower.

370
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:07,305
We'll stay here until we're finished.
We'll search everything.

371
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:08,906
Hold on one second..

372
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:15,066
I know what you're going to say..Haven't you got anything
better to do , shouldn't you be catching criminals...

373
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:20,626
I don't know what you're doing here wasting your time.
Good. Then you said it.

374
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:23,626
It's for you.

375
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,568
...And I don't understand what you're doing either.

376
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,569
Doing what should have been done a long time ago..

377
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:33,071
You listen to me, get your pack of hounds
together and get out of there. Now!

378
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:36,706
I'll take full responsibility. We have to continue.
I'll telephone you with an update 

379
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,707
This has to be done.

380
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:43,743
I've spoken with the military,
You have no authority anymore.

381
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:44,887
Lennart...

382
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,588
Allow me to help you with that..

383
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:50,749
I'll give you exactly five minutes to
get packed up and out of here.

384
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:56,024
Brix, come in. Brix, come in...

385
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:59,029
We found something in the basement.

386
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:24,514
What's in the box?
Get it open.

387
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:58,161
The group had based themselves
here on the first floor.

388
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:18,044
5.56 calibre. The bullets used by
Danish soldiers in their assault rifles.

389
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:27,236
The soldiers slept in shifts.
Here in this area.

390
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:40,403
Was it here that they were killed?
According to Raben.

391
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:44,322
And the corpses
were brought in here afterwards.

392
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:50,405
The soldiers, who came to
rescue the group, found nothing.

393
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:54,002
They couldn't drag the bodies outside?

394
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,003
Not without being shot....pretty open out there..

395
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:00,241
Are we done here?

396
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,886
Some people thought the father was a drug lord,
who financed the Taliban by selling opium.

397
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:21,124
Does he believe that the family
were killed by Danish soldiers?

398
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:40,409
No, there was no trace of them, no 
trace of them has ever been found.

399
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:45,408
Good. Excuse us for disturbing you.

400
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,688
What's this?

401
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:06,531
The family had a bakery.
Where's the oven?

402
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:19,011
He says that everything was destroyed.
I just want to see the oven.

403
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:24,974
I don't care! Look, get it cleared
before the meeting!

404
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:30,056
Rossing took the bait, he wants 
to meet Now, we'll get him.

405
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,257
He's up there waiting...tell him I'm coming..

406
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,855
yes yes, he'll be waiting for you.
We have a problem.

407
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:38,755
The police have expanded their
investigation in Afghanistan.

408
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:41,256
What do you mean expanded?
I'm not sure of the details yet..

409
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:46,373
They've left the Militarised Zone without permission.
Without authority their findings are flawed

410
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,893
So give them authority.

411
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:54,212
It's against international rules. Military HQ is furious.
Their safety is not guaranteed

412
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:59,817
Where have you been? The Minister
of Defence is still waiting in your office.

413
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:03,892
Help them over there, if you can.
Easy for you to talk.

414
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:09,929
If it's not a pressing matter,
come back later.

415
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,291
I've always been loyal to the
Prime Minister.  Congratulations

416
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,217
Even when I had to
compromise my own principles.

417
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,900
When the civilian killings were reported
we had to make a difficult decision.

418
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:35,693
We needed more money
and more soldiers.

419
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:41,459
The prime minister and I agreed to
delay the examination of the extra hand.

420
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:50,172
I had no idea where it would lead.
With Monberg...

421
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:53,301
...and all those killings.

422
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:59,980
Alarm bells should have gone off
in the process.

423
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,642
What about?

424
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:08,219
Irregularities were found when
 the hand was properly examined

425
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:12,093
We were very hesitant about it.

426
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:17,419
The prosecutor concluded that the only
civilian among those killed was a bomber.

427
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,543
What was the problem?

428
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:28,098
There was a henna tattoo on the
 hand, a special henna tattoo.

429
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:37,976
Experts believed that it was
typical of the Hazara people.

430
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:42,105
Hazara people are sworn enemies of the Taliban.

431
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:45,862
But the crucial point was...
...the gold ring.

432
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,780
The Taliban never wear gold.

433
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:54,067
Therefore, it couldn't possibly
have been from a suicide bomber.

434
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:02,019
Did the prime minister know all this?

435
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:07,262
Officially, no.
But did he ..?

436
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:14,105
Gert knows everything. He's in charge.

437
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,225
What happens now?
We'll change our strategy again.

438
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,199
You and Rossing against the Prime Minister?
Read it here.

439
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
 Are you sure he isn't lying?

440
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,861
I'll inform Krabbe before the meeting.

441
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:41,628
It's my locker, but I haven't used it
in ages. I've always said so.

442
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,989
The phone was used in connection
with the murder of Grüner.

443
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:49,269
It's possible, but it's not mine.

444
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:53,471
I had nothing to do with the killings.

445
00:41:55,512 --> 00:42:00,347
Look at these. Our technicians
examined the broken parts.

446
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:05,906
They matched the ID tag that
we've found on the five victims.

447
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:08,029
Yes.

448
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:14,263
I've never seen any of this before.
What is that key for?

449
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,585
No idea.

450
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,186
 You are going to be charged 
with all five murders.

451
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:21,187
That's ridiculous..

452
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:23,388
I'm innocent.

453
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,389
You claim that you never met the victim of
the first murder, the lawyer Dragsholm?

454
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:32,390
And you didn't know know that
she wanted to reopen the case?

455
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:37,390
Pending our investigation, you'll be 
kept in solitary. Take him away.

456
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:43,028
You're right, I did meet Anne Dragsholm.

457
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:51,747
She asked for a meeting. I thought
it was best to remain open-minded.

458
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:56,433
But she kept making accusations,
so I told her to go to hell.

459
00:42:56,597 --> 00:43:00,431
Why should I kill my own people...

460
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:05,148
...and be stupid enough to leave
a mobile inside my locker?

461
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:09,869
You've now established regret,
but that won't sway the judge.

462
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:17,070
We didn't care about Anne Dragsholm.
You can damn-well check my alibi.

463
00:43:17,238 --> 00:43:20,231
We?
Yes.

464
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:23,391
Bilal was involved in the meeting.

465
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,474
He was deputy commander
of the camp at the time.

466
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:33,235
How did Bilal feel about the accusations?

467
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,996
He was angry. He was afraid that
it would destroy our reputation.

468
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,792
Bilal is a Muslim, but he hates
dark men more than we do.

469
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,079
And that's understandable.

470
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:54,196
Bilal has access to the basement?

471
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:57,990
Bilal is a boy scout.
Does he have access?

472
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:03,953
Yes, but he said it was dangerous
because the ceiling could collapse.

473
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:09,311
The prosecutor will read the indictment
before you enter your plea.

474
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:14,637
Are you sticking by your statement
about the officer and civilian victims?

475
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:19,115
You'll probably go back to the
Institution again.

476
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:22,639
ln any case ... Excuse me?

477
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:33,080
The session has been postponed. They
think they've found the perpetrator.

478
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:37,795
They've found evidence
pointing to General Søgaard.

479
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:40,517
You've insisted someone from
the barracks was involved.

480
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:42,518
Now maybe they'll find some truth

481
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,915
Okay. Come on.

482
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:49,919
They must not question you 
without me being there.

483
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:54,637
Søgaard may be hiding something,
but he's definitely not the culprit.

484
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:57,559
It isn't Søgaard.

485
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:04,041
The other half of all ID tags
were in his locker. Hurry.

486
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:09,327
You've got the wrong man.
My wife and son are in the barracks.

487
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:12,923
Quiet.
My wife and son ...

488
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,684
What are you doing?
Are you completely mad?

489
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,487
Put him in the car....Now...hurry.

490
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:35,399
I still can't get information about
when my father will be released.

491
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:40,404
Any news from the police?
The last one just left.

492
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:45,360
My dad found out that someone
had hidden some radio messages.

493
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,523
Who here could have done that?

494
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:56,290
Do you understand that it's important?
Everything Jens said may be true.

495
00:45:56,451 --> 00:46:01,081
There were no messages and
no one is hiding anything.

496
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:08,089
My dad thinks otherwise. They must've
been placed in Søgaard's locker.

497
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:11,005
So it must be Søgaard.

498
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:15,290
Who operated the radio?

499
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:19,286
All radio calls are recorded in a log.

500
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:23,332
So, is there a way to delete
the messages from it.

501
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:28,169
Who could have done it,
if it wasn't Søgaard?

502
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:32,104
I have to see the other officers.

503
00:46:32,905 --> 00:46:35,505
 Call General Arild. Find out
 who accused my dad.

504
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:41,013
This must be the same guy...
someone who attended the ball.

505
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:46,487
My father was on to something
and suddenly he was betrayed.

506
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:53,369
Call him. Or call the police.
They need to know.

507
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:56,095
What are you waiting for?

508
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:32,129
Lund... I've talked to my superiors.
We have to get out of here, right now.

509
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:35,768
There's nothing here, right?
I want to see the oven.

510
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:39,851
You'll be sent home to answer
a criminal charge.

511
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,970
Yes? Hello, Strange here.

512
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:55,892
There must be another.

513
00:48:08,821 --> 00:48:12,894
We have to remove all this
rubble and take a look.

514
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:23,618
He says you're crazy. Agreed...
five people were killed.

515
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:27,661
If you know anything about it
please tell us about it now.

516
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:32,134
A family used to live here.
Two adults and two children.

517
00:48:32,302 --> 00:48:37,331
I need to know whether
they were killed or not.

518
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,934
Around here, every day people die,
in case you haven't noticed.

519
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:54,821
What the hell does he mean by that?
Hey...

520
00:48:54,984 --> 00:48:58,260
Hey! Hey!

521
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:04,978
When people get killed, it means
something. What's wrong with you?

522
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:08,137
Translate, dammit.

523
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:12,618
Tell me what happened. Do you have
the uniform on just for decoration?

524
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:17,337
What happened to the corpses? You
must've heard or seen something.

525
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,784
They were buried outside? Were they
burned? Did they run away?

526
00:49:21,946 --> 00:49:25,781
You should care, all of you..
That concerns you...

527
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:28,336
Relax, relax.

528
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:34,503
We've been through it all.
There is no oven. No bodies. Okay?

529
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:40,657
It's Brix. They think they know
who the perpetrator is.

530
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,184
Yes?

531
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:51,819
Fly back immediately. We're in the 
shit with the ministry and the army

532
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,820
You have caused a stink by
 stepping out of the zone

533
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:54,821
No choice..

534
00:49:54,989 --> 00:49:59,062
Evidence suggests that it is Bilal.
He knew Dragsholm.  It started to...

535
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,500
..make sense when we found the five
halves of the ID tags at the barracks.

536
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:03,501
How come?

537
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:05,102
Yes, so..come home now..

538
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,206
At the barracks?
Why would Bilal...

539
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:08,707
Come home Lund.

540
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,749
We know where this key is for.
Good, back to the barracks.

541
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,587
It's not the barracks. According to
the locksmith it's a lease...

542
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:20,823
in the name of Per K. Møller.

543
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:26,702
The meeting's started. Would
everyone take their seats.

544
00:50:39,592 --> 00:50:47,307
The Minister of Justice has a report
about the investigation in Helmand.

545
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:50,386
The Prime Minister wants it heard before the vote.

546
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:52,387
Let's start now

547
00:50:52,953 --> 00:51:00,349
As you know the investigation carried out in
Afghanistan has yielded no new information.

548
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:05,269
...but I've discovered a scandal
of historic proportions.

549
00:51:05,434 --> 00:51:07,725
A stain on the history of the party
and the government.

550
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:10,946
Is that it?
That's all..?

551
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,947
The police found nothing?

552
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:18,152
No, but if I may continue ...

553
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:22,867
...other issues will have to wait.
The prime minister has the floor.

554
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:28,156
His words aren't important If I can't continue. What I have 
to expose, it's scandalous, I must be allowed to speak. 

555
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:33,754
You can wait, I will speak now, and I find
this a hard thing to say...

556
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:39,275
I've just received information ...

557
00:51:39,437 --> 00:51:44,306
...which more than suggests that
the Minister of Defence misled us.

558
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:51,031
The Minister of Defence
withheld a statement ...

559
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:55,714
...indicating that the hand
found in Afghanistan ...

560
00:51:55,878 --> 00:52:00,315
...didn't belong to
a Taliban suicide bomber.

561
00:52:00,478 --> 00:52:05,189
This information was concealed to
avoid the question of killing civilians.

562
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:10,479
That's totally wrong...It's shocking.
Yes...I was shocked..

563
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:17,716
With immediate effect The Minister Of Defence is
 dismissed for gross misconduct in office, 

564
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,589
His actions will be investigated
by the Intelligence service.

565
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,958
Say it. The Prime Minister told you
to withhold those documents.

566
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,840
The Minister of Justice must wait.

567
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:33,040
Let me finish. The Minister of Defence
has told me everything.

568
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:37,877
The situation regarding the Minister
of Justice is equally serious.

569
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:42,433
He should be acting for the benefit
of the nation...

570
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:47,722
...but instead he misused his office
to cast doubt on the Prime Minister.

571
00:52:47,882 --> 00:52:52,751
The Prime Minister instructed
the Minister of Defense ...

572
00:52:52,922 --> 00:52:57,155
His motives are questionable.
He's leading a smear campaign...

573
00:52:57,323 --> 00:53:02,522
...and is very careless
with confidential information.

574
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:09,032
Intelligence will investigate
whether he has committed treason.

575
00:53:09,204 --> 00:53:13,038
That's ludicrous!
What the hell is going on?

576
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:16,301
If it is discovered you have broken
the law I cannot help you here

577
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:18,302
I need no help from you..

578
00:53:18,964 --> 00:53:21,800
It goes without saying, that you have
hereby resigned as minister.

579
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:32,438
Relax, relax.
I'll go myself. Relax!

580
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:39,436
Have you been arrested?

581
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:44,600
Has the Minister of Defense tried to
mislead parliament?

582
00:53:57,527 --> 00:54:01,123
They found it in Søgaards locker?

583
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:04,485
Søgaard's alibis are all in order.

584
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:09,517
Brix thinks Bilal used the locker
to plant evidence.

585
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:14,399
If there were no civilian deaths,
then why the murders?

586
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:18,847
I didn't get to hear more after
you went at his Afghan driver.

587
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:26,204
The main thing is that we have him
now...whether it's Bilal or Søgaard.

588
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,282
Yes. you're right

589
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,126
So it's good you're on your way home
to clean everything up, right?

590
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:52,565
Shit.

591
00:55:14,453 --> 00:55:16,967
Do as they say.

592
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:25,930

1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:13,249
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:18,290
The Muslim League will avenge
the suffering Denmark has caused...

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,832
Brix thinks
you can give us a new angle.

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,332
Kodmani must be questioned again.

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:29,332
Raben knew both victims.
He lied. And now he's escaped.

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,665
- We must send out a search party.
- Why him?

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:37,165
I respect your methods, but they
have been known to lead to disaster.

8
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,582
The Government has put a lot of work
into the terrorism package.

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:47,124
We need you to head the negotiations.
Will you be Minister of Justice?

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,749
The link was activated at 5:03pm.
At sunset, the end of Ramadan.

11
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:55,374
The woman who was killed
had also been in the army.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,415
Buch failed to get broad agreement
on the terrorism package.

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,499
- There was a secret memo.
- Is what she says true?

14
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:09,290
Yes. The memo warned against
terrorism, after the first killing.

15
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:13,082
Monberg and I removed the memo.

16
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,915
I knew nothing of that memo.
It was removed from the file.

17
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,624
Why was Monberg concerned
about national security?

18
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,415
- The Probation Service turned you down.
- Why?

19
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:30,749
- Why can't I see him?
- He refuses to take his medication.

20
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:36,249
He wouldn't escape
unless he had a good reason.

21
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:40,540
Hi, Priest!
I need to talk to certain people.

22
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:46,124
- Myg and Dragsholm are dead.
- Myg came to visit me.

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,999
- Why set up a post office box?
- Faith Fellow told me to.

24
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:58,332
In which language?
Shut up, for a second!

25
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,415
- Lund is...
- I know all about Lund.

26
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,999
She got kicked out
for several good reasons.

27
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,374
That interview was conducted
in the worst possible manner.

28
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:19,915
Monberg requested documents
concerning Anne Dragsholm.

29
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:26,040
Why did Monberg withhold
information about a terrorism alert?

30
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:30,457
It could compromise
military strategy in Afghanistan

31
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,707
thus endangering Danish soldiers.

32
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:39,540
Frode had another diary.
He knew Anne Dragsholm personally.

33
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:44,374
Anne felt the army didn't take
the squad's statement seriously.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,374
- Which squad?
- She conducted a case for them.

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,457
Dragsholm contacted me
a few weeks before she was killed.

36
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:57,374
Do you have the list of Team Ægir?
We must find Raben's squad.

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,749
THE KILLING

38
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,040
THURSDAY, 17 NOVEMBER
6:34PM

39
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,665
- Can't you stop that?
- We're working on it.

40
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:39,332
He was attacked in his car and
wheeled down here in his wheelchair.

41
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,124
We saw the smoke,
but couldn't get in.

42
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,749
- And the sprinklers?
- They were turned off.

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:53,832
The CCTV had been switched off
shortly before 5:00pm.

44
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:58,040
Petrol had been poured
all over and around the victim.

45
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,582
The fire was ignited
with a call from a mobile phone.

46
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:09,665
The victim was tied up
and the wheelchair was chained.

47
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,124
He sat there
watching the mobile phone

48
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,499
while he waited
for all hell to break loose.

49
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,124
- What do we know about him?
- David Grüner, 28-year-old veteran.

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,665
He has worked here
as a security guard for a year.

51
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,124
His legs were shot to bits
in Afghanistan. Raben's squad.

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,124
- Perhaps he was burnt alive.
- Is that a car tyre?

53
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,249
- Yes.
- I need to make a call.

54
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,457
- And no dog tag?
- Yes, it was dangling in his car.

55
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,499
It looks like the same perpetrator.

56
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,707
If only we'd been briefed in time.

57
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,957
We didn't know what to expect.

58
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,499
Lund didn't know either.
We drove out here, and suddenly...

59
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,749
I should have known.

60
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,749
I should have...

61
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,040
I should have done something.

62
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:07,082
If only we'd come half an hour earlier.
Just 15 minutes.

63
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,290
- Lund?
- I'm all right.

64
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:27,707
The car tyre round the neck is used
on informers in South Africa

65
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,790
and American
security personnel in Iraq.

66
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:37,207
- I hear there were witnesses.
- Raben. Whatever he was doing here.

67
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,665
It seems to be the same perpetrator
as in the previous killings.

68
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,749
- Sarah Lund uncovered all this?
- Yes.

69
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,999
They didn't inform us
in time for the press conference.

70
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:58,332
- That would have been preferable.
- Kodmani could still be involved.

71
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:03,915
I am going to take Lund
off the case for a few days.

72
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,874
Why?
I know what I said yesterday.

73
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,915
But there are two good reasons
to keep her on it.

74
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:19,624
I'd like to know what she thinks of
this Faith Fellow Kodmani mentioned.

75
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,665
We must take
a broader view of the case.

76
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,624
And what's the second reason?

77
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:32,665
Kodmani has agreed to being
questioned, on one condition.

78
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,165
- Meet Bjørn before the wedding.
- This is not a good time.

79
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:43,374
Coffee this evening?
We could drop by.

80
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,624
- Any news about Raben?
- No, he's gone.

81
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,540
- And the others from his squad?
- The search is on.

82
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:54,290
- Lund!
- Coffee tonight, then.

83
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:59,374
- I'll buy some cake. Call you later.
- Good. See you.

84
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,124
Remember: no nuts in the cake!
Bjørn is allergic to nuts.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,415
Kodmani will talk.
But only if you do the questioning.

86
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,582
But you couldn't see,
if he was the victim.

87
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,624
- It was him.
- Maybe he just...

88
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,415
Priest!
He is dead, dammit! Face it!

89
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,249
He had a wife and a child.

90
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:11,249
- Did you find the others?
- There is only one more left.

91
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,540
- Thomsen.
- What about HC?

92
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,207
HC died in a car accident last year.

93
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:25,582
Thomsen no longer lives
at her address in Copenhagen.

94
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:33,540
It's locked. It's your wife.
She said you gave her a sign.

95
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,749
I said I didn't know where you were,
but she insisted on staying.

96
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,957
Jonas, do as she says. Go to bed.

97
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,582
Sleep tight, darling.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,957
- Who knows you're here?
- Nobody.

99
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,249
I told the babysitter
I was visiting a friend.

100
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:03,332
- Are you sure nobody followed you?
- Why did you escape?

101
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,332
Myg and Grüner have been killed.

102
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,957
I don't know why.

103
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,707
They knew something.
They were scared.

104
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,665
What are you talking about?

105
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,290
Something happened in Afghanistan.

106
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:26,749
I never told you. I can't quite remember it.
I thought it was over.

107
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,874
And that it was all in my mind.
But maybe I was quite sane.

108
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,874
If I don't find out, I'm going to rot
in that mental institution.

109
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,499
What haven't you told me?

110
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,332
Jens, turn yourself in.

111
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,874
We'll explain it somehow,
so that it won't ruin everything.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,207
- No. I can't turn myself in.
- Why not?

113
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,624
We've waited for two years!
We've talked to doctors and lawyers.

114
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,582
- You're ruining our chances...
- What do you expect?

115
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,040
Should I wait ten years,
let my son forget me

116
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,499
and let you run off with Søgaard?

117
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,540
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:22,499
I'll sort it all out.
I know what I'm doing. OK?

119
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:34,207
I need your help to find Thomsen.

120
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,832
Look in the files at the barracks.
I must talk to her.

121
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,790
She is the last one of our squad.

122
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,207
Take this. It's safe.

123
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,957
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

124
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,915
I must leave now.
They will look for me here.

125
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,999
Kiss Jonas for me.

126
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,665
The war in Afghanistan has failed.
Terrorism is the consequence of it.

127
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,915
You are shamelessly exploiting
a national crisis.

128
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:29,499
You would abolish the rule of law,
freedom of speech and human rights.

129
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:34,624
We support the Government,
but the terrorism package is too lenient.

130
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,207
The Government
has brought this country to a crisis.

131
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:44,040
The Government should not lose
its head, like those present.

132
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:49,790
The terrorism package
is crafted out of necessity.

133
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:55,915
Personal intrigue must not prevent us
from solving the problems.

134
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:01,249
The Ministry of Justice
is trying to withhold information.

135
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:06,415
But the Minister of Justice explained
about the memo from Special Branch.

136
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,540
We are not sure what part
the Ministry of Justice plays in this.

137
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,374
Buch's predecessor withheld
information about the first killing.

138
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,207
We have explained...

139
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:22,832
Notwithstanding security measures,
it seems stupid not to tell anybody.

140
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,332
So it seems you're on your own
with the People's Party.

141
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,082
- We still want a broad agreement.
- And failing that?

142
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:37,499
Everyone knows what I think
of the People's Party's proposal.

143
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:42,332
- We are sure you will see reason.
- And thus we end the debate.

144
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,957
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

145
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,040
That went well. Shall we meet up
tomorrow morning?

146
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:55,290
- We are on to something.
- I just want it resolved.

147
00:13:55,416 --> 00:14:01,582
I'll show up. Or do you want
to think things over?

148
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,707
What's up?

149
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,749
Monberg and Dragsholm
didn't know each other personally.

150
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:15,457
Special Branch knows nothing of it
and König was surprised to hear it.

151
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,790
We know they met at a hotel
the weekend before she was killed.

152
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:27,790
That weekend Monberg spoke
at a seminar on human rights.

153
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:34,374
It was arranged by Amnesty
and Dragsholm was on the board.

154
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,082
- Did they stay the night?
- The Minister did, alone.

155
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:44,540
- I left the hotel in the afternoon.
- Did you know of their meeting?

156
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:50,082
They weren't having an affair.
I would have noticed.

157
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,707
What is Plough doing here?

158
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,749
They found him
in a multi-storey car park.

159
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:03,624
It seems to be the same killer
who committed the two previous killings.

160
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,499
Special Branch is not sure
they've got the right man.

161
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,915
The Prime Minister wants a meeting
with you and the Minister of Defense.

162
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,665
How was Monberg
connected to the first victim?

163
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,999
We must find out if Monberg withheld
information for personal reasons.

164
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,957
Recent events
force me to tell you something.

165
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:30,874
In the past few months,
Monberg cancelled certain meetings.

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,082
- He always had a plausible excuse.
- Get to the point, Plough.

167
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,374
He wasn't always
where he said he'd be.

168
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,457
I sensed he was seeing someone

169
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,332
probably without
his family's knowledge.

170
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,665
- Having a bit on the side?
- By the looks of it...

171
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,749
Do you think it was Dragsholm?

172
00:15:54,875 --> 00:16:01,999
The days he cancelled meetings,
he stayed at Hotel Hammershøj.

173
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,165
We know he met Dragsholm there.

174
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,999
Special Branch knows nothing of it.

175
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,915
And if an affair was relevant to
the investigation, he would have told us.

176
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,457
Don't mention it at the meeting.
We need to know more.

177
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,457
The Minister of Defense
is close to Monberg

178
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,582
so we can't just blurt it out.

179
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:42,874
Good evening. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Please sit down.

180
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,707
My colleague here will join us.
Sit down.

181
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,290
You wanted to tell me something.

182
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,915
I want to tell you all I know
about the Faith Fellow.

183
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:11,499
But the members of my organisation
who you arrested have no part in it.

184
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:16,957
We won't cut any deals.
Who we arrest is our concern.

185
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,499
I know I am going to pay
for my mistake.

186
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,540
- Just make sure others don't.
- What mistake is that?

187
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:36,082
My first contact with Faith Fellow
was on one of my websites.

188
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,957
- That was almost two months ago.
- We didn't find anything.

189
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:47,290
I didn't suspect anything, but now
I can see he played me like a fiddle.

190
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:52,124
My faith, my political views,
my hatred...

191
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,915
Don't give us the story of your life.

192
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:59,665
I was certain I could trust him.
He wrote convincingly.

193
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,665
He asked me to set up
a PO box for his donations.

194
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,957
He also asked me how to upload
a video on my website.

195
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,124
- Did he ask you to kill too?
- No.

196
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,582
There was none of that.

197
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:23,790
My only crime is that
it made me feel good, at first.

198
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,540
For once, your lot were being punished.
I felt vindicated.

199
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,207
Until you showed me the photos.

200
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,999
Until I understood
that we were going to pay for it.

201
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,290
- How do you mean?
- You only see what you want to see.

202
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,790
The killers aren't fundamentalists,
but people who hate us.

203
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:52,540
- Who are they?
- That's for you to find out.

204
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,999
In which language
did Faith Fellow write?

205
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,374
- English with some Arabic.
- Was he an Arab?

206
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,915
No. That was to please me.

207
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:15,415
His sentences
seemed out of context.

208
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:20,957
Did Faith Fellow write about
an army squad, or Anne Dragsholm?

209
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:28,165
- You must know more...
- The words he chose...

210
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,582
He was very precise and brief.

211
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm convinced
Faith Fellow is a military man.

212
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,540
Or used to be.

213
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,540
Kodmani isn't in the clear yet.

214
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,624
But what do we know
about Faith Fellow?

215
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:53,624
He is probably the man
behind the Muslim League.

216
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,249
- The video, army lists, dog tags.
- I agree.

217
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,915
Now, we must focus on Raben's
squad and look for a motive.

218
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,707
What motive is there
if Kodmani didn't do it?

219
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,082
What do you know
about the squad?

220
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:15,832
They are all decorated.
The squad was called 3-2-AIpha.

221
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,290
It consisted of eight persons.
Raben was squad leader since 2001.

222
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:28,540
The squad was often stationed abroad
and did well in Afghanistan.

223
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:33,665
But on their last mission, the squad
lost three men and was disbanded.

224
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,457
- What about the rest of the squad?
- There are only two left.

225
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:42,582
Jens Peter Raben, on the run. Lisbeth
Thomsen, whereabouts unknown.

226
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:49,082
The first victim was not part
of the squad, only connected to it.

227
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:54,582
Yes. Anne Dragsholm represented
the squad at an inquiry.

228
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,832
Concerning what?

229
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,957
The last mission.

230
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,082
The local civilians accused them
of breaching the Geneva Convention.

231
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,290
Meaning?

232
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,499
Alleged killings of civilians.

233
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:15,874
Dragsholm and the judge advocate's
report cleared the squad.

234
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,790
According to Dragsholm's husband
there was some disagreement.

235
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,915
- That's why the army fired her.
- She may have borne a grudge.

236
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:31,790
But the fact is, she resigned.
This is Dragsholm's resignation.

237
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,207
- Do you have a minute?
- Yes.

238
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,207
Kodmani talked of a military man.

239
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,665
Maybe he was in Afghanistan
at the time.

240
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:49,749
We might find someone who was
involved and is now seeking revenge.

241
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,790
What is a judge advocate's report?

242
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,332
Judge advocates may prosecute,
but in this case they didn't.

243
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,040
Right. I want that report
sent to my address ASAP.

244
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:16,915
We must find Lisbeth Thomsen
before it's too late. Call me.

245
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,749
Thanks. Do you know
any bakeries that are open now?

246
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,290
I'll call you.

247
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,999
What's up?

248
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,124
I see you decided
to keep Lund on the case.

249
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,499
- Is that a problem?
- No.

250
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,457
But it may be unwise if you have
a future career to consider.

251
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,249
My future is hardly
to be discussed with König?

252
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:03,290
We were talking about the Minister
of Justice being under pressure.

253
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,707
Ruth, what is going on?

254
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,082
I don't like being kept in the dark.

255
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,707
If you or König know something...

256
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,499
You'll be informed in due course.

257
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,832
You have enough on your plate.

258
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:30,124
Including Lund.
She is your responsibility.

259
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,124
Agreed?

260
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,582
We weren't talking
about anything important.

261
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,790
Shall we meet up later?

262
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:53,499
Good.
I'll be counting on it. Bye.

263
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,582
This evening,
another terrorism victim was found.

264
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:06,374
28-year-old David Grüner served
at Ryvangen army barracks.

265
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,582
His body was found
in a multi-storey car park.

266
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:14,790
Like the two previous victims,
he was subjected to ruthless violence.

267
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:19,540
The police and Special Branch
have arrested some suspects

268
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,249
but there is no conclusive
breakthrough in the investigation.

269
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,749
- Buch... Nice to see you.
- Thank you. Likewise.

270
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:32,249
- Am I late for something?
- We were just catching up.

271
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:37,582
- Are you holding your own?
- I'm coping. It's crazy.

272
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:41,540
It'll all work out.
You did quite well.

273
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:46,415
Monberg would've been pleased
to know you've taken over from him.

274
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,207
Right, let's get started.

275
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,415
It doesn't look too good, but police
and Special Branch are on it.

276
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,749
- But it may take some time.
- I'm afraid so.

277
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:05,540
The terrorists have chosen
a most inconvenient time.

278
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:11,749
It is imperative that we reach
agreement on the terrorism package.

279
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:16,790
And, Gert, we can't wait for Agger
and the Opposition to see reason.

280
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:22,040
We'll agree with the People's Party
and ban certain organisations.

281
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:26,874
The investigation doesn't point
to any of those organisations.

282
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,290
We can't be sure. To ban them
because of this case would be wrong.

283
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:37,957
I understand your concern.
Had this been peace-time

284
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,874
I would have shared your opinion.

285
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,624
I agree with the Minister of Defense.
We must send a clear signal.

286
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,915
Not on that basis!

287
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:55,790
Other things
are blurring the picture.

288
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:07,374
Monberg may have known the first victim,
Anne Dragsholm, personally.

289
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,124
He never told anybody.

290
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,790
How did he know her?
What does Special Branch say?

291
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:18,499
They are not aware
of the connection.

292
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:23,540
- Are we talking about rumours?
- Somehow, things don't add up.

293
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,082
If Special Branch doesn't see
any connection, why worry?

294
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,165
Thomas, do you know something?

295
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,874
No, I don't know anything.

296
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,915
Let Special Branch do their work,
and let us focus on ours.

297
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,540
It may seem rash to accuse
this particular organisation.

298
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:54,624
But these Islamic organisations
have made statements

299
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,832
that are reprehensible and hostile.
We must take action.

300
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,415
So I want you to agree
to Krabbe's demands

301
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:07,165
and seal up the terrorism package
with the People's party ASAP.

302
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:16,707
Our next deployment
faces difficulties.

303
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:21,082
We have informed about security
and procedures abroad.

304
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:25,332
But the risk of being in danger
when they return

305
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,957
will make some soldiers opt out.

306
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,207
Any solutions?

307
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,499
We've invited the soldiers
and their relatives to a meeting.

308
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:40,207
- Bilal will talk to them tomorrow.
- Grüner's death makes it harder.

309
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:46,124
Explain to them that this is a temporary
and untypical situation.

310
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,457
It's high time
we got this thing sorted out.

311
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,832
One more thing.

312
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,832
Grüner was in 3-2-AIpha,
and so was Myg Poulsen.

313
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:03,707
The first victim, the legal advisor,
was connected to the squad.

314
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:09,582
- This must cause some speculation.
- We have nothing to hide.

315
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:13,124
Give the investigators
any files they want.

316
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,332
Of course.

317
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,957
And then there is Raben.
His escape may be relevant.

318
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,915
- He was squad leader...
- Why bring that up now?

319
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:30,165
Raben will seek out
his military contacts.

320
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:35,790
- We'll arrest him on sight!
- It's a matter of security.

321
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:39,582
If you're worried
about my daughter's loyalty, Bilal,

322
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,207
you're barking up the wrong tree.
Understood?

323
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:49,040
Søgaard, come with me to Grüner's wife,
to pay our respects.

324
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,665
I'd like an agenda for the meeting
with soldiers and relatives.

325
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,374
- Do you have a moment?
- Later.

326
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,915
I'll see to it that my furniture
is cleared out by tomorrow.

327
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,540
I heard about Grüner.

328
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,332
He was in Jens' squad.
What's going on?

329
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:14,457
I don't know, but Jens
was spotted at the crime scene.

330
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,082
I expect the police will be
keeping an eye on you and Jonas.

331
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,249
Louise...

332
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:33,582
...if Jens contacts you,
it's important you let me know.

333
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,624
Will you agree to that?

334
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,290
Yes.

335
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,249
Good. When will the forensic reports
be ready?

336
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,874
Right.

337
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:13,790
- Thanks. Sorry. I'm all yours now.
- Take a look at this.

338
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:18,790
We'll have a traditional
horseshoe table setting.

339
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,415
Nothing else is traditional
about our wedding!

340
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:27,707
- These cakes are good.
- You'll be seated there.

341
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,540
Can't I sit next to Mark?

342
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,749
Bjørn's cousin is on his own,

343
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,915
because his wife is ill.

344
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,457
- You are welcome to invite a companion.
- No.

345
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:51,332
- Don't you have a fella?
- No. Sarah is taking a break.

346
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:57,207
I was taking a break too.
But then I thought better of it!

347
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:02,207
- Do you know how we met?
- Let me just answer this. Yes?

348
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:07,624
That's all right. Just get them to me
as soon as possible. Excellent.

349
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,457
Thanks. Bye.

350
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,207
So where did you meet?

351
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,040
It was a second-hand shop.

352
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:22,915
- Where you find well used things.
- Of good quality.

353
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,082
Known brands.
I was looking for a coat.

354
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,249
That's for me.

355
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,957
We should have talked
when she was still working in Gedser.

356
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,415
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

357
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:44,707
Hi. This is the judge advocate's
report and a file on Thomsen.

358
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,874
Any progress with Thomsen?

359
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:52,332
She has sublet her flat and comes
every three months for mail and rent.

360
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:57,999
- That's all, at present.
- Why can't we find her?

361
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,540
I suppose she's trying hard
not to be found.

362
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:06,499
We have to leave now.
Bjørn is feeling unwell.

363
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,707
Are you sure there were
no nuts in the cakes?

364
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,207
- Yes...
- Gluten also does that to me.

365
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:18,082
- And you are...?
- Ulrik Strange. A colleague.

366
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,040
Vibeke. Sarah's mother.
Nice to meet you.

367
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:25,582
We must dash. He really
doesn't feel well. We'll call you.

368
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,124
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

369
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,665
I've asked Colonel Jarnvig to come in
and explain about the report.

370
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,915
- Still no news about Raben?
- No.

371
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:46,915
- OK. See you tomorrow.
- Unless you invite me in for cake.

372
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,124
- See you tomorrow.
- Right.

373
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:03,624
The police have intensified
the search for the escaped inmate.

374
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,832
Jens Peter Raben, aged 37,
height 190cm, dark brown hair.

375
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,124
He is presumed dangerous.

376
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,707
Hello?

377
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,499
- It's me. Where are you?
- I just left the nursery.

378
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:21,082
- Are you being followed?
- I don't think so.

379
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,874
I have to be back in half an hour.

380
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,457
Did you find anything?

381
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,249
I brought you some documents.

382
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,124
- Did you check her file?
- Yes.

383
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,832
There's only her Copenhagen address.

384
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:41,957
- Thomsen is from Hirtshals.
- There is nothing about Hirtshals.

385
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,999
What about next of kin?
She had an uncle.

386
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,749
In Sweden. Some island.

387
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,540
- She went there on leave.
- Yes... It's noted here.

388
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,832
But the uncle is dead.
That's all there is.

389
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,582
I'm here.

390
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,415
Where are you?

391
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:24,082
Stay put.
They're watching you.

392
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:35,665
I don't want you mixed up in this.
Thanks for helping me, love.

393
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,874
- I'll call you, whenever I can.
- Jens...

394
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:44,499
I love you.
But I can't take any more of this.

395
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:50,707
I'm not moving from the barracks.
They'll keep me on at the infirmary.

396
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:55,165
I have to think of Jonas.
He needs me.

397
00:34:56,291 --> 00:35:00,540
- Louise...
- I have to leave now.

398
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,415
Wait.

399
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,124
Take care.

400
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:21,915
The judge advocate's report
mentions civilian casualties.

401
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:27,040
We often get that allegation
after engaging in combat.

402
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,790
The enemy wants
to cause aggravation.

403
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,749
- It's the nature of war rhetoric.
- It could still be true.

404
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:39,665
The Taliban
often hide among civilians.

405
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:44,124
There was a thorough investigation
which cleared the squad.

406
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,082
So you don't believe
the allegations?

407
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:55,124
- No. They were groundless.
- But in the report...

408
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,582
I came to help,
not to be made accountable.

409
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:04,290
We lost three men on that mission,
all of whom were from my barracks.

410
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,165
I believe that's in the report too.

411
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,249
Would anyone want to take revenge
for the accusations?

412
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:18,624
Possibly.
It damaged our reputation.

413
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,624
We tried to make amends.
But someone might still bear a grudge.

414
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:29,290
Do you know if any soldiers here
are connected to Afghanistan?

415
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,749
No. Not to my knowledge.

416
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:39,249
Do you think a Danish soldier
is killing off the squad, one by one?

417
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,915
That's an insane idea!

418
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,082
Thank you. That will be all.

419
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,207
- What?
- Lisbeth Thomsen lives on Skogö.

420
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:03,249
She's staying in her late uncle's house.
The local police have got her.

421
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:07,874
- When can we be on Skogö?
- In a couple of hours, if I drive.

422
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:23,165
Lisbeth Thomsen volunteered
for national service.

423
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:31,207
- I take it you didn't?
- No way!

424
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:37,749
I feigned a bad back
but ended up in a field in full kit.

425
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,707
How did you like it?

426
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:46,165
Actually, I stayed on for a few years.
The army's all right.

427
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,499
Shouldn't we have turned off?
We have a ferry to catch.

428
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,457
The E6 is quicker.

429
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,707
How do you know?
Do you have a summer house?

430
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:04,499
I used to have
a Swedish boyfriend.

431
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,582
Mr. Nilsson?

432
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:14,707
- Why didn't it work out?
- It just didn't.

433
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:24,415
I was about to move to Sweden,
but then a lot of things happened.

434
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:30,832
It's hard to imagine you holding hands
in the forests of Sweden.

435
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,249
Has the local police been informed
that Raben may turn up?

436
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:47,707
Isn't it rather unlikely?

437
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,415
The Prime Minister said to accept
all demands of the People's Party.

438
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,665
- It's far too hasty.
- Write it up!

439
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,499
- You wanted this agreement.
- Not on that basis.

440
00:39:55,625 --> 00:40:00,749
- There are too many loose ends.
- And you were against the ban.

441
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:05,290
It's not up to me.
It's a political decision.

442
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,624
Those organisations
have an unfortunate image.

443
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,207
And we can't prove that Monberg and
Anne Dragsholm had a thing going on.

444
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:16,290
So let's do as we are told.

445
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,457
- Am I early?
- Not at all, come in.

446
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,290
Karina. Will you set up
our press conference?

447
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:38,374
The ban on certain organisations
is included.

448
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:43,957
Yes. I see you've talked
to the Prime Minister.

449
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,665
- About the press conference...
- One small detail.

450
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:54,999
"Organisations said to encourage
or incite terror..."

451
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,124
You've had plenty
of time for amendments.

452
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,665
Yes. But it ought to read:

453
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:10,165
"...incite terror or any other
subversive activities..."

454
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,874
Let's get it sorted out now.

455
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:25,624
We're back to where I finished
negotiating with Monberg.

456
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,582
- A pity he couldn't finish it.
- Quite.

457
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:34,374
In spite of his heart condition,
he really put in a lot of effort.

458
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,457
He only cancelled one meeting.

459
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:42,582
The day the Minister of Integration
was attacked outside her home.

460
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:47,582
It gave us something to talk about
at our next meeting.

461
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:53,249
Send me the corrected agreement.
See you at the press conference.

462
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:01,207
- This letter was returned.
- Thanks.

463
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:06,874
Monberg cancelled a meeting
on 7 October.

464
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,749
- Did he say where he was going?
- No. Why?

465
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:17,415
It's one of the days
he checked into that hotel.

466
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:21,915
- He was going to the doctor.
- Get me the chief of Special Branch.

467
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:28,374
That day, Special Branch was
watching out for certain ministers.

468
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,749
If Monberg was with Dragsholm
in a hotel

469
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,915
it must be in their report.

470
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:57,124
Welcome. Lisbeth Thomsen lives
on the other side of the island.

471
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,999
- But she is being picked up.
- Is it safe?

472
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:04,915
We have a couple of men out there.
But she can look after herself.

473
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,790
- Have you met her?
- Yes. But she keeps to herself.

474
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:11,374
- What does she do?
- She works in the forest.

475
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,457
Chopping wood. Hunting.
She's very capable.

476
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,999
Let's go to the police station.

477
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,207
Raben will probably contact her.

478
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,499
Right. We're ready for him.

479
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,790
Turn left up ahead.

480
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:58,124
The Danish police called.
You must come in for questioning.

481
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,040
- Where are you going?
- Do you want me to bring this?

482
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,165
- Have you been briefed?
- Yes.

483
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:30,874
- Can you explain these events?
- I only know what was on the news.

484
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:34,290
- Have you received any threats?
- No.

485
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:38,957
Have you had any recent contact
with Myg, Grüner or Raben?

486
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,874
I haven't seen any of them
for two years.

487
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,165
In addition to members of your squad,
your lawyer was also killed.

488
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,457
Anne Dragsholm.
Has she contacted you?

489
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:02,415
What happened in August,
two years ago?

490
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:05,915
We lost three soldiers.
It's in the report.

491
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,207
We want to hear your version.

492
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,499
We have to ask these questions.
It's important for us, and for you.

493
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:27,249
We were patrolling the area.

494
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,790
After a while,
we were called up on the radio

495
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:35,915
by another Danish squad,
which was under fire.

496
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:42,290
They were in an area
near the river.

497
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,207
In the Green Zone
which was controlled by the enemy.

498
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:52,124
We were going to cross the river.

499
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,124
But the bridges were mined.

500
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:00,832
The bridge was blown up.
And our armoured vehicle with it.

501
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,290
Bo, sitting across from me,
got the barrel up his throat.

502
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:09,415
The gun barrel
went upwards and into him.

503
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,665
We were cut off
from the rest of the platoon.

504
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:17,165
But we were told that help
was on its way, for the wounded.

505
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,915
Raben ordered the rest of his squad
to head for the village

506
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,207
to assist those
who were under fire in there.

507
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,207
Then what?

508
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,290
That was the last time I saw them.

509
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:38,749
They were found and brought
back to the camp, two days later.

510
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,624
- Why weren't you with them?
- I was to stay with the wounded.

511
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,665
But he died
before the helicopter came.

512
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:54,624
Didn't your mates tell you
what happened in the village?

513
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,832
Yes, you know what's in the report.

514
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,082
They were ambushed.

515
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:04,165
Two more died.
Raben and Grüner were wounded.

516
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:10,624
There were accusations of atrocities
and civilian casualties.

517
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,790
I know nothing about that.

518
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:16,624
How can you explain such anger?

519
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:21,957
I'm sick of those accusations.
We lost three men.

520
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,165
The squad was exonerated.

521
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,165
Raben, Myg and the rest
put their lives at stake.

522
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,832
Don't slag them off.

523
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:37,665
We risk our lives out there,
and then we are reproached.

524
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:45,124
Sorry. But according to the report
there was no patrol under fire.

525
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,832
- We received a radio message.
- But it seems mysterious...

526
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:53,415
- Are we done now?
- It's for your own good.

527
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:57,499
- Why are you in hiding here?
- I'm not!

528
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:02,915
I enjoy the peace.
At least I did, until you lot came.

529
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:07,207
- Are we finished?
- No. Please look at these photos.

530
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,499
Perhaps you can help us.

531
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,374
My God...

532
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:28,124
Bloody hell...

533
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,999
It's Krabbe. What shall I tell him?

534
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,457
I must hear from Special Branch.

535
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:41,124
- We called a press conference.
- What did König say?

536
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,540
- I haven't spoken to him.
- We have to go now.

537
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:48,624
- Give me his number.
- There's no need for that.

538
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,415
Dragsholm wasn't having
an affair with Monberg.

539
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,207
I was.

540
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,332
I didn't think it mattered.

541
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:02,790
The evening of Monberg
and Dragsholm's meeting

542
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:05,540
I was staying at the same hotel.

543
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,082
Monberg was giving a talk
in the afternoon

544
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,124
and asked me to come that evening
to discuss some work.

545
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:18,790
I had just ended the affair,
so I feared it was a false pretence.

546
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,415
I met him in the hotel bar
after his meeting with Dragsholm.

547
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:28,124
He was rather quiet.
But he was drinking too quickly.

548
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,332
I was concerned.
He was carrying a folder.

549
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:35,874
But it was not for me to see.
And then he let me leave.

550
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:40,707
- Did you see Dragsholm?
- No. And he didn't mention her.

551
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,332
I knew nothing of their connection.

552
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,165
- But his behaviour changed.
- In what way?

553
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:54,290
I thought it was due to my ending
the affair. He became introvert.

554
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:59,124
He avoided me.
Until the eve of his heart attack.

555
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,749
Last Sunday, he wanted me
to help him send something.

556
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,207
I gave him an envelope,
and he put it in the out tray.

557
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,207
That was the last time I saw him.

558
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,415
Now the envelope has been returned.

559
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:18,957
It contains the folder
from his meeting with Dragsholm.

560
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,624
He wanted to make sure
the envelope and folder came back.

561
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:29,457
It's a judge advocate's report
on an incident in Afghanistan.

562
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,790
And the CVs of soldiers
of a certain squad.

563
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:39,082
- The names of some of the victims!
- Why did Dragsholm give him this?

564
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,832
There is a covering note
from Monberg.

565
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,082
"Request re-opening of case"

566
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:50,457
I realise I must resign.

567
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,707
I'm really sorry.

568
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,499
It's Krabbe again.
What are we to do?

569
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:09,415
- How was the meeting?
- Five of them cancelled.

570
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:13,540
Some relatives were upset
about Grüner's death.

571
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:16,540
Everyone has till 9:00am
tomorrow to think it over.

572
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:25,040
Tell Søgaard to be here tomorrow
morning. We'll take it from there.

573
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,332
Did you access Lisbeth Thomsen's
file on this computer last night?

574
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:37,207
- No.
- Do you know if Søgaard did?

575
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:42,707
- No. I'll ask the security officers.
- That won't be necessary.

576
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:57,040
- I just meet the security officer.
- I said there was no need.

577
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,707
There is now.

578
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:13,332
- There's not much furniture.
- There will be.

579
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,540
- Now what?
- That's fine.

580
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:27,040
Jonas is staying over with a friend.
I must paint his new room.

581
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,582
- Do you want me to help you?
- It's kind of you to offer.

582
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,957
But painting is good therapy.

583
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,624
You got a little...

584
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,540
There's still some...

585
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,207
I'm very grateful for your...

586
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,749
Just say the word.
I'll come and give you a hand.

587
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,374
Thanks.

588
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:18,540
When did you see him?
Was he here at the barracks?

589
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:25,124
- I'd better be off.
- Stay here. It concerns you too.

590
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,082
He wanted to know
Thomsen's whereabouts.

591
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:38,457
I accessed your computer.
Sorry. He said it was important.

592
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,082
- Did you let him into the barracks?
- No.

593
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:46,957
I told him to give himself up
or else leave us in peace.

594
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,624
- Happy now?
- Where is he?

595
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,499
- I don't know. Why?
- There's been a burglary.

596
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,582
At the depot.

597
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,332
Someone who knows
our security procedures

598
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:03,957
made off with five kilos
of plastic explosives.

599
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:11,499
- You must know more.
- No. I want to go home.

600
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,582
Lund...

601
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:27,457
- What?
- Nobody has seen Dragsholm here.

602
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,457
She knows something.
What about Raben?

603
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:36,040
We haven't seen him.
Shall we drive Thomsen home?

604
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,374
- No. We're taking her with us.
- I'm not going to Copenhagen!

605
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,874
- We'll let you pick up some things.
- What the hell for?

606
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,374
Come on.
The ferry departs in 45 minutes.

607
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,707
If you're in charge of the roads here,
I have a few complaints.

608
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:13,082
- Brix here. Any news?
- We're bringing her in.

609
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:18,707
- We're on our way to the ferry.
- We talked to her subtenant.

610
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:22,749
A week ago, he got a call
from the tax authorities.

611
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:27,540
Threatening to throw him out,
they demanded he call them

612
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:31,749
when Thomsen turned up.
They wished to pay her a visit.

613
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,749
- Why is that important?
- We asked the tax people.

614
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:40,707
None of them have enquired
about Thomsen.

615
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:45,582
You may not be alone
on that island.

616
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,749
OK. Thanks.

617
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,749
- Have you seen this before?
- Let's turn back.

618
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,415
- I'll just check it out.
- No, Strange...

619
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,290
Turn around. Let's go!

620
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,082
Stay where you are.

621
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:47,957
Something happened in that village.
It's all about that.

622
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,582
- I wasn't there. I know no more.
- Then why do you think so?

623
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,957
My mates said so.
And now they're dead. Go!

624
00:56:56,083 --> 00:57:00,040
- Did they say civilians were killed?
- They didn't do it.

625
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:04,249
Some fucked up Danish officer
had gone crazy.

626
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:08,290
According to the judge advocate's
report there was no officer.

627
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,790
They spoke of an officer called Perk.

628
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,665
Nobody believed them.
The case was closed.

629
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:22,415
But the lawyer believed them.
She asked if I would testify.

630
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:25,540
Police!
Come out, or I'll shoot!

631
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:27,165
Stay here.

632
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,540
What's happening?

633
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:39,790
Get back to Thomsen. Now!

634
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:12,332
- I stopped you.
- Were you in here?

635
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,082
No. Why?

636
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,374
Get out!

1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,832
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:14,957
My blood will be shed.
And many will die along with me.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:19,790
- What does Special Branch know?
- Raben was squad leader.

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,707
No officer Perk. No corpses.

5
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:33,499
Why didn't he pull the trigger?
He had enough time.

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:38,957
The Defense Minister
must account for

7
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:44,749
a military case,
possibly connected to the killings.

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,624
If it's true, I want it
out in the open. If not...

9
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:55,249
We got a fax from the camp
in Afghanistan.

10
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,957
There was a mismatch among
the body parts. A hand too many.

11
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:06,707
It was the hand
of the suicide bomber.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,749
- You are bound to say that!
- It's in the amended medical report!

13
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,165
This has been very taxing.

14
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:19,457
The Minister of Defense
was well prepared for the meeting.

15
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,290
Had the Prime Minister
been informed?

16
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:25,165
Of course he had!

17
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:31,624
- There was no one!
- Why would I lie?

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,749
He had a tattoo on this shoulder.
I'd recognise him on sight.

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,165
You didn't let him down.
You held out longer than most wives.

20
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,540
I want your help with something.

21
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,415
You may resume
your temporary position.

22
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:52,415
- What did Søgaard think of Raben?
- Not much. They were in deep shit.

23
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:57,124
Concerning the officer
who was sent home.

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,249
I know it was you! We came
to relieve you. You think I'm an idiot?

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,707
I was sent home because
I had a nervous breakdown.

26
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,249
Raben... Put the gun down.

27
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,790
- Perk...
- Put the gun down, now!

28
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,415
No!

29
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,332
THE KILLING

30
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,707
MONDAY, 21 NOVEMBER
7:19PM

31
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,707
Left side of the thorax.
The bullet perforated his lung.

32
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,124
- Has he eaten recently?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

33
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,082
- Is he allergic to any drugs?
- They have his medical record.

34
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,790
He needs a suction drain.
Get him ready!

35
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,790
You can't come in here.

36
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,207
They've brought the officer in
for questioning.

37
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,957
Should they start or wait for us?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,915
Is he going to be all right?

39
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,540
I had to shoot.
He was waving a gun about.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,332
- Why didn't he drop it?
- I don't know.

41
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:36,165
He was about to put it down.
Then you arrived.

42
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,999
He seemed to think
you were Perk.

43
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,832
- Where is he?
- On the operating table.

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,082
What the hell happened?

45
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,749
He took the officer hostage.
He had a gun.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,999
And then he took off.
He wouldn't put down his weapon.

47
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,874
- Who shot him?
- I did. I aimed at his arm.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,499
Put guards on Raben. No one has
access to him without asking us.

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,957
Is he going to pull through?
Why didn't he put the gun down?

50
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:15,082
I don't know.
But we got the officer.

51
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,832
Raben found him,
so he's probably the right one.

52
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,999
- Saturation?
- Pressure's falling.

53
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,999
- Ventricular defibrillation.
- More oxygen!

54
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,457
- Put the gun down, now!
- Perk...

55
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,582
Raben said the officer they
were relieving was called Perk.

56
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:51,582
Søgaard had attended Perk's funeral,
three months earlier.

57
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,999
- Didn't he think it strange?
- It couldn't be the same Perk. Why?

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:01,249
What about the radio call
the squad claimed to have received?

59
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,707
- From a Danish unit in trouble.
- None of our radios picked it up.

60
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:13,999
We're on a tight schedule. I suggest
we postpone these questions.

61
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,415
There was no officer.
We had no troops in that area.

62
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,040
No...

63
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,665
We didn't have any.

64
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:39,082
I want a transcript of all radio
communications in that area.

65
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,540
Ask Army Operational Command
to send it to us.

66
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,707
Oh, Bilal?

67
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,290
Mum's the word.

68
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,540
Something's happened to Jens.
The police called.

69
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:30,332
I'll stay with Jonas.
You'd better go immediately.

70
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,999
What's happened?

71
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,457
- What sort of alibi?
- Skåning had a nervous breakdown.

72
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,665
He flew home with Raben
and the wounded soldiers.

73
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,457
Check him again.
I'm on my way.

74
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,957
- He just came out of surgery.
- What happened?

75
00:06:55,083 --> 00:07:00,499
He took an officer hostage.
He had a gun. He tried to escape.

76
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,957
Why did you shoot?

77
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:09,415
We had a... situation.

78
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,499
He tried to take his own life.
Then he thought better of it.

79
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:21,040
But he wouldn't put down his weapon.
Excuse me. Just a moment.

80
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,582
These are his personal belongings.

81
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,124
They are questioning the officer.

82
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,915
His statement has been confirmed.

83
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,790
But it must be him.
We've checked all the rest of them.

84
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:45,374
- What did the doctor say?
- We may interview Raben tomorrow.

85
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,415
There's a problem. Raben spoke
before he was anaesthetised.

86
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:56,207
He said, repeatedly, that the policeman
who shot him was Perk.

87
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:04,749
The doctor said he was delirious,
but it'll crop up in the police inquiry.

88
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:09,290
- Is your report accurate?
- Yes, it is.

89
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,374
What exactly did the doctor say?

90
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,832
Something was not right.

91
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,790
When Raben saw Strange,
he said, "Perk!"

92
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,374
But, really...

93
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,582
He'd just been threatening
to commit suicide.

94
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,874
He was in a state.
He was completely beside himself.

95
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,832
- What does Strange say?
- What can he say?

96
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,040
- I'm on my way to HQ.
- We have to take this seriously.

97
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:54,040
When we took on Strange
a year ago, I read his CV.

98
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,249
- He was in the army for some years.
- Yes, I know. At Vordingborg.

99
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:03,040
He had back trouble.
He's hardly a suspect.

100
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,540
Strange wasn't just at Vordingborg.

101
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,790
Strange was with Special Forces.
He was an officer.

102
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,540
Shall we leave now?

103
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:25,832
Raben, the only survivor of his squad,
is in a critical condition.

104
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,999
Minister of Justice Buch
accused the Minister of Defense

105
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:36,457
of withholding information about
killings of civilians in Afghanistan.

106
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,249
The Prime Minister
has called a meeting with Buch.

107
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:46,540
- Krabbe will call me back.
- I can't keep making excuses.

108
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,207
I'm sorry I'm late,
but things are rather hectic.

109
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,165
It's all right. Have a seat.

110
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,040
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

111
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,915
I'm anxious to find the Minister
of Defense and talk things over.

112
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:14,082
- Talk what over?
- I realise I was a bit rash.

113
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,832
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
I'll offer him my apologies

114
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,957
so that we may continue
our working relationship.

115
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:28,415
And Krabbe too. The terrorism package
has put us under pressure.

116
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,207
But if I can just have
a talk with him, I'm sure...

117
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:38,915
You've been a Minister for seven days.
God created Earth in that time.

118
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,249
But you've destroyed everything.

119
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,499
Politicians must be team players.
Don't try to be a solo dancer.

120
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:51,165
All those accusations have
left you with egg on your face.

121
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,540
I've listened to you, but I'm sure
you're barking up the wrong tree.

122
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:00,749
- You will have to resign.
- But I'm not ready to resign.

123
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,290
There are far too many loose ends.

124
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,915
How did the Minister of Defense
know I'd mention that fax?

125
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,707
What fax?

126
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:18,249
The fax about the medical report
and the surplus hand.

127
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,374
Very convenient!
And I didn't tell him.

128
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,249
- Then who did?
- Shall I call Rossing over here?

129
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,624
No

130
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,082
No. Never mind.

131
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:44,290
- Will you be at the reception?
- No. I don't have time.

132
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:52,332
This is what we'll do: tomorrow,
we'll pass the terrorism package.

133
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:58,457
Then you call a press conference
as your grand finale.

134
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:05,499
Don't worry. In a few years,
you can be back on the political scene.

135
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,040
See you tomorrow.
Best regards to you family.

136
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,374
- How long were you in the SAS?
- Come on, Brix!

137
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:27,707
You'd better answer. There will be
an inquiry about the shooting.

138
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:33,124
- We have to know where we stand.
- I was in the army for a few years.

139
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,707
They asked if I'd like to join
Special Forces. And I accepted.

140
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,374
I grew tired of it and quit.
Then I applied to the Police Academy.

141
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,915
And that was the last of it?

142
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:51,332
After 9/11,
I was asked to sign up again.

143
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,374
I had a boring job in the drug squad,
so I gave it another go.

144
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,832
I quit 18 months ago
and joined the police force again.

145
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,374
Were you in Afghanistan?

146
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:10,124
Yes. Three times.
I had nothing to do with Team Ægir.

147
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,582
I was demobilised
six months before they left.

148
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,415
And I never met Jens Peter Raben.

149
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:21,874
Don't you think I'd have told you
if I had knowledge of this case?

150
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,582
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I wanted to forget about it.

151
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:34,665
My life fell apart while I was out there.
My marriage, my children.

152
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,415
It's taken me a long time
to get back on my feet.

153
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:47,124
According to Raben's hostage,
he took great interest in a certain tattoo.

154
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,707
"Ingenio et Armis."
"With cunning and weapons".

155
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,707
We're wasting time.
Why don't we question that officer?

156
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,124
He's not the one.
We sent him home.

157
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,290
Then we must have
overlooked something.

158
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,915
Just show me your shoulder.
Let's get it over with.

159
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,332
Before you handcuff me, check how
many officers have the same tattoo.

160
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:35,165
Hand over your gun and badge
until we get this matter cleared up.

161
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,957
After they've questioned you, go home
and stay there, until further notice.

162
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,124
Strange is being suspended.

163
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,124
Take over his assignment.
Report to Lund and me.

164
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,582
- OK.
- Lund will brief you.

165
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:59,374
I'll contact Special Forces.
We need a list of their officers.

166
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,957
Had he been involved,
I would have found out.

167
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,624
The case is connected to Afghanistan,
but he never let on.

168
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,499
The case took a surprising turn.

169
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,624
Until proven otherwise,
he's a suspect.

170
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,915
When he shot Raben...
Was there really no alternative?

171
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,540
No.

172
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,582
It was justifiable.

173
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:31,040
Were you with Strange
at the time of all the killings?

174
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:45,749
Either Raben is crazy, or Strange
is lying. I'd rather believe the former.

175
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,707
But you better think carefully.

176
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,582
- How is he?
- He'll sleep until tomorrow.

177
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:22,415
But he's going to be all right.
You may go in and see him.

178
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,582
I'll come back tomorrow.
Will somebody collect his clothes?

179
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,540
It's important for him to feel
that someone is there for him.

180
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,540
The doctor said
I should talk to you.

181
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,749
I don't know what to say.

182
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,999
I saw an old video this evening.

183
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,165
We were at the beach
just before Jonas was born.

184
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,040
Remember?

185
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,165
We couldn't decide
on a name for him.

186
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,665
We had written a long list of names,
but couldn't decide.

187
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,290
In the end,
you wanted to go for a swim.

188
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,040
But I didn't, because I thought
I looked like a whale.

189
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,540
But you took me in your arms and
carried me out to sea. You kissed me.

190
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,790
You said that now you knew
what his name should be.

191
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,957
He should be named Jonas

192
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,832
Because Jonas was inside the whale.

193
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,415
I'd better get home

194
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,665
No comments. Goodbye. We won't
talk to the press until we know more.

195
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:50,582
- His driver hasn't seen him.
- He left the Prime Minister an hour ago.

196
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,040
He's not answering his mobile
and his wife hasn't seen him.

197
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,249
- I hear rumours.
- Let's hear it from him.

198
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,290
Maybe he met up
with that journalist woman.

199
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:05,790
Is that the secretariat?
Plough. Our Minister is missing.

200
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,665
Could he be at a committee meeting?

201
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,540
What did you say?
Where? For how long?

202
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,874
- Never mind. Thank you.
- Thanks.

203
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,957
- Where is he?
- In the Ministry of Integration.

204
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,124
What's this?
I'd better have another one.

205
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,332
Hi there! Hello?

206
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,790
- Connie Vemmer wants to talk to you.
- Try the champagne!

207
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,457
The Minister of Defense was warned
we'd bring up that medical report.

208
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,415
What did Krabbe want?

209
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,832
They've got Raben.
He's injured, but...

210
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,540
It's over!
I'm resigning tomorrow.

211
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,832
- We can't just give up.
- Something is amiss.

212
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,999
We're in this together.
We have to keep calm.

213
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,332
The truth is we weren't up to it!

214
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,040
That's going a bit far.
Let's get back to our office.

215
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,540
You had no idea
what Monberg was up to.

216
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,749
And you even slept with him!
Bloody hell!

217
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,999
Don't go! Come back.

218
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,957
Come here, won't you?

219
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,124
I must ask you to leave.

220
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,499
Yes?

221
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,749
All right, I'm coming! Goddamn it!

222
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,207
- Will you stop that!
- Hello?

223
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:34,415
- Buch! What are you doing here?
- Sorry. We've got to talk.

224
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,957
Dig in!

225
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:43,165
- We talked about it too.
- What?

226
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:47,082
- Getting an au pair.
- That's my wife.

227
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,082
And my children.

228
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,332
What is it you want?

229
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,207
I'm sorry, if I made you confused.

230
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,707
- Why did you come?
- It was nothing.

231
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,290
I had the Prime Minister's confidence.

232
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,582
I demand to know
what you talked about.

233
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:26,915
After your TV stunt, I was furious.
The terrorism package was in ruins.

234
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:33,707
I had to call a meeting
in the party's executive committee.

235
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,249
But you're right here!

236
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:42,832
I was on my way when I heard
from the Prime Ministers' office.

237
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,707
They said the Minister of Defense
was in the clear

238
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:52,582
and the terrorism package
was up for vote tomorrow.

239
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:58,207
How could they know that,
before the Security Committee meeting?

240
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,499
I couldn't understand that either.

241
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,499
However, I've thought it over
and I think I get the picture.

242
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,207
So what, if the Prime Minister's office
had prior knowledge?

243
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,707
They knew your allegations
would be repudiated.

244
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:21,832
So they call me up, to avoid me
stirring things up within my party.

245
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,749
Or perhaps
they just lost confidence in you.

246
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:30,999
Or, as you would have it,
the Minister of Defense fucked you over.

247
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:36,332
But that doesn't mean
the Prime Minister is a villain.

248
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,832
I spoke to him this evening.
All was well.

249
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm sorry to say, I'm glad he gave you
the push. I've fought for this.

250
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,207
I'll call you a taxi.

251
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:54,665
We need to know exactly
when Strange was sent home.

252
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:59,332
- He claims it was six months before.
- They don't give out information.

253
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,165
But General Arild is coming
to see us tomorrow morning.

254
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,415
Good. About Strange's CV.
Could you send me that?

255
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,207
Thank you.

256
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,957
Lund...

257
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:27,207
Documents on the soldiers who died
on the last mission of Raben's squad.

258
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:32,999
I'd left them in the car.
You'd better take over.

259
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,415
I don't care what Brix thinks
or that nutcase Raben.

260
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:44,040
- We can't talk about the inquiry.
- What do you believe?

261
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,040
You should have told me.

262
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:56,999
Why? Did you tell me about your life
and your partner who was shot?

263
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:06,790
A detective told me you were nuts
and caused Jan Meyer's death.

264
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:10,582
I stood by you, all the time,
even though you told me nothing.

265
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,249
I told my kids about you.

266
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,207
They asked me
why I looked so happy.

267
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,582
I told them I'd met someone at work.

268
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,582
We've been very cooperative.

269
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:57,332
Your interrogations at the barracks.
And now Special Forces.

270
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,999
Were Special Forces in the area
in question two years ago?

271
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,540
- Yes, they were on missions there.
- While Team Ægir was there?

272
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:12,165
Had Ulrik Strange been demobilised
six months prior to that?

273
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:17,790
- You know I can't disclose that.
- I want a list of who was there.

274
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:22,832
I'm not at liberty
to disclose that information.

275
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,790
But no one from Special Forces
was involved in that incident.

276
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,874
Brix?

277
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:37,207
The Danish Special Forces
don't kill innocent civilians.

278
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,249
Excuse me.
We are busy deploying troops.

279
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:44,749
These soldiers were deployed too
and we need information.

280
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:51,415
The ramblings of a traumatised
soldier don't suffice.

281
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:57,874
And how could Jens Peter Raben
elude Special Branch?

282
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,207
This is the score.
Either you give me what I need

283
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,374
or I'll raise the question
with the press.

284
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,499
Why won't you assist us
in solving this case?

285
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:15,124
Get my drift? Or shall I find
someone who is "at liberty"?

286
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:25,290
Evidently, this information is important.
I'll see what I can do.

287
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,207
Jens Peter Raben has woken up.

288
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,957
He wants to be questioned, immediately.
Without an attorney.

289
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:41,790
We did surgery on your artery.
Take care or you could die.

290
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:49,874
Wait. Wait a minute.
I'll find someone to get you ready.

291
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,374
I'm sorry to have caused you
embarrassment.

292
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,374
You should know
that I liked being here.

293
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,082
I hope you will be just
as helpful to my successor...

294
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:15,124
...whoever he may be.

295
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,082
Thank you.

296
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,582
Today's schedule.

297
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,207
The Prime Minister's office
expects you

298
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,582
to give the usual speech
and to be present.

299
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:37,290
- About Jens Peter Raben...
- Forget it.

300
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:43,540
I'd like to apologise
for my behaviour last night.

301
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:49,332
You were there for me all along.
This cock-up is my responsibility.

302
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,415
This is the best solution for
the Government and the Ministry.

303
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:59,374
I wish you all the best.
There you are.

304
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,749
And for you...

305
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:07,374
Excuse me, I have to answer this.

306
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,624
- Was it the wrong Armagnac?
- No, it's fine.

307
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,124
Plough has worries of his own.

308
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:22,499
He's been called to a meeting
in the Prime Minister's office.

309
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,415
They want to appoint him
as an EU consultant in Skopje.

310
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,082
If Plough goes, I go too.
But that's fine by me.

311
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:36,624
The journalist woman
told me she'll explain it all

312
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,249
but only to you, personally.
I really think, you...

313
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:45,624
I'll talk to the Prime Minister
about your future careers.

314
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,249
I'll put it right.
See you downstairs.

315
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,999
We never should have backed him up.

316
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:04,040
They just called me back.
Skopje it is. EU consultant.

317
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:08,915
- After 23 years, I end up in Skopje.
- Not necessarily.

318
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,707
What am I to tell my wife?

319
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,582
Where is Skopje anyway?
Do we have an atlas?

320
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:20,665
Listen to me! Perhaps your wife
gets to stay in Denmark.

321
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,749
At 9:32am we got a message
from a Danish unit under fire.

322
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,957
We crossed the river,
and there was a foul-up.

323
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,457
Thomsen may have told you
what happened.

324
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,999
We reached the village
and fought our way into the building.

325
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,124
But there was no Danish unit.

326
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,707
Just one officer, who had ensconced
himself with a local family.

327
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,749
Why did you think he was called Perk?

328
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,665
He said so. I saw his dog tag.

329
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:58,749
I'd never seen him before. I assumed
he was from another Danish camp.

330
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:05,832
- How had he ended up there?
- He'd been cut off from his squad.

331
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:11,707
The Taliban were hounding him.
He sought refuge in the building.

332
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:21,582
There were only four of us left.
Myg, HC, Sebastian and myself.

333
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:26,374
And Perk. Dolmer had been killed
as we forced our way in.

334
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,499
Grüner's leg was shot to bits.

335
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,957
He was in urgent need of help.
But we were under fire.

336
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,749
And we'd left the radio with Thomsen.

337
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:40,374
- What about Perk's radio?
- He said it had been blown to bits.

338
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,915
He decided we'd better wait

339
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,624
than fight our way out.

340
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,957
So that's what we did.
The shooting continued.

341
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:55,790
The next day, the heat got to us.
There wasn't enough water.

342
00:31:55,916 --> 00:32:00,665
The stench was unbearable.
Time went by, but no help arrived.

343
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:05,957
Perk became tense.
He wanted to find a way to get away.

344
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:14,790
He wanted the father
to help him get hold of a radio.

345
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,165
But the father said
he didn't know of any.

346
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:23,499
Perk fetched one of the children.
A little girl.

347
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,165
He held a pistol to her head.

348
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:31,124
He asked the father if he'd rather
help the Taliban than us.

349
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,457
And then he fired.

350
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,832
He grabbed hold of the children's
mother and shot her too.

351
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,165
The father held the youngest, a boy,
and begged for them to be spared.

352
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,957
Perk shot them both.

353
00:32:55,416 --> 00:33:09,957
What did you do?

354
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,457
I held the first child.

355
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,665
The little girl.

356
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:24,665
- I never thought he'd shoot.
- What did the others do?

357
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,582
Everybody was shouting.

358
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,374
Sebastian was crying.

359
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,874
Would that be Sebastian Holst?

360
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,082
The youngest of us.

361
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,040
He took more interest
in his camera than in his gun.

362
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,665
I put my arms around him
and made him calm down.

363
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:54,124
When darkness fell, we suddenly
heard the sound of an engine.

364
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,832
A man drove his moped into
the courtyard and blew himself up.

365
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,915
I don't remember much more.
They came to our aid soon after.

366
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,290
- Where was Perk at that time?
- I don't know.

367
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:14,749
He must have found a way out
just before help arrived.

368
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:19,707
- And the bodies of the family?
- He must have got rid of them.

369
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,124
Ask him!

370
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,082
Perk is the policeman
who shot me yesterday.

371
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,582
- Where is he?
- Why do you think it was him?

372
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:36,249
It is him. He killed the others.
He has a tattoo on his shoulder.

373
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:42,207
You were equally convinced that
the officer you took hostage was Perk.

374
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:53,249
I'd like you to look at these.
Just take your time.

375
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:12,207
Raben has cause to tell that tale.
He's facing several charges.

376
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:18,749
- Could Strange have been there?
- They haven't confirmed it yet.

377
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,790
But Raben is mentally unstable.
We have written proof of that.

378
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,207
He may have confused Strange
with another Special Forces officer.

379
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:36,665
We are checking that.
Strange has been investigating the case.

380
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:40,207
He's had no time
to play Muslim League.

381
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,832
In the course of last week
his alibi is incomplete.

382
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:50,082
Before we got to Myg Poulsen,
more than an hour had passed.

383
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,665
Grüner was burnt in a fire
triggered by a mobile phone

384
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,624
whose owner we can't find.

385
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:05,915
I met with Strange before we left
for the multi-storey car park.

386
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,540
In Sweden he'd left a bit, while
I was questioning Lisbeth Thomsen.

387
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:19,749
And he was at the barracks,
the night the explosives were stolen.

388
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:26,040
But when you found the chaplain
in the church, Strange was in Helsingør.

389
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,999
Has that been checked?

390
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:32,790
I saw them return
but I'll have it checked.

391
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,624
I'm going to see
Sebastian Holst's parents.

392
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,207
We've looked though his photos.
There was no officer.

393
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:48,040
He always had his camera with him
but it was never found.

394
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:53,749
- What shall we do with Strange?
- Bring him in for questioning.

395
00:36:56,416 --> 00:37:02,290
Our superiors will want to know
why you took him on.

396
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,415
I didn't actually appoint him.

397
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:10,457
Strange came to our department
in connection with the police reform.

398
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:15,915
If anyone, our superiors will
be washing their hands of him.

399
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,457
Thank you. Bye.

400
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,290
He's asked to see me. I'm going now.

401
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,165
They've already questioned him.
Don't forget to pack those.

402
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,707
- Let me know if I can help.
- Why?

403
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:41,999
He's under arrest, facing charges.
Isn't that what you wanted?

404
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:49,499
Here is the programme
for the ceremony.

405
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:53,915
I'll leave it to you. I'll attend,
but I'd like you to make a speech.

406
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:59,415
- Anything else?
- Yes.

407
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:05,665
Operational Command asked about
the transcript of the radio message.

408
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,749
I told them you'd want a printout
as well as a computer file.

409
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,957
- Why do you need it?
- Just take care of the ceremony.

410
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:28,999
There will be a short break
in the third reading before the vote.

411
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:33,082
At the press conference
afterwards, Buch will resign.

412
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:37,290
Here's the man himself.
May we have a comment?

413
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,040
- Do you have a moment?
- Of course.

414
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:52,499
A silly mistake.
Plough has been given the slip.

415
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:57,540
That's no mistake. We need
to signal a new beginning.

416
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:01,332
- Get rid of the skeletons.
- But I'm the one, who...

417
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:05,249
The Prime Minister tells me
you apologised.

418
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,790
I'm glad to hear it.
No hard feelings.

419
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:13,124
We'll work things out.
However, in for a penny, in for a pound.

420
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,957
Did you see our draft for your
speech at the press conference?

421
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:22,499
- Yes, thank you.
- Excuse me. I must talk to him.

422
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,999
Plough. Everything is ready for
the press conference in an hour or two.

423
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,874
Your wife has turned up.
Karina has gone to receive her.

424
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,290
- My wife?
- I said you'd meet her outside.

425
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,082
Where is she?

426
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,540
We must talk about
the medical reports.

427
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,082
Get in.
We'll go for a drive.

428
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,290
You think I was running errands
for the Minister of Defense.

429
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,290
I got kicked out.
If he knew about it in advance

430
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:26,457
one of your people must have
tipped him off. Never mind that.

431
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:31,415
It was right under your nose,
all along.

432
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,082
Why didn't you check the dates
on the two medical reports?

433
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,707
What dates?

434
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:53,749
I believe Sebastian always
had his camera with him.

435
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,957
He was always taking pictures.

436
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:01,290
There's a whole box of pictures.
You've seen them.

437
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:06,124
Did they say why his camera
was missing two years ago?

438
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,874
- It wasn't. He'd sent it home.
- He'd sent his camera home?

439
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,790
Yes, it was broken.
He asked me to repair it.

440
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:32,040
- Why do you ask?
- I won't trouble you any further.

441
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:36,582
I heard on the radio that you've
found his squad leader, Raben.

442
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:40,249
I expect the whole business
will be stirred up again.

443
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,874
What do you know of it?

444
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,957
I don't think it was an officer.

445
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:52,874
They made that up, as an excuse
for heading out to that building.

446
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,207
It was Raben's fault Sebastian
and the others were killed.

447
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,165
Why do you think so?

448
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,540
Sebastian predicted it.

449
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,915
I've lost both my sons
to a war I don't understand.

450
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:22,124
One came home in a coffin.
The other just went back.

451
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:29,457
I've no idea what we did wrong.

452
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,915
Is there anything
you haven't told us about?

453
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:45,040
- A video diary.
- I'd like to see it.

454
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,707
I'd like you to sign
your written statement.

455
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:54,624
- I'm allowed to see my wife.
- She's waiting outside.

456
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,374
You'll be taken back to hospital.
You have five minutes.

457
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:32,582
- May we have a bit of privacy?
- I'm afraid not.

458
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,999
Come and sit down.

459
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,540
You've heard what happened yesterday.
I was beside myself.

460
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,999
It won't happen again.

461
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:58,332
- We'll talk about it later.
- I let you down.

462
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,707
I wasn't ready.
A rotten boyfriend, a rotten father.

463
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,874
If only I could turn back the clock.

464
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,915
But things are looking up.
They listen to me now.

465
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,082
You and Jonas
mean everything to me.

466
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,624
- We can work things out.
- I'm seeing Søgaard now.

467
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:41,415
It's got nothing to do with him.
I missed you, every single day.

468
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,165
I just can't stand it any longer...

469
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:55,832
Can't you see? It's no use.

470
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:02,624
- We want you in for questioning.
- Just a minute.

471
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,915
Sorry...

472
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,499
Can I see my wife?

473
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:17,249
- Do you want a lawyer?
- No. I want to see my wife!

474
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:23,957
Sebastian Holst sent a video diary
home, shortly before his death.

475
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:31,665
Don't get worried, but something
is not right in our squad.

476
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:38,332
- Why must I see this?
- Raben is the worst off.

477
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:46,749
He sees Taliban everywhere,
and thinks only of killing.

478
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:52,124
He runs too many risks. Makes us
do things we're not ordered to do.

479
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,332
He fabricates messages,
just to get out and "kick ass".

480
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,832
This morning, we crossed the river
to raid a house for the third time

481
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:08,040
because Raben thinks
the father is Taliban.

482
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:15,165
We took the place apart. Raben
accused him of being an informer.

483
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:18,040
He poked his gun in his face.

484
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,332
For no reason.

485
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:28,915
The children were crying. The mother
and old women were crying.

486
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:34,499
Raben is running wild.
He wants to do it again.

487
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:40,332
I try to talk to the others,
but they say everything will be fine.

488
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,790
They don't want to cross him.

489
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,832
But I suppose
he knows what he's doing.

490
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:52,707
And he's the best man to be with,
when the shit hits the fan.

491
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,165
In a couple of weeks we'll be home,
so it'll all work out.

492
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:05,499
I miss you. See you soon.

493
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,749
I'll give your love
to Big Brother. Bye.

494
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,707
Is it true, what he's saying?

495
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:28,124
Sebastian was only there
to compete with his elder brother.

496
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:32,749
It's not about Sebastian,
but the officer.

497
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:35,207
The family he mentioned...

498
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:39,040
Is it the same family
you claim was killed?

499
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,165
Yes.

500
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,915
You and the squad had been
at the family's house several times?

501
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:52,124
You were convinced they were Taliban.
You wanted to go again.

502
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,915
- That's irrelevant.
- No. It isn't.

503
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,665
There is no indication
of your receiving any message.

504
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,957
And there was
no officer called Perk.

505
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,415
I've explained everything.

506
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,582
Look at these.
Five people have been killed.

507
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:20,374
I've done everything I can
to find that officer.

508
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,207
If you are lying,
and he doesn't exist

509
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,749
now is the time to admit it!

510
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:38,582
It was my decision to enter
the village. The others didn't agree.

511
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,540
I should have listened to them.
But there was an officer.

512
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,415
And he's the one I saw yesterday.

513
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,040
We just received documentation
from the army to the effect that

514
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,665
the person you identified
as the officer in question

515
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:04,499
was not in Afghanistan at the time.

516
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,999
What about Sebastian's elder brother?
Do you know him?

517
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:20,915
- He's a doctor. He was in our camp.
- An army surgeon? What's his name?

518
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,165
Frederik. Frederik Holst.

519
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:36,040
Frederik Holst, army surgeon.
We need to pay him a visit.

520
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:40,874
Ask the father what the elder
brother said about Raben's squad.

521
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:48,915
The Minister just popped out.
He'll be back soon.

522
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:52,415
What did she say?

523
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:56,790
I'm sorry I tricked you.
But you needed to see Vemmer.

524
00:49:56,916 --> 00:50:01,207
We realise
you can't tell us everything.

525
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:05,415
Even if you don't act upon it,
you should have the information.

526
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:10,790
I've resigned myself
to going to Skopje.

527
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:14,124
If you decide to act,
you must go the whole hog.

528
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,957
- How far have they got?
- The vote starts in ten minutes.

529
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,499
- Is Krabbe there?
- Yes.

530
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,999
But he's got nothing to do with it.

531
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,999
Krabbe?

532
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:52,665
- Krabbe? Is that you?
- Bloody hell!

533
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:57,457
If you want to talk to me,
you can call my secretary.

534
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:03,165
The medical report about the
surplus hand was faxed in August.

535
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:09,749
The revised medical report
didn't arrive until October.

536
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:15,790
First, there's one report,
implying that civilians were killed.

537
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:19,874
What a pathetic attempt
to cling to office!

538
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,499
In spite of the obvious, nobody
acted upon it, for two months.

539
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,915
There was no cause. It was
the hand of the suicide bomber.

540
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:34,999
Why didn't they say anything?
What were they up to?

541
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,332
When the first report arrived

542
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:40,624
the Prime Minister
was proposing extra appropriation

543
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,499
in order to step up
our military effort in Afghanistan.

544
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:48,457
It was promptly approved
when Parliament opened in October.

545
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:53,165
You and your party
voted in favour of it.

546
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,999
This proves nothing.
Pure speculation.

547
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:04,124
- Why would the Prime Minister...?
- That's what happened, damn it!

548
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:09,499
Go ahead and push for a strict
terrorism package, if you like.

549
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:12,957
But it's going to affect
the wrong people.

550
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:18,457
I'm asking you to help me
do something about it.

551
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,207
We got them sent off
in high spirits.

552
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:38,582
You never told me of the message
we received five days earlier.

553
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:47,207
Yes, we got a message.
In August two years ago.

554
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,665
Five days before the incident.

555
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,332
From a Special Forces unit.

556
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,165
I don't understand.

557
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:04,124
They were only 150km from
where Raben's squad ended up.

558
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:10,415
- I never saw that message.
- You were in command.

559
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,624
What do you mean?

560
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,707
Raben's squad said someone was there.
We didn't believe them.

561
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:23,874
- We said they were seeing ghosts.
- So they were. This proves nothing.

562
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,749
- Why didn't you mention it?
- I have no knowledge of this.

563
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:34,582
If an official complaint has been filed,
I'd like to see it.

564
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,415
- I'm leaving for the airport.
- No.

565
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:42,707
Stay at the barracks
until further notice. Understood?

566
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:51,874
I'm glad you came.
I was about to call you.

567
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,999
You've been out all day.

568
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:59,540
Raben's squad
could have been right.

569
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:05,832
There was radio contact
with a Danish unit five days before.

570
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:12,999
- We must tell the police.
- They're focused on Special Forces.

571
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,915
But why are you so concerned?

572
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,290
Søgaard may have
withheld information.

573
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:24,332
I was in Kabul. He was in command.

574
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:28,624
Something is amiss,
but Søgaard isn't the problem.

575
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,957
Did you help Raben
elude Special Branch?

576
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:41,790
I gave you confidential information
about his surveillance.

577
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:48,915
I've been tipped off that you
met with him shortly after that.

578
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:53,999
This is important information
which we need to investigate.

579
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:58,499
- Can't we leave the...?
- Torsten, just answer me!

580
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:01,290
Did you help Raben or not?

581
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,582
When?

582
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,290
Yes. Right. Thanks.

583
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:17,415
The elder brother is in Afghanistan.

584
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,957
He only left yesterday.

585
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:25,124
He was home on a three week leave.
We found this.

586
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:47,082
We must question him.
Get us on the soldiers' flight tonight.

587
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:56,915
- What the hell are you saying?
- We've been wasting time.

588
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,457
Frederik Holst
saw his brother's video diary.

589
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:05,540
He was at the field hospital, when
they brought in his brother's body.

590
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:10,832
We need to get permission.
I'll ask Hedeby to...

591
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:13,874
That will take days!
We can't wait for that.

592
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:23,957
I need a copy of the medical reports.

593
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:29,957
- Are you travelling as a tourist?
- You can fix it if you want to.

594
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:33,457
You have connections.

595
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:36,165
Don't tell me Ruth Hedeby
is wearing the trousers.

596
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:42,415
Right! TNT, tetryl, RDX.
You name it

597
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,124
And fireworks for New Year's Eve.

598
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:10,999
My partner... Jan Meyer.

599
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,957
We arrived at a warehouse.

600
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:25,749
I went inside. I didn't think
there was anyone in the building.

601
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,040
Then Meyer went inside.

602
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:39,832
I should have stopped him.
It was my mistake.

603
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:50,290
We caught the perpetrator.
But it seemed... unimportant.

604
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,957
I shut myself down.

605
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,999
I got that job in Gedser
and it suited me fine.

606
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:03,040
I wanted to hide myself away.

607
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:15,165
If you hadn't turned up with word
from Brix, I'd still be there.

608
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,332
I'm sorry.

609
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:37,540
Now what?

610
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,499
We have to leave.

611
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,874
Where to?

612
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,040
They didn't let me get my jacket
when they dragged me in here.

613
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,665
Then you'd better fetch it.

614
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:56,540
Coming?

615
00:58:57,375 --> 00:59:02,665
Frederik Holst's CV.
A warrant for his arrest. Contacts.

616
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:07,415
Strange, you be pathfinder.
You stop over in Istanbul.

617
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:11,749
I'll forward your visas
and documents by fax.

618
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:16,915
You fly with the army's aircraft
to Afghanistan under their command.

619
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:20,374
Follow their instructions.
Get that, Lund?

620
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,249
In 36 hours you'll be back here.

621
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,582
Take care.

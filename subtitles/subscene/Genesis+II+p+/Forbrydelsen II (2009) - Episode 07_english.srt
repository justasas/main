1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,749
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,540
My blood will be shed.
And many will die along with me.

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:19,290
- What do you have on the squad?
- Raben was squad leader.

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:24,124
- Nobody called Perk, no corpses!
- They had a lieutenant called Perk.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,124
- That coffin is empty!
- Clear your desk.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,165
- Return to your work in Gedser.
- I'm sorry, it...

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:39,790
- Four dead, and we do nothing.
- What the hell is going on?

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,665
It's best the Prime Minister
knows nothing.

9
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:49,290
Thomas has 24 hours
to look into certain matters.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,499
- He would never harm the priest.
- What did Dragsholm know?

11
00:00:54,625 --> 00:01:00,457
- Myg talked about that officer.
- Find Sarah Lund!

12
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:06,915
You signed up when Jonas was born.
Don't come to see us, ever again!

13
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,082
Why not arrest him?

14
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,582
- Raben is the only survivor.
- Live bait.

15
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:20,082
- Did you know Anne Dragsholm?
- No. And I've never seen that card.

16
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,582
- We must check the priest. Lund...
- Lund no longer works here.

17
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:30,790
- Karina! Why ruin your career?
- I spoke with Monberg's wife.

18
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:36,040
He has regained consciousness
We must get to him before Rossing.

19
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:40,665
- You want to put the blame on me!
- What did Rossing say?

20
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,915
- Another visitor?
- Right. I need rest.

21
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:50,290
Who had the coffin exhumed?
What about this Raben?

22
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:55,832
He had reason to escape. He was
turned down by the Probation Service.

23
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,165
You'll take the blame, not Rossing.

24
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,082
- What did Dragsholm say?
- She'd found the officer.

25
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,665
Krabbe told the PM, "Either you resign,
or the Government falls".

26
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,332
Who brought these flowers?

27
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:15,124
- Perk's dog tag was never found.
- What?

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,040
- We must talk to the priest.
- Ask Brix.

29
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:24,124
The priest's fingerprints are on
the calling card. He denied seeing it.

30
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,415
I need an ambulance at St Simon's
Church. He's still breathing, but...

31
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,874
THE KILLING

32
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,249
SUNDAY, 20 NOVEMBER
6:11 PM

33
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,165
Arrest the priest.
Charge him with obstruction.

34
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,707
He claimed he didn't know the lawyer.
Why did he lie?

35
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,832
- Lund, I'll call you...
- The priest is badly wounded.

36
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:30,915
The ambulance is coming.
I'm in pursuit of the suspect.

37
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:36,707
He can't be far away.
Send backup, all you've got!

38
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,040
- Stay there. We're coming.
- Talk to the priest. He saw him.

39
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,665
Lund. You're off the case.
Don't do any more. Get it?

40
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,457
Yes.
No, wait...

41
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,707
You are not to do anything!

42
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,082
Lund!

43
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:48,249
Former Minister of Justice Frode
Monberg passed away this evening.

44
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,832
He was hospitalised, following
a heart attack last week.

45
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:58,624
Frode Monberg was
Minister of Justice for nine years.

46
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,582
His successor, Thomas Buch,
had just visited him...

47
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,582
The Prime Minister
has called a meeting

48
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,374
about the People's Party's threats.

49
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:21,165
If you hadn't pressured Monberg,
he'd never have admitted anything.

50
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,249
- How much did you pressure him?
- He did what was necessary.

51
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:31,665
You weren't present.
Buch! What exactly happened?

52
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:36,165
This mess is Monberg's fault.
At least he's party to it.

53
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,332
We mustn't let the Defense Minister
get away with it.

54
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,957
Monberg can't confirm anything.

55
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,832
We must focus on the meeting.

56
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:55,499
Krabbe and the Defense Minister
will take over the terrorism package.

57
00:08:55,625 --> 00:09:01,957
If the People's Party gets the better
of you now, all will be lost.

58
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,665
The Prime Minister's office called
to say the meeting has started.

59
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,790
- We should wait for instructions.
- We have to stop the meeting.

60
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:17,207
You can't just do that.
I need to know more about Monberg.

61
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,499
Why did you leave him?

62
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,582
What did you say to him?

63
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,999
I'm shocked by the loss
of a good colleague

64
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:34,165
a great political personality,
and, above all, a dear friend.

65
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,374
It is a great loss, at a time when
our country faces serious problems.

66
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,665
- Don't defend him!
- I want to know what happened.

67
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:50,749
He chose to die, because he
couldn't face an impeachment!

68
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,999
Call in the press. Straight away!

69
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,124
With all due respect,
you have better candidates than him.

70
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,957
Possibly, but Buch is my Minister.
The People's Party should leave off.

71
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,082
We'll see
what's decided this evening.

72
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,957
We can alter the terrorism package
to suit the People's Party.

73
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,582
- But without Buch, of course.
- I'd rather get rid of him.

74
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,499
We don't fire a Minister
after one week.

75
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:28,790
Buch has been hindered
by irregularities on Monberg's part.

76
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:33,999
- What irregularities?
- No need to talk about that now.

77
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,665
Frode wasn't quite
master of the situation.

78
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:43,332
- We can look into the matter later.
- The problems must be solved.

79
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:49,249
But it causes me some concern
that new surprises keep turning up.

80
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,499
Rumours about this, that,
and the other.

81
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,415
And now there is talk of some
old army case. What's that about?

82
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:02,374
- Do you listen to such nonsense?
- You just set my mind at ease.

83
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,582
Let's get that terrorism package passed.
Then things will settle down.

84
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,040
...very critical questions
to the Ministry of Defense.

85
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:17,457
I demand a report
from the Defense Minister

86
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,624
concerning a military case

87
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,499
which may be connected
to the recent killings.

88
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:31,165
Evidently, the Defense Minister
has withheld information

89
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,165
to cover up his own negligence.

90
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:39,874
My predecessor Frode Monberg
confirmed my suspicions.

91
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,665
That's all I can say at present.

92
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,790
We'll keep the press informed.

93
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,832
What did the Defense Minister do?

94
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,332
Who is behind the killings?

95
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,874
Have you informed
the Prime Minister?

96
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:00,582
Is this what you mean
by everything settling down?

97
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:07,749
Lund surprised him, pursued him,
and they ended up here.

98
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,790
No, it's in there.

99
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:15,332
- Did the priest say anything?
- No. He was unconscious.

100
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,499
He died on his way to hospital.

101
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,957
- He was beaten to death.
- What did Lund say?

102
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,707
We should look for the dog tag of
the exhumed soldier. It was missing.

103
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:33,207
- I haven't followed up on that.
- Well, then do it!

104
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,832
Call his mother.
Find out if there was a dog tag.

105
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,749
- Where is she?
- At the Emergency Ward.

106
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:47,832
She's to be debriefed at HQ.

107
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,374
We need to talk. Right now!

108
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,124
Didn't you see his face?
Any special characteristics?

109
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,915
No. I told you.

110
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,290
Why didn't you call earlier?

111
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,040
You'd been taken off the case.

112
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,957
Are you all right?

113
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:29,124
I'll drive you home.
Should I call anybody?

114
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,915
No, I'm not going home.

115
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,624
My mother is getting married.

116
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,749
Some wedding guests
are staying over.

117
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,790
Come on.

118
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,040
Let's go.

119
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,082
The exhumation was a bit much,
but we were on to something.

120
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:08,249
- No comments. Goodbye.
- His dog tag was never found.

121
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:13,415
Not now.
Someone misused his identity.

122
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:18,040
Why was Lund in that church?
If you've gone behind my back...

123
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:23,332
No. Special Branch is mistaken.
We must talk to König.

124
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:28,332
König is busy. The Minister of Justice
made an announcement.

125
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,540
And Raben is on his way
to the officers academy.

126
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,165
Special Branch will take action.

127
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,707
Why don't you trust me, for once?

128
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:50,249
I'm not saying I'm always right.
Neither is Lund.

129
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,665
You should have
more confidence in me

130
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:58,165
after all our nightly rendezvous
in random hotel rooms.

131
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,707
I can work around König.

132
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,040
Yes. All right.
I'll see what I can do about it.

133
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,707
Are many soldiers opting out?

134
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,874
Yes, but we'll sort that out.

135
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,540
The only surviving member
of the squad is your son-in-law.

136
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,165
Your former son-in-law.

137
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,790
What do the police say
about his involvement?

138
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,415
I don't know much about it.

139
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,207
- How was your hunting season?
- I haven't been hunting much.

140
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:50,332
If he attacked the army chaplain,
he must be quite mad.

141
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,540
Yes...

142
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,665
- Good evening. Sorry I'm late.
- Søgaard!

143
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,957
- I didn't think you were coming.
- I see you haven't left me much.

144
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,624
I think Søgaard was
about to ask me to dance.

145
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,415
Yes, of course.

146
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,790
I'm sorry, Torsten.
But I'm prying into this affair

147
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:33,165
because they are about to catch Raben.
That's confidential.

148
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,999
Army Intelligence
knows Raben's whereabouts.

149
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,457
Special Branch is watching him,
hoping to find the killers.

150
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,582
Excuse me. Jarnvig speaking.

151
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,040
But what do the police say?

152
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,665
OK. Thanks, Bilal.

153
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:23,207
If you do as I say and tell the truth,
you may return to the ball.

154
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,415
You covered up for
an officer called Perk.

155
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:32,249
He had a dog tag on with that name,
but who was he?

156
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:39,624
- There was no officer.
- The army chaplain told me about it.

157
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,999
What? I just heard the priest
was found killed, this evening.

158
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:54,124
- You need help.
- I want to see the personnel files.

159
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,790
I don't have them.
They are at the personnel office.

160
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,165
And you are being watched
by Special Branch.

161
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,165
- Give yourself up.
- Are the files at Holmen?

162
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:10,707
Special Branch believes
you'll lead them to the killers.

163
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:37,832
Don't! You're only making things worse.
I'll go with you. OK?

164
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,415
- We'll have a quiet talk.
- Keep your mouth shut!

165
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,915
I was coming home.

166
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,874
I had only two weeks to go.

167
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,665
And now it's been two years.

168
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:59,082
- You could have investigated it.
- There was nothing to investigate.

169
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,249
You ruined everything, for yourself,
for Louise, for Jonas.

170
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:10,207
- What were you thinking?
- Why should I be lying?

171
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,415
Why should anybody?
I tried to stop him.

172
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,207
It was as easy
as blowing out a candle.

173
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:26,582
He had the officers' academy logo
tattooed on his shoulder.

174
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,957
I could recognise him on sight.

175
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:39,207
There is a back entrance.
It leads out into the garden.

176
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,165
The toilets are
at the end of the hallway.

177
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,665
That's all I could do.
I wanted to prevent...

178
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:11,290
I'll let you in on a secret.
I didn't hesitate to appoint you

179
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:16,374
I knew I could trust you.
Nothing in your political past suggests

180
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,332
that you would stab
your own Government in the back.

181
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,624
Your accusations
cannot be retracted.

182
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,040
I don't wish to retract them.
I want the matter to be cleared up.

183
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:38,707
There is no documentation.
Rossing is my trusted Minister.

184
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:44,624
Just let me ask him those questions
before the Security Committee.

185
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,040
I have no choice, now that you've
handed out tickets to the press.

186
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,915
I don't suppose you realise
what you've started.

187
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,957
If there is anything amiss,
I want it out in the open.

188
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,832
But if it's pure speculation...

189
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,040
I won't betray your trust.
Things are looking up.

190
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,999
They found him in his church.
He died in the ambulance.

191
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,915
Former field chaplain.

192
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:29,290
That makes it five people killed.
Unless we count Monberg, too.

193
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,665
- No dog tag?
- Yes.

194
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:36,415
But the killer was interrupted
by the police woman. He dropped it.

195
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,957
- By Lund?
- Yes.

196
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:44,874
The priest was on Team Ægir
and knew the first victim, Dragsholm.

197
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,832
Maybe all the victims knew
about the incident in Afghanistan.

198
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:54,665
All was investigated and reported,
according to procedure.

199
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,415
Nothing points towards
the killing of civilians.

200
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,874
Maybe they're taking extra care
for a reason.

201
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:08,415
- No more sweets. I'll have a pear.
- We must look at the case once more.

202
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:13,165
Do we know anyone
inside the Ministry of Defense

203
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,457
who bears a grudge
against Rossing?

204
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:21,457
I'd like to know what is uncovered
regarding that officer.

205
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:28,249
Lund is not on the case anymore.
It's Special Branch's investigation.

206
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,207
- And what do they say?
- They're following Monberg's lead.

207
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,415
But they're not sure
it's relevant to the investigation.

208
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:43,124
Isn't it odd that the soldier's
dog tag was never found?

209
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,665
No, not really. And it doesn't mean
that there are crooks in the army.

210
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:53,874
Nothing indicates that
fundamentalists are behind it.

211
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,790
- Only what we found at Kodmani's.
- That may belong to Faith Fellow.

212
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,040
Ruth Hedeby speaking

213
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,665
Yes?

214
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:10,832
Why aren't we investigating
the army and Team Ægir?

215
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,999
Stop it. I don't want
to wrestle with you.

216
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:19,040
Let us have Raben in
for questioning.

217
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:24,124
It will have to wait.
He seems to have escaped.

218
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,790
We are looking for him.
And we'll find him.

219
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,624
We are still working
on different theories.

220
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,624
Have a little confidence in me.

221
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,582
Damn it, Lennart. If I knew
there was something to hide

222
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,624
would I be sitting here,
lying to you?

223
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,749
That was the Ministry of Justice.

224
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,290
They wish to inform us about
Buch's talk with his predecessor.

225
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:59,207
Monberg saw the first victim,
Anne Dragsholm.

226
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:05,540
She found the officer
the squad was referring to.

227
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:16,040
That is not confirmed. We don't know,
if there even was an incident.

228
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:20,999
The Ministry of Justice is adamant.
They want everything out in the open.

229
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:27,540
If there are any obstructions,
the Minister wants to know.

230
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,582
You forgot your...

231
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:04,040
Thanks. That leaves
only one matter to discuss.

232
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:09,249
No. Lund is not coming back.

233
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:15,457
Have you decided?

234
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:20,457
Yes. Number 38.
With extra cheese.

235
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:24,290
And a number 38
with extra cheese.

236
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,540
Yes, please.

237
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,124
Sì, sì!

238
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:37,207
- How is your head?
- I took some painkillers.

239
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:41,249
- I can manage.
- You can't see what you're doing.

240
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,332
It looks fine.

241
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,915
Yes, I know it stings.

242
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:01,957
- I don't understand.
- What?

243
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,957
Why didn't he pull the trigger?

244
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:14,499
- Never mind that now.
- No. He had enough time.

245
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,165
It won't happen again.
I promise you that.

246
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,665
Damn, that was quick!

247
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,124
- It's for you.
- For me?

248
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,457
Excuse the intrusion.
I won't take much of your time.

249
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,332
Lennart... Brix
can fill you in on the details.

250
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,457
We were a bit rash, it seems.

251
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:57,749
You may return to your
temporary position, as of now.

252
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,374
This is due
to developments in the case

253
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,249
and a change of attitude
in the Ministry of Justice.

254
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,790
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

255
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:15,374
I want a guarantee that I can stay
on the case until it's closed.

256
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,832
- It's my case, I work with Strange.
- Fine, if you can agree.

257
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:26,082
No restrictions. All Team Ægir's
officers are to be questioned.

258
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,332
Fine. Then that's how it will be.

259
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:39,082
And stop the tail on Raben.
I want him in for questioning.

260
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,624
Raben got away.

261
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,249
I'm sorry,
but that's how it is.

262
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:03,374
- Where am I to sleep?
- The food is on its way.

263
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,874
- I'll save mine till tomorrow.
- OK.

264
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:18,665
Lund never saw his face,
but we have a theory.

265
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,874
He was one of Team Ægir's officers.

266
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,999
The team was led by 28 officers,

267
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,665
all of whom are suspects.

268
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:32,374
Get them in for questioning,
no matter where they are.

269
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,165
Per K. Møller's dog tag
was never found.

270
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:39,624
We have reason to believe
somebody used his identity.

271
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:46,999
We must check these bills
for items ordered in this name.

272
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:53,707
Anne Dragsholm found the officer
who called himself Perk.

273
00:29:56,041 --> 00:30:00,207
We must be able to find out
how she found him.

274
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,540
Special Branch's report on
who came and went at the ball.

275
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:13,999
- What do they say about Raben?
- He abandoned the car he came in.

276
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:18,874
After the ball, he disappeared.
His wife and the Colonel were there.

277
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,457
- But they didn't necessarily meet.
- He is looking for the same.

278
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:29,499
What are we to do
about the Ministers?

279
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:34,207
- We should have a talk...
- Hold your horses.

280
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:49,499
- Did you check Søgaard's past?
- Yes. Very interesting.

281
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:55,665
We are sending a new team to war.
This is very disturbing.

282
00:30:55,791 --> 00:31:01,790
Where were you yesterday evening
from 5:00 to 9:00, before the ball?

283
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:09,415
One of my officers needed
to have a talk before leaving.

284
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,374
Who was it?

285
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:23,499
Call him. You won't have the chance
for the next six months.

286
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:29,832
- You called the army chaplain. Why?
- I had nothing to do with his death.

287
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:33,290
Were you afraid
that he should tell tales?

288
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,749
Raben had attacked him.

289
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:44,040
Dragsholm contacted the priest
about the old military case.

290
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,415
- I wasn't aware of that.
- That case bothered you.

291
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,915
You called Raben
unpatriotic and cowardly.

292
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:56,374
Possibly.
Raben's story harmed us all.

293
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,999
What is your relationship
with Raben's wife?

294
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:03,707
You took her home last night.
How long have you known her?

295
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:11,665
Five years ago, you gave orders
to have some cadets tied to a tree.

296
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:15,415
You claimed they had been disloyal.

297
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:19,790
You civilians know nothing
about risking one's life for others!

298
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,415
I train men for war.
We must be able to trust each other.

299
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,415
Was that the problem
with Raben's squad?

300
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:31,749
Did they let you down by accusing
an officer of killing civilians?

301
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,624
That gives you
and your fellow officers a motive.

302
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,499
I'll say no more
before I've talked to a lawyer.

303
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,999
Join the crowd.
You and 20 or 30 of your colleagues.

304
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:55,874
- So you left the ball with him?
- Søgaard gave me a lift home.

305
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,540
- Did you notice anything unusual?
- This is for the armoured vehicles.

306
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:05,874
Bandages, painkillers, morphine, etc.

307
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,665
- And the day Grüner was killed?
- I already told you.

308
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:15,332
We met Søgaard by coincidence.
He gave us a lift to the barracks.

309
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:19,457
- Where did he go from there?
- I've no idea!

310
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:24,540
Maybe he went to Sweden
to deliver some explosives.

311
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:33,624
He helped me redecorating
and later we joined my father.

312
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:40,499
Right, thanks. We'll get back to you
if there are any developments.

313
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:47,374
- I know about the investigation.
- Excuse me for a moment.

314
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:57,874
I need the key to the depot.
I want to get the rest of our things.

315
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,874
- I'll see to it. But we're busy now.
- I'll manage on my own.

316
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,582
I want to have everything ready
before Jonas comes home.

317
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,624
By the way, you have a visitor.
That idiot from last night.

318
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,457
The police have focused
on the officers of Team Ægir.

319
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:30,540
- Why? Did they explain?
- In connection with the murders.

320
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:35,374
Madness! They are our best officers,
hardly terrorists!

321
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,999
We're doing all we can
to help the police.

322
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,999
Just the police?

323
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,665
Raben was
at the officers' academy last night.

324
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:53,082
- Did you know that?
- No. Why? What was he after?

325
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:57,540
He seems interested in the officers.
I find it rather disconcerting.

326
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:01,749
Raben managed
to give Special Branch the slip.

327
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:06,915
Early this morning, someone broke
into our personnel office.

328
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:12,374
Raben was recognised on CCTV.
No valuables were stolen.

329
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,499
But all the files on the officers
on Team Ægir are missing.

330
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,207
REPORT
CAPTAIN TORBEN SKÅNING

331
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,499
...MENTALLY UNSTABLE...
...FITS OF RAGE...

332
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:29,749
Three soldiers die on a mission.
The Ministry of Defense is informed.

333
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:36,165
Allegedly, a local family
was executed by Danish soldiers.

334
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:41,207
- Is there any proof of that?
- Only the judge advocate's report.

335
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:46,540
The soldiers claim the officer,
who they came to relieve, did it.

336
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:50,624
The accusations were disregarded
as propaganda for Taliban.

337
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,415
- The soldiers withdrew them.
- Why did they change their story?

338
00:36:56,958 --> 00:37:02,374
None of them lived to tell.
They are all dead now.

339
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:07,957
- What about Raben?
- No news. They'll let us know.

340
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:14,249
The Minister of Defense
knew something was amiss.

341
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:21,915
- There's a journalist to see you.
- That will have to wait.

342
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,624
She has an axe to grind
with the Minister of Defense.

343
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,749
She worked in the Ministry of Defense
when the case came up.

344
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,457
Come in.

345
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:51,040
I worked for the Ministry
of Defense Press Service

346
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:55,249
when the case came up
two years ago.

347
00:37:55,375 --> 00:38:03,040
On the day of the soldiers' funeral,
when the Minister gave his speech

348
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,499
I was at work. A fax came in.

349
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:10,124
Anonymous, from Afghanistan.
Is it all right, if I smoke?

350
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,249
- No.
- Go ahead.

351
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,874
Thank you.

352
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:26,290
- Where was I?
- A fax.

353
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:33,540
A medical report from
the field hospital at the main camp.

354
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:37,290
Apparently,
there was a mismatch

355
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:41,457
among the collected body parts.

356
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:45,165
- What sort of mismatch?
- A hand.

357
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:49,624
- There was a hand too many.
- A hand?

358
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:54,915
- It wasn't from any of the soldiers.
- The hand of a dead civilian?

359
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,832
An appropriate supposition.

360
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:02,082
I pass on the fax
to the Permanent Secretary

361
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,165
expecting the matter
to be investigated

362
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,832
seeing as it confirms
the soldiers' allegations.

363
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,749
But nothing happens.

364
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,415
Nobody reacts.
The fax doesn't enter into the case.

365
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,874
I need you to tell this
to the Security Committee.

366
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,915
I can't. I must adhere
to the Official Secrets Act.

367
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,207
I risk being accused of high treason.
Otherwise, I'd have written about it.

368
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:36,374
- If you're out to make some deal...
- Of course not!

369
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,582
I've been waiting
for someone to look into the case.

370
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,499
If you won't step forward,
it's of no use to me.

371
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,415
- What is that?
- The fax.

372
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:03,124
I photocopied it, before passing it
on to the Permanent Secretary.

373
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,999
Right...

374
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,290
Thanks.

375
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:21,790
Buch, we don't know her.
I have a bad feeling about this.

376
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,790
I apologise for the delay.
I'm sorry.

377
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:40,124
This meeting is about the accusations
by the Minister of Justice

378
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,999
against the Minister of Defense
regarding recent and past cases.

379
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:50,040
Present are: myself, the Home
Secretary, the Foreign Minister

380
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:53,665
the Minister of Defense,
and finally, the Minister of Justice.

381
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:57,707
Let me start two years ago,

382
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,665
when an incident in Afghanistan
was reported.

383
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,707
As from now referred to
as the Helmand case.

384
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:11,999
Raben stole information
about the officers on Team Ægir.

385
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,124
He's up to something.
We must find him.

386
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,540
He must have taken another car.
Look for stolen cars.

387
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,249
- Right.
- Thanks.

388
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,749
Ouch! Sorry.

389
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:42,290
- I'm sorry.
- You'd better take a look at this.

390
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,457
Lund? Take a look at this.

391
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:52,165
They had to pick him up.
He didn't turn up for questioning. Lund?

392
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:57,165
- Yes. Who is he?
- Lieutenant Peter Lænkholm.

393
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:00,124
It seems he was kicked out
a couple of years ago.

394
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,874
Thanks.

395
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:10,749
I'm no longer in the army
so I can't help you.

396
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:15,415
You were on Team Ægir.
How did you like Major Søgaard?

397
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:19,207
He was great! He trained me
at the officers' academy.

398
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:24,249
I thought he was terrific.
I chose to serve under his command.

399
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,707
- But you didn't serve for very long.
- I got as far as Afghanistan.

400
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:34,832
It says you were uncooperative
and there were disciplinary problems.

401
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,040
- I won't slag off Søgaard.
- This is how it is, mate.

402
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:46,582
You have enough weed at home
to send you to prison.

403
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:52,624
- But I'm not a dealer.
- Tell us about Søgaard.

404
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,332
What went wrong?

405
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,790
As long as you follow the rules,
all is well. He's cool.

406
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,749
But you didn't.

407
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:10,332
I smoked a joint.

408
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,874
I was no more high
than the bloody Taliban.

409
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,999
And then you were kicked out.

410
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:21,165
No. Søgaard doesn't
just kick people out.

411
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,207
- I got the full treatment.
- What treatment?

412
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,957
They fetch you at night
when you're asleep.

413
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:36,915
They tie you
with cable binders and duct tape.

414
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:42,790
Then they string you up,
with a flare up your arse.

415
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:44,749
A flare?

416
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:50,790
Yes. It's not that great,
I can tell you.

417
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:58,082
Didn't anybody help you?

418
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:08,457
Out there, Søgaard is God.
Nobody moves unless he gives the order.

419
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:15,374
What about Raben and his squad?
How did Søgaard like him?

420
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:21,124
- Eh?
- Not very much.

421
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,332
They were into deep shit.

422
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:30,290
- What was your impression?
- We heard the rumours.

423
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,957
And then this officer
was discharged.

424
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:40,082
Søgaard doesn't discharge a soldier
before time, just like that.

425
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:44,832
He'd done something worse than
smoke joints. What was his name?

426
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,457
- His name was Skåning.
- OK. What else?

427
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,832
I don't know.

428
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,915
Is this him?

429
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,915
Great!

430
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:15,749
No answer. It sounds like
the phone is switched off. Come on.

431
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:47,374
Why was Parliament
not informed of the accusations?

432
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,457
We can hardly inform Parliament
every time the Taliban pull a stunt.

433
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,332
You saw no reason to investigate
the alleged killings of civilians?

434
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:01,332
Damn it, Buch.
The Minister has already answered.

435
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,832
Is it too much to ask to be informed
of what this is all about?

436
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:26,832
- What's this then?
- A report from the field hospital.

437
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:33,249
The fax was sent to your Ministry
on the day of the soldiers' funeral.

438
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:38,749
Among the body parts
there was a hand too many.

439
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:42,624
- The hand of an Afghan.
- Where did you get this?

440
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,874
The reporting doctor concludes

441
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,999
that the alleged civilian killings
should be investigated.

442
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:54,415
The case has been investigated,
and to tell you the truth...

443
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:59,874
The truth is, you did sod all!
You knew something was amiss.

444
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:05,540
But you didn't tell anyone, and you
told Monberg to keep it a secret.

445
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:10,249
And when the first victim was found,
you still didn't do shit!

446
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,207
Five people have been killed.

447
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,624
Five lives
could have been spared.

448
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,749
- Do you have an explanation?
- Yes. Of course.

449
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:33,749
The fax was kept out of the case files
due to an inaccuracy.

450
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:37,832
Nonsense! Time and place
is on the fax. It all fits.

451
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:41,999
I'm sorry you force me to go
into these macabre details.

452
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:48,457
Further investigation proved it to be
the hand of the suicide bomber.

453
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,749
Nevertheless...

454
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:56,040
It's in the corrected medical report
which they received later.

455
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:02,457
I won't waste any more of your time.
You're welcome to read the report.

456
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,749
This has been quite an ordeal.

457
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:15,915
How did you know I was going
to talk about that fax?

458
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:20,790
- How could you know?
- You ignore expert opinion.

459
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:26,499
You force the police and Special Branch
to hound our soldiers.

460
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:31,040
You put pressure on Monberg
when he was unwell.

461
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:36,915
And now you try to make me
responsible for your incompetence!

462
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:14,707
Your husband isn't answering
the phone and he isn't at home.

463
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:19,749
Right, then try...
No. Why?

464
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,665
When was that?

465
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:29,707
OK, thanks. She doesn't know
why he's not answering his mobile.

466
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:35,207
Skåning is studying languages
and was going to the library.

467
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:40,540
- What else?
- Someone else called, two hours ago.

468
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,124
And old army buddy.
She didn't know him.

469
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:32,290
- Hi, I didn't expect you back.
- I was delayed.

470
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,874
- I'll lock up.
- Good night.

471
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:27,707
Buch? The Minister of Defense
denies all accusations.

472
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,207
Will you give him
an official apology?

473
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:34,124
After only a week
as Minister of Justice

474
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,499
Buch faces an uncertain future

475
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:43,999
due to what is described
as a political blunder

476
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,999
The People's Party is likely
to give a vote of no confidence

477
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:50,457
demanding the Minister's resignation

478
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:55,665
and to press
for a stricter terrorism package.

479
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,790
- Did you call the journalist?
- Yes, but in vain.

480
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:03,040
It was a set-up,
planned by the Minister of Defense.

481
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:07,415
No one likes to be smeared,
so I'm relieved to hear

482
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,832
the Minister of Justice has been
asked to withdraw his accusations.

483
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:21,290
It's my own fault.
The Minister of Defense was right.

484
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,540
I pressured Monberg too much.

485
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:30,124
I kept on at him.

486
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,249
I didn't consider his health.

487
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,624
- Not for a second.
- You had good reason.

488
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:41,874
- You were on to something.
- It doesn't seem so now.

489
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,790
Oh, excuse me.

490
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,957
Do you have a minute?

491
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:54,540
If you've come to gloat,
you chose the wrong moment.

492
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:58,790
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Don't talk about the package.

493
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01,832
And I won't butter you up...

494
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:07,624
I'll get the terror package I want.
And I still want to be rid of you.

495
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:11,874
But how sure are you about
your accusations against Rossing?

496
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,832
Why?
You're hardly losing sleep over it.

497
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:23,207
- Do you still believe in them?
- Why do you ask?

498
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:28,874
The Minister of Defense
was unusually well prepared.

499
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,665
- Perhaps even too well prepared.
- Yes, and for a reason.

500
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:39,624
I was tipped off about a fax.
It was most likely set up by Rossing.

501
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,082
And I walked right into the trap.
Satisfied?

502
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:49,499
You'd told no one about the fax?

503
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,040
I didn't phone to warn him.

504
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:58,124
- Only you and your staff knew.
- Krabbe, for Heaven's sake!

505
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,749
Had the Prime Minister
been informed?

506
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:04,457
Of course. I wouldn't get up
on my high horse without...

507
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:15,040
Excuse me.
The Prime Minister's office called.

508
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:18,165
The Prime Minister
would like to see you.

509
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,332
Excuse me.
I won't disturb you any longer.

510
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,415
Thank you for listening.

511
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,665
It's fantastic. Come on!
Yes, come along.

512
00:54:56,791 --> 00:55:00,999
Don't film me. I'm so fat!

513
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,874
Nonsense! You are beautiful.

514
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:18,915
Hi. Sorry I'm so late.
They kept me at it, all day.

515
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:24,290
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- No. Stay.

516
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:54,249
- Is the little squirt at home?
- No, he's with my father.

517
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:03,207
You didn't let him down, Louise.
You held out longer than most.

518
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:10,624
I'd like you
to help me with something.

519
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,999
Let's try his address again.
Maybe he's come home.

520
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:33,499
Shut up!
You said your name was Perk.

521
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,582
- You had a dog tag. It was you!
- It wasn't me.

522
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:40,790
Admit it!

523
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,540
I know it was you.
We came to your rescue.

524
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:55,374
Leave me alone. I was discharged
after a nervous breakdown.

525
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,124
I flew home
with the wounded soldiers.

526
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,832
- Which soldiers?
- From 3-2-AIpha.

527
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:11,040
The survivors. They had been under
siege in a village for two days.

528
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:16,665
Were you on that plane?

529
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,665
Please leave me alone!

530
00:57:30,333 --> 00:58:10,249
Raben...

531
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,415
Put the gun down.

532
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,124
You're the only one left.

533
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,457
Raben, think about it.

534
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,332
Put the gun down
and come here. Come on.

535
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:01,082
It's OK. He's my partner.
Just put the gun down.

536
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:14,499
Raben! Put the gun down!

537
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,915
Put it down, damn it!

538
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:30,332
- Put the gun on the floor.
- Perk...

539
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:34,457
Put the gun down, I said.
Put it down, now!

540
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,582
Do as he says.

541
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,540
No!

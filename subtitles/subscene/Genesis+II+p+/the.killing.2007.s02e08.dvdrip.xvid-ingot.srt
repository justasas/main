1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,956
Ten days ago a woman was killed
 in unusual circumstances

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,908
How many will follow me in death?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,551
What does PET have on the group?
Raben was the squad leader.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,998
There was no officer named Perk.
There were no civilian bodies.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,509
Why was he depressed?
He escaped.

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,510
It doesn't matter now..
He could have killed me easily.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,912
The Minister of Defence needs to
explain the circumstances...

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,518
...of the Afghan military isssue
that may be related to the killings.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,959
If there's any truth to it,
we have to know the details.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
..No evidence..
and your time is done

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,749
We received a fax from
the camp in Afghanistan.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,959
There was a mismatch
in the number of body parts.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,240
They had one hand too many...
...it belonged to a suicide bomber.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,154
Who tried to blow up the beseiged building.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,713
It appears in
the adjusted medical report.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,034
The Minister of Defence was unusually
well-prepared for the meeting.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,192
Did the prime minister know?

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
Of course he knew...
I didn't know the extent..

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,470
There was no other officer
Why would I lie?

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,395
He had a officer school logo tattoo on
his shoulder, If I saw him, I'd recognize him.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,588
You haven't failed him.
You've stayed longer than most do.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,675
I need your help with something.
You'll temporarily have your job back.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,436
How did Søgaard treat Raben?
Not well. They were in deep shit

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,957
There was the officer
who was sent away...

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,274
...I know it was you. We came to your
rescue. Do you think I'm crazy?

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,274
I was sent home because of
a nervous breakdown.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,436
Raben... Put the gun down.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,512
Perk...
Put the gun down now.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,318
No!

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,190
On the left side of the chest...
...the bullet pierced his lung.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,399
Has he eaten recently?
He's lost a lot of blood.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,078
Is he allergic to any medication?
They have his medical records.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,789
He needs to have his lung drained.
Prepare him for the operation.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,277
You can't come in here...

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,072
They need to question the officer Raben was holding,
see if we can find out what happened..

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,157
He'll be okay in there

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,155
I had to shoot. He was standing there
and waving a gun.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,350
Why didn't he run? What happened?
He was putting it down.

39
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,351
I'd calmed him down, he was coming..

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,310
Then you came in.
He thought you were Perk.

41
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:31,511
Perk!

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,352
Where is he now?
On the operating table.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,478
What the hell happened?

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,034
He took the officer hostage.
He had a gun. He ran away.

45
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,990
He wouldn't drop the weapon.
Who shot?  I aimed at his arm.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,234
Put guards on Raben.  No one is to
see him without our authorisation.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,520
How's his condition now?
Why didn't he put the gun down?

48
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,912
I don't know. But we have
the officer in custody.

49
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,792
Raben also found him.
I think he was right.

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,997
Saturation?
Blood pressure dropping.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,993
Ventricular fibrillation.
More oxygen

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,152
Put the gun down now!
Perk...

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,036
Raben said the officer they were
sent to rescue, was called Perk.

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,558
Søgaard helped bury a soldier with
that nickname, three months earlier.

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,315
Wasn't it strange?
He couldn't be Perk.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,828
What about the radio call that Raben and 
the group claimed they received...

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,959
...of a unit in difficuty? Nothing like
 that was reported

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,749
We have a tight schedule for
the redeployment tomorrow.

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,276
I suggest we address
these questions later.

60
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,072
There was no officer.
We had no people in the area.

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,555
No. not officially

62
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,239
I want a transcript of all radio
communications in that area from that time

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,836
Ask HQ to send it over.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Bilal!

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,871
Just between us.

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,590
Something happened to Jens.
The police tried to reach you.

67
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,515
I'll stay with Jonas. You go ahead.
What happened?

68
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,038
Does he have an alibi?
Skåning had a nervous breakdown.

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,239
He was flown home with Raben
and the wounded soldiers.

70
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,949
Check again.
I'm on my way.

71
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,071
The surgery just finished, he's stable now.
What happened?

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,758
He took an officer hostage.
He had a gun and tried to escape.

73
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,948
Why was he shot?
Because there was an...

74
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,629
...an emergency. He wanted to commit
suicide. Then he changed his mind.

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,115
But he wouldn't put his weapon down.
Sorry... Just a moment.

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,919
These are his personal belongings.

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,671
They're questioning the officer now.
I'll check the officer's explanation.

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,310
His ststement is ready.

79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,031
It must be him. We've checked
all other officers thoroughly.

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,272
We can talk to Raben tomorrow.

81
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,351
We've got a problem. Raben said
something before he went under.

82
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,852
He was rambling but nonetheless

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,599
He said repeatedly, that the
policeman who shot him was Perk.

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,430
The doctor said it was delirium,
but it'll be included in the report.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,469
Did we describe the event accurately?
We did.

86
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,039
What did the doctor mean, exactly?

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,076
Something was wrong. When Raben
saw Strange, he called him 'Perk'.

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,200
Anyway...Two seconds before, he was
threatening to take his own life.

89
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,670
He was confused...
He was definitely not himself.

90
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,516
What did Strange say?
What could he say? I'm going to HQ.

91
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,958
We need to take this seriously.

92
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,955
When Strange was hired a year
ago, I read his resumé.

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,237
He served in the army.
I know...in Vordingborg.

94
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,872
He had back problems.
That doesn't make him suspect.

95
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,112
Strange was not only posted
in Vordingborg.

96
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,229
At some point Strange was in the
commando division. As an officer.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
What are we going to do next?

98
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,750
Raben is the last survivor
from that soldiers group.

99
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,835
The Minister of Justice Buch accused
the Minister of Defence ...

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,994
... of withholding information about
civilian casualties in Afghanistan.

101
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,709
The Prime Minister held a meeting
with Buch.

102
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,591
Krabbe call me back.
I don't have any excuses.

103
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,510
I regret the delay,
but there's a lot of work to do.

104
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,111
I know...do take a seat..

105
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,077
Would you like something to drink?
No thanks.

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,655
I want to clear things with the Minister of Defence.
This matter is causing turbulence

107
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:46,656
Go on..

108
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,657
Of course I am aware I was a bit rushed.
hasty in my actions..

109
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,030
I am sorry for the misunderstanding.
I'll offer him my apologies ...

110
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,715
...so we can continue our work.

111
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,829
Likewise with Krabbe.  We're under
pressure with the anti-terrorism package.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,595
If I could just talk to him, I'm sure ...

113
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,074
You've been a minister for 7 days.
In that time God created the Earth.

114
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,870
You have come close to ruining everything.
Politics is a team sport.

115
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,033
Don't go on a solo tour leaving turmoil in your wake
as you try to make your name

116
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,115
You've been damaged
by all the allegations.

117
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,831
I listened to you, but you didn't
listen to me. You'll have to resign.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,310
I'm not ready or going to resign.

119
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,199
There are too many loose ends.

120
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,673
How did the Minister of Defence
know I would bring up the fax?

121
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,354
What fax?

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,638
The fax about the medical report
and the extra hand!

123
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,998
I didn't tell him anything.
Who did then?

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,836
Should I call Rossing over here
so he can answer?

125
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,071
No.

126
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,872
No. It's nothing.

127
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,512
Are you coming to the reception?
No thanks. I don't have time.

128
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,076
Here's what we'll do: Tomorrow we finalise
the anti-terrorism package.

129
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,519
You hold your resignation press conference
and come out with half a victory.

130
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,994
You have the skills. Keep low for a
couple of years, then you'll come back.

131
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,591
See you tomorrow.
Say 'Hi' to your family from me.

132
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,190
How long were you a commando?
Come on, Brix I can't tell you that.

133
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,514
You have to answer. There'll be
an investigation into the shooting.

134
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,028
We need to know where we stand.
I spent several years in the army.

135
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,433
They asked if I wanted to join
the commandos.  I said yes.

136
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,114
I got tired of it... fed up...
and entered the Police Academy.

137
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,115
But you went back in again, why?

138
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,029
After September 11, 2001, I was
invited to rejoin the commandos.

139
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,910
I was bored working on the Drug
Squad, so I took another rotation.

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,231
I quit six months ago.

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,278
Were you in Afghanistan?

142
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,116
Yes. Three times. But, I had nothing
to do with Team Aegir.

143
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,477
I was back home half a year
before they deployed.

144
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,837
I've never met Jens Peter Raben.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,357
If I had known anything about
this case,  I'd have told you.

146
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,755
Why didn't you say something?
I wanted to put it all behind me.

147
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,631
My life fell apart while I was there.
My marriage, my children.

148
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,237
I suffered from depression,
which took me a long time to get over.

149
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:13,509
Raben was very interested in a tattoo that the 
officer had on his shoulder.

150
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,876
'Ingenio et Armis'.
'With wisdom and weapons'

151
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,749
We're wasting time. Why aren't we
interrogating the officer?

152
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,117
He's not here.
We sent him home.

153
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,109
There must be something we overlooked.

154
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,558
Just show us your shoulder
then we'll get this over with.

155
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,395
Find out how many people
have this tattoo.

156
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,669
Turn in your gun and police ID card.
We need to investigate this.

157
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,631
You'll be questioned about the shooting,
Go home now.

158
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,195
Strange is temporarily suspended.
You'll take over his duties.

159
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,716
Okay.
You'll get a briefing from Lund.

160
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,796
I've asked the commandos for a list
of their officers.

161
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,336
I don't see any involvement.

162
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:29,937
The case is linked to Afghanistan

163
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,755
He didn't say a damn thing.
Not even in his resumé.

164
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,656
That doesn't make him a suspect..

165
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,793
No..We have to consider him a suspect.

166
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,396
When he shot Raben...
..was there no other way?

167
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,397
No..

168
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,433
It was justified.

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,435
Were  you with Strange when
all the killings occurred?

170
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,393
Either Raben is crazy or...
Strange is lying.  I prefer the former.

171
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,870
Think hard.

172
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,796
How is he?
He's out of danger now. He'll sleep until tomorrow.

173
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,671
He's fine. You can see him.
I'll wait until tomorrow.

174
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,630
It's important that he feels
that someone is there for him.

175
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,637
The doctor says
I need to speak with you.

176
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,997
I don't know what to say.

177
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,108
I watched an old video tonight.

178
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,312
We were on the beach, just before
Jonas was born. Do you remember?

179
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,629
We couldn't decide
what he should be called.

180
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,315
We had made
a long list of names.

181
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,315
After a while you wanted
to go swimming.

182
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,115
Not me, because I felt
I looked like a whale.

183
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,554
But you picked me up and carried me
to the sea. And you kissed me.

184
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,590
And you said that you now knew
what he should be called.

185
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,751
We called him Jonas...

186
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,308
...because he was inside a whale.

187
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,798
I'm going home.

188
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,958
No comment. We have no statement
for the press until we know more. Bye

189
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,559
We need to find him...any joy?

190
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,399
His driver hasn't seen him. He left the Prime Minister
over an hour ago in some distress..

191
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,033
He's not answering his mobile. I'm hearing
lots of rumours.

192
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:11,034
Let's wait to hear from him.

193
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:15,400
Maybe he agreed to meet with that
 journalist without telling us..

194
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,835
Is this the Secretariat? Plough.
We can't find our minister.

195
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,755
Could he be at a committee meeting?
What do you think?

196
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,233
Where do you think...? How long?
It doesn't matter. Thank you.

197
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,949
Where is he?
He's at the Ministry of Integration.

198
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,068
Hello...This is done..I need another one...

199
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,630
Connie Vemmer wants to talk to you.
Have a glass of champagne.

200
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,475
The Minister of Defence knew we
had the medical report.

201
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,438
Did Krabbe tell him?

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,398
They have Raben. He's hurt, but ...

203
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,235
It's over!
I'll resign tomorrow.

204
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,793
We can't just give up.

205
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,794
 Something's not right.  

206
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,295
Buch..We have to stand together on this.

207
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,999
We need to keep cool heads.

208
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,800
You don't know what you're talking about.
and it's all your fault

209
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,790
Now I think you've crossed the line.
We didn't have enough info!

210
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,191
You had no idea what Monberg
was going to do...

211
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,239
...You slept with him!
Why don't you check the dates? Goddamn it!

212
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,551
Don't go. Come back!

213
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,190
Come here..

214
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,796
Please leave now.

215
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,753
Yes.

216
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,469
Yes! I'm coming, damn it.

217
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,195
Stop your banging now
Hello?

218
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,189
Buch, what the hell are you doing here?
We need to talk...it's important..

219
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,555
Go ahead.

220
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,793
We have to talk about it.
What?

221
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,316
To get an au pair.
It's my wife ...

222
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,994
...and my children.

223
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,512
What do you want?

224
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,719
I'm sorry if I confused you when
I came to see you at your office

225
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,112
Then, why did you come?
There was nothing.

226
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,628
I had the confidence of the Prime Minister.
What were you talking about before?

227
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,556
After your TV appearance, I was angry.
The anti-terrorism package was ruined.

228
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,398
I hastily called a meeting of
the party executive committee.

229
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,472
But you weren't there.

230
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,875
I was in the car when I received
a message from the Prime Minister.

231
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,669
The Minister of Defence
would be exhonerated ...

232
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,197
and the anti-terrorism package
will be back on track tomorrow.

233
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,832
How did they know that before the
meeting of the Security Committee?

234
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,788
I don't understand, but...

235
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,476
...I've been thinking about that
and I think I understand it.

236
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,399
Who cares if the prime minister had
advance knowledge?

237
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,271
They knew that your allegations
would be rejected. So they called me.

238
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,150
It's possible they just don't
have confidence in you anymore.

239
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,950
Or the defense minister just
wanted to made a fool out of you.

240
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,511
But it doesn't appear that the
Prime Minister is the villain.

241
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,832
I spoke with him this evening.
Everything was fine.

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,632
I'm pleased that he's given
you the boot, I fought for it.

243
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,433
You were not good for the job at hand

244
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,439
Now I'll call you a cab.

245
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,912
When was Strange sent home?

246
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,631
He claimed, six months ago. The
commandos won't give that information.

247
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,952
General Arild is coming to see us
tomorrow morning.

248
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,195
Good. Can you send Strange's CV
to me? Thanks.

249
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,876
Lund...

250
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,235
These are documents on the soldiers
who died during Raben's last mission.

251
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,109
I had them in the car.
It's best that you take them.

252
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,254
I don't care what Brix thinks...
...or what crazy Raben thinks.

253
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,555
It's late for this..

254
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,514
What do you think?

255
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,113
You should have said something.
Why?

256
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,115
Why didn't you tell anyone
about your partner who was shot?

257
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,276
A detective told me you were biased
and guilty in Jan Meyers death.

258
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,434
I've always backed you up, even
when you have been wrong..

259
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,199
I've told my children about you.

260
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,275
They asked me why I was happy.
I said that I'd met someone.

261
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,629
We have been very cooperative.

262
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,830
Your interrogations at the officers'
barracks. And now the commandos.

263
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,957
Were there commandos in that
area two years ago?

264
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,758
Yes they were there.

265
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,673
While Team Aegir was there?

266
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,960
Was Ulrik Strange
sent home six months earlier?

267
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,194
I can't confirm that.
I want a list of the commandos who were there.

268
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,036
I can't give you that information.
It's classified and not for your eyes.

269
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,478
But no commandos were involved
in the incident.

270
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,631
Brix...

271
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,710
The Danish commandos are brave men who 
don't randomly kill civilians.

272
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,169
We have to send off our team, I hope
this is at an end now

273
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,170
They were deployed and now they're dead,
we need info.

274
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,551
The ravings of a traumatized soldier are not enough
to warrant this witch hunt

275
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,033
Answer me this..How could Jens Peter Raben
have slipped away from Intelligence?

276
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,796
It's like this. Either you give me
what I need...

277
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,794
...or I'll call the press and ask why ...

278
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,714
you are being obstructive and not trying to help us
resolve this matter? Do you understand...?

279
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,431
...or should I find someone higher up who
can give us the information we need?

280
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,279
I understand that the information is
important. I'll do whatever I can.

281
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,191
Jens Peter Raben just woke up.
He's asked to speak to you..... immediately.

282
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,831
You've had arterial surgery.  Careful.
It could be fatal.

283
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,554
Wait... Wait a minute. I'll get someone
to help you get ready.

284
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,634
I'm sorry if I've put you in
an embarrassing position.

285
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,036
I've been happy to be here. I hope my
successor will be more successful...

286
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,671
...regardless of who it is.
Thank you.

287
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,472
Today's program:

288
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,873
The Prime Minister expects you
to give the usual resignation speech.

289
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,313
Then there's Jens Peter Raben...
It doesn't matter.

290
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,589
I want to say sorry for my behavior last night.
It was wrong of me to treat you like that

291
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,949
You've always supported me.
I'm the one who blew it.

292
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,511
It's the best solution for both the
government and the ministry.

293
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:52,597
I wish you all the best.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

294
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,993
I'll just have to take this call..

295
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,035
Was it the wrong brandy?
No, it is fine.

296
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,795
Plough has his own concerns.

297
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,748
He's been summoned to a meeting
with the Prime Minister.

298
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,118
Rumour is they'll appoint him as the 
EU advisor in Skopje and banish him

299
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,308
If Plough goes, I'll probably go too.
But it doesn't matter.

300
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,711
The journalist told me that she can
explain everything and make it all clear

301
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,510
But only to you. It might be worthwhile..
I really think that you ...

302
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,719
I'll talk to prime minister about your future.
I'm sure there's a place for you here

303
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,269
See you down the hall.

304
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,590
We should've never backed him up.
It's Skopje. EU advisor.

305
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,411
After 23 years, I end up in Skopje.

306
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:57,312
Skopje isn't the end of the earth

307
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,555
What the hell do I tell my wife?
And where is it? Do we have an atlas?

308
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,350
Listen... Maybe your wife
will want to stay in Denmark.

309
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,992
At 09:32, we received a message
that a Danish unit was under fire.

310
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,598
We crossed the river, then it went wrong.
Thomsen told you what happened.

311
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,916
We fought our way into the building.
There was no sign of any Danish unit.

312
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,438
Only one officer who had barricaded
himself in with a local family.

313
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,392
Why did you think his name was Perk?
That's what was on his ID tag.

314
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,916
I assumed, that he was
from another Danish camp.

315
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,758
How did he get there?
He said he was separated from his group.

316
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,079
The Taliban chased him.
He sought refuge in the building.

317
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,917
There were only four of us.
Myg, HC, Sebastian and myself...

318
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,437
...and Perk. Dolmer was killed when
he went inside. Grüner was shot...

319
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:18,473
...in the leg. He needed help but,
we were under attack. Thomsen had...

320
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,112
...the radio. What about Perk's radio?
He said it was shot to pieces.

321
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,628
He decided it was better
to wait, than to fight it out.

322
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,796
The shooting continued.
The next day it began to heat up.

323
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,354
We had very little water. The stench
was unbearable. No one came to help.

324
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,470
Perk became irritated and angry
He wanted to try to get away.

325
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,911
He wanted the father of the family
to help obtain a radio.

326
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,197
The father said he knew nothing
 about where to get a radio .

327
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,273
Perk took a child, a girl, and...

328
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,796
...held a gun to her head.

329
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,318
He asked the father whether he
would help the Taliban or us.

330
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,472
And then he shot her.

331
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,395
He took the mother and shot her too.

332
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,590
The father was holding the youngest,
a boy, and begged for their lives.

333
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,590
Perk shot them both.

334
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,913
What did you do?

335
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,394
What did you do?

336
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,317
I held the first child... the girl.

337
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,793
I didn't think he would shoot her.
What did the others do?

338
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,592
They all shouted at once.
Sebastian shouted.

339
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,911
Was that Sebastian Holst?

340
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,634
The youngest. He was more interested
in his camera than his gun.

341
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,033
I threw my arms around him. I
managed to get him calmed down.

342
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,274
When it got dark, we suddenly
heard an engine noise.

343
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,878
A man drove his motorcycle into the
courtyard and blew himself up.

344
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,592
So I don't remember much after that.
Help may have arrived shortly after.

345
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,038
Where was Perk at that time?
I don't know.

346
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,159
He must've found a way out,
just before help arrived.

347
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,031
And the bodies of the family?
He must've got rid of them.

348
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,116
You can ask him yourself. The
policeman who shot me...was Perk.

349
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,272
Where is he?
Why do you think it was him?

350
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,151
It's him. He's killed all the others.
He has the tattoo on his shoulder.

351
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,509
You were also convinced that the
officer you took as hostage was Perk.

352
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,513
I want you to look at these.
Just take your time.

353
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,355
Raben needed to tell us that story.
He's the accused, but he's also the victim.

354
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,709
Strange may have been there?
That hasn't been confirmed.

355
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,159
But Raben is mentally unstable,
of that we have documentary evidence.

356
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,714
He may have confused Strange with
another commando officer.

357
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,476
We're checking into that now. Strange
investigated the matter with Lund.

358
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,349
We've never identified any other trace
 of war with the muslim league

359
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,230
Unfortunately there are
holes in his alibi.

360
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,794
It was more than an hour before we met
and went out to see Myg Poulsen.

361
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,910
Grüner was set on fire by a call from a
mobile, and we don't know the owner.

362
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,915
And I met Strange shortly before we
went to the parking garage.

363
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,108
He was away when I interviewed
Lisbeth Thomsen in Sweden.

364
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,719
And he was in the barracks the
evening the explosives were stolen.

365
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,318
But when you found the chaplain in the
church Strange was in Elsinore.

366
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,914
Has that been checked into?

367
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,359
I saw him come back but
of course I'll check into it.

368
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,652
I have to meet Sebastian Holst's
parents and tell them what Raben said.

369
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:11,153
It's already been checked

370
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,237
We saw his pictures.There was no officer.
He always had his camera with him, but...

371
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,713
...it wasn't found.What do we do with
Strange?  Get him in for questioning.

372
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,913
Our superiors will want to know
why you employed him this time.

373
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,913
I didn't hire him.

374
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,949
Strange came as part of a reshuffle
for police reform.

375
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,035
If anyone's hands have to be washed
in public, it's our superiors.

376
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,797
Thank you. Bye. He's asked
to see me, so I'm going now.

377
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,838
He's been interrogated.
Don't forget to pack those.

378
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,913
Tell me if I can help.
Why?

379
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,596
He's accused of a lot of crap.
Wasn't that what you wanted?

380
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,477
Here's the program for the ceremony.
I'll leave it to you. I'll come, But...

381
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,875
...you can make the speech.
Was there anything else?  Yes.

382
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,751
HQ asked if you wanted the radio traffic
text as a hard copy or computer file.

383
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,631
I said in view of the enquiry 
you probably wanted both.

384
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,591
May I ask why?
Jus take care of the ceremony.

385
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,117
In a moment, there'll be a short break,
just before the vote.

386
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,276
At the press conference afterwards,
Buch will resign.

387
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,514
Let's see if we can get a comment.
A quick comment?

388
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,840
Got a minute?

389
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,951
There's been a stupid mistake. Plough's been
asked to resign from his office..

390
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,514
That was no mistake.
We need a new beginning.

391
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:25,515
..a new broom to sweep
everything clean until all

392
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,353
The fossils have gone.
But I'm the one ...

393
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,356
Buch you had apologised to the Prime Minister 
yesterday. I'm glad there are no bad feelings.

394
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,674
We'll figure it out. It's politics.. We've said
A, but then we must also say B.

395
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,033
Have you seen the draft of your speech
for the press conference?

396
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:45,034
I have yes, glanced through it...

397
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,995
Yeah, thanks.
Sorry, I need to see him.

398
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,878
Plough here. Everything's ready for your
press conference in about a half hour.

399
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,431
Your wife has just arrived. Karina's
gone down to meet her.

400
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,718
My wife?
I said you'd met her out front.

401
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,160
Where is she?

402
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,191
We have to talk about the medical reports, educate
yourself........ get in. We're going.

403
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,239
You think I was the errand-boy
for the Minister of Defence.

404
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,109
I was kicked out.
He knew everything in advance...

405
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,910
Must have been one of your people
who tipped him off. Okay

406
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,200
The whole time it was right in front of you.

407
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,388
Why didn't you check the dates
of the two medical reports?

408
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,909
What dates?

409
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,993
I understand Sebastian always had
his camera with him.

410
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,599
He always took pictures. There's
a whole box of photos down there.

411
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,959
Did they offer an explanation two years
ago, why his camera was missing?

412
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,511
It wasn't missing..He'd sent it home.

413
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:33,512
He'd sent the camera back here?

414
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,276
Yes..It was broken.
He asked me to get it repaired

415
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,154
Why are you asking?
Just something I was following up..it's nothing now.

416
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,233
I heard on the radio
that you'd found Raben.

417
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,949
Now the whole story will be
dredged up again.

418
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,476
What do you know about it?

419
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,598
I don't think there was an officer.

420
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,878
They invented him as an excuse
to go to that building.

421
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,178
It was Raben's fault that Sebastian
and the others were killed.

422
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,679
Why do you think that?

423
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,157
Sebastian predicted that himself.

424
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,598
I lost both my sons to a war,
I don't understand.

425
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,153
One came home in a coffin.
The other simply returned.

426
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,996
I don't know what we've done wrong.

427
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,230
Is there anything you haven't told us?

428
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,955
A video diary.
I would like to see it please.

429
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,955
If you agree with the conditions
Please sign it.

430
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,318
I want to see my wife.
She's waiting outside.

431
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,474
You'll be driven back to the hospital.
You can have five minutes with her.

432
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,989
Can we have some privacy?
Sorry.

433
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,838
Come on.
Sit down.

434
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,716
They've probably told you what
happened yesterday. I wasn't myself.

435
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,519
It will never happen again.

436
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,313
We can talk about it another time.
I've disappointed you.

437
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,552
I was really a bad friend,
a bad father.

438
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,554
If I could only turn back the clock.

439
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,910
But there.s one bright spot.
Now they're listening to me.

440
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,629
You and Jonas
mean everything to me.

441
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,793
We'll work it out.
I've started to see Søgaard.

442
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,710
This has nothing to do with him.
I've missed you every single day.

443
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,075
I just don't think anymore that
I...

444
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,513
...can't you see it?
It's no good.

445
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,312
We have to take you in for questioning
again...We're not finished.

446
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,074
Sorry.
I want to talk to my wife again.

447
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,430
You want a lawyer?
No I want to talk to my wife.

448
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,119
Sebastian Holst sent a video diary
home shortly before his death.

449
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,913
Don't be scared, but something
isn't right in our group.

450
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,315
Why should I look at it?
Raben is the worst of all.

451
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,397
He sees Taliban everywhere
and only thinks about killing.

452
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,439
He takes too many chances and asks
us to do things we're not supposed to..

453
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,994
He invents messages for us to go out
and kick ass.

454
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,795
This morning we went out to search
a house for the third time in a week...

455
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,351
...because Raben believes that
it's a Taliban safe house.

456
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,799
We searched. Raben accused the
father of being an informant. ...

457
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,637
He placed his weapon
against his head....for no reason

458
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,871
The children cried. The mother
and the old women wept.

459
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,589
Raben will do it again.

460
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,151
When I talk with others, they say

461
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,077
it'll be okay. They don't want to
fall out with him.

462
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,189
But he's the best person to be with...

463
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,832
...once the shit starts to rain
down on your head.

464
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,233
And in a few weeks we'll come
home, so it'll probably be fine.

465
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,111
I miss you. See you soon. I'll pass on
your greetings to my brother. Bye.

466
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,957
Is what he says true?

467
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,637
Sebastian joined up, just to
compete with his older brother.

468
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,353
It's not about Sebastian, but the officer.
The family, he talks about...

469
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,655
Is this the same family,
you claim was killed?

470
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:46,156
Yes, the same family.

471
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,911
So you and the group had been
with the family many times before?

472
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,997
You were convinced that they were Taliban.
 Found nothing, but you kept going there.

473
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,993
It doesn't matter.
No.

474
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,915
There's no evidence
you received the message.

475
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,789
So there was no officer called Perk.

476
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,191
I've explained everything.

477
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,232
Look at these..
There are five people killed.

478
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,030
I've done everything to find the officer you describe.

479
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,958
If you lied to me and he doesn't exist,
you need to admit it to me right now.

480
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,354
It was my decision to go into
in the village. The others disagreed.

481
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,232
I should've listened to them.
But there was an officer.

482
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,631
I saw him yesterday.

483
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,119
Papers from Defense say...

484
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,637
...that the person you identified
as the officer...

485
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,270
...wasn't in Afghanistan then.

486
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,637
And Sebastian's older brother?
Do you know him?

487
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,716
He's a doctor. He was in the camp.
A military doctor? What's his name?

488
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,077
Frederik. Frederik Holst.

489
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,633
Frederik Holst, army  physician.
We need to see him here.

490
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,157
Ask the father what the older
brother said about Raben's unit.

491
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,032
The minister's just arrived..
He's back.

492
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,395
What did she say?

493
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,156
Sorry, I tricked you.
You'll have to talk to Vemmer.

494
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,996
We know there are things
you can't tell us about.

495
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,789
Even if you do nothing with it
you should have the information.

496
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,033
I've resigned and I'll go to Skopje.

497
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,796
If you decide to do something,
you have to finish it.

498
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,918
How is the bill coming along?
The vote is in about ten minutes.

499
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,640
Is Krabbe there?
Yes.

500
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,595
But he has nothing to do with it.

501
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,591
Krabbe?

502
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,073
Krabbe? Is this you?
Damn, even here..?

503
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,756
Call my secretary if
you want to speak to me.

504
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,313
The medical report about the extra hand
was faxed to Defence in mid-August.

505
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,476
The revised medical report
appeared in early October.

506
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,670
First, a report which suggests
that civilians were killed.

507
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,628
And which you maintain is a
 pathetic cover-up attempt.

508
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,239
Everything was clear, but nothing
 was done for two months...

509
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,790
There was no reason. The hand
belonged to a suicide bomber.

510
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,794
Why did they said nothing?
What were they up to?

511
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,590
When the first report came, the Prime
Minister was proposing funding...

512
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,958
...to increase our military
deployment effort in Afghanistan.

513
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,875
It was adopted when parliament
opened in October.

514
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,476
You and your party voted for it.

515
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,794
This proves nothing. Pure speculation.
What would the Prime Minister gain from it...

516
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,669
That's how it happened, dammit!

517
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,834
Vote for a draconian anti-terrorism
package if you want.

518
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,152
But it will target the wrong people.

519
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,111
The question is whether you will
help me do something about it.

520
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,634
They're on the road
and in good spirits.

521
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,238
You never said anything
about a notice, five days before.

522
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,196
There was an announcement.
in August, two years ago.

523
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,478
Five days before the incident.

524
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,510
An message from the commandos.
I don't understand.

525
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:57,028
The commandos were only 150 km
from Raben's group at the village.

526
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,699
I've never seen that message. 

527
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,200
You had command.

528
00:51:04,201 --> 00:51:06,201
 What do you mean? I've never seen this before..

529
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,997
Raben and his group said someone
was there. We didn't believe them.

530
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,280
We said they saw ghosts. 
Yes, and they did. This proves nothing.

531
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,956
Why didn't you check it out?
I had no knowledge of that.

532
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,436
If an official complaint is submitted,
I want to see it.

533
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,549
I'm going to the airport.
No stay in the barracks until further notice.

534
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,269
Is that understood?

535
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,271
I'm glad you're here. I was going to call.
You were gone all day.

536
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,991
There is a possibility that Raben
may have been right.

537
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,918
There was radio contact with a Danish
commando unit five days before.

538
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:03,428
We have to call the police.
The police will need to focus on the commandos.

539
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,195
But why are you so interested?

540
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:13,435
Søgaard withheld the information. When
I was in Kabul, he was in command.

541
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,559
Something's wrong, but
Søgaard's not the problem.

542
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,556
Did you help Raben
escape from Intelligence?

543
00:52:27,057 --> 00:52:30,557
I see from your reaction and silence that you
did help him slip away..

544
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,118
I gave you confidential information
about his security. You tipped him off later.

545
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,718
This is important information which
we need to investigate further.

546
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,671
Just answer me, damn it!
Did you help Raben, or not?

547
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,230
When?

548
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,472
Yes. That's good. Thank you.

549
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,909
The older brother's in Afghanistan.
He just left yesterday.

550
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,676
He's been home on leave for
three weeks. We found this...here.

551
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,111
We'll have to go and interrogate him.
There's a military flight tonight.

552
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,114
What the hell are you talking about?
We're wasting our time.

553
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,556
Frederik Holst has a motive.
He's seen his brother's video.

554
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,635
He was at the field hospital when
his brother's body was brought in.

555
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,590
We'll need to ask for permission.
I'll ask Hedeby...

556
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,912
It may take several days.
We can't wait.

557
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,193
I need a copy of the medical report
from the Ministry of Justice.

558
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,354
Do you want to travel as a tourist?
This needs to be done if you want to solve this

559
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,318
You have connections.

560
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,996
Didn't you tell me that Ruth Hedeby
runs the whole place.

561
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,948
Yes, damn it. TNT, tetryl, RDX.
You name it?

562
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,635
I also buy rockets for
New Years' celebrations.

563
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,318
My buddy... Jan Meyer.

564
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,836
We arrived at a warehouse.

565
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,914
And I went inside. I didn't think
that anyone was in the building.

566
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,319
Meyer went inside.

567
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,917
I should've stopped him.
It was my fault.

568
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,558
We found the perpetrator,
but it seemed... unimportant.

569
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,911
They pulled the plug...

570
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,914
I got the job in Gedser
which suited me fine.

571
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,550
I just wanted to hide.

572
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:55,511
If you hadn't come with the request
from Brix, I'd still be sitting there.

573
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,469
So sorry.

574
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,359
And what now?

575
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,954
We gotta go.

576
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:29,358
Uh, where? I didn't have a chance to
get my jacket when they took me.

577
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,640
We'll get it
Are you coming?

578
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,555
Here's the CV for Frederik Holst.
An arrest warrant. Contacts.

579
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,157
Strange, you'll be the point man.
You're going to Istanbul.

580
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,710
I'll send visas and documents
to you by fax.

581
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,113
You'll travel on a military aircraft
to Afghanistan under their command.

582
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,590
Just do as they say.
Got that, Lund?

583
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,799
I'll see you two back here
in 36 hours.

584
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,952
Take care of yourselves.

585
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:25,953

1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,036
Ten days ago a woman was killed in
unusual circumstances.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,910
The Muslim League will punish Denmark.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,712
Brix says you offer a different perspective.
Kodmani should be interviewed again.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,877
Jens Peter Raben knew both victims.
Now he's escaped.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,034
I have respect for your work,
but sometimes it's a disaster

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,599
The government has put much effort
into the anti-terrorism package.

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,232
Do you want to be the Minister of Justice?
The link was activated a 17:03.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,598
The woman was also
sent on military service.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,356
Buchs attempt to create a broad
agreement has suffered a severe blow.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,274
There was a confidential memo.
Is it true what they say?

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,956
Yes. The memo suggested a possible
terrorism link to the first murder.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,396
Your predecessor, Monberg, and I
removed the note from the record

13
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:11,397
The note was removed from the record.
Why?

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,716
Why did Monberg fear a threat
to national security?

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,475
The Directorate of Prisons has
rejected your application.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,509
Why can't I see him?
-He refuses his medication.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,754
He would never just run away.
There has to be a reason.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,596
Hi, Chaplain. There are some people
I need to talk to.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,197
Myg and the lawyer are dead.
Myg visited me.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,829
Why did you rent the post box?
'Faith Brother' told me to

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,195
What language did he write in?
Just shut up for a minute!

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Lund is..
I know all about Lund.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,278
She was kicked out of here, for many
good reasons.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,479
what we witnessed today is the most talentless
interview I have witnessed in many years

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,677
Monberg has requested material
about Anne Dragsholm.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,551
Why did your predecessor supress
information about the warning on terrorism?

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,795
There was a risk of compromising
strategy in Afghanistan.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,513
Frode had an agenda. He knew
Anne Dragsholm personally.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,151
She felt that the army didn't take the
group's explanation seriously.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,995
She argued the case for a group of soldiers.

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,914
The lawyer contacted me two days
before she was killed.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,916
Do you have the list of Team Aegir members?
We need to talk to someone in Raben's group.

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,518
Can't you stop that racket?
We're doing our best.

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,959
He was attacked in his car and
wheeled down here in his wheelchair.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,272
We saw the smoke,
but we couldn't put the fire out.

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,557
Are there Sprinklers?
They've been turned off.

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,909
The same with the security cameras.
Shortly before 17:00.

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,868
The victim was doused with petrol.

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,875
The fire was ignited by a call
to a mobile phone. There.

40
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,069
The victim was handcuffed and the
wheelchair was chained.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,473
Must have just sat there waiting for the
phone to ring...

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,552
for all hell to break loose.

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,353
What do we know about him?
David Grüner, 28 a former soldier.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,830
He's been employed here as a guard
for about a year.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,394
He lost his legs in Afghanistan.
He was in Raben's unit.

46
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,597
He may have been burned alive.
Is that a car tyre? - Yes

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,638
I've got to make a call.

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,879
No image recognition?
We're checking that now

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,873
Everything points to the same perpetrator.

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,989
It would have been nice to get
a briefing before the press conference.

51
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,789
Lund knows nothing.
We came out here and then ...

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,559
I should have known.

53
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,149
I should have...

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,152
I should have done something.

55
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,509
If we'd arrived half an hour sooner.
Just a quarter hour.

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,918
Lund...
I'm okay.

57
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,590
The tyre around the neck is favoured 
against informants in South Africa.

58
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,514
And against U.S. security personnel in Iraq.

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,708
They saw him run away I hear?
Raben? No idea what he was doing here.

60
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,000
Because everything indicates it's the same
perpetrator as before.

61
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,790
And Sarah Lund has it all figured out?

62
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,999
She's smart, I didn't know they
were coming here

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,190
Would have been nice if you had.
Kodmani may still be involved.

64
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,309
I'm going to take Lund off
the case for several days.

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,075
Why?
I know what I said yesterday.

66
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,233
But there are two good reasons
to keep her now.

67
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,999
What she thinks about 'Faith Brother',
that Kodmani keeps talking about?

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,311
We need to have a broader view, she gives it to us.

69
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,631
And what's the other reason?

70
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Kodmani has agreed to an interrogation.
On one condition.

71
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,195
You must meet Bjørn before the wedding.
It's a bad time now.

72
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,239
How about a cup of coffee?
We could get together

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,472
Any news about Raben?
No.

74
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,315
What about the rest of his group?
They should be questioned.

75
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,711
Lund!
It's fine for coffee this evening.

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,670
I'll buy some cake.
I'm glad. I'll see you.

77
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,072
The cake should be without nuts.
Bjørn can't tolerate nuts.

78
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,032
Kodmani wants to talk. The condition is
that you conduct the interrogation.

79
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,751
You saw him.
You don't know if it was him.

80
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,673
It was him.
Maybe he...

81
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,913
Chaplain! He's dead, damn it.
Face it..it's fact

82
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,232
He had a wife and child.

83
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,554
Have you found the others?
There's only one of you left.

84
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,679
It's Thomsen.
What about the HC?

85
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,197
I have heard from the veterans' club
Hans died in a traffic accident last year.

86
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,232
I've checked and Thomsen no longer lives
at the address in Copenhagen.

87
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,118
It's your wife.
She said you'd not contacted her

88
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,068
I said I didn't know where you were,
but she wanted to stay.

89
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,392
Jonas, listen to her. Go to sleep.

90
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,470
Sleep well, darling.

91
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,349
Does anyone know you're here?
No, no one.

92
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,751
I said I was going to a friend's place.

93
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,869
Are you sure you were'nt followed?
Why did you run away?

94
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,874
Myg and Grüner have been killed.

95
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,512
I don't know what this is about.
They knew something. They were afraid.

96
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,831
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,834
There was something that happened
in Afghanistan our last time out.

98
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,118
I've never told you.
I thought it was over, maybe I imagined it

99
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,512
or I had invented it.
Perhaps I was crazy, maybe not...

100
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,832
I have to find out what happened or rot in
 that Institution.

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,549
What is it you haven't told me?

102
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,033
Jens, give yourself up I'm sure we can explain it.
We can make it clear, they'll understand

103
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,479
Then maybe theres a chance for us
I can't do that..

104
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,668
Why not? We've waited two years!
We've talked to doctors and lawyers.

105
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,197
Now you can destroy it all.
What do you want me to do?

106
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,796
Should I wait ten years until
my son has forgotten me?

107
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,396
And you're out there with Søgaard?

108
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,074
Sorry.

109
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,280
I need time to get a handle on it.
I know what to do. Okay?

110
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,437
I need your help to find Thomsen.
Search the files in the barracks.

111
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,754
I need to speak with her.
She's the last one of the group.

112
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,316
Bring it here. It's safe.

113
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,711
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I have to go now. They'll be coming here.

114
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,278
Give Jonas a kiss from me.

115
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,595
The war in Afghanistan is a fiasco. It 
leads to terrorism here as a consequence of it.

116
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,912
It's shameless, exploiting a national crisis.

117
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,835
Would you prefer to abolish the law?
And democratic rights?

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,393
The People's Party supports the Government,
but these anti-terrorism measures are too soft.

119
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,189
The government has the country in a crisis.

120
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,956
The government tries to keep a cool head,
unlike my colleagues at the table

121
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,319
Constitutional experts have worked hard
to re-shape the present package.

122
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,237
Personal pettiness should not get in the way
of solving these problems.

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,349
The Ministry of Justice
is trying to withhold information.

124
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,310
The Minister of Justice has already given an
explanation about the Intelligence memo.

125
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,268
We aren't convinced what role
the Department of Justice plays in this.

126
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,975
Buchs' predecessor withheld
information about the first killing.

127
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,976
That was a security decision as we have explained

128
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,153
Regardless of the security situation
it's stupid not to inform anyone.

129
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,793
There is clearly still a distance between
 the parties on this issue

130
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,996
We are working on a broad compromise.
And if that fails?

131
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,156
There is no doubt about what I
think of the People's Party proposal.

132
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,848
We are confident that the minister
will come to his senses.

133
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:08,849
Thank you all for a lively debate 

134
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:17,198
It went very well. Shall we put our
heads together tomorrow morning?

135
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,272
We've found out something about Monberg.

136
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,432
I just want this resolved.

137
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,516
I'll be there.  Or do you want to keep
quiet about it? What is it.

138
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,832
There's Nothing suggested that Monberg
and Dragsholm knew each other privately.

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,719
Intelligence knew nothing and
König was surprised.

140
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,479
We know they had a meeting at a hotel
the weekend before she was killed.

141
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
It could have been completely innocent

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,634
The weekend Monberg spoke at
a seminar on human rights...

143
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,875
...organized by Amnesty
and Dragsholm sat on the board.

144
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,319
Do we know if they stayed the night?
The Minister did.

145
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,712
I left in the afternoon.
What do you think they were doing?

146
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,159
I know what you're asking....If they had an affair.
I'm sure I would have noticed.

147
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,677
What's Plough doing here?

148
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,957
He was found this evening.

149
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,672
Everything indicates
it's the same perpetrator.

150
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,628
Intelligence now doubts that
we have the right suspect.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,236
The Prime Minister wants to meet you
and the Minister of Defence.

152
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,359
What was the connection
between Monberg and the first victim?

153
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,469
If Monberg has withheld information
on personal grounds, we need to find out.

154
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,269
There's something I have to tell you about him.

155
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,991
In the last few months
Monberg sometimes cancelled meetings.

156
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,951
Always with a plausible explanation.
Come to the point, Plough.

157
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,832
He wasn't always able to be the places...
I felt that he had someone ...

158
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,869
It wasn't necessarily something
his family was informed about.

159
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,830
He had it both ways?
You think it was with Dragsholm?

160
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,872
The day he canceled the meetings
He stayed at the Hotel Hammershøj.

161
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,113
Where he recently met with Dragsholm.
The Intelligence Service knows nothing.

162
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,753
And if it affected the investigation,
he ordered it.

163
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,549
Don't mention it at the meeting.
We have to get some more information.

164
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,273
Moreover Monberg knew the Minister of Defence
really well.

165
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,078
Good evening. I'm sorry that you
had to wait. Go ahead take a seat.

166
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,672
It's my colleague. Sit down.

167
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,158
Do you have something to tell us?

168
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,272
I'll tell everything
I know about 'Faith Brother'.

169
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,673
I tell you this to protect my members 

170
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,789
None of the people you've arrested,
had anything to do with him.

171
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,988
We're not going to make a deal on that.
We decide who we pick up not you.

172
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,315
I realise that I will have
to pay for my mistake.

173
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:40,316
but it is my mistake alone you understand

174
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,316
No one else was involved is that clear..

175
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,836
What kind of a mistake?

176
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,996
My first contact with 'Faith Brother'
was an on-line chat two months ago.

177
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,799
We haven't found anything.

178
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,034
I can see now that he pressed
all the right buttons.

179
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,591
My religion, my political beliefs,
my hatred...

180
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,274
Come on get to the point.

181
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,831
I was sure I could trust him, he was so plausible.

182
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,758
He asked me to rent a post box
because he wanted to donate money.

183
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,789
He asked for guidance on how to put
a video on my website.

184
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,794
Did you commit murder for him?
No, there was nothing...

185
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,713
There was nothing of the sort like that.

186
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,998
It initially gave me a pleasant feeling.

187
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,679
Finally, I got what I'd worked for.
A sense of justice.

188
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,632
Until you showed me those photos.
Until I understood there was a price to pay.

189
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,759
What do you mean?
You see only what you want.

190
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,119
It's not fundamentalists who did this here.
It was those who hate us.

191
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,070
Who are they?
You need to find that out for yourself.

192
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,992
What language did 'Faith Brother'
write in?

193
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,869
English, with some Arabic.
So he was an Arab?

194
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,318
No. That was just to placate me.

195
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,553
His grammer was all wrong... out of context.

196
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,511
Did  'Faith Brother' write about the
soldiers' group? About Anne Dragsholm?

197
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,791
You must know more than that.
The words he used...

198
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,077
He was very precise and concise.

199
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,079
I'm sure that  'Faith Brother' is a soldier.

200
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,629
...Or was.

201
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,477
Kodmani remains suspicious,
but what do we know about  'Faith Brother'?

202
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,237
He's probably the person
behind the Muslim League.

203
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,710
The video, military lists, ID tags.

204
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,192
We need to focus on Raben's group
and keep an open mind on the subject.

205
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,069
What would the motive be if
Kodmani didn't do it?

206
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,073
What does Intelligence say about that unit?

207
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,519
It's a highly decorated group.
It was operating under the name 3-2-Alpha.

208
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,800
It consisted of eight people
with Raben as squad leader since 2001.

209
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,953
The unit did good work in Afghanistan.
as part of Team Aegir.

210
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,079
It received the highest praise.
But just before their repatriation...

211
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,678
the group lost three men and was disbanded

212
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,679
And what of the rest of the group?

213
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,439
There are only two left.
Jens Peter Raben and Lisbeth Thomsen.

214
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Raben is a fugitive and
we're looking for Lisbeth Thomsen

215
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,516
Was the first victim in contact
with the group, or...?

216
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,800
She represented the group
in connection with an investigation.

217
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,795
About what?
From the last mission.

218
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,078
Contravention of the Geneva Convention.

219
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,079
What does that mean?

220
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,595
Accusations of civilian killings.

221
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,471
Thanks to Dragsholm and
the prosecutor's report, the unit was acquitted.

222
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,077
Dragholm's husband believed
there was a controversy.

223
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,552
Therefore, she was fired by the army.
Maybe she harbored a grudge.

224
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,477
But the fact remains that she resigned.
This is her resignation letter.

225
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,913
Do you have a moment?
Yes.

226
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,837
Kodmani said he thought he was a soldier.
Maybe when he was in Afghanistan.

227
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,074
Maybe it's someone who was involved
there and is now seeking revenge.

228
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,273
What's a provost report?

229
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,638
Judge Advocate General Corps can try
military criminal cases.

230
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,157
I'd like to have the report
as soon as possible.

231
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,316
Let's get ahold of Lisbeth Thomsen
before it's too late. We'll call her.

232
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,837
Thank you. Do you know where there
is a bakery that's still open now?

233
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,878
Yes, it...
Well.

234
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,231
I'm calling.

235
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,236
What then?

236
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,871
You've decided to keep Lund on the case?

237
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,112
Is this a problem?
No.

238
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,195
But it's perhaps wise
if you consider your future.

239
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,716
Surely my future can't be affected by König?

240
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,079
I mean that the Minister
of Justice is under pressure.

241
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,037
Ruth, what is it?

242
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,239
I'd like to stay fully informed.
If König and you know something ...

243
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,428
In due course you'll be informed.
You have enough on your plate.

244
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,994
Including Lund, they're all your responsibility.
Do we agree on that?

245
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,595
We didn't talk about anything important.

246
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,071
See you later?

247
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,509
Good.
See you then. Bye.

248
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,359
Another ex Danish soldier has fallen to terrorism

249
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,878
28-year-old David  Grüner was once
stationed in the barracks at Ryvangen.

250
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,952
His body was found in a car park.

251
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,875
Like the previous victims
He had been brutally murdered.

252
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:24,628
Police and Intelligence still have in custody
 group members connected to the slayings

253
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,396
Well, Buch... Good to see you.
Thanks, you too.

254
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,917
Did I just miss something?
We had a chat.

255
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,632
Can you keep going?
I do what I can.

256
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,712
It'll be alright.
You're doing fine.

257
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,159
Monberg would be happy if
He knew that you had taken over.

258
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,993
Let's get started.

259
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,837
It doesn't look good, but the police and Intelligence
are working round the clock

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,072
But it may take time?
I 'm afraid so.

261
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,712
The terrorists have chosen an unfortunate
 moment for us to begin their campaign.

262
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,637
We have to get an agreement at all costs
on the anti-terrorism measures.

263
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,875
And Gert, we can't get Agger
and the opposition to wait.

264
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,510
We'll agree with the People's Party
to ban certain organizations.

265
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,791
The investigation doesn't show
a link to those associations.

266
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,792
Nothing at all..

267
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,316
It's not right to ban them
because of this matter.

268
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,096
I understand your objections.
If the situation was peaceful ..

269
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,550
I would probably share your opinion.

270
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,156
The Defence Minister is right.

271
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,517
Damn right I am on that basis!

272
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,269
There are other issues connected to it.

273
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,032
Monberg may have had personal
knowledge of the first victim.

274
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,079
He hasn't said anything to anyone.

275
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,198
How did he know her?
What does Intelligence say?

276
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,716
They weren't even aware of a connection...

277
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,556
So they're just rumours?
There's just something wrong.

278
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,032
If Intelligence finds nothing,
Then there is nothing going on?

279
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,873
Thomas, do you know something?

280
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,478
No, I don't know anything.

281
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,191
So I think we should
concentrate on our own work.

282
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,549
It seems premature
to prohibit an organisation.

283
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,397
But these Muslim organisations
have made statements ...

284
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,759
...which are objectionable and hostile.
We have to take action.

285
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,199
I want you to finalise the anti-terrorism
package with the People's Party.

286
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,316
Understood?

287
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,918
With regard to the deployment of the next
army team there may be trouble.

288
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,959
We're telling everyone the procedures.
But if they face risk when they come home ...

289
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,558
Will some soldiers want to reconsider
going there.

290
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,633
We've invited soldiers
and their relatives to a briefing.

291
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,157
Bilal will have a word with them.
It won't be easy after what happened to Grüner.

292
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,758
You must explain to them that the situation is
temporary and completely untypical.

293
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,391
Do it dammit
It's high time to do this job.

294
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,192
One more thing.
Grüner was in 3-2-Alfa like Myg Poulsen.

295
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,672
The first victim, the lawyer,
was associated with the group.

296
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,879
There may be some speculation
in that context.

297
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,910
We have nothing to hide.
Give the police everything they want.

298
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,995
And then there's Raben.

299
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,030
His escape could be linked to here. Raben is heavily linked here

300
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,031
Why would he come here..

301
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,637
It's obvious he'd seek out his contacts
in the military, come looking for help

302
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,076
So he gets arrested immediately.
It is a safety issue.

303
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,189
If it's my daughter's loyalty,
you worry about, Bilal...

304
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,638
...then we're not going to get along.
Is that understood?

305
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,749
Søgaard, come with me
to see Grüner's wife.

306
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,675
Bilal, set up an agenda
for a discussion with families.

307
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,155
Do you have time?
Later..I'll probably move my stuff tomorrow.

308
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,551
I'm sure we can do it with not much upheaval

309
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,191
I have heard about Grüner.
He and Myg were in Jens' group together.

310
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,638
Really, but Jens was seen at the
scene of the murder.

311
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,033
The police will be watching
you and Jonas from now on.

312
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,752
Louise...

313
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,040
If Jens contacts you
it's important that you call me..

314
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,913
Do you agree?

315
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,036
Yes.

316
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,710
Good. When will the forensic
report be ready? Okay.

317
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,837
Thank you. Sorry. So am I.
Now you'll see.

318
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,998
The seating arrangement is
traditional horseshoe shape.

319
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:09,899
We're trying to fit personalities all together..

320
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,870
These are good cakes.
You're there.

321
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,791
Shouldn't I sit next to Mark?

322
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,671
Bjorn's cousin is also alone
because his wife is sick.

323
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,035
It's okay to bring someone.
Not necessarily.

324
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,548
Do you not have a partner?
No. Sarah's had enough of that.

325
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,068
I also put everything on hold
but then I came up with other ideas.

326
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,155
Do you know how we met?
Ah..excuse me please..

327
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,996
That's fine.
I'll get them as soon as possible.

328
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,631
Thank you.
How do you know each other?

329
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,315
Yesterday...

330
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,996
It's a thrift store...where you find
used stuff.

331
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,948
But good quality. Famous brands.
I was looking for a jacket.

332
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,873
That's for me.

333
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,592
Maybe we should have talked to
her when she was down in Gedser.

334
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,235
Are you okay?
Yes, yes.

335
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,953
Hello. Here's the provost's report
and a folder on Thomsen.

336
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:31,954
Anything useful for us?

337
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,274
She rented her flat out and comes
every three months for rent and mail.

338
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,753
That's all we have.
Why can't we find her?

339
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,913
She's making an effort not to be found.

340
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,789
We'll have to go.
Bjørn feels so bad.

341
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,509
Are you sure that there were
no nuts in the cake?

342
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,831
I get that from gluten also.

343
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,959
And you are?
Ulrik Strange. From work.

344
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,759
Vibeke. Sarah's mother.

345
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,710
We'll have to run.
He doesn't feel well. We'll call you.

346
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,553
Bue, bye.
- Bye.

347
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,277
I've asked Colonel Jarnvig
to come in and talk to us.

348
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,319
There is still no news about Raben?

349
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,588
Okay. See you tomorrow.
Unless I eat some cake.

350
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,751
See you tomorrow.
Yes.

351
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,639
The police have stepped up the search
for the escapee from Herstedvester.

352
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,716
Jens Peter Raben is 37 years old,
1.90 cm tall and has dark hair.

353
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,190
Police say he is dangerous and should
 not be approached.

354
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,355
Hello?
It's me. Where are you?

355
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:57,356
I'm on my way now

356
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,238
Are you being followed?
I don't think so.

357
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,552
I'll be back in the barracks in half an hour.
Did you find anything?

358
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,238
I have some papers for you.
Have you seen her file?

359
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,551
Yes. It doesn't say anything.
Only her address in Copenhagen

360
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,999
Is there anything about Hirtshals?
Thomsen comes from Hirtshals.

361
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,950
Who is her next of kin? She has an uncle.
In Sweden...on an island.

362
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,829
She used to go there on vacation
when she was on leave.

363
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
Yes. That's here.

364
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,952
But the uncle is dead.
There is nothing after that.

365
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,434
Now I'm here.

366
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,550
Where are you?

367
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,069
Stay where you are.
They're watching you.

368
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,758
I don't want you to get involved.
Thanks for the help, honey.

369
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,390
I'll call as often as possible.
Jens...

370
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,599
I love you.
But I can't do this anymore.

371
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,392
I'll stay at the barracks.
They want me to stay on at the hospital.

372
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,759
I have to think about Jonas.
He needs me.

373
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,879
Louise...
I have to run now.

374
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,431
Wait...
Take care of yourself.

375
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:02,435
This involved the killing of civilians.
It's an allegation we often hear.

376
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,832
The Opposition are trying
to whip up public indignation.

377
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,719
It may well be true.

378
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,431
The Taliban often hide behind civilians.

379
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,639
The case was thoroughly investigated
and the unit has been acquitted.

380
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,877
So you don't believe those allegations.

381
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,272
No, they were totally unfounded.
But the report ...

382
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,035
I haven't come to be accountable.

383
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,228
Three men from my barracks were
 killed on that mission.

384
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,756
That's stated in the report.

385
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,674
Could it be an act of revenge
in response to those allegations?

386
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,595
Could be.
The case damaged our reputation.

387
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,719
It might someone with a grudge.

388
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,399
Are there any soldiers in the army
who might be linked to Afghanistan?

389
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,950
No. Not that I know of.

390
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:14,195
Do you think a Danish military unit
commits attrocities? That's crazy.

391
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,193
Thank you. That was all.


392
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,834
Lisbeth Thomsen lives
on a Swedish island, Skogö ...

393
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,676
in the home of her deceased uncle.
The local police have gotten hold of her.

394
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,118
How long does it take to go to Skogö?
A couple of hours.

395
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,551
Lisbeth Thomsen volunteered
for military service.

396
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,319
And you didn't?
No, I can damn well assure you.

397
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,918
I pretended to have back pain, but
I landed in a foxhole.

398
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,514
How was it?

399
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,754
I stuck it out for a couple of years.
The army was okay.

400
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,677
Shouldn't we turn here?
No, we take E6, it's faster.

401
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,277
How the hell do you know?
Do you have a summer cottage?

402
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,471
I used to have a Swedish boyfriend.

403
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,553
Mr. Nilsson?

404
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,678
Why 'used to have'?

405
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,196
Long story..

406
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,554
It was understood that I'd move up
here, but it didn't work out.

407
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,355
It's a little hard to imagine you
holding hands in a Swedish forest.

408
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,199
Have the local police been informed
that Raben might show up?

409
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Yeah yeah yeah

410
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,872
It's pretty unlikely all the same

411
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,789
We've accommodated all the
People's Party's demands.

412
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,954
That's far too hasty.
You wanted this agreement.

413
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,114
But now there are too many loose ends.
You've always been against the ban.

414
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,717
I don't like it.
It's politically motivated

415
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,396
These are flimsy associations
with  nothing to suggest...

416
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,237
...that Monberg and Anne Dragsholm
had anything going on.

417
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,357
Am I too early?
No, come inside.

418
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,554
Karina, do you want to prepare for
our press conference?

419
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,838
To justify a ban on certain associations.

420
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,039
We've reworded it

421
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,209
Yes. I can see that you have been
talking to the Prime Minister.

422
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,210
Everyone want's to get this through

423
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:17,110
There is one small detail that concerns us
 "'Associations which incite terrorism..."

424
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,709
What is the objection
Just words..It should read:

425
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,672
"... encourage terrorism or other
subversive activities..."

426
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,958
Let's get it right this time
We're almost there

427
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,912
When i was negotiating with Monberg. He worked
tirelessly. Too bad he couldn't finish.

428
00:39:46,913 --> 00:39:48,513
he was dedicated to finding a solution

429
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:49,914
We all are..

430
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,951
Despite his heart problems
he worked hard for it..

431
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,069
I think that he only cancelled once.
That day, the Minister of Integration...

432
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,676
...was assaulted in front of her home.

433
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,550
That gave us a topic of conversation
for our next meeting.

434
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,910
I'm sending the text over, right?
See you at the press conference.

435
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,750
This letter has been returned.
Thanks.

436
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,429
Monberg canceled a meeting on October 7.

437
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,579
Is there anything about
where he went later that day?

438
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,980
I'll check and see..

439
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,238
It's one of those days when he
was booked into the hotel.

440
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,678
He went to the doctor.
Call the head of Intelligence.

441
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,116
That day Intelligence increased security
for certain ministers...

442
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,229
...among them Justice.
Did Monberg take Dragsholm to a hotel?

443
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,393
It must be in the Intelligence report
for that day.

444
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,712
Welcome.

445
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,317
Lisbeth Thomsen lives on the other side
of the island. We'll pick her up for you.

446
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:17,318
You haven't picked her up yet..

447
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,371
We have a couple of men out there.
But she can handle herself.

448
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:22,572
Do you know her?

449
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,993
Yes, but she keeps to herself.

450
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:26,294
What does she do?

451
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,029
What does she do? She works in the woods,
...felling, hunting.  She can do everything.

452
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,158
We'll drive to the police station.

453
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,270
Raben will probably visit her.

454
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,479
If he does, we'll take care of him.
Up here on the left.

455
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,317
The Danish police called.
They want to question you.

456
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:14,318
Where are you going?

457
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,438
You want me to come with you holding this?

458
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,833
You've been briefed?
Yes.

459
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,833
Can you explain what happened?

460
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,358
Nothing more than what I've heard.
Have you ever received threats?  No.

461
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,115
Have you seen Myg Poulsen,
David Grüner or Jens Peter Raben?

462
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,238
No, I haven't seen them for two years.

463
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,155
Besides the members of your unit,
the lawyer was also murdered.

464
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,949
Anne Dragsholm.
Has she contacted you?

465
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,675
What happened in August,
two years ago?

466
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,150
Three men were killed.
It's in the report.

467
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,517
We want to hear your version.

468
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,078
We need to ask these questions.
It's very important to us, and for you.

469
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,995
We were........we were out on patrol.
After a while ...

470
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,191
...we got a radio message.
A Danish group had come under fire.

471
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,956
They were in an area by a river.

472
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,671
In the Green Zone,
the area controlled by the enemy.

473
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,755
At first we wanted to cross the river
using the bridge...

474
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,517
...but there were explosives.
The bridge was blown to pieces.

475
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,552
We called for an armoured vehicle.
Bo sat next to me and got hit in the throat.

476
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,077
The gun barrel shattered and shrapnel pierced him....
In the throat..

477
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,475
We were cut off from the rest,
but they said help was coming.

478
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,397
Raben ordered the rest of the unit
to go to the village ...

479
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,350
...to help those under fire there.

480
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,911
What then?
It was the last time I saw them.

481
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,950
They were found two days later
and brought back to the camp.

482
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,951
Why weren't you there?

483
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,831
 My job was to
stay until help came for the wounded.

484
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,594
He died before the helicopter arrived.

485
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,436
The others have probably told you
what happened in the village.

486
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,673
You know what the report says.

487
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,516
They were ambushed. Two were killed.
Raben and Grüner were injured.

488
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,710
Subsequently there were allegations of 
civilian deaths and atrocities..war crimes.

489
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,777
I know nothing about that.
Can you explain the anger against...

490
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:23,978
..the unit,something must have
 happened that wasn't...

491
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,589
I don't want to hear anymore about
the accusations. We lost three men.

492
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,638
The group was fully exonerated.

493
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,351
Raben, Myg and others risked their lives.

494
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,675
You shouldn't slander them.
We risked our lives down there.

495
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,870
Sorry, but according to the report from the
enquiry no Danish patrol was under fire.

496
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,713
We received a call.

497
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,839
It may seem strange...
Are we finished?

498
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,011
We're here for your own good.
Why are you hiding here?

499
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,477
I'm not. I'm just here to get a little peace. It was 
before you two arrived. Are we finished?

500
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,189
No, we have some photos we'd
like you to take a look at.

501
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,079
Maybe you can help us.

502
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,356
God...

503
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,639
That's Krabbe calling. What can I say?

504
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,075
First I want to speak to Intelligence.
We have a press conference to prepare for

505
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,119
What did König say?
I haven't spoken to him.

506
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,796
We have to go now.
Give me the number.

507
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:50,797
Listen to me

508
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:51,798
Just give me the bloody number

509
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,193
It was not Dragsholm who had
an affair with Monberg. It was me.

510
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,114
I didn't think it played any role.

511
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,118
The weekend before the assassination
I was in the same hotel.

512
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,636
Frode ..
Monberg had to talk that afternoon.

513
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,157
He had asked me to come and work
there in the evening.

514
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,791
I had just broken off the affair and
thought that it was a pretext.

515
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,071
I met him at the hotel bar, shortly after his
meeting with Dragsholm. He was quiet.

516
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,758
But he drank way too fast and I began
to worry. He had a file with him.

517
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,677
Shortly after that I left.
So, did you see Dragsholm?

518
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:46,791
No. And he said nothing about her.
I knew nothing about their connection.

519
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,997
But, he behaved differently.
How?

520
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,393
I thought it was because I had
ended our relationship.

521
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:55,394
He avoided me.

522
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,473
Until the night before his heart attack.

523
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,156
He wanted my help to
post something for him.

524
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,110
I gave him an envelope,
and he put it in the out tray.

525
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,319
That was the last time I saw him.

526
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,350
Now, the envelope came back with the
file from the evening with Dragsholm.

527
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,992
He wanted to be absolutely sure
that envelope and folder came back.

528
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:32,430
It is an auditor's report. And CVs
of the soldiers from a particular group.

529
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,114
There are names of those killed.

530
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,479
Why did Dragsholm give him this file?

531
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,480
There is other documentation at the back

532
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,079
There is an accompanying letter from
Monberg..a request to reopen the case.

533
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,218
I realise that I have to resign.
I deeply regret that.

534
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,919
I'll go immediately

535
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,997
It's Krabbe again.
What should we do?

536
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,933
How was the meeting with the families?
We've lost some, Five have resigned.

537
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,908
Some family members were upset
by Grüner's death.

538
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,830
They'll have time for reflection
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

539
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,952
Give Søgaard the message
to come tomorrow morning.

540
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,996
Bilal, did you touch the Lisbeth
Thomsen file last night?

541
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,551
No.
Do you know if Søgaard did?

542
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,952
No, I can ask him when I give him the message
No no, Thanks, that's fine.

543
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,719
The Colonel is to see the security officer...
There is no need for him.

544
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,633
I've just spoken to security.

545
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,975
What I said was uncalled for.

546
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,753
There's not much furniture.
My stuff is in storage.

547
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,831
What next?
Now it's fine.

548
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,596
Jonas will sleep over with a friend.
I need to paint his new room.

549
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,595
Shall I help you?
Thank you. That's nice of you...

550
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,877
...but painting is good therapy.

551
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,434
You got just a little...

552
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,312
There is still just a little...

553
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,713
I'm really glad that you...

554
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,669
Give me a shout if you want me
to come and help.

555
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,910
Thanks.

556
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,034
When did you talk to him?
Is he here?

557
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,470
I'm leaving.
You stay here. It also concerns you.

558
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,792
He wanted to know where Thomsen was.

559
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,035
I looked in your computer.
Sorry, but he said it was important.

560
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,670
Did you take him to the barracks?
No.

561
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,870
I said he should give himself up
or leave us alone.

562
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,713
Satisfied?
Where is he now?

563
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,432
I don't know. Why?
There've been burglaries at the depot.

564
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,957
Someone, who knows security procedures,
has taken some plastic explosives.

565
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,509
5 kilograms.

566
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,318
You may be able to tell me
something more.  I want to go home.

567
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,516
Lund...

568
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,314
What?
No one has seen Dragsholm over here.

569
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,870
She knows something.
And Raben?

570
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,999
We haven't seen him.
Should we drive Thomsen home?

571
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,333
We'll take her to Copenhagen.
I'm not going to Copenhagen.

572
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:33,334
It's in your own interest to go, you are in danger
while you are here

573
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,830
Why the hell would I want to?
Come on, the ferry goes in three minutes.

574
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,359
If you're responsible for the roads,
I have some complaints.

575
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,196
Lund speaking. Brix here, any news?
We're taking her home.

576
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,353
We've spoken with a neighbour

577
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,275
He was called a week ago by the tax office.

578
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,276
They asked him to call them
the next time Thomsen appeared.

579
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,638
So they could talk to her.
Why is that important?

580
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:27,955
We talked to the tax office.
No one there want's to talk to her

581
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,955
You may not be alone on the island.

582
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,156
Okay. Thank you.

583
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,435
Does this happen a lot out here?
Let's go back.

584
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,637
I'll just check.
No, Strange...

585
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,239
Turn around. Let's go, damn it.
You're a sitting target

586
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,995
I think something happened at the village.

587
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,392
I don't know more, just talk and gossip
What do you think happened then?

588
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,793
They said something happened and now they're all dead.
Did they talk about civilian casualties?

589
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,717
They didn't do anything.
The whole thing was fucked up by a Danish officer.

590
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,919
The report says nothing about an officer,
 all personnel were accounted for

591
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,358
They talked about an officer named Perk.

592
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,512
No one believed them.
The case was closed.

593
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,852
The lawyer believed them.
She asked if I wanted to testify.

594
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:04,853
Draagsholm..

595
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,756
Police!
Come out or I'll shoot!

596
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,436
What is it?

597
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,751
Go back to Thomsen.
Now!

598
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,398
That was me who stopped you.
Have you opened this?

599
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,916
Get out!

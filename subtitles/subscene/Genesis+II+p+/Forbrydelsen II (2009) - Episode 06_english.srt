1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,999
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:16,082
The Muslim League will avenge
the suffering Denmark has caused...

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,957
My blood will be shed.
And many will die along with me.

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,082
Brix thinks
you can give us a new angle.

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,374
David Grüner, 28-year-old veteran.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,207
- What do you know about the squad?
- 3-2-AIpha. Raben was squad leader.

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:37,165
- Do we know where the rest are?
- Raben and Lisbeth Thomsen.

8
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:42,249
- She's living on a Swedish island.
- Raben may turn up.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,124
- The Probation Service turned you down.
- Why?

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,332
- Why can't I visit him?
- Raben lied, and now he's escaped.

11
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,874
- He turned up.
- Have you agreed to meet?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,582
- Something happened in that village.
- They can't just vanish.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,832
- What happened?
- He called himself Perk.

14
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,915
Thomsen!
Don't start it! Stop!

15
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:18,582
The Government has put a lot of work
into the terrorism package.

16
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:24,040
- Will you be Minister of Justice?
- I had an affair with Monberg.

17
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,165
This is a report
on an incident in Afghanistan.

18
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,290
- I realise I must resign.
- The victims' names!

19
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:36,582
You leave me no choice
but to tell the media

20
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,207
that the Government is incapable
of taking action against terrorism.

21
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,832
- Buch?
- We'll have to stop this.

22
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:48,707
- These are merely allegations.
- I have written evidence.

23
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,707
Monberg didn't have a heart attack.
He took some pills.

24
00:01:54,958 --> 00:02:00,332
What if it's all a set-up?
The video, Faith Fellow, Kodmani?

25
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,040
- The army doesn't kill its own.
- Someone in the army.

26
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,790
- Rubbish!
- Lund and Strange stay on the case.

27
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,874
- No officer Perk, no bodies.
- And you checked all this?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,957
- My second-in-command briefed me.
- Who was he?

29
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:22,707
War is dirty. Innocent people die.
That's why the politicians send us.

30
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:29,040
I need your help.
Why did he try to kill himself?

31
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,165
What?

32
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,832
- It is not the right time.
- Monberg is involved in the case.

33
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,915
The lawyer asked for his help
to reopen the case.

34
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:43,457
The Defense Ministry called a meeting
with the Minister of Justice.

35
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:47,999
Concerning squad leader Raben.
He was in a mental institution.

36
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:52,040
- That won't buy you a gas pistol!
- I need it!

37
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,707
My father knows about this phone.
Are you all right?

38
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,082
You'd better take this.

39
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,832
You are right to turn yourself in.
Let me change, before we go.

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,707
Some recruits were trained by
a first lieutenant they called Perk.

41
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,332
Per K. Møller.
He was on Team Ægir.

42
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:16,540
He got the funeral he wanted.
Is this to do with the investigation?

43
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,749
A lawyer was here,
asking the same questions.

44
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,165
He died,
three months before the incident.

45
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,790
Søgaard wouldn't
let them see the body.

46
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:34,582
We must get her permission to dig
up the coffin, to see if it's empty.

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,582
THE KILLING

48
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:46,790
- Something came up.
- You promised to give me a hand.

49
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:52,124
- I'll come tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? It's my wedding!

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,415
Mum, I can't talk now.
I'll call you. Bye.

51
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,874
- How deep must we dig?
- About my height.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,374
- Is the coffin still intact?
- I've never dug one up before.

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,582
- Mind the hedge!
- Lund? We have a problem.

54
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:18,749
We can't get a warrant now.
The judge wants to know more.

55
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,624
Let's hear what the field chaplain
and Major Søgaard say.

56
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,374
And the mother of the deceased
just turned up.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,582
I can't agree to this.

58
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,707
- We're on thin ice.
- Where is she?

59
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:40,124
Get those people out.
I won't have anybody digging there.

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,124
- May I have a word with you?
- No. I won't change my mind. Leave!

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,415
There may have been a mistake
at your son's funeral.

62
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,040
You have no right! Leave!

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,249
We must be quite certain
that your son is in the coffin.

64
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,582
And we need your permission.

65
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:04,707
- I promise we'll do it with care.
- Why wouldn't he be in the coffin?

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,540
He is believed to have been seen
three months after his presumed death.

67
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,999
Some soldiers witnessed
something in Afghanistan.

68
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:19,540
Your son may have been involved
with the killing of civilians.

69
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,124
With your permission,
we can start immediately.

70
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,790
Otherwise, I'm forced to get
permission from someone else.

71
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,707
- What kind of a person are you?
- I realise it may seem...

72
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,915
Lund? Brix wants to see you.

73
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,790
- We didn't talk of exhumations.
- The family never saw the body.

74
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:58,957
- The chaplain and Søgaard said...
- It's not enough!

75
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:03,749
- Not without the mother's consent.
- There is no body in that coffin.

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:08,082
- If the coffin is empty...
- Send these people home!

77
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,040
Brix, wait a moment!

78
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,582
I know I'm right.

79
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,082
Trust me, goddamn it!

80
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:24,207
- Søgaard refuses to be questioned.
- Bring him in to HQ now.

81
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,415
- And the chaplain?
- We're still looking for him.

82
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,707
We can't wait for more killings.
We must do something!

83
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,749
Did you see the chaplain
about your husband?

84
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:05,040
Yes, he said he wasn't well.
Can we go now?

85
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,332
Was your husband angry
with the chaplain?

86
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:13,707
No. He knows he only wants to help.
They are friends.

87
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,332
- Would your husband harm him?
- Not so loud!

88
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,874
The chaplain left in a hurry.
He forgot a parish council meeting.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,749
He was seen leaving with someone
who looked like your husband.

90
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,540
- Any idea where they were heading?
- No.

91
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,624
He'd never dream
of harming the vicar.

92
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,665
Thank you.

93
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,707
- The pizza is getting cold.
- We'll buy another on the way home.

94
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,290
- Where are we going?
- Drive on!

95
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,082
What did Dragsholm say?
Why did she contact you?

96
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:16,207
- Was she reopening the case?
- Turn left here. Here!

97
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,999
Leave the keys in the ignition.

98
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,832
Move away from the car.

99
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,415
Further away!

100
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,582
What are you planning to do, Priest?

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,374
It won't do you any good.

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,499
The police will find out.

103
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,957
Yes. Hello? Is that the police?
My name is Gunnar Torp.

104
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:02,415
I'm in Hareskoven Forest.
I want to report an assault.

105
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,874
It concerns a former soldier,
Jens Peter Raben.

106
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,124
He drove me into the woods
and threatened me with a pistol.

107
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,499
No, I don't know where he is.
I'll wait at the main path.

108
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,874
Thank you.

109
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,124
I want no part in it. If you contact
me again, I'll shoot you.

110
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,332
- What did Dragsholm want?
- Run!

111
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:31,457
- I know nothing. Stay put!
- She saw Myg, Grüner, Thomsen.

112
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,249
She wanted them to testify
against the officer.

113
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,582
I buried that officer,
three months before the incident!

114
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,874
Now, get lost!

115
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,374
What had Dragsholm uncovered?
Why reopen the case?

116
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:03,915
She wanted me to testify.
I heard them talk about the officer.

117
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,915
- You knew something was amiss.
- No. I didn't understand.

118
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,707
- I asked Søgaard about it.
- And what did Søgaard say?

119
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,665
That there was no case.
As the judge advocate's report said.

120
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:22,249
I was locked up for two years,
drugged, cut off from my family.

121
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,707
Talk to Søgaard, the Colonel
and the others at the barracks.

122
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,665
No!

123
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,832
Raben...

124
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,040
Forgive me.

125
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,457
Think of your wife!
Think of your son!

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,457
People are shocked. Four killings!
Why don't we do something?

127
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,124
The investigation is complicated.

128
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,749
It's fundamentalism.
We are under terrorist attack.

129
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:23,124
- It isn't as simple as that.
- What's so bloody complicated?

130
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,040
Even though this meeting
is off the record

131
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,332
the Home Secretary
should refrain from swearing.

132
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,374
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,082
But we're in this together.
There has been no breakthrough.

134
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,707
The Opposition is gloating
and the People's Party is impatient

135
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:47,874
because the Minister of Justice
won't pass the terrorism package.

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,790
- We must look into it.
- Into what?

137
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:58,665
I know these Islamist organisations,
these people you are protecting.

138
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:03,749
They'd replace democracy
with Sharia if you let them.

139
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:08,499
None of my colleagues abroad
understand that we're doing nothing.

140
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,124
What if these organisations
are mixed up in it?

141
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,374
That is why
I've called this meeting.

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,457
Thomas wishes to present us
with something to explain himself.

143
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:28,165
That part is no longer relevant.
It was a misunderstanding.

144
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,165
- What the hell is going on?
- Listen to me.

145
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:38,040
We all know
it was no easy start for Buch.

146
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,290
But he's sure to pass the terrorism
package if he can work in peace.

147
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:47,165
Let's focus on our common enemy,
and refrain from blaming each other.

148
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,082
Any one of us
could be in Buch's shoes.

149
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,707
Excuse me.
Rossing here.

150
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,957
Protecting those organisations
is not the way to show tolerance.

151
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,374
Could I talk this over with you,
in private?

152
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,582
- What's that?
- It won't take a moment. Please.

153
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,332
Put the police
and Special Branch to work.

154
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,624
The police seem to be too busy.

155
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:19,374
The Ministry of Defense
has been informed

156
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,540
that a dead soldier
is about to be exhumed.

157
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:28,999
- What are you saying?
- The bereaved are very upset.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,749
Buch... Do you have an explanation?

159
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,665
I'm not quite up-to-date on that,
but let us...

160
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,790
You may be newly appointed,
but I can't protect you

161
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,874
You seem to have changed
your mind about Monberg.

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,207
- Why this exhumation?
- I need time.

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,749
Tell me what is going on.

164
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:03,540
It's best the Prime Minister
is not informed about such matters.

165
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,915
I'll get to the bottom of it.

166
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,457
But it must not be said later on
that the Prime Minister was informed.

167
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:16,332
- It would compromise you.
- What are you on about?

168
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:23,790
Perhaps I was wrong about Monberg
being the only one at fault.

169
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:29,457
Call a meeting
with the People's Party.

170
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,332
Ease their mind,
say we'll pass the terror package

171
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,457
but we need to investigate
the organisations one more time.

172
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,040
- For how long?
- A couple of days.

173
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:47,374
Blame me and my amateurism.
Krabbe will understand that.

174
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,332
We all have a tight schedule.
Could we come to a decision?

175
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,707
I'll talk to Krabbe.
I'm giving Thomas 24 hours

176
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,415
to investigate
certain circumstances.

177
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:05,124
- Might I ask which circumstances?
- No. Please inform the others.

178
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,374
You claimed you didn't know
any officer by the name of Perk.

179
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,332
I still don't.

180
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,624
Officer Per K. Møller's
nickname was Perk

181
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,999
and he was on Team Ægir,
as were you.

182
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,124
Correct. Some officers
gave him that nickname.

183
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,832
- Did you drag me in here for that?
- Just answer the questions.

184
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,040
You and the field chaplain
attended his funeral. Why?

185
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,874
We escorted the coffin on the flight
home and wanted to pay our respects.

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,249
Why wasn't his family
allowed to see his body?

187
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,290
- He died in an explosion.
- Tell me about it.

188
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:53,999
His head was severed from what was
left of his body. What is this about?

189
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,874
With a dead officer called Perk,
it must have surprised you

190
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,374
when Raben and the others claimed
to have met an officer of that name.

191
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,790
No. It made their report even more
unbelievable. I'd buried him!

192
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:18,499
- Did you alone declare him dead?
- This is ridiculous!

193
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:23,999
- Why was there no autopsy?
- I saw what was left of the man!

194
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:28,707
We feared
his death was self-inflicted.

195
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:33,165
- Do you claim he took his own life?
- We'll never know.

196
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:37,957
- But for the sake of the family...
- Rubbish!

197
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:43,082
We are about to open an empty coffin,
so don't give me that!

198
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,290
Don't tell me you're digging him up!

199
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,707
Lund...

200
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:57,249
- The coffin has been dug up.
- And?

201
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,790
Hi, Lund.
Nice to see you again.

202
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:11,540
I only get this kind of work
when you're around.

203
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,040
Well...
Caucasian, late twenties.

204
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,582
The femur indicates
that he was about six foot tall.

205
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:25,207
He's had a very rough treatment.
I'd say an explosion.

206
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:31,207
It's rather a mess. It reminds me
of one time in the Balkans...

207
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:37,249
It can't be him.
You can't be sure it's Per K. Møller.

208
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:42,165
- We'll need to take him in...
- You can't be sure!

209
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,999
It could be someone else. They could
have put another body in its place.

210
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:51,124
- It's not necessarily Per K. Møller.
- What is that?

211
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,749
We'll have to take a DNA test.
What about his teeth?

212
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,874
It just can't be right.

213
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,124
It can't be him.

214
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,999
Søgaard and the chaplain
wouldn't let them see the body.

215
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,207
Something is amiss.
I know...

216
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,874
Wrap it up and close it.

217
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,707
Hey. What's going on?

218
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,374
- Got anyone buried here?
- No.

219
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,457
Some crazy cop thought
an empty coffin was buried here.

220
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,999
You'd think
they had better things to do.

221
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:20,790
"The dragon curled up around
the town, bit his tail, and fell asleep."

222
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,540
So should you.
Tomorrow we'll make your room nice.

223
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,624
Why are they chasing Daddy?
Has he gone?

224
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:40,749
He's playing hide-and-seek,
just like you do at nursery.

225
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,624
Now lie down and sleep.

226
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,665
- Are they angry with Daddy?
- No. They just want to find him.

227
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,207
When they do,
we can go visit him again.

228
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,624
Shall we try out
your new scooter tomorrow?

229
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,165
Sleep tight, darling.

230
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,665
Yes, of course. I understand.
Thank you. Goodbye.

231
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,207
They found the Priest.

232
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,874
He says Jens took him
to some woods at gunpoint.

233
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,290
He's all right,
apart from being slightly bruised.

234
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:40,332
I wanted to check that you were OK.
You'd better not leave the barracks.

235
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,957
I'd like to know
what the hell is going on.

236
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:51,040
Explosives have been found here.
You and Søgaard were questioned.

237
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:57,040
- And now the Priest tells this tale.
- It's a routine investigation.

238
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,540
Nonsense! Jens said something
bad happened in Afghanistan.

239
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,499
He's right about that.

240
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,249
Three soldiers
from this squad were killed.

241
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:11,290
- That wasn't it. What was it?
- There's a simple explanation.

242
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,957
As a squad leader, Jens made
a wrong decision. I'd feel bad too.

243
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,040
So you think
he's acting out of guilt?

244
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,915
It's time you realised there are sides
to Jens you don't know.

245
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,332
Right. I'd like you to leave now.

246
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,790
Why did he go to war
when Jonas was born?

247
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:34,207
- He was sent to Iraq.
- No. He was not on a contract.

248
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,874
He volunteered.
He wanted to go!

249
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,415
- Jens is not the man you think...
- Leave!

250
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,915
Get out of here!

251
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,874
Rossing called a meeting
with Monberg

252
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,874
and Raben was on the agenda.

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,332
The official reason is "prevention
of crime among demobilised soldiers".

254
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,332
Raben is not the only soldier
to be named as an example.

255
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,957
Eat, Plough. It's delicious.

256
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:21,040
The Ministry of Defense didn't want
to disclose Raben's name.

257
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,124
- Why are there no minutes?
- The Ministers were alone.

258
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,374
I was busy with a bill.

259
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,999
Monberg promised his constituents
to cut expenses in the Probation Service.

260
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,665
Is there any dessert?

261
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:42,999
If Monberg knew then
about this military case

262
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,915
and failed to inform the police
when Dragsholm was killed...

263
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,374
What do the police
and Special Branch say?

264
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,374
At the moment, they are arguing
about the exhumation of that soldier.

265
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,249
Special Branch was against it.

266
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:05,540
I want to be briefed about it.
Find out what Monberg was told.

267
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:10,915
- Did Monberg keep a diary?
- I could call and ask his wife.

268
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:16,290
No. Let me. Meanwhile,
you can talk to Karina.

269
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:20,707
I ask her to pop in, to thank her,
and get her to resume her work.

270
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:25,457
She can't. There are disciplinary
proceedings. She's being replaced.

271
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,790
Dial the number
of Monberg's wife.

272
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,207
We can't ignore what she's done.

273
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,207
She even used her password
after she was fired.

274
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,749
- Talk to her.
- No! I won't talk to Karina.

275
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,249
Good evening. Thomas Buch.
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

276
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,707
Can I talk to Hanne Monberg?

277
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,207
- Thomas said you wanted to see me.
- Yes...

278
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,249
No. It was his idea.
I wasn't informed.

279
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,207
OK.

280
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:18,040
I want you to know,
I enjoyed working here.

281
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,415
I admire your expertise.

282
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,332
But you can be a pain in the arse.

283
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,957
I've worn out three nannies
because I had to be here every day

284
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:35,957
to meet your impossible demands.
But it was never good enough.

285
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,790
- Everything must be done properly.
- Evidently it wasn't, anyway.

286
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:46,707
You're so uptight! My sleeping
with Monberg really disappointed you!

287
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:51,915
I'd just gone through a divorce.
But we don't talk of such matters!

288
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:56,249
When did you ever ask me
about my personal life?

289
00:24:56,375 --> 00:25:01,040
Never! But you are so prudish
whenever something happens

290
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,207
which doesn't involve
rules and regulations.

291
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,249
You deserve better!

292
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,749
Karina! How could you
ruin your career like that?

293
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,665
After all we've worked for,
all I've taught you. For a moment of...

294
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,874
How are you doing?

295
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,624
Monberg's wife said
he didn't keep a diary.

296
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,332
But he's regained consciousness.
His condition is stable.

297
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,249
We must talk with him
as soon as possible.

298
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:37,290
- I'll call the hospital.
- We must get to him before Rossing.

299
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,874
Get me an update on Raben
from our system.

300
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,499
And find out where the police
and Special Branch stand. Hurry up!

301
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,165
- Do you have a nanny?
- It's been seen to.

302
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,415
The coroner has checked his teeth.

303
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:09,624
There is no doubt
about the soldier's identity.

304
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:19,290
This is either going to be
Lund's funeral or yours.

305
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,999
Do you get my drift?

306
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,207
I will protect you,
but the matter must be cleared up.

307
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,832
Special Branch has found something.

308
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,374
They have tracked down Raben.

309
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,999
He abandoned the chaplain's car
and continued on foot.

310
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,499
- Have they caught him?
- König will inform us tomorrow.

311
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:49,249
Could you ask him
if there is anything we can do?

312
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,999
To think that
you could be so wrong.

313
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,499
And your pass, please?

314
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:20,415
I'll inform Gedser.
You can resume your work there.

315
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,082
Send Major Søgaard home.
I'll talk to Special Branch.

316
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,207
Let me have a word with you
in a couple of minutes.

317
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,040
Do you want me to drive you home?

318
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:03,040
- Thank you for...
- Lund, I'm sorry, it...

319
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:08,290
I'll call you tomorrow.

320
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,415
Give your mother
my best wishes for...

321
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,124
Raben abandoned the chaplain's car.

322
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:27,249
A Volvo was stolen nearby.
We found him at around 2:00am.

323
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,249
He slept for three hours,
then drove on.

324
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:35,082
He's near the barracks

325
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:40,665
- Why don't we get him in here?
- Raben is the last one of the squad.

326
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:47,124
- He is the next potential victim.
- So you want to use him as bait?

327
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,332
I could keep chasing fundamentalists.

328
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:54,249
But, sooner or later,
the killers will get to Raben.

329
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:58,207
- Our men can assist you.
- Thank you.

330
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:03,790
Our men are better equipped for it.
You need to regroup, since Lund...

331
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:07,457
We have dealt
with this lack of cooperation.

332
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,915
We're up and running.

333
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,207
That will please
the Ministry of Justice immensely.

334
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:16,999
I'd like you to look at these.

335
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:22,415
Refugees from Helmand, living in
Denmark for the last couple of years.

336
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:28,082
- They might be seeking revenge.
- Take a look.

337
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:33,499
Some to be watched, others questioned,
none to be exhumed!

338
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,707
Do you have a moment?
Lennart, we'll talk.

339
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,332
Why did Raben
take you to the woods at gunpoint?

340
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:51,707
I don't know.
Maybe because he's not well.

341
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,499
He is under enormous pressure.

342
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:59,499
I tried to reason with him.

343
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,749
War does strange things to people.

344
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:09,915
We found this in your church.
Anne Dragsholm's calling card.

345
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,582
- What was it doing there?
- Raben must have had it.

346
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:18,457
- Did you know her?
- No. Raben talked about her.

347
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,749
But I never met her.
Nor have I seen that card.

348
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,249
Can I go now?
It's Sunday. I have a church service.

349
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,999
Yes, all right.

350
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:39,790
- Special Branch is watching Raben.
- Why don't they bring him in?

351
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:45,540
- We do as they say. Take a look.
- We should check the chaplain.

352
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:50,790
Afghan refugees in Denmark.
Go see them.

353
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,832
- Lund suspected the chaplain...
- Lund is no longer here.

354
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,165
No more nonsense. Get moving.

355
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,290
What do we say, if anyone calls up
and wants to speak to Lund?

356
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,915
Say that she's attending a wedding.

357
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,707
I spoke to Møller's mother.
The family is suing for damages

358
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,665
for the pain and suffering
the police caused her.

359
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:24,082
I spoke to our former field chaplain.
He is shocked.

360
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,624
The question is
what Raben will do next.

361
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,624
He seems desperate.
He's the only one left of the squad.

362
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,415
He must be under extreme pressure.

363
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:38,790
It's best to keep your eyes and ears
open when leaving the barracks.

364
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:45,249
- Have you informed Louise?
- He was one of the best.

365
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:48,915
When others gave up,
Raben had 10% more to give.

366
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,457
A pity he didn't hold out
in the long run.

367
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,749
Did we get to the bottom of it,
the things Raben and his squad claimed?

368
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:05,749
- How certain were we?
- 100% certain. Why?

369
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,707
These past few days have been tough.
I could relieve you.

370
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,832
That won't be necessary,
Thanks all the same.

371
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:30,832
Are you hungry?
Do you want a sandwich?

372
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,499
Here.

373
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,124
We only have a couple of minutes.

374
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,207
You must leave the barracks!

375
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,082
- What did you do to the Priest?
- Nothing. They're lying to you.

376
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:08,082
About what? My father told me
about the incident. You feel guilty.

377
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,707
- It's not that.
- Then what?

378
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:14,957
They are covering up
for something an officer did.

379
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,124
- Who?
- I don't know. Søgaard.

380
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,790
- Maybe others. Your father.
- My father?

381
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,915
I don't believe it!

382
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:37,749
Get hold of Sarah Lund of the police.
Tell her to check...

383
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:41,915
Is it true you volunteered
when Jonas was born?

384
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,582
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me the truth.

385
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:58,624
Yes, it's true. Can't you see
they are trying to separate us?

386
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,874
It's not what you think.

387
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:09,874
After what I'd seen and done
I didn't deserve him.

388
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:14,082
- He was so pure. And I wasn't.
- Let go of me!

389
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,707
I've changed. I just want
to come home and be with you.

390
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:21,957
Let go of Mummy!
Let her go!

391
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,874
How you've grown!

392
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,832
It's me. Daddy.

393
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:50,374
- May I see? Smashing!
- Mummy, let's go now.

394
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,540
Don't try to see us.
Ever again.

395
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,290
- Would you rather wait here?
- No. It's OK.

396
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,499
- There he is.
- It's good to see you.

397
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,832
- How are you?
- All right.

398
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:32,374
It seems quite a storm
has been brewing.

399
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,374
Hello, Karina.

400
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,499
I'm glad you could take over from me.

401
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,957
Now, I can take better care
of this old heart.

402
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,749
I doubt I'm allowed
to eat chocolate any more.

403
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,707
Well... Evidently,
you have been informed.

404
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,040
I've been unwell for some time.

405
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:15,290
I don't want my family to suffer,
unnecessarily.

406
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:21,874
Of course not. We just want
to talk about that old military case.

407
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:27,249
The one you circulated,
just before you...

408
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:30,582
There's not much to tell.

409
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:36,124
I passed it on for Anne Dragsholm,

410
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,082
who I knew some few years back.

411
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:43,082
We had a meeting. She was getting
divorced. We talked about old times.

412
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:47,499
She gave me the folder as I was leaving.
The case meant a lot to her.

413
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,832
But I never got to look at it.

414
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,999
- Why?
- You already knew about the case.

415
00:36:56,125 --> 00:37:01,915
The Defense Minister had called
a meeting with you about a soldier.

416
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,124
A certain Jens Peter Raben.

417
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,957
I... I'm not sure I understand.

418
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,624
Just tell me what you spoke about
with Rossing at that meeting.

419
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,999
But that's several years ago.
I can't remember...

420
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:23,249
Frode! You withheld information
about that military case

421
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:28,790
from the police, Special Branch,
and the rest of the world. Why?

422
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,707
- What are you hiding?
- Karina, what's the idea?

423
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,665
Why have a meeting about the soldier?

424
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,040
- What did Rossing say?
- What are you on about?

425
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:44,540
You met with the Minister of Defense.
Later, Dragsholm brings the case up.

426
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,540
But you never let on.
Not even when she was killed.

427
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:51,415
If you've come to blame me for
your mistakes, I must ask you to leave.

428
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,624
What did Rossing say at that meeting?

429
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,124
Visitors again? That won't do.
I appreciate your concern

430
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,082
but the doctor needs
to examine my husband.

431
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:13,165
- It isn't good for him.
- My wife is right. I should rest.

432
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,165
And I do believe
the Minister was about to leave.

433
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,790
Right.

434
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,499
Thanks, Plough.

435
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:41,374
Krabbe is impatient.
He wants to talk to you.

436
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,874
I've been given 24 hours. Send him
back to the Prime Minister's office.

437
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,749
I suggest you issue an apology
for the exhumation of the soldier.

438
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:59,124
- Who organised that exhumation?
- The person in question was fired.

439
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,790
And not for the first time. As a chief
inspector, she solved a murder

440
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:08,749
and kept digging into
the involvement of local politicians.

441
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:14,790
I suggest you mention she's been
fired and that we expect to...

442
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,332
I'd like to talk to her.

443
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:22,540
You said she solved that case.
Maybe she knows something.

444
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:26,874
You can't. It will compromise
your relations with the police.

445
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,332
If Monberg won't talk, we'll have to try
something else. Get hold of her.

446
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:41,874
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

447
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,165
- You may kiss the bride.
- May I?

448
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,415
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

449
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:59,457
Now, let's have something to eat
and a drink, and another, and another!

450
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,874
You can tell
he was in the Home Guard!

451
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,124
- Congratulations, Granny.
- Thank you.

452
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,790
- About my being toastmaster...
- Yes! Keep the speeches short.

453
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:22,415
- There must be time for dancing.
- We must have our picture taken.

454
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,207
Here's the bell.
We've put the presents on the table.

455
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,290
Including the flowers for you.
Yes. The red bouquet.

456
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,207
- OK. Thanks.
- Everybody, take your places.

457
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,749
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Say cheese!

458
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:31,499
- Do you still work at police HQ?
- No, not for a long time.

459
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:36,957
I read in the morning paper
that they dug up a dead soldier.

460
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:49,082
I'm sorry, someone's here to see you.
She says it's important.

461
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:52,999
I've been looking
forward to making this speech

462
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:57,207
so I will get down to it,
straight away.

463
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,582
That's all right.
I'll wait a minute.

464
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:07,749
- Karina Munch, Ministry of Justice.
- A toast? Cheers!

465
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:14,165
This conversation
is purely coincidental.

466
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,582
What conversation, with whom?

467
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,207
Come this way.

468
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,582
Hi. Thomas Buch.

469
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:51,957
Karina suggests
we have met by coincidence.

470
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:55,374
But in truth
I'm in dire need of some answers.

471
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,790
If it's about the exhumation,
I'm really sorry.

472
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:04,290
Do you know about the accusations
against Danish troops in Afghanistan?

473
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,957
I'm not...

474
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:12,457
Are there any indications
of the killings of civilians?

475
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:17,582
You had better call
Lennart Brix or Ruth Hedeby.

476
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:21,082
Focus is on a certain officer.

477
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,874
Could there be a cover-up?

478
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,790
No. And there probably
wasn't any officer.

479
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:36,290
- Why did you dig up that man?
- That was a mistake.

480
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:41,499
I don't know anything.
I have to get back to the wedding.

481
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:46,374
What do you know about
the squad leader, Jens Peter Raben?

482
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,082
Nothing.
I thought he knew something, but...

483
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:57,707
They claim he is mentally ill.
He had good reason to escape.

484
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:00,457
He'd just been turned down.

485
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,749
- By whom?
- The Probation Service.

486
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,124
The doctors had given him
a clean bill of health

487
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,665
but the Probation Service turned
down his requests for parole.

488
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:18,207
And once again, recently.
He was probably disappointed.

489
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:22,332
Just a moment.

490
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,665
Monberg was working on a bill
concerning the Probation Service.

491
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,124
When was that abandoned?

492
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,249
Shortly after the meeting between
Monberg and the Minister of Defense.

493
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,374
We must get hold of Plough.

494
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:45,290
Thank you. And congratulations
on your mother's wedding.

495
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,832
You make me so happy.

496
00:44:54,958 --> 00:45:00,415
I just want to sing and make speeches,
all the time.

497
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:06,207
Sometimes I wish we had met
earlier in life.

498
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:13,457
But I'm sure we needed to have
some corners rubbed off first.

499
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:19,874
I'm so glad I walked into
the second-hand shop that day...

500
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:38,915
Long live the bride!

501
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:08,499
- Who brought these flowers?
- They were delivered by courier.

502
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,749
CHECK THE DOG TAG - RABEN

503
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,415
Now that we are all gathered,
I would like to continue what I started.

504
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,874
Dear Bjørn...

505
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,874
What's this?

506
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,582
You can't walk out
on your mother's speech!

507
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:52,374
Yes, that's exactly
what she's doing. And it's OK!

508
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,957
Get used to it, Bjørn!

509
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,832
The women of this family
are very busy.

510
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:04,124
- You'll just have to keep up!
- Now you tell me!

511
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:09,832
Where was I?
My dear, wonderful Bjørn...

512
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,582
I want to apologise.

513
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:44,040
I know I can't put it right.

514
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,749
I hope you understand
it was important to be certain.

515
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,957
I understand you won't speak to me.

516
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:58,499
But there is something I need to know.
No one else can help.

517
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:03,999
It's about your son's dog tag.
The chain with the metal name tag.

518
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,540
Do you know where it is?

519
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,499
No. They said they never found it.

520
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:18,874
They said it was lost, when he...

521
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,124
And it wasn't brought back
with his other belongings?

522
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:26,374
Why do you ask?

523
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,707
I think someone found his dog tag
and misused it.

524
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:37,082
Somebody who needed
to take on another identity.

525
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,207
I won't disturb you any longer.

526
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,832
Wait a moment.
I have something to show you.

527
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:47,624
Yes?

528
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:51,332
I thought it was a mistake.

529
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:56,999
Now and then things turn up,
as if Per were still alive.

530
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,999
For instance,
bills for various purchases.

531
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,290
The latest one
is from two months ago.

532
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,040
I must ask you to come
during visiting hours.

533
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:31,374
- I have no more to say.
- You needn't say much.

534
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,624
You were preparing a bill.

535
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,040
You promised your constituents
to cut Probation Service expenses.

536
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:43,457
- No more overcrowded prisons.
- We have no more to talk about.

537
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:48,124
And fewer mentally ill criminals
in the prisons.

538
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,749
Some of them were to be reassessed
and given parole.

539
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:57,749
One of them was Jens Peter Raben.

540
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,624
That's what Rossing
wished to discuss with you.

541
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,207
Strangely enough,
you withdrew your proposal.

542
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:09,249
- Nothing came of it.
- No...

543
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,082
- There were other reasons for that.
- I won't disturb you any longer.

544
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,415
I'll leave it to Plough
and the legal experts.

545
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,040
Wait.

546
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,707
- What do you plan to do now?
- That depends on you.

547
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:39,499
- But it doesn't look good.
- It wasn't my decision.

548
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,915
- What?
- I just wanted to do my job.

549
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,040
Rossing didn't want Raben released.

550
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,415
He was a security risk.

551
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:53,332
It was in the national interest
to keep him locked up.

552
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:56,957
- The national interest?
- He didn't elaborate on it.

553
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:04,957
- Raben knew something was amiss.
- I can't make head nor tail of it.

554
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,999
- Rossing told me what to do.
- But you found the reason.

555
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:13,207
When Anne Dragsholm
wanted to reopen the case.

556
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,124
What did Dragsholm say?
What had she discovered?

557
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,165
- I can't...
- Damn it! Tell me!

558
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:25,040
People are dying out there!

559
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:29,082
You're the one to take the blame,
not Rossing.

560
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:43,582
She had found proof that
the soldiers were speaking the truth.

561
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,999
Civilians had been killed.

562
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:52,457
It was an injustice
that Raben had been locked away.

563
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:56,499
- What had she found?
- The officer.

564
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,540
She had found the officer who did it.

565
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,915
That's all I know!

566
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,832
What happens now?

567
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:10,457
- Who was that officer?
- She didn't say.

568
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,957
- What am I to do?
- It will be all right.

569
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,415
You did right to tell me.

570
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,707
Excuse me, but I must talk to you.
It's important.

571
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:35,624
- Two minutes.
- Rossing won't say a word.

572
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,665
You can't make him.
You don't know him.

573
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,582
I got Monberg to talk. We must get
Special Branch over here.

574
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:54,915
- Krabbe demands your resignation
- Do you know that for sure, or...?

575
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,249
He gave the Prime Minister
an ultimatum.

576
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,124
Either you go or the Government falls.

577
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,665
Monberg is giving
an official explanation.

578
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:04,790
We'll take it from there.

579
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,915
It will all work out.

580
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:19,790
- Where is Monberg?
- He wanted a bit of exercise.

581
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:35,832
- Is it hanging straight now?
- Lift up the corner. And the other.

582
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:39,499
- Like that?
- Yes, that's it.

583
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,832
Right. There we go.

584
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,707
It looks great, doesn't it?

585
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,665
- I'll leave you to it now.
- Thanks for helping, Dad.

586
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,790
I'm sorry about
the things I said yesterday.

587
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:04,832
It's all right.
I've been a fool.

588
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:10,415
Join us at the cadets' ball.
I'd like you to come.

589
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:14,457
- It would do you good.
- I'm not in the mood.

590
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:18,249
- And I want to be with Jonas.
- Jonas is all right.

591
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,874
It's you I'm worried about.

592
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,499
Come on. It'll do you good.

593
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,832
I'll call the nanny.

594
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,665
It's just for a couple of hours.
We can leave when you like.

595
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:39,415
Of course, it's up to you.
See you.

596
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,499
What time are you going?

597
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:31,415
- Aren't you at the wedding?
- You must check something.

598
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:37,415
I'm standing here with an interpreter
at a refugee centre.

599
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:40,124
- I'll just step outside.
- Right.

600
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,999
What's up?

601
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:48,124
Someone used Per K. Møller's identity.
His dog tag is missing.

602
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,207
Purchases were made
in his name, recently.

603
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:54,290
Talk to the chaplain
or Major Søgaard.

604
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:59,957
Run his name through a computer
and see if anything else turns up.

605
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,915
I'm in Helsingør. What's up?

606
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,624
- When will you be back?
- In a couple of hours.

607
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:10,290
- Have you talked to Brix?
- No. Not yet.

608
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:13,124
I will. Of course.

609
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,749
I'm sorry. Bye.

610
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:26,040
Strange and the team
are still interviewing refugees.

611
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:29,582
- Any joy?
- They've run up some mileage.

612
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,249
What does Special Branch
say about Raben?

613
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:38,374
He was at the barracks until 11:00
and then approached his wife and son.

614
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,749
They argued.
Now he's back at the barracks.

615
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:47,124
- No trace of any perpetrators?
- No. Strangely enough.

616
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:52,040
König is right to focus on Raben,
him being the last man of the squad.

617
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:56,790
It won't be in vain.
Do you want to come for a bite?

618
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,457
Or are you going to sit here
and brood all day?

619
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,749
This came back from Forensics.
Strange had it checked.

620
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:07,124
- What is it?
- The calling card.

621
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,249
The one the chaplain
didn't know about.

622
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:16,207
- I'm done with the chaplain.
- It's full of his fingerprints.

623
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,415
Strange, seeing as he claims
to know nothing of it.

624
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:54,957
Hello?

625
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:01,915
Anybody there?

626
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,749
Hello?

627
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:19,540
Sarah Lund. Send an ambulance
to St Simon's Church, Vesterbro.

628
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:23,665
I just found the vicar.
He's still breathing, but...

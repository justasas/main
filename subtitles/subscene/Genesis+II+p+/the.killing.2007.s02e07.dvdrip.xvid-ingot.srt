1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,376
Ten days ago
a woman was murdered in unusual circumstances
.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,010
How many will follow me in death?

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,571
What does PET have on the group?
Raben was the squad leader.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,211
There was no one named Perk.
A lieutenant was called Perk.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,656
There may be nothing in the coffin.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,894
I informed Gedser you'll be returning to them.
I'm sorry that that...

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,452
We're up to four deaths.
Why don't we do something?

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,013
It's best that the Prime Minister
doesn't know.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,458
I've given Thomas 24 hours to
investigate certain leads.

10
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,459
May I enquire as to what investigations?
No..

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,457
He couldn't do the priest thing.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,092
Of course I was  in the camp.
They talked about him, captain..officer.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,299
Volunteered...you voluntarily joined
just before Jonas was born?

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,497
Don't try to contact us again.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,656
Why haven't we caught him?
Raben is the last survivor.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,940
You didn't know Anne Dragsholm?
I haven't seen the report.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,412
Check with the priest. Lund said...
Lund...She isn't here anymore.

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,493
Karina, what were you thinking?
To ruin your career.

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:32,259
Monberg's woken up. We need to
talk with him before Rossing does.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,448
I need to rest, I'm asking you to leave..
What did Rossing mean?

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,929
I need to get some rest.

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,936
Who was in charge of the exhumation?
You mean Jens Peter Raben?

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,254
He had just been denied
release from prison.

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,493
You'll get blamed!
Not Rossing.

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,096
She found the captain...the officer

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,616
Either you or he
betrayed the government.

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,136
Who sent the flowers?

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,770
Per K. Møller's dog tags
were never found.

29
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,013
It's obvious, talking to the priest.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,412
Her business card is covered
with the priest's fingerprints.

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,539
Send an ambulance immediately
to Simon Church.

32
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,373
Interview the chaplain
He said he didn't know the lawyer.

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,737
He's swamped us with lies from the beginning.

34
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,691
Lund, I don't have time...
The priest is seriously injured.

35
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,059
I've followed the suspect.
I'm located in the meatpacking district.

36
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,133
Send all the manpower
that you have available here.

37
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,330
Stay where you are. We're on our way.
Talk with the priest. He's seen him.

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,413
Lund stay where you are.
Don't do any more. Lund do you understand?

39
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,253
Yes.
No, wait.

40
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,938
Don't do anything else.

41
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,370
Lund!

42
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,690
Reports are coming in that ormer Justice Minister
Frode Monberg died earlier this evening.

43
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,012
He suffered a heart attack last week and has
 been being treated in hospital since then.

44
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,538
Frode Monberg had served as a Government Attorney for
nine years before becoming Justice Minister.

45
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,058
He was replaced by Thomas Buch, who was believed to have
been his last visitor at the hospital before he died.

46
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,819
The PM has reconvened Parliament because of 
the recent threats and deaths of military personnel..


47
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,213
If you hadn't pressed Monberg, he
would never have admitted anything.

48
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,056
How much did you push him?
It was necessary to do it.

49
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,499
You weren't there.
Buch, what exactly happened?

50
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,699
In Monberg's case,
he certainly was complicit.

51
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,049
If we don't do anything,
the Defense Ministry is off the hook.

52
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,050
Monberg is dead now straight after he was 'pressed'
I want to know what happened.

53
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,850
We need to focus on
what we do at the meeting.

54
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,094
Krabbe and the Defense Ministry will decide the 
anti-terrorism package. You're on very dodgy ground.

55
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,290
If the Liberal Party gets anything
on you now, you're done.

56
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,291
You've got to stay focussed and alert, the knives
are out for you now..

57
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:47,969
The meeting started five minutes ago.
We're awaiting your instructions.

58
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,057
We need to stop the meeting.
I'd like to know more about Monberg.

59
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:55,058
this was a statesman, a loyal friend and not someone who 
would act this way..

60
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,089
Why did you leave him?
What did you tell him?

61
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,334
I am deeply shocked by the loss
of a good colleague...

62
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,210
...and a great political figure,
but above all, a very dear friend.

63
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,534
It's an unbelievable loss in light of
the difficulties our country is in.

64
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,252
Don't defend him like he could do no wrong how dare you..
I need to know..want to know what happened!

65
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,130
What happened was he was up to his neck in deceit
and if he wasn't now dead he'd be facing impeachment!

66
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,018
Get the press over here!
Right now!

67
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,300
With all due respect: I have
far better candidates than him.

68
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,889
I expect and hope that when Buch is gone the 
Liberal Party will stop taking shots at us.

69
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,790
He has proved to be a liability in our partnership, expect
a smoother relationship from now on..

70
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,655
We are prepared to finalise the
anti-terrorism legislation.

71
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,848
Once Buch is out of the way.
How will he be got rid of...

72
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,334
We'll fire him.
Buch admitted to irregularities...

73
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:01,335
..and stepped outside of what were his duties 
when pursuing these delicate matters...

74
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,959
Particularly the situation with Frode Monberg.

75
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
No..I think there is somthing to all of that..

76
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,692
Regardless of what happened tonight..in recent weeks..
I mean...

77
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,651
Frode had lost his focus, allowed his emotions
to get in the way of political judgement..

78
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,009
I'll just say that I'm being
a little bit cautious...

79
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,410
This whole matter has been beset with
problems and dare I say it..surprises

80
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,038
...when new surprises continue
to emerge almost daily..

81
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,039
It's difficult to reach agreement with these distractions..

82
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,375
The last one about an old military file
 was somewhat of a shock

83
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,898
Have you been listening to such nonsense?
That's just what I wanted to hear.

84
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:35,899
Glad you are listening..

85
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,135
Once we've completed and announced the anti-
terrorism deal, things will quieten down.

86
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,909
There are clearly now some very critical
questions for The Defence Ministry.

87
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,910
There has been a systomatic cover up reaching
top levels regarding the military.

88
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,608
The Minister of Defence will have to explain 
surpressing a two year old military file...

89
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,535
...that's possibly connected to the recent murders.
Despite the contents of the file there is.. 

90
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,569
Evidence to suggest that the Defense
Ministry deliberately failed to disclose

91
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,972
...information in order to cover-up
its own negligence.

92
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:15,012
Shortly before his death, Frode Monberg confirmed
my fears..we must now have a meeting about this.

93
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,696
You will be kept informed
during the process.  Thank you.

94
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,376
If fundamentalists aren't behind
the killings, then who is?

95
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,812
Is this what you mean that...
'things will quieten down'?

96
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,893
Lund surprised him in the church,
followed him and they ended up here.

97
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,733
Ready for you now..

98
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,939
Did the priest say anything?
No.

99
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,137
He died on his way to the hospital.

100
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,373
He was beaten to death.
And what did Lund say?

101
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,818
That we should check the dog tags
on the exhumed soldier.

102
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,258
I wish we'd checked earlier.
Get it done.

103
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,540
Call his mother. Find out
if there were dog tags or not.

104
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,569
Where is she?
She's back at the station by now..

105
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,095
We need to have a talk.
Right now.

106
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,531
But you didn't see his face?
Nothing distinguishable?

107
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,612
No. nothing that would help us..

108
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,931
Why didn't you call in before that?

109
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,817
You should have waited for back-up.

110
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,735
Are you okay?

111
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,817
I'll drive you home.
Is there anyone I should call?

112
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,418
No, I'm not going home.

113
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,210
My mom still has some wedding
guests staying at home.

114
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,616
Come

115
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:26,417
My place..

116
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,775
The Exhumation was risky,
but we had to close a line of enquiry

117
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,576
On the say so of a flawed detective's hunch..is that
all you needed to agree to it..

118
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:39,459
His dog tags were never found.
His identity has been compromised...

119
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,977
Lets get this straight regarding Lund and this case..
She is gone, history and made you look a fool..

120
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,816
...PET has been proven wrong. We
need to have a meeting with König.

121
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,656
König has no time. The Minister of
Justice has reached a verdict

122
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,878
And our problem with Raben..he is being monitored
by PET surveillance teams

123
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,777
Why can't you trust me for once, show some faith..

124
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,652
I'm not saying our information is flawless,
or that she has the answer

125
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,937
But if you could show
more confidence in me... other than

126
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,252
... at night-time meetings
in random hotel rooms...

127
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,095
I'll even forget the
conversation with König.

128
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,412
Yes. Okay. I'll see
what I can do about it.

129
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:48,016
Are there problems with the other men?
Yes, but we'll get a handle on it.

130
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,412
The only survivor from the group left now
is your son.

131
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,697
Your former son in law.

132
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,296
What do the police know?
Are they saying much?

133
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,457
I don't know much about it. How
is the deer hunting this year?

134
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,458
Don't know...haven't been..

135
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,172
..If he attacked an army chaplain,
he must be very sick.

136
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,929
Yes.

137
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,610
Good evening.
Sorry, I came so late.

138
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,111
Søgaard, you came.

139
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,419
I'm glad you came.
There's not much time left.

140
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,676
I think Søgaard needs me to
offer myself up for a dance.

141
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,457
Yes...I would like to..

142
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,215
Excuse my directness..The point that I'm
trying to make is...

143
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,498
...that it won't be very long
before they get to Raben.

144
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,811
According to intelligence,
Raben's been found.

145
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,531
PET has him under surveillance
hoping to find the perpetrators.

146
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,658
Excuse me.... This is Jarnvig.

147
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,531
What do the police know?

148
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,375
Okay. Thanks, Bilal.

149
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,612
If you tell me the truth, you'll
be back at the ball in two minutes.

150
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,092
The officer I took over from,
said he was called Perk.

151
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,053
He had a dog tag with that name,
but it couldn't have been his.

152
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,216
There was no other officer..
There was, you or Søgaard covered it up.

153
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,017
You need to know this..

154
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,258
The priest was found murdered tonight.

155
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,259
Beaten to death at his church.

156
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,171
You need help.

157
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:11,172
I want to see the personnel files I need
to know who was there

158
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,652
That information is classified...and stored at Human
Resources you have no access there..

159
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,671
Incidentally,
you are being monitored by PET.

160
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,769
Turn yourself in, now.
Are they watching me now?

161
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,695
PET think they can find
the perpetrators through you.

162
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,172
You're just making it much worse.
Now we're just talking, I am on your side. Ok?

163
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,811
We'll talk quietly.
Keep your mouth shut. On my side?

164
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,290
I was on my way home.

165
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,930
I had fourteen days remaining.

166
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,456
Now it's been two years.

167
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,535
You could have done something, spoken up.
There was nothing to say that could help you.

168
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,933
It was you who destroyed
everything. For Louise, for Jonas.

169
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,697
What the hell are you thinking?
Why would I lie?

170
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,217
Why would the others lie?
I tried to stop him.

171
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,929
Killing was as easy for him
as blowing out candles.

172
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,936
He had the officer school logo
tattooed on his shoulder.

173
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:39,937
Ingenio et Armis

174
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,979
I just need to see him again...
I'll recognize him.

175
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,136
There's a way out the back.
The road leads out to the garden.

176
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,251
The Khazi's are that way,
down at the end of the hall.

177
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,413
My options were limited. it was
 the only thing I could do.

178
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,858
I had no doubt that it should be you when
I asked you to become my minister.

179
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,810
I knew I could trust you.
There was nothing in your political past...

180
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,816
that suggested that you would stab
your own government in the back.

181
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,734
Your accusations against the Defence Minister 
can't be withdrawn.

182
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,418
I'm not interested in a witch hunt..this needs
investigating and cleaning up..

183
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,291
Thomas..without documentary proof there is 
nothing. Rossing is a trusted minister.

184
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,853
Give me the opportunity to
question the safety committee.

185
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,094
I've no choice, after you went ahead and 
shared the documents with the press.

186
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,616
If there's proof of any of it, I want to know before
you ever pull a stunt like that again.

187
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,972
If there's no evidence...you're time is done.

188
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,168
I'll earn your trust. Thing's willl
be better from now on.

189
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,656
He was found in his church.
He died on the way to hospital.

190
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,735
Former army chaplain. Counting him,
the number of dead is now five.

191
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,212
Unless we count Monberg too..
But no dog tags?

192
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,632
No, The killer was disturbed by a police
woman. The priest was dying on the floor.

193
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,033
You mean Lund?

194
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,858
Yes..The priest was also on team Aegir
and had contact with Dragsholm.

195
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,535
All the victims may have had knowledge
about the incident in Afghanistan.

196
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,172
Everything was documented
and processed according to regulations.

197
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,810
Nothing suggests the killing of civilians.

198
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,496
Maybe there's a reason, after all they've made
a big effort to surpress the case..

199
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,495
No more of that. I have a pear.
We'll need to go through this carefully.

200
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:22,213
Karina do we know anyone who knows
the Defense Ministry from the inside?

201
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,977
I also want to know what Lund has found out
with respect to the mystery officer.

202
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,291
Lund isn't on the case anymore. She was removed 
after the exhumation

203
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,339
PET manages the investigations.
What's PET say?

204
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,617
They looked into what Monberg said.

205
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,570
They aren't convinced that it has
any significance to the investigation.

206
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,098
It's noteworthy that the soldier's
dog tag was never found.

207
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,095
Not really. And why should we be trying
to criminalise people in the army?

208
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,050
Not a damn thing suggests that
fundamentalists are behind it.

209
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,613
No...Aside from the connection with Kodmani...
Or connected with their beliefs.

210
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,738
This is Ruth Hedeby..

211
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,414
Yes?

212
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,209
Why aren't we investigating the army?

213
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,293
Lennert..Stop. I don't want to
 argue with you.

214
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,248
So, at least let's get Raben in for questioning.
Let us do our job.

215
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,016
That will have to wait.
He might have escaped.

216
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,417
Escaped..!

217
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,570
We're looking for him now...
...We'll find him.

218
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,173
We're still working on various theories.

219
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,457
You need to have a little confidence.

220
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,774
Lennart, dammit... If I knew there
was something being hidden..

221
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,172
...do you think I'd sit here
and lie to you?

222
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,458
That was the Justice Department.
letting us know some detail..

223
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,329
...about the conversation
Buch had with his predecessor.

224
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,176
Monberg had spoken to Anne Dragsholm.

225
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,176
She had found the officer
that the group had referred to.

226
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,053
Nothing's changed. We don't know
if anything happened then, the case is closed

227
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,738
The Ministry of Justice directive is
clear: Everything must be revealed.

228
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,896
If we encounter obstacles, the Minister
wants to be notified immediately.

229
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,291
You forgot your...

230
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,053
Thank you.
Then there's just one point.

231
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,773
No. Lund's not coming back.

232
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,853
Have you tried..a...38?

233
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,810
Yes. 38....
...And with extra cheese.

234
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,370
And a 38 with extra cheese.

235
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,531
Yes.

236
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,419
Si, si.

237
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,938
How's the head?
I took some aspirin.

238
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,536
I've got it.
You can't see anything.

239
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,259
It looks fine.

240
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,812
Yes, it stings a little.

241
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,491
I don't understand.
What don't you understand?

242
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,338
Why he didn't pull the trigger.

243
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,459
It doesn't matter now... No.
He could have killed me easily

244
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,012
It won't happen again...

245
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,017
That was bloody fast.

246
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,096
It's for you.
For me?

247
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,656
Excuse me for interrupting.
I'll be brief.

248
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,779
I've had a meeting with Lennart...
Brix listened and we decided

249
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,330
We moved a little too fast.

250
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,255
You are reinstated to your temporary job...
..effective immediately.

251
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,574
This is only possible because of
a significant change in attitude...

252
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,495
...within the Ministry of Justice.
Thanks.  See you tomorrow.

253
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,575
I want to stay on
until the case is closed.

254
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,814
I'll want to lead the investigation
together with Strange. 

255
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:13,015
 What else will you need?

256
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,929
We need to get all the officers from
Team Aegir in for questioning.

257
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,298
Fine. We'll do that.

258
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,659
Oh..Hey...Stop monitoring Raben, so we can
bring him in for questioning.

259
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,256
Raben's escaped.

260
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,779
It's regrettable but
that's where we are..

261
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,573
I'm tired and really need to sleep
The food's on its way.

262
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,018
It'll keep until tomorrow.
Okay.

263
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,335
Lund never saw his face and so
 we are working on a theory

264
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,459
...that we think he is an officer or former
officer with Team Aegir.

265
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,011
The unit was led by 28 officers before it
was disbanded. All are potential suspects.

266
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,492
Track them down.Get them all in for
questioning wherever they are.

267
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,448
Per K. Møller's ID tags
were never found.

268
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,737
Someone has been using his identity.

269
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:35,578
We need to check through these receipts
for things bought in his name.

270
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,975
we need to carefully work backwards to when

271
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:41,976
Anne Dragsholm found the officer
who called himself Perk.

272
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:50,739
We have to find out
how she located him.

273
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,213
Intelligence recorded the details of 
everyone who attended the cadet ball.

274
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,454
What did they say about Raben?
He left the car there.

275
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,455
He entered the building where they lost him

276
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,171
After the party, he disappeared.
His wife and the Colonel stayed there.

277
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,051
Nothing suggests that they made contact.
He's doing the same as us. investigating.

278
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,338
What does it have to do with
the ministers of Justice and Defense?

279
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,891
We need to ask..there are lot's of unans.....
Don't get ahead of yourself..

280
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,529
Have you checked Søgaard's background?
Yes it's very interesting...

281
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,889
We're about to send a new team to
Afghanistan. This is very inconvenient.

282
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:48,579
Where were you yesterday between 17:00
and 21;00 before you went to the cadet ball?

283
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,929
One of my officers wanted to talk to me
before the redeployment begins.

284
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,933
Who was the officer you saw?

285
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,211
Call me immediately if you find a problem.
Otherwise it'll be half a year.

286
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,076
Yesterday you also spoke with
the chaplain. Why did you call him?

287
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,077
Is it now illegal to call an old friend?

288
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,657

Were you afraid he would talk?

289
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,017
About what? Raben had attacked him.
I wanted to make sure he was ok.

290
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,297
Dragsholm had contacted the chaplain...

291
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,851
...because she wanted to reopen
an old military case.

292
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:29,352
If you say so.

293
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,571
Back then you said that Raben was
unpatriotic and cowardly.

294
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,895
It's true. Raben's behavior harmed us all.
Put safety and care at risk.

295
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,690
What's your relationship with Raben's
wife? You drove her home yesterday.

296
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,694
How long have you actually
known her?

297
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,738
Five years ago
you gave you the order ...

298
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,055
...for some cadets to be tied to a tree.
For some minor breach of rules...

299
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:58,156
A minor breach of rules..the service without
rules and discipline is worthless..

300
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,214
Civilians don't understand what it means
to put your lives in the hands of others.

301
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,690
In war you need to trust each other.

302
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:13,732
Raben's group failed because they were
accusing a Danish officer of killing civilians?

303
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,098
That would give you and your fellow officers
a good motive to cover up..

304
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,112
I won't say anything more
without a lawyer.

305
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,529
Get to the back of the line. There are
30 of your colleagues waiting to be seen.

306
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,894
So you left the military college together?
Søgaard gave me a lift home.

307
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,339
Did you notice anything unusual? There
were armoured vehicles everywhere.

308
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,698
Pressure Dressings,
painkillers, morphine, etc.

309
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,172
What about the day Gruner was killed?
I've already said.

310
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,859
We met Søgaard by accident, and he
gave us a lift back to the barracks.

311
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Anything unusual in his behaviour lately?

312
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,140
I don't know if he's been
in Sweden with explosives...

313
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,610
...but I don't think he was.

314
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,093
He helped me to paint and then
we went to my dad's place.

315
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,733
Good. Thank you. You'll hear from us
if there are developments.

316
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,234
Could you check my innoculations..

317
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,170
Sorry. Just two seconds.

318
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,171
I need the key to the store room
to pick up the rest of our kit.

319
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,172
Yes of course, no problem..

320
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,099
I'll handle it later.
We're busy right now.

321
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,492
I want everything to be ready
before Jonas comes home.

322
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,859
That idiot from yesterday has come to visit..

323
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,575
Police have focused their attention
on officers from Team Aegir.

324
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:04,576
Tell me what they say...what they think..

325
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,956
They seem to think that there's a
military connection with the murders.

326
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,537
Madness. They're our best people.
Not determined terrorists.

327
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,013
We'll do what we can to help the police.
No point in impeding their work.

328
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:24,176
Only the police? Jens Peter Raben
was at the military college last night.

329
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,460
Did you know?  No. Why?
What did he want?

330
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,738
He's also interested in the officers
 who made up the unit

331
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,928
Raben succeeded in shaking off
the Intelligence tail.

332
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,854
Early this morning we had
a break-in at Human Resources.

333
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,889
Raben was detected on the surveillance
camera.No doubt it was him.

334
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,850
All officer records from
Team Aegir are missing.

335
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:36,794
Report: Captain Torben Skåning

336
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:39,922
mentally unstable, tantrums

337
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:02,339
Three soldiers died during the mission.
The Ministry of Defence was informed.

338
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,336
Reportedly, a local family was executed
by Danish soldiers.

339
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,369
Is there any evidence?
No.  Only the provost report.

340
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:19,137
The soldiers all claimed that the officer
they came to the rescue killed civilians.

341
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,170
The story was dismissed as Taliban
propaganda and the unit was withdrawn.

342
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,891
What caused them to change their minds?
They didn't answer that question.

343
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,530
They're all dead.  So be it.

344
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,854
Any news about Raben?
No. They keep us informed when there is anything.

345
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,856
The Minister of Defence knew there
was something wrong with the case.

346
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,368
Connie Vemmer, a journalist, wants
to see you.  She can join the queue.

347
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:59,412
She knows something about Rossing.
She used to worked for Defence.

348
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,658
Come

349
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,330
I worked for the press service at the
Ministry of Defense...

350
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,334
...when the case came up two years ago.

351
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,736
On the day the soldiers were buried,
the minister gave a speech...

352
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,577
I was at work and received a fax...
Anonymously, from Afghanistan.

353
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,892
Is it okay if I smoke?
No.  But go ahead.

354
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,015
Thank you.

355
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,048
Where was I?
There was a fax.

356
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:01,092
It was a medical report from the
field hospital where the casualties were.

357
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:08,769
There was a mismatch between the
collected limbs and body parts.

358
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,333
Mismatched, how?
They had one hand too many.

359
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,456
A hand?

360
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,535
It wasn't a soldier's hand.
The hand of a dead civilian?

361
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,498
A logical conclusion.

362
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:31,498
I gave the fax to the secretary and
thought the matter would be investigated...

363
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,690
...because it supported the soldiers'
allegations. But nothing was done..

364
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:42,456
There was no response.
The fax isn't in the case file.

365
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,135
You need to come and explain this
to the Security Committee.

366
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,339
I can't. I'm subject to the
Official Secrets Act.

367
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,778
I risk being charged with treason.

368
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,697
Otherwise, I'd have written about it.
If you want to make a deal...

369
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,409
I've been waiting for someone
to take up the matter.

370
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,176
If you will not testify,
I can't use a damn thing.

371
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,457
What's this?
The Fax.

372
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,011
I made a photocopy,
before I gave it to the secretary.

373
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,210
Thank you.

374
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,857
We don't know her. I've got a
very bad feeling about this.

375
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,932
Sorry for the delay. I apologise.

376
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,536
We're here to consider the allegations
made by the Minister of Justice...

377
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,252
....against the Minister of Defence in
connection with the military matter.

378
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,130
Present are the Ministers of Interior,
Foreign Affairs and Defense...

379
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,293
and now finally the Justice Minister

380
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,251
In August, two years ago, an incident
was reported in Afghanistan.

381
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,552
It was alleged that civilians had been
brutally killed by Danish troops

382
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:23,253
while serving in Afghanistan.

383
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,095
Hereinafter referred to
as the 'Helmand' matter.

384
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,532
Raben stole information about
the officers in Team Aegir.

385
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:32,533
He's clearly trying to track someone down

386
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,656
We need to get hold of him.

387
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,690
He must have a car again. Find out
which cars have been reported stolen.

388
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:43,191
Trace as many as possible

389
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,658
Sorry.

390
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,209
Excuse me.
There's something you should look at.

391
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,259
Lund... look here.

392
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,813
They had to go and find him. He didn't
appear for questioning. Lund...

393
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,610
Yes. Who is he?
Lieutenant Peter Lænkholm.

394
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,534
He was kicked out a few years ago.

395
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,850
Thank you.

396
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,772
I'm not in the army anymore
so I can't really help you.

397
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,013
You were in Team Aegir? What do you
think about Major Søgaard?

398
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,729
Super.
He taught me at the military college.

399
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,690
I thought he was great.
I chose to serve under him.

400
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,059
You didn't serve very long.
I went to Afghanistan.

401
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:54,853
It says here that you were uncooperative
and had disciplinary problems.

402
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,571
I'm not saying anything about Søgaard.
The thing is, he is my friend.

403
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,072
I'll tell you something friend..

404
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,973
You have enough marijuana at home for an
extended vacation in prison. Get me? Huh?

405
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,736
But I'm not a dealer.
Tell us about Søgaard.

406
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,017
What went wrong?

407
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,599
As long as you follow the rules,
there's no problem. He's cool.

408
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,000
But you didn't follow the rules.

409
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,739
I smoked a small joint. I wasn't more
of a problem than the damn Taliban.

410
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,370
And then they kicked you out?

411
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,135
No. Søgaard kicking people out
was not his style of doing things.

412
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,258
It was a serious challenge to his command.
What then?

413
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,730
They pick you up at night
when you're asleep.

414
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,213
They tie you down
with zip ties and gaffa tape.

415
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,056
So, they hang you up
with a flare in your ass.

416
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,575
A flare?

417
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:07,373
Yes. And that's not nice, I can tell you.

418
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,020
Did anyone help you?

419
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,576
Søgaard is God. Nobody does anything
without his say-so there.

420
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,409
What about Raben and his group?
How did Søgaard treat them?

421
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,733
Not particularly well.
They were in deep shit.

422
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:44,691
How did you know that?
We heard the rumours.

423
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,216
And an officer was sent home.

424
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,090
Søgaard simply had the officer
 flown home early.

425
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,018
He did something worse than smoke
marijuana.  What was his name?

426
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,889
His name was Skåninge.
Okay. What else?

427
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,257
I don't know.

428
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,730
Is this him?

429
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,815
Fine.

430
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,688
He's not answering. It sounds like
his phone's turned off. Come on.

431
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,729
Why wasn't parliament informed
of the allegations?

432
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,451
We are fighting a war, we don't bring
to parliament every piece of Taliban propoganda

433
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:07,057
No-one at your ministry suggested that the
claimed civilian deaths should be investigated?

434
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,929
Come on, Buch. The Minister of Defence
has already answered the question..

435
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,532
Can we now finally find out
what this is all about?

436
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,377
What's this?
A report from the field hospital.

437
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,695
It was faxed to your ministry, on the
same day the soldiers state funeral.

438
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,809
There was one hand too many
among the body parts.

439
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,529
Apparently from an Afghan civilian.
How do you know that?

440
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,772
The doctor concluded that the alleged...

441
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,649
...civilian deaths should be investigated.

442
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,859
The case was investigated and the truth is Buch...
there were no grounds to do anything

443
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,094
You didn't do a damn thing, you failed your duty..
You saw the report. but did nothing...

444
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,618
..and you kept Monberg quiet with nonsense 
and flim flam about national security.

445
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,730
And when the first victim was found,
you still didn't do a damn thing.

446
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:25,135
Five people have been killed.
And perhaps they didn't have to die.

447
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,814
Does the Minister have an explanation?
Yes, of course.

448
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,658
The fax wasn't included in the file
because there was an inaccuracy.

449
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,956
Nonsense. Time, date place are
indicated on the fax. Everything is there..

450
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:45,957
If you'll get of your high horse
and allow me to finish..

451
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,178
A closer examination revealed that
hand belonged to a suicide bomber...

452
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,636
...who tried to blow up
the besieged building.

453
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:55,737
The evidence in the fax should have been investigated..

454
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:02,016
But still... There is the corrected
medical report that we received later.

455
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,174
I don't want to waste your time.
You may read the report.

456
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,050
I think it's been a bit of an ordeal.

457
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,500
How did you know
I'd talk about the fax?

458
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,572
You ignored the experts. You forced
police and Intelligence ...

459
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,609
... into a smear campaign against our brave soldiers
serving in Afghanistan.

460
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,059
You pressured Monberg when he didn't feel well!
God knows what you did to him.

461
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:41,340
And now you push responsibility
for your own ineptitude on me.

462
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,529
Your husband isn't answering
his mobile. He's not home.

463
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,490
Then try...
No, why?

464
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,138
When was that?

465
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,937
Okay, good. She doesn't know
why he's not answering.

466
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,970
Skåninge is studying Afghan
and went to the library today.

467
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,898
And later?  Two hours ago,
someone called. She didn't know him.

468
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,294
Hello.  I thought you were never coming back.
Ah I was held up, traffic.

469
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,738
I'll get going then
Good luck. Bye.

470
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:24,211
The Minister of Defence
refutes all your allegations.

471
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,376
Will there be an official apology
from your side, Buch?

472
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:30,377
More embarrassment for the government
 are emerging about Thomas Buch

473
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,091
Political commentators describe Justice 
Minister Buchs future as highly uncertain...

474
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:40,095
...after what is seen as a massive political
blunder that has seriously damaged his future

475
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,017
Analysts expect the People's Party
will insist on the Minister's departure...

476
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,053
...and use the political situation
to defeat the anti-terrorism package.

477
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:54,076
It was the journalist for sure.
Yes yes, you were right..

478
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,133
The Minister of Defence stuffed us.

479
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,339
Nobody was really slandered,
I'm happy and relieved that...

480
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:08,018
...the Minister of Justice has been
asked to withdraw his accusations.

481
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:17,414
It's my own fault.
The Defence Minister was right.

482
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:24,133
I pressured Monberg too much.
I continued to pressure him.

483
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,896
I didn't think for a moment about
his condition. Not a single moment.

484
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,178
You had good reason.
You were onto something.

485
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,537
Apparently not.

486
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,969
Sorry. Can I just talk
to you for two minutes?

487
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,372
I hope that you won't gloat. It's a bad
time.

488
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,373
 I don't want to...
May I smoke?

489
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,570
...talk about the anti-terrorism package.
And I don't want to suck up to you.

490
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:00,895
I know I'll get my anti-terrorism package
through and I still want you out.

491
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,976
But how confident are you about
the charges against Rossing?

492
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,277
Why'd you ask?

493
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,492
Surely, it is not something
that you'll lose sleep over?

494
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,096
You still believe there's something to it?
Why are you asking?

495
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,778
I saw that the Minister of Defence
was exceptionally well-prepared.

496
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,638
Maybe even a little too well-prepared.

497
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:23,639
Yeah..

498
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,640
He was very well prepared.

499
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:31,569
I got a tip about an important fax. It
was probably arranged by Rossing.

500
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,619
And I went in with both feet.
Satisfied?

501
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,477
Did you tell anybody about the fax before the
meeting? I imagine you kept it all quiet..

502
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:42,578
Yes of course I wanted to
 catch him off balance..

503
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,617
So only you and your staff knew.

504
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,618
Krabbe It was a set up..

505
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,375
Was the Prime Minister aware?
Of course The Prime Minister knew

506
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:57,216
I didn't realise the full extent...

507
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:07,891
Excuse me, the Prime Minister would like
to see you in his offices straight away..

508
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,417
Sorry.
I won't disturb you anymore.

509
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,890
Good luck and.......Thanks for listening.

510
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,849
It's fantastic. Come on.
Come along.

511
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,536
No filming, I'm too fat.

512
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,134
Nonsense, you're beautiful.

513
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,731
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

514
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,733
They've kept me quite busy.

515
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,257
I'll come back later.
No,  stay here.

516
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,091
Is your son home?
No, he's with my dad.

517
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:49,288
You haven't failed him, Louise.
You've held out longer than most.

518
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,817
There's something
I'd like your help with.

519
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,977
We'll try his house again.

520
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,738
Shut up. You said he was called Perk.
You had the ID tags. It was you.

521
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,335
Not true. Admit it, damn it.

522
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,698
I know it was you.
I came to your rescue.

523
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:39,933
Leave me alone. I was sent home
with a nervous breakdown.

524
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,013
I flew back with the wounded soldiers.

525
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,538
What soldiers?
Those from the 3-2-Alpha.

526
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:55,093
The survivors who were beseiged
for two days in a village.

527
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,254
You were on the plane?

528
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,533
Now leave me alone.

529
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,815
Raben...

530
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,810
Raben...

531
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,373
Put the gun down.

532
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,011
You're the only one remaining.

533
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,974
Raben, think twice.

534
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,572
Put the gun down and come
over here....Come..

535
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,493
It's okay. He's my colleague.
Just put the gun down.

536
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,497
Raben, put the gun down.

537
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,338
Put it down, damn it.

538
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,537
Put the gun on the floor.
Perk...

539
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,488
Put the gun down, I said.
Put the gun down, now.

540
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,654
Do as he says.

541
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,498
No!

542
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:21,499

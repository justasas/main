1
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:11,165
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:16,249
The Muslim League will avenge
the suffering Denmark has caused...

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,540
My blood will be shed
and many will die along with me.

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,957
Abdel Hussein Kodmani.
The video was on his website.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,249
Brix thinks
you can give us a new angle.

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,665
David Grüner, 28-year-old veteran.

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:36,124
- What do you know about the squad?
- 3-2-AIpha. Eight soldiers.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,832
Raben was squad leader. There were
accusations of civilian casualties.

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,957
- The judge advocates cleared them.
- And the rest of the squad?

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:52,249
Raben is on the run.
We are looking for Lisbeth Thomsen.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,374
The Government has put a lot of work
into the terrorism package.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,249
- Will you be Minister of Justice?
- Why didn't we see this coming?

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,165
We never imagined such madness.

14
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,832
It seems you're on your own
with the People's Party.

15
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:15,624
- We want a national agreement.
- The Minister will see reason.

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,124
The Prime Minister wants to see you
and the Minister of Defense.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,999
- Monberg knew the first victim.
- Do you listen to rumours?

18
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:31,999
We must take action.
Agree to the People's Party's demands.

19
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,915
- The Probation Service turned you down.
- Why?

20
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,874
- Why can't I see him?
- Myg Poulsen has been killed.

21
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,290
Raben knew both victims.
He lied about it and escaped.

22
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:54,290
I must find Thomsen.
She's the only one left of our squad.

23
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:59,624
- Turn yourself in.
- Tell me if you hear from Jens.

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,249
- She had an uncle. In Sweden.
- It's in this file.

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:11,165
Has he been here? Someone made off
with five kilos of plastic explosives.

26
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,040
Thomsen is living
on the Swedish island of Skogö.

27
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:22,665
- The police are expecting Raben.
- He's not likely to find this place.

28
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:27,582
- How can you explain the anger?
- I'm sick of those accusations.

29
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:32,249
Raben and the squad risked their lives.
Don't slag them off.

30
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,624
- You're not alone on the island.
- Stay there!

31
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,832
- Something happened in the village.
- Why do you think so?

32
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:49,790
My dead mates had talked about
some fucked up officer called Perk.

33
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,124
- The lawyer believed them
- Dragsholm.

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,457
- Come out, or I'll shoot.
- Stay here.

35
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:01,957
- Krabbe is getting impatient.
- We planned this press conference.

36
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:07,082
Dragsholm wasn't having
an affair with Monberg. I was.

37
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,540
- Did you see Dragsholm?
- No. And he told me nothing.

38
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,832
It's a judge advocate's report
on an incident in Afghanistan.

39
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,624
- I realise I must resign.
- The victims' names!

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,040
- What's happening?
- Get back to Thomsen. Now!

41
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,332
- I stopped you.
- Were you in here?

42
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,249
No. Why?

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,374
THE KILLING

44
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,790
They can't get far on this island.

45
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,415
- What's in that direction?
- Nothing. Just forest.

46
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,540
- And over there?
- More of the same.

47
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,165
20,000 acres of forest.
And Thomsen knows it well.

48
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,832
Bertil and Ralle
were trying to cut them off.

49
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:06,624
- But I don't think they saw them.
- Where is our backup?

50
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,415
They told me half an hour,
but knowing them it'll be longer.

51
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,957
- My brother-in-law is on his way.
- Your brother-in-law?

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,624
Yes. Had we known
you'd let Thomsen go

53
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,374
we'd be better prepared.

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,915
It was easy to get into the house.
Flimsy doors and open windows.

55
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,082
- Any traces of the suspect?
- Only Raben's.

56
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:40,374
We can't be certain, he didn't do it.
He was a soldier.

57
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,832
And that's a booby-trap
with a kilo of explosives.

58
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,790
Had Thomsen touched the rifle,
the house would have blown up.

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:53,332
Raben may have made the roadblock,
but not the booby-trap.

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,749
We must find Thomsen and Raben.
Why the hell...

61
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,415
My brother-in-law and his mates.

62
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,499
They found Thomsen's car.

63
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,374
They must have continued on foot.

64
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,665
Come on!

65
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,207
- What's wrong?
- Could you...

66
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,665
Come here.

67
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,749
- How far is it?
- It's still some distance.

68
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,582
Be careful.

69
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,457
- Someone was in your house. Who?
- I didn't see anyone.

70
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,540
- I haven't used the rifle lately.
- What's going on?

71
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:31,499
The lawyer came to see me.
She asked me to testify again.

72
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,999
- She wanted to reopen the case.
- Why? What did she say?

73
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:40,582
- She'd uncovered new information.
- What sort of information?

74
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,582
She wouldn't say.
What happened in that village?

75
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:52,707
- I don't know. What else?
- That's all she would tell me.

76
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,290
- Did you do wrong? What happened?
- I can't remember, damn it.

77
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,457
I remember the screams.
The stench of death.

78
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,415
The children trying to...

79
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,374
He called himself Perk.

80
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,290
Did anyone survive?
Is it someone seeking revenge?

81
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,124
They've found the car! Come on.

82
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:40,582
- Why did he need explosives?
- He didn't. I told you!

83
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,415
The codes for the ammunition depot
are in your father's computer.

84
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,207
Jens wasn't here.
I accessed that computer.

85
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,957
I know nothing of your explosives.
He wanted to find Thomsen.

86
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,082
I found the address
of her uncle in Sweden.

87
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:01,040
- So you met. Where?
- It doesn't matter.

88
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,790
It does! He's wanted.
And you are an accessory...

89
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,665
In a car park. OK?

90
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,374
- He just turned up.
- Have you planned to meet?

91
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,457
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

92
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,582
Yes? Come in.

93
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,374
The police have searched the depot
for forensic evidence.

94
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,999
The colonel's code was not used
to gain access.

95
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:39,499
They wish to speak to you. They've found
explosives identical to ours.

96
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,207
- Where?
- On an island in Sweden.

97
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,749
It was placed in a house
belonging to Lisbeth Thomsen.

98
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,915
Where was Jens heading?

99
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,415
He didn't say.

100
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,457
But he was asking about
Thomsen's house in Sweden.

101
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,582
Now that they've found the explosives,
there's no danger.

102
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,332
Will you let me know
if the police mention Jens?

103
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:26,707
Of course.
The police will want to speak to you too.

104
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,457
But it won't be as bad as this.

105
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:10,332
The number you called
cannot be reached at the moment.

106
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:17,665
- They were here, not so long ago.
- Let's see.

107
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,665
Perhaps they chose the footpath.

108
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,374
- Where does it lead?
- East. Towards the harbour.

109
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,332
- What's in that direction?
- A caravan park, but it's closed.

110
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,415
- Is there a harbour?
- It's just a landing stage.

111
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,040
Thomsen owns a boat!

112
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,165
Inform the coast guard!
We must search this area. Go!

113
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,374
They found the car. And they know
where my boat is moored.

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,749
- They've called the coast guard.
- Never mind. Come on.

115
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,207
No! Take this.

116
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:10,290
Row north. I'll go the other way.
The coast guard will follow me.

117
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,749
- We stay together!
- It will give you a head start.

118
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:20,040
The police will let me go.
It's our only chance.

119
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,290
We'll stick together. Come on.

120
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,082
Fuel! We don't have any fuel.

121
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:32,290
There's a jerry can in my boat-shed.
Over there. You can't miss it.

122
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,665
There are no bogeymen!
Hurry up.

123
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,457
Thomsen! Stop!

124
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,082
Stop! Don't start it!

125
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,540
- Take the kayak. See you.
- Stop!

126
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,290
- The Minister is coming.
- We can't wait any longer.

127
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,957
- The Prime Minister is on a plane.
- The news is going on air.

128
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,624
- What is happening?
- Keep calling him. I'm sorry.

129
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,874
Something's come up. I must
discuss it with the Prime Minister.

130
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,290
- What is it?
- Can't tell you, but it's important.

131
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,999
I don't believe the Prime Minister
would want this postponement.

132
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:24,124
The investigation may influence
the ban on Islamic organisations.

133
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,749
Buch...
Will you stop stalling, damn it!

134
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,874
Our country is waiting
for us to take action.

135
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,957
- Don't be so bloody soft.
- Krabbe, I've had enough...

136
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,624
I don't give a damn!
And neither does the Prime Minister.

137
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,540
I demand an explanation now.

138
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:50,415
Or I'll tell the press the Government
is incapable of making decisions.

139
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,915
I'm sorry,
but it's your responsibility.

140
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,457
I won't be made accountable
for your indecision.

141
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:03,082
The reporters are anxious
that you'll be too late for the news.

142
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,707
You may be nervous,
but this is a historical crisis.

143
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,540
Let us go and tell them
what we agreed upon.

144
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,790
Good evening.

145
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,915
Good evening and welcome.

146
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,790
The Government is pleased
to present the terrorism agreement

147
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,124
which has been reached
with the People's Party.

148
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,707
Terrorism has become a fact of life

149
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,832
so we must be up front
with improving security.

150
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:48,415
These threats must not force us
to compromise our democratic values.

151
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,540
We must protect our freedom
and fight dark forces.

152
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,874
Since the recent killings
of demobilised soldiers

153
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,332
this seems more urgent
than ever before.

154
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,290
Before we recount
the terrorism package

155
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,915
Erling Krabbe will say a few words.

156
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,707
Thank you.

157
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:18,457
The negotiations
have been lengthy and difficult.

158
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:24,582
But we have succeeded
in reaching an agreement.

159
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:31,374
I wish to commend the Government
for the good political work

160
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,790
and for having the courage
to take the bull by the horns

161
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:40,582
even if the Opposition
has thrown in the towel.

162
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:47,582
The People's Party makes a point
of guarding our freedom.

163
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:52,499
We will not be trampled
by medieval fanatics

164
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:57,249
hatched from Muslim schools
and organisations

165
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,707
subsidised by the Danish state.

166
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,499
We must take strict measures
against certain groups

167
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,165
who try to undermine our society.

168
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,499
Otherwise we sell out on the core
of our identity as Danes.

169
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,624
We can't allow that.

170
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,749
The People's Party is proud
to contribute to the new legislation.

171
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:26,207
The Minister of Justice
will give a summary of its contents.

172
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,999
Buch...

173
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,124
Buch!

174
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,499
Well... it's no good.
We'll have to stop this.

175
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:05,415
Yes. I'm sorry.
I can't go into details.

176
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,540
- Excuse me.
- What's going on?

177
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:25,790
The launch of the terrorism package
took a surprising turn.

178
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:30,582
Minister of Justice Buch walked out
during a press conference

179
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,999
having stated
that the terrorism package is off.

180
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,082
The Minister of Justice
had no further comments

181
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,374
but Erling Krabbe was astounded.

182
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,582
I can't reach König
at Special Branch.

183
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:52,624
Ask Karina to get whatever she can
on that old military case.

184
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,707
I'll do it. We can't be sure
about Karina's involvement.

185
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,707
It is possible, a disciplinary...

186
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,207
I haven't been here
since Monberg's 50th birthday.

187
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:24,832
These portraits should remind
the Minister of his responsibility.

188
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,957
- It doesn't look good, but...
- Are you aware of the reactions?

189
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,665
Do you realise the magnitude
of the crisis we are now facing?

190
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,207
It would be wrong to agree
on that terrorism package. Monberg...

191
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:41,665
Don't blame Monberg.
So you're still on about those allegations.

192
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,874
Not just allegations.
There is written evidence.

193
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,832
Monberg met with the first victim.
She was a lawyer

194
00:18:54,958 --> 00:19:00,624
and wanted Monberg to help her
reopen a military criminal case.

195
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,249
The case involved the soldiers
who have been killed recently.

196
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:10,290
A squad was accused
of killing civilians in Afghanistan.

197
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:15,374
The squad was cleared, but the lawyer
wanted the case reopened.

198
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:20,874
She gave Monberg the case file.
Five days later, she was killed.

199
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,415
- How did you get hold of this?
- Monberg circulated it.

200
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,124
I received it
just before the press conference.

201
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,832
Monberg should have
brought this up long ago.

202
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:40,915
We can ask him when he recovers,
but we must act upon it now.

203
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,249
Monberg didn't have a heart attack.

204
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,665
His wife said he took some pills.

205
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,540
He was depressed.
Their marriage was on the rocks.

206
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,665
She was devastated. We agreed
to give the press another story.

207
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:03,707
- That hardly improves the situation.
- What was Monberg trying to hide?

208
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,165
Why should he be concerned
with some old military case?

209
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,707
I don't understand it.

210
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,749
Look into it. Mum's the word.

211
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,915
We must know what it's all about,
as soon as possible.

212
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,707
Considering the latest rumour.

213
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,915
- What rumour?
- Something happened in Sweden.

214
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,874
It seems another soldier
has been found dead.

215
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,082
How were we to know she'd run off?
There's no trace of Raben.

216
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,374
They split before the explosion.
Maybe he got away in another vessel.

217
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,874
We're searching for the perpetrator.

218
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:59,040
The coast guard and the Swedish Navy.
We're doing all we can. Bye.

219
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,415
Brix and Special Branch
want a meeting.

220
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,124
Explosives were stolen
from the barracks.

221
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,415
They're checking if the same explosives
were used here.

222
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:27,165
We couldn't have prevented it.
We tried to help her, but she ran off.

223
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:35,624
They found a bag. Let's look for clues
in the boat house. Maybe...

224
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,457
Where are you going?
Lund!

225
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,332
Right. Thanks.

226
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:52,790
The bombing
of a Danish citizen in Sweden

227
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:57,540
was connected to
the so-called terrorism killings.

228
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:04,332
The victim was a woman,
previously connected to the army.

229
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:09,040
This makes her the fourth victim
in the unsolved terrorism case.

230
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,165
Neither Special Branch
nor the police have any...

231
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,624
What the hell
are they talking about?

232
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,749
Hedeby is in there too.

233
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,707
We mustn't give up now.
We're on to something.

234
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,665
No, we're not.
All we do is find the bodies.

235
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,665
What happened in Afghanistan,
we don't know for certain.

236
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,624
But some fundamentalists
find the soldiers guilty

237
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,665
notwithstanding
the judge advocate's report.

238
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:10,957
We've found websites
and fatwas against the soldiers

239
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:15,707
and the system that exonerated them.
We will concentrate on this.

240
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:20,165
Unfortunately, the investigation
has not solved the case.

241
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,957
I have asked Brix to restructure
his team as of today.

242
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,874
- What's the idea?
- You are still on the case.

243
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,415
- But you must take a few days off.
- We're just about to...

244
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:40,749
You let your main witness go
when the killer was in the area.

245
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,790
She ran off!
We could hardly put her in chains.

246
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:49,207
You knew some religious fanatics
were out to kill that squad.

247
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,165
You shouldn't have gone to lunch.

248
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,374
What if someone else
wants to get rid of the squad?

249
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,832
What if it's all a set-up?

250
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:11,290
The flyers, the video, Faith Fellow,
Kodmani, the Muslim League.

251
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,707
What are you saying?
What is she talking about?

252
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:20,499
Dragsholm asked Thomsen to testify
if the case was reopened.

253
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:26,082
What if somebody doesn't want
the case to be reopened?

254
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:30,165
Who would that be?
They are all dead!

255
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,999
And the last one with a good alibi
was committed to Herstedvester.

256
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:40,582
The army. The explosives
were stolen from the barracks.

257
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,040
And the detonators were like
the ones used in the army.

258
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:49,874
We're not sure the incident occurred,
nor if the case was to be reopened.

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,540
Yes. The reopening
of the case was on the cards.

260
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:58,957
I have only just been informed.
It's become a political issue.

261
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,207
But it has nothing
to do with the killings.

262
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,040
- It would explain a lot.
- The army doesn't kill its own.

263
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:10,082
Not the army as such.
Someone in the army, with a motive.

264
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:17,499
Rubbish! I expect to be briefed
when you've restructured your team.

265
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:24,499
I already have. Lund and Strange
will continue to work on the case.

266
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:29,540
It's in everyone's interest
to have this matter cleared up.

267
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:32,415
I'm sure you will understand.

268
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:36,540
If not, I will invite you
to see the forensic morgue.

269
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,790
We'll do it.
But they mustn't find fault.

270
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,749
- Agreed?
- Of course.

271
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:55,165
We'll investigate
the case from Afghanistan.

272
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,457
And we'll check out this officer Perk
Thomsen mentioned.

273
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,332
As long as you're discreet about it.

274
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,957
- What is she doing here?
- Hello?

275
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:15,082
- She met with her husband.
- How? She is being watched.

276
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:21,624
Right. She told him about
Thomsen's house in Sweden.

277
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,332
I have ordered a search.
Shall we set off?

278
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:56,040
The police have been here twice.
And Louise called.

279
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,374
FOURTH DANISH SOLDIER
KILLED LAST NIGHT

280
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,540
I need money.
Can you lend me some?

281
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,749
- For what?
- Just a couple of thousand.

282
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:12,749
This will have to stop.
You're the last one.

283
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,207
- Can I have some money or not?
- Turn yourself in.

284
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:21,165
Thomsen said the lawyer
wanted to reopen the case.

285
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:27,749
- What case?
- About what happened out there.

286
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,499
She must have discovered
something.

287
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:35,124
If I give up now,
they'll all have died in vain.

288
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:42,499
- Did Dragsholm contact you?
- Who?

289
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:47,332
- She was killed in Memorial Park.
- I never met her.

290
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,207
- You think I'm insane.
- No. I was in that camp too.

291
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:58,290
- They checked. There was no officer.
- It must have been a cover-up.

292
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,582
The same people are behind this.

293
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:07,415
You have a wife and son
to think of too.

294
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,290
- Just give me some money.
- I can take you to the police.

295
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,582
I could tell them you're innocent.
Trust me.

296
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,290
I just saw Thomsen get blown up.

297
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,499
Don't tell me
to turn the other cheek.

298
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,082
Now give me some money, damn it!

299
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,124
Don't you have a cash card?
You must have!

300
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:55,582
We excused your behaviour
at the press conference

301
00:28:55,708 --> 00:29:01,249
with the necessity to discuss
the case with the security committee.

302
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,290
After the latest killing,
the media calls it a massive blunder.

303
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:11,790
Several of your colleagues wash their
hands of you, Erling Krabbe for one.

304
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:18,374
- And the Prime Minister?
- He expects an explanation.

305
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,374
According to the Ministry of Defense

306
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,707
nothing connects Monberg
to the old military case.

307
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,874
But I've been wrong
about Monberg before.

308
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,332
- Didn't you see a change in him?
- No.

309
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:39,624
I suppose I didn't really know him.

310
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:44,749
We're here.
You'd better go in by yourself.

311
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:52,665
If there's to be a disciplinary case,
we should not be discussing this.

312
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:57,332
Damn it, Plough. She merely
had an affair with the Minister.

313
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:02,124
We can't be sure
that there isn't more to it.

314
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,665
You just don't want
to hear about Monberg's sex life.

315
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,624
I'd prefer not to.

316
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,415
- Hello?
- Just a moment.

317
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,207
PARALYSED

318
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,790
- Hi!
- Hi.

319
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,624
Sit here, darling.
Look in your book.

320
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:45,374
I'll give the nanny a hand
throwing this out. One moment.

321
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,832
- Hello. What's your name?
- Merle.

322
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:58,874
Come along, dear.
Lotte will help you get dressed.

323
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,415
I'm sorry. I must go to the post office.
Don't forget to let her wee.

324
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,957
If it's about my resignation,
I'll do whatever the Ministry wants.

325
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,624
If I'm a suspect,
they must take me to court.

326
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,832
- I didn't know you have a daughter.
- I didn't say at the job interview.

327
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:24,915
- Her father is a musician, it seems.
- No. That's mine.

328
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:32,540
Her father is a lawyer. He wanted
to earn a lot of money. In Dubai.

329
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,999
I would like you to come back.

330
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:42,624
I have misled you
and the Permanent Secretary.

331
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,374
Plough doesn't think
you've done anything wrong.

332
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,249
He could do with
a roll in the hay, too.

333
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,082
Sorry. But I need your help.

334
00:31:55,208 --> 00:32:00,374
I must find out how Monberg
is involved with all this.

335
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:06,332
Do you have any idea
why he wanted to hide these matters?

336
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:11,457
- I would have told you.
- Why all this secrecy?

337
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:16,749
- Why did he try to kill himself?
- What?

338
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,707
It wasn't a heart attack
He took some pills.

339
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:25,790
He probably had a bad conscience.
But I need some solid facts.

340
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,332
- I don't know what to say.
- Right.

341
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,790
If you think of something,
please call me.

342
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,624
I wish you all the best.

343
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,540
I'm on my way.

344
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:47,957
The Minister of Defense
is calling a meeting.

345
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:52,665
- What about?
- They didn't say. This afternoon.

346
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:55,082
Tell him we don't have time.

347
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,790
Major Søgaard
isn't answering his phone.

348
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:12,540
He's at the officers' send-off.
He'll get back to you.

349
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:17,499
Myg Poulsen was
in charge of ammunitions.

350
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:21,540
His key and access code
were misused.

351
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,207
His killer must
have got it from him.

352
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,290
Don't you cancel a code
when the holder dies?

353
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:32,957
It was cancelled, but the technicians
hadn't reprogrammed the lock.

354
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,165
Nobody imagined this could happen.

355
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,749
No... When I picked up the judge
advocate's report, there was no guard.

356
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:46,874
The depot is locked electronically.
Only seven people know the code.

357
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,165
- Normally, no guard is needed.
- What time was the burglary?

358
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:57,207
According to the log files,
the lock was disengaged at 0:39.

359
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,082
And once again at 1:04,
25 minutes later.

360
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:05,332
As you can see, the burglar
made his way in here.

361
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:10,832
I assume your forensic staff
can explain how.

362
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,540
The explosives
were taken from that shelf.

363
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:30,332
We've made a list of outsiders
who know their way about the barracks.

364
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:35,749
- How did Lisbeth Thomsen die?
- It could be an insider.

365
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:42,082
Maybe nobody noticed anything
because the burglar belongs here.

366
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:46,749
- A hole was cut in the fence.
- That could be a diversion.

367
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:50,540
- The burglar knew this place.
- Who else has access?

368
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,540
Three platoon commanders.
And two officers.

369
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,499
What about you?

370
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:01,665
Come with us to police headquarters.
We'll get back to you. Stay in town.

371
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:06,874
- Why?
- We want you in for questioning.

372
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,124
- It will have to wait
- Either you come voluntarily...

373
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,957
...or else we'll have to arrest you.

374
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:33,499
Yesterday, you told me no civilians
were assaulted in that village.

375
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,707
According to Thomsen,
3-2-AIpha gave a different account.

376
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,540
Yes. But they were proved wrong.

377
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,207
You lost three men.
Maybe you weren't quite focused.

378
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:47,499
So the squad was flown back
to the main camp.

379
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,665
What did the soldiers report?

380
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:58,582
They'd had a call from a patrol
under fire behind enemy lines.

381
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:02,832
On arrival they found
only one officer, Perk.

382
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,832
He'd been under fire
and they came to relieve him.

383
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:10,707
- What else did they say?
- They took refuge in a house.

384
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:14,874
They were under siege for 48 hours
without radio contact.

385
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,165
During this siege, something
allegedly happened to the family.

386
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,415
- What?
- The Danish officer killed them.

387
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,957
What did you think of that?

388
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,832
The report was pure fabrication.

389
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,665
Nobody could confirm that the squad
had received any such message.

390
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:43,499
None of our men were in the area,
nobody called Perk, and no bodies.

391
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:49,749
- Why would they lie?
- That mission cost three lives.

392
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:56,707
They were trying to shift the blame
for the tragedy they had caused.

393
00:36:56,833 --> 00:37:01,832
So you think squad leader Raben
was to blame for the tragedy.

394
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,415
I'm not obliged to answer that.

395
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:08,915
- What about the family in the house?
- Everybody had fled.

396
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:13,665
It was a dangerous area.
We did all we could...

397
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:18,624
- Did you yourself check all this?
- It goes with the job.

398
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,207
I wasn't in the camp during
the incident, but I was briefed...

399
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:28,790
- Hold on! You weren't in the camp?
- No.

400
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:33,915
I was at the Security Force's meeting
with the Afghan Government in Kabul.

401
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:39,374
My second-in-command kept me posted.
Everything was by the book.

402
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,415
Who was your
second-in-command?

403
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,082
Captain Søgaard.
Presently Major Søgaard.

404
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:50,165
- Søgaard was in command.
- Correct.

405
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,374
- I came back two days later...
- That will be all for now.

406
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:03,207
Jarnvig.
Hello. Just a moment.

407
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,749
- Any word from Søgaard?
- We've left messages.

408
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,707
He doesn't return our calls.

409
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:22,332
Special Branch is investigating
Islamic organisations

410
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:27,207
who maintain that Danish soldiers
committed atrocities in Helmand.

411
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,832
- Is there any actual evidence?
- I don't know.

412
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:36,582
König will brief you. They have
nothing on Monberg and the case.

413
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:42,665
They are complaining about lack
of cooperation with the police.

414
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,124
- Why's that?
- I'll look into it.

415
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:51,332
I have posted the vacancy
for your new Personal Secretary.

416
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:55,624
- I know of two, who...
- Do you have a moment?

417
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:02,832
You caught me at a bad moment.
But I'll be seeing you later.

418
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,457
Two minutes.

419
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:15,749
The Prime Minister briefed me.
We'd better have a chat.

420
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,790
Rossing, I realise
Monberg is a friend of yours.

421
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:31,290
You may not like what you hear,
but we must get to the bottom of this.

422
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:34,415
I remember
when I was first appointed.

423
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:39,374
You're anxious to make a good
impression on the Prime Minister.

424
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,790
- It's like going back to school.
- I'm rather busy...

425
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,957
You're digging a grave.
Not for Monberg, but for the country.

426
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:54,957
I know there is no connection between
Monberg and that military case.

427
00:39:55,708 --> 00:40:00,207
- If you say so.
- You need to realise this.

428
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,874
Frode has been under
extreme pressure for a long time.

429
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:10,165
The terrorism package negotiations.
A very unhappy marriage.

430
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,457
May I?

431
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,749
And then he was approached
by Anne Dragsholm.

432
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:22,499
For the past 15 years
she has been the love of his life.

433
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:28,124
They met at university. He was
a visiting lecturer, she a student.

434
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:34,124
But Frode had a wife and children.
He broke up the relationship.

435
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,749
I don't believe they have
been in touch since then.

436
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:47,290
Until now, when she made
use of her connection to him.

437
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,415
Is there a point to this?

438
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:03,249
Monberg wasn't interested in the case.
He wanted Dragsholm.

439
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,957
When she was killed
a few days later, he cracked.

440
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,582
I had lunch with him
a couple of days before...

441
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:21,249
He spoke of all the mistakes
he'd made in his life.

442
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,332
I had other things on my mind.

443
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,165
He was talking about
his break-up with Anne Dragsholm.

444
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,374
So you'd like me
to forget the whole thing.

445
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,665
No. I'm not saying that.

446
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,457
I want everything out in the open,
but not right now.

447
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:45,165
If you're kicking up dirt that only
concerns Monberg's personal life

448
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,915
you may as well
be setting fire to our flag.

449
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,124
It's your choice.

450
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,915
I'm just asking you to think
before you act.

451
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,790
Thanks for the coffee.

452
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:16,457
- Is this your address book?
- Yes. You won't find his in there.

453
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,082
We'll have to take it with us.
You'll get it back.

454
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,874
- Mummy...
- Hi, darling.

455
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,999
Did you have fun?

456
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:38,249
They're helping Mummy clear up.
They're leaving now.

457
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,540
- Did you like the zoological museum?
- Please sign here.

458
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:47,874
Hi, Jonas. Nice bag.
Did your Daddy give you that?

459
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:52,582
- Where are they taking our computer?
- So long.

460
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,707
It's all right, darling.
They just want to borrow it.

461
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,874
We'll buy a PlayStation
on Monday.

462
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,457
- Louise. Hello?
- It's me.

463
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,290
Would you mind coming over
to my office?

464
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,290
Come in.

465
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,124
He really isn't well.

466
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:46,790
He needs help. He must get out
of harm's way before it's too late.

467
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,749
Call him. Say you want to meet him.
Let the police see to the rest.

468
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:55,124
- I did. He doesn't answer the phone.
- Try again.

469
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,040
Try this one. One cool piece.

470
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:20,249
- How much are you good for?
- About 600.

471
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,582
600? You can't even
buy a gas pistol for that.

472
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,540
I'll have this one.

473
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,540
I need it. Get it?

474
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,332
Leave!

475
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:24,957
- Louise?
- My dad knows about this phone.

476
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:30,624
- How? Was it Priest?
- They are worried about you.

477
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,082
- Are you all right?
- Do the police know about it?

478
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,957
Not yet. Are you all right?

479
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,582
Priest says something's not right.

480
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,165
I know what I'm doing.
We can't talk now.

481
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:17,040
I'm looking for Major Søgaard.
Has anyone seen him?

482
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:25,957
"Jam tarts for breakfast?"
She gives him an icy look.

483
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,749
"That's all you can get
through the letterbox."

484
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,999
Hi.

485
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:38,040
I've been leaving messages all day.
You know I want to talk to you.

486
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:43,624
This is my last day with the officers.
We have a full schedule.

487
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:49,124
- It's about your stationing.
- With Team Ægir, right?

488
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,749
Shall I question you here?

489
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,249
I need to go to the john.

490
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:01,665
Unless you want to join me there too,
I'll meet you outside.

491
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:14,040
Go ahead. Shoot. But I know
no more than the colonel.

492
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:18,457
He wasn't in the camp. You must
have heard the soldiers' statements.

493
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,249
But I can't tell you anything
you don't already know.

494
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:26,290
The soldiers mentioned
an officer called Perk.

495
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:30,457
There was no officer.
And nobody called Perk.

496
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:34,957
They claim they received a distress call.
There wasn't any.

497
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:41,665
The squad leader should have
confirmed it before going in.

498
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,540
You don't like Raben, do you?

499
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,665
I didn't say that.
He used to be a good soldier.

500
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,665
How can you be sure
no atrocities were committed?

501
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:56,874
I led the operation that got
Raben's squad out of that mess.

502
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,790
So you were one of the first
to arrive at the scene.

503
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:07,040
- Correct.
- And you saw nothing significant?

504
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:11,665
I wouldn't say that. Three soldiers dead,
the rest of them wounded.

505
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:15,707
But I saw no civilians.
Neither dead nor alive.

506
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:19,999
A few months later, you were
decorated and promoted to Major.

507
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,665
Did it have anything
to do with that mission?

508
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:26,624
We did save the rest of the squad.

509
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:32,790
If anything happened in that village,
it would have been your responsibility.

510
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:37,957
Yes, but had anything happened,
it was no big deal.

511
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:41,582
War is a dirty business.
Innocent people die too.

512
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:47,374
Politicians send us to war, so that
you don't get blood on your hands.

513
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,332
Go.

514
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,582
Lund here. I want Søgaard's
alibi checked. Where was he?

515
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:11,540
Who did he see, what did he do,
around the time of the four killings.

516
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:16,915
Brix reports that they checked
officers stationed abroad after 1996.

517
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,874
There is no officer
by the name of Perk.

518
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:27,999
But some recruits were trained
by a lieutenant they called Perk.

519
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:32,999
- OK.
- His real name is Per K. Møller.

520
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,499
- He was on Team Ægir.
- Did you get his address?

521
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:50,457
Thank you very much.
It seems to tally.

522
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:55,707
Monberg was a visiting lecturer
while Dragsholm was at university.

523
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,874
They may have had an affair.

524
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,082
After that,
she applied for a job in the army.

525
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,582
I hope you weren't too rude
to the Defense Minister.

526
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:19,624
- I tried to call you. Where is he?
- He just went in.

527
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,749
- We can't talk about the case.
- That's not it. I must speak to him.

528
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,290
It's important.

529
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,499
- Thank you.
- I want a word.

530
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:35,249
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes, of course.

531
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:39,374
I just wanted to thank you.
I had lost perspective.

532
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,582
We must regard it
as being for a greater cause.

533
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:49,124
I'll propose to the Prime Minister
that we let sleeping dogs lie.

534
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,582
I'm pleased that we see eye to eye.

535
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,874
- Buch...
- Yes. What?

536
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,249
- Karina.
- Talk to Plough.

537
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,540
Monberg is connected
to the military case.

538
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:12,582
The lawyer complained
to him about procedure.

539
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:16,165
The soldiers' statements
were being disregarded.

540
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:21,082
- Monberg knew about the case.
- We've been through all that.

541
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:24,832
- If you've come to impress...
- At first, I found nothing.

542
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:31,040
Then, I cross-checked the soldiers'
names with the Ministry's files.

543
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:34,124
You don't have computer access!

544
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:39,415
The case went through
the Ministry of Defense.

545
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:45,165
But the Minister of Justice
attended a meeting about a soldier.

546
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,749
Jens Peter Raben,
who was committed to Herstedvester.

547
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:53,415
There are no minutes of the meeting.

548
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:56,957
Defense Minister Rossing
called the meeting.

549
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,874
Buch... We're waiting for you.

550
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,624
Come along, darling.

551
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:34,540
Those were Per Kristian's
favourite sunglasses.

552
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:41,415
Won't you sit down? My husband
is abroad, but I hope I can help.

553
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:46,749
- When did your son die?
- In May two years ago.

554
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,832
- May?
- Yes. In an explosion.

555
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:59,499
Leave her in peace. He died
three months before the incident.

556
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,290
I tried to talk him into
choosing another profession.

557
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:08,749
But he was an army man.
He wanted to make a difference.

558
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:11,915
He was promoted to First Lieutenant.

559
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,124
We hardly ever heard from him.

560
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:19,707
And then they phoned
to tell us what had happened.

561
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,249
He had the funeral
he would have wanted.

562
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:26,165
- That's a comfort.
- Maybe we should...

563
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,082
- Thank you for your time.
- Yes, but...

564
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:33,374
Has it to do with the investigation?

565
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,540
A lawyer was here
asking the same questions.

566
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,415
A lawyer?

567
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,082
We've kept his things.

568
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:51,582
Every time we're about to throw
them out, we have second thoughts.

569
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,290
The lawyer asked to see the documents
concerning his accident

570
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,874
in case we were entitled
to compensation.

571
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,915
When I came back, she was
searching through his things.

572
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,082
- What for?
- She wouldn't say.

573
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,999
She asked a lot of questions.

574
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,374
About the funeral, and all.

575
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,374
About the funeral?

576
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,832
It bothered her, we hadn't seen him.

577
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:23,624
- Seen him? Where?
- In his coffin.

578
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:29,290
We wanted to, but they told us
we'd better not. For our own sakes.

579
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:35,165
- Who said that?
- Captain Søgaard and the chaplain.

580
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:41,290
Did they say, you shouldn't see
your son in the coffin?

581
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,957
- Where is he buried?
- In the churchyard nearby.

582
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,999
Would you like to see
a photo of the grave?

583
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,874
Yes, please.

584
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:00,582
- Forget it!
- Dragsholm was on to it too.

585
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:05,374
She must have been.
Søgaard claimed he didn't know Perk.

586
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:11,999
- He's covering for him.
- He died before the incident.

587
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,415
- He didn't let them see the body.
- It was blown to bits.

588
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,374
If there was a body.

589
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:21,249
We must ask for her permission.

590
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,957
We'll have to dig up the coffin
to see if it's empty.

591
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,582
I want you to leave.

592
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,415
Jens?

593
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:48,999
I never really believed in God.
It always seemed so weird.

594
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:55,999
If there is a God,
what is the meaning of all this?

595
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,832
I would like to have faith.
But it's hard.

596
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,957
Do you understand?

597
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,915
We'd better go to the police.

598
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,540
You'd better take this.

599
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,332
What was I thinking?

600
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,082
You're doing the right thing.
Let me just change, before we go.

601
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:54,457
ANNE DRAGSHOLM
BARRISTER-AT-LAW

602
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,999
Priest?

603
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,082
Priest!

604
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,165
PER K. MØLLER
REST IN PEACE

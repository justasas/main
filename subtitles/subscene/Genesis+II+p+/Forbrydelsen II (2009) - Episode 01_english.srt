1
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,582
- Emergency services.
- Something's happened.

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:19,749
What is your name?

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:24,415
There's blood everywhere.
I can't find her.

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,999
- Where are you calling from?
- Oh, my God!

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,374
- I need an address.
- Anne?

6
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,999
Someone's been in the house.
I can't find my wife.

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,332
- Is anyone injured?
- I don't know!

8
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:43,999
Tell me what's going on, so I can
get you the help you need... Hello?

9
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:49,749
- What have I done?
- Hello? Stay on the phone.

10
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,499
Anne? Anne...?

11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,082
Hello?

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,499
- Hello?
- Anne?

13
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:45,957
There are 15-20 stab wounds
on her torso and neck.

14
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:49,207
It looks like a crime of passion.

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,124
I don't think she was killed here.

16
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,332
Much indicates that she was already dead
when she was strung up.

17
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,540
- Can someone shut that dog up?
- Brix?

18
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,749
They found the husband in his car
on the ramp to the motorway.

19
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,249
- He is covered in blood.
- Bring him in for questioning.

20
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,415
If he's covered in blood,
we're halfway there.

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,707
THE KILLING

22
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:44,082
It's 7am on Monday
November 14. This is the news.

23
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,040
Minister of Justice Frode Monberg

24
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,707
was rushed to the hospital
after a heart attack.

25
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,124
His present condition is not known.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,540
Parliament is to read
the new terror package.

27
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:02,082
The Prime Minister says Monberg's
absence will not affect negotiations.

28
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,624
The terror package is necessary.

29
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,249
The fight against terrorism must go on,

30
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,957
both here and in Afghanistan.

31
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:17,582
The suspect in the Memorial Park murder
is still in custody.

32
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,749
Little information has been released
about the murder of ten days ago.

33
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,832
MONDAY 14 NOVEMBER
7:41AM

34
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,540
DAY 1

35
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,207
- Any news?
- No.

36
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,540
- Sleep well.
- Have a nice shift.

37
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,915
Hi.

38
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,749
My name is Ulrik Strange.

39
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,290
I left several messages
but apparently your machine doesn't work.

40
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,499
- There's coffee if you like.
- Thanks.

41
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:51,999
- I'm Chief Inspector...
- You mean Detective Inspector.

42
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,999
No, that title is obsolete.
It was changed after the reform.

43
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,999
There's a case we'd like to discuss
with you. About...

44
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,915
About 10 days ago,
a woman was killed

45
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,957
under very strange circumstances.

46
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:26,707
- I'll wait till you're finished.
- I can hear you.

47
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:31,040
We've withheld information,
but you've probably read about it.

48
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,582
We'd like you to go over the case
to see if we missed something.

49
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,332
- We?
- Brix, your former boss.

50
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,832
He thinks you can give us
a new angle.

51
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,540
- Lennart Brix?
- Yes. He'd like you to read the brief.

52
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,790
I can stay till midday.
We could meet and discuss it.

53
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:04,082
I don't with work with briefs
and perpetrators much anymore.

54
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,082
We're pretty sure
we have our man.

55
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,415
The victim's husband is in custody.

56
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,832
The remand expires in 32 hours,
and then we have to release him.

57
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,249
- You'll be paid for your time.
- That's fine.

58
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,624
- But tell Brix it's of no interest.
- Why not?

59
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:32,332
Brix said you would say no,
but I was to emphasise the importance...

60
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,832
And now you have, haven't you?

61
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,415
I have to go. It's been a long night.

62
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,957
Close the door when you're done...

63
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,749
OK.

64
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,082
- What is his condition?
- Will the minister return?

65
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:11,624
I have no further comments.
We hope the minister will recover.

66
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,790
Thank you.

67
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,540
Have a seat. The Prime Minister
will be with you shortly.

68
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,915
- Hi, Thomas. How are things?
- Fine, thanks.

69
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,124
- And the family?
- They're fine.

70
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,874
- Is there any news?
- His condition is stable.

71
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,957
But he isn't coming back,
not now or later.

72
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:32,499
We're all relieved that he'll survive,
but it's bloody bad timing.

73
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,374
- Of course.
- As you know, I have chosen you.

74
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,874
Your primary task is to get
our terror package passed.

75
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,957
The voting is next week,
and right now this place is like a zoo.

76
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,790
Our supporting party is pressuring us,
and the Opposition...

77
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,790
Excuse me, there's something
I have to say.

78
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,665
I'm honoured
to be given the offer. Truly.

79
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,582
But I've decided to decline.

80
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,915
- Why?
- I don't feel I'm ready.

81
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,290
I'm not a lawyer.
I don't know enough.

82
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,582
There are more suitable candidates.

83
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,540
Perhaps in a few years' time
when I've been here longer.

84
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,457
The government has put a lot of work
into the terror package.

85
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:27,707
We need someone to head
the negotiations immediately.

86
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,124
To me it's very simple.

87
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,082
You have the ability,
so you're obligated.

88
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:39,374
I could appoint someone from our group,
but you're the one I need.

89
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:46,082
So if you don't have any further objections,
I'll ask you again.

90
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,040
Will you be our new
Minister of Justice?

91
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,124
Raben, you have a visitor.

92
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,207
He wanted to come,
but today is Bake Day in day-care.

93
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,249
- The other kids were going.
- I understand.

94
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,207
I brought some of his new drawings.
Would you like to see them?

95
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,040
It's all about fairytales
and role-playing right now.

96
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,707
This is a very important dragon.

97
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,415
I can't remember its name,
but it's huge and very dangerous.

98
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,832
- He's getting good at it.
- We bought a shield and sword.

99
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,790
It was a gift from my father.

100
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,207
Otherwise
there's not much going on.

101
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,082
- Shall we...?
- Let's wait a while.

102
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,624
- When is it?
- Soon. It'll be fine.

103
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,915
They interview me
and then evaluate me.

104
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,624
It'll be fine. The lawyer says
my chances are good.

105
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,707
The clinical director says
I've made great progress.

106
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,124
This time they can't turn me down.

107
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,665
What's wrong?

108
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,582
He doesn't want to come anymore.

109
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,124
Jonas doesn't want to come anymore.

110
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:48,124
I know you love to see him,
and I tried, but he won't come.

111
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,457
It's OK.

112
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,540
- You mustn't pressure him.
- I don't.

113
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,624
But he isn't a baby anymore.

114
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,082
He won't even talk about you.

115
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,207
I think someone has been teasing him
because they heard something.

116
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,249
I'm sorry, honey.

117
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,332
Forget it. I'll work it out.

118
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,499
We will work it out.

119
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,082
It'll be fine. I promise.

120
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,707
We'll be together so much
that you two will miss being alone.

121
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,374
Because I snore
and smack my lips

122
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,707
and get toothpaste
on my upper lip.

123
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,999
This is Vibeke Lund.
I'm not home, but leave a message.

124
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,582
Hi, Mum. I'm taking the train
in a couple of hours.

125
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,457
I can only stay till tomorrow,
so... See you.

126
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,540
She said no.

127
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,874
The ferry traffic gives her plenty to do.
How's it going?

128
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,124
Brix.

129
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,540
- Strange here.
- Sarah Lund. Is Brix there?

130
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,457
He's busy. Can I help you?

131
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,332
I'm visiting my family today.

132
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,040
I don't know if I'll have time

133
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,749
but if you still think
I can help, then...

134
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,999
- Then what?
- I have to go. I'll call later.

135
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,749
Hello?

136
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:12,707
Thomas Buch, age 38, was accepted
as Minister of Justice by the Queen.

137
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,415
In political circles,
his appointment was a surprise.

138
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:23,582
His first task is to get consensus
on the terror package.

139
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,540
I shook her hand.

140
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:32,082
I'm in the ministry now, dear.
Talk to you later.

141
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,082
Karina Munk Jørgensen,
secretary to the minister.

142
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,707
- Thomas Buch.
- Welcome.

143
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,582
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

144
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,457
This is where we reside.

145
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,499
Our staff of 170
takes up the 3rd and 4th floors.

146
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,457
This is the minister's office.

147
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,957
- There are a few things left to move.
- That's all right.

148
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,874
I presume this is my predecessor's.

149
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,582
No, I put it there.
It's the negotiation process.

150
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,624
Carsten Plough,
Permanent Undersecretary.

151
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,915
- The reception is all set.
- Good.

152
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:32,165
I'd like to be briefed
on the status of the negotiations.

153
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:36,415
An agreement will probably be made
with the People's Party.

154
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:41,207
The Opposition has opted out,
but you can read all about that.

155
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,749
And I will.

156
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:47,374
First I'd like to tell you
my thoughts.

157
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,207
We're at war.

158
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,707
Whether we like it or not,
we have to find unity.

159
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,207
So we need to work towards
a broad, national agreement.

160
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,499
That's been attempted.
Your predecessor acknowledged...

161
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,665
I understand.
But it's important that we succeed.

162
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,374
- Is that a problem?
- Of course not.

163
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,915
I'd like to show you your gift
from the People's Party.

164
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,040
"German occupation never again".

165
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:27,207
I'm no expert on political messages,
but I don't think they'll give in.

166
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,332
- We'll see about that.
- Yes.

167
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:36,165
You can discuss it with your personal
adviser whenever he or she starts.

168
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,749
I don't need an adviser right now.
I think the three of us can manage.

169
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:48,332
OK. I'll call a meeting
for all parties right away.

170
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,749
Great. Let's try those canapés.

171
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:21,582
Just don't be naive. The bike mender
has been evaluated the last 15 years.

172
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:27,915
- He thinks he'll get out every time.
- Why doesn't the buzzer sound?

173
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:33,415
Don't get your hopes up.
They'll just screw you over. Get it?

174
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,540
I get it. See you.

175
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,874
Director Toft!

176
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,332
Raben!

177
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,374
Stop!

178
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,874
- Step away from the fence.
- It's OK.

179
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:01,165
- How do you think it went?
- I can't tell you.

180
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:07,207
- Talk to your lawyer.
- I won't see him for a few days.

181
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,957
- Then you'll have to wait.
- I'm not asking for myself.

182
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,290
I have to call my wife.

183
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,957
I don't know what to say.
If it's bad, tell me now.

184
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:25,790
The institution approved you,
but it doesn't matter.

185
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:31,499
The Probation Service has the final say,
so nothing's definite.

186
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,582
Get moving, Raben!

187
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:08,999
-What exactly did she say?
- The doctors think I'm ready.

188
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,957
- When will you know for sure?
- In about a week.

189
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,790
It depends on the Probation Service,
so you need to get hold of Myg.

190
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,124
Hang on.
I'm going in the other room.

191
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:26,665
- Myg? Why?
- He can get me a job.

192
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,915
It would make me look good.
Tell him it's urgent.

193
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:35,832
- Is Jonas there?
- He's showing Dad something.

194
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,499
My phone card is running out.
Give Jonas a kiss. Don't forget Myg.

195
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,124
I won't.

196
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:49,332
- Hi. There's some dinner left.
- Excellent.

197
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,540
- How did it go?
- Waste of time. We deploy 200 men.

198
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,207
And the brass can't understand
that Materials Command can't keep up.

199
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:02,415
You're usually good
at explaining that.

200
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:08,790
- Jonas, put your pj's on.
- No, I want to fence with Grandpa.

201
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:14,290
Hurry up. If you're quick,
he'll read you a bedtime story.

202
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:23,540
I looked at the schools.
The one on Sionsgade sounds best.

203
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,457
- And it's nearby.
- True.

204
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,499
- Gravy?
- Just a bit.

205
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,915
He has be to enrolled,
so you should get it done.

206
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,540
We'll see.

207
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,749
But it depends
on whether we'll be living here.

208
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,749
Why wouldn't you?
They're crazy about you in the infirmary.

209
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:47,790
I need a personnel list with
phone numbers. Do you have one?

210
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,832
Yes, it's in the drawer.

211
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,707
I've offered to remodel the basement,
and you can move down there.

212
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,749
We'll see.

213
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:10,915
- Do you think he'll be released?
- I heard there's a good chance.

214
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,957
And if he isn't?

215
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,040
You've been waiting
for over two years.

216
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,124
You keep putting off the decision.
It affects Jonas and you...

217
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,582
He's his father, and I love him.

218
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,999
If that's a problem,
we'll leave right now.

219
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,665
OK?

220
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,999
Sorry to interrupt, sir. The major said
you wanted an update on the APCs.

221
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,124
Later, Bilal.

222
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,290
- And there's a lance corporal...
- Yes.

223
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,374
- Thank you. Later.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,749
The woman came home at 7:32pm
and switched off the alarm.

225
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:21,040
- She talked to her husband...
- Perhaps I should wait for Brix.

226
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:26,749
He's been delayed.
He asked me to show you around.

227
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:36,499
The couple were getting divorced.
He had an affair with his secretary.

228
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,457
The wife threw him out
a month before that.

229
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:46,082
She refused to talk to him,
and he says she hung up on him.

230
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,749
- Where was their daughter?
- At her grandparents'.

231
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:55,499
At 7:41 pm she used her laptop
to go on the Internet in here.

232
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:11,790
She had some wine, looked at
some housing sites and took a bath.

233
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:16,915
So she might not have heard
the basement window being forced open.

234
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:24,332
She took a long bath and returned
to the kitchen in her robe.

235
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,957
Was that her usual routine?

236
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,582
Coming home late, taking a bath?

237
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,915
Eating alone in the kitchen?

238
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,457
- It's hard to say since she was alone.
- Yes.

239
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,040
The perpetrator attacked her
before she ate, according to the coroner.

240
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:51,040
They moved to the living room
where he stabbed her.

241
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,249
We haven't found the weapon.

242
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,332
She was stabbed 21 times.

243
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,249
Once in the heart, which was fatal.

244
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:07,957
She was forced into the chair.
The amount of blood indicates that.

245
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:13,290
- Did you find ashes or cigarettes?
- It's not from a pack of cigarettes.

246
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,540
- Chewing gum?
- Maybe.

247
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:24,332
The husband says he arrived
after midnight and called it in.

248
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:33,374
- Does he have an alibi?
- His mistress, who's extremely blond.

249
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,249
He had been drinking
and came to talk some sense into her.

250
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,790
She didn't answer the door. Then he
saw the open window and entered.

251
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,749
He claims he got blood on himself.

252
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,332
Didn't he have a key?

253
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,665
The wife had the locks and alarms
changed a few weeks ago.

254
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,040
She was very concerned about safety.

255
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,082
She fired her old security company
because she was dissatisfied.

256
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:08,749
According to the new company,
she ordered sensors for the garden.

257
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,415
Good to see you.

258
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:20,832
- Shall we check out the rest?
- Yes. This way.

259
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,374
The woman was entitled
to half her husband's fortune and firm.

260
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,374
So he certainly had a motive.

261
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,207
- That's where we found her.
- She had no connection to the park.

262
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:41,999
Or the execution site,
but she was dragged over the fence.

263
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,874
There are pictures
in the back of the brief.

264
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,582
Thanks.

265
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,665
The husband isn't stupid.

266
00:28:55,791 --> 00:29:00,040
We think this is a diversion.
A lot seems to point in that direction.

267
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,082
What are you thinking?

268
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,832
I think this is a mistake.

269
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,040
I think I'm wasting your time.

270
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,374
I just want your opinion.

271
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:40,165
Why don't you sleep on it
and then we'll talk tomorrow?

272
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,749
- I don't have any idea...
- If you do, then come and see me.

273
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:47,290
If you don't, that's fine, too.

274
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,165
I need your help.

275
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,665
Otherwise I have to release
the guy tomorrow.

276
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:05,374
- Buch here.
- Karina. I talked to the Opposition.

277
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,707
They can meet with you
and the People's Party in the morning.

278
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:16,874
Fine. I only have 7-800 pages to go
before I'm up to speed.

279
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,540
- See you tomorrow then.
- Wait.

280
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:29,415
There are pictures of a dead woman.
From the Memorial Park.

281
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:34,249
- Sorry. That's a mistake.
- Why is the ministry involved?

282
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:40,665
Your predecessor wanted updates
due to the scene of the crime.

283
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:44,624
But the police haven't found
a political motive.

284
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,040
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

285
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,790
Goodnight.

286
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,415
TOMORROW AT 5:03PM

287
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,124
TOMORROW 5:03PM

288
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:16,249
TUESDAY 15 NOVEMBER
9:32AM

289
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,165
DAY 2

290
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:22,874
One Islamist society
after another pops up...

291
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,457
- It's a scare campaign.
- They want to overthrow democracy.

292
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:32,124
- And reintroduce the Middle Ages.
- But you love freedom of speech.

293
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,415
The terror package doesn't take
the actual situation into account.

294
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:42,457
If the People's Party won't budge,
we can't be a part of this.

295
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,124
I have a meeting.

296
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,624
I hope you learned something.
Nice to meet you.

297
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,374
Congratulations.
Good luck.

298
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:56,999
- Bye, Agger.
- Have a good one, Krabbe.

299
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:05,499
Nice try. I'm sorry about the last bit,
but it had to be said.

300
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,582
We have to protect ourselves.
Just think of London and Madrid.

301
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,290
I agree with Agger. Special Branch
doesn't see it the way you do...

302
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,749
- Did you get our gift?
- Yes, thanks.

303
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,874
Since you're falling in the polls

304
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,332
one might think that a scare campaign
would be welcome, right?

305
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:38,040
My grandfather was a freedom fighter.
He ended up in Neuengamme.

306
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:43,540
- Make no mistake. What I say is true.
- That doesn't change anything.

307
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:47,540
- Your proposal is problematic.
- Who says it's just a proposal?

308
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,249
What do you mean?

309
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,582
We need each other to get a majority.

310
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:05,374
Right now, as I see it,
you need us more than we need you.

311
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,457
My support base
wants your answer later today.

312
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,749
Is a couple of hours enough
to clear it with the PM?

313
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:25,290
Thanks for the delicious coffee.

314
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,457
OK, we'll take
a five-minute break.

315
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,124
Hi.

316
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:51,165
Let him eat and go to the bathroom,
so we can continue the interrogation.

317
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,457
The hearing is in three hours.
We need more.

318
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,249
Yes, that's fine.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

320
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:15,624
I'll get to that later.
AII right. Bye.

321
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,082
This is Deputy Commissioner
Ruth Hedeby. She wants to listen in.

322
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,457
I've heard a lot about you.
Have a seat.

323
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,624
As you know, the Memorial Park
is a national monument.

324
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:39,040
It gives rise to speculation,
which we'd like to quash quickly.

325
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,624
But the suspect has an alibi,

326
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:48,332
and if we're to charge him today
we need more to go on.

327
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:53,124
So I'm interested in hearing
if you can help us find more.

328
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,165
I don't know if I can.

329
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,790
I can't find fault with the investigation.

330
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:06,040
And the forensic evidence is clear...

331
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,332
But you entertain your own views.

332
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:14,874
I don't think he did it.
That is, her husband.

333
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:22,582
Of course, it could be him,
but I don't think so.

334
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:27,249
He didn't have anything
to do with it. It says...

335
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:35,415
It says that it was a crime of passion,
yet the body was dragged away...

336
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,749
Probably to divert the investigation.

337
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:42,082
Forensics said his clothes
were covered in blood...

338
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,582
I'd like to hear what Lund has to say
if you don't mind.

339
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:52,832
The victim was afraid of the murderer.

340
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:56,582
She's been afraid for a while.

341
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:04,082
Her husband had a motive
and was manipulative, but not violent.

342
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,124
There are no prior incidents.

343
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,249
I think...

344
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:16,999
the perpetrator wanted to make
a statement with the execution site.

345
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,749
Yes. What did he want to state?

346
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:26,749
- What did she do before she married?
- Quite a bit.

347
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:32,207
Some education in the US,
NGOs in Africa and Asia.

348
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:38,415
Sent out by the military and Amnesty,
but never for long.

349
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,665
What did she do in the military?

350
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,165
A military legal adviser.

351
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:47,582
She was sent to the Balkans,
Iraq, Cyprus and Afghanistan.

352
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:51,040
- That was several years ago.
- Did she still have army contacts?

353
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:57,957
No, except for a monthly contribution
to a veterans' club.

354
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:02,749
It was a regular transferral and...
Excuse me.

355
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,332
I don't know
if I'm right about this.

356
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:21,165
But if I am, it seems like
there's something you haven't found

357
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,749
or something is missing.

358
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,415
Yes.

359
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,665
The husband just confessed.

360
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,082
Confessed to murder
and the disposal of the body.

361
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,957
I see. Right.

362
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:55,832
The lawyers need a detailed
confession to write up the charges.

363
00:37:55,958 --> 00:38:01,332
Then we can close this case.
I'm sorry. Thanks for your time.

364
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,290
I was worried there for a minute.

365
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,624
- I'm sorry if you...
- No, it's fine.

366
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,624
- I'd like to pay...
- No, I was going to drop by anyway.

367
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,957
Congratulations.

368
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,874
Happy birthday to you!

369
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,665
- Blow the candles out. Is that on?
- I have to put in a new tape.

370
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,665
- There we go.
- Go ahead.

371
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,832
Well done.

372
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:47,832
Since you're all here,
Bjørn and I have an announcement.

373
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,040
Some good news.

374
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:55,999
Bjørn has been so careless
as to propose and I said yes.

375
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,707
You're all invited.

376
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,415
But it will be a quiet ceremony.
I won't be in white.

377
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,457
Have a seat.

378
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,332
Here, Mum.
Thanks for the sweatshirt.

379
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,499
Sorry about the size.

380
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:29,124
I'm just glad you're here.
When do you have to leave?

381
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:34,457
- In a minute.
- Grandma said it was a job interview.

382
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,832
She must have misunderstood.

383
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:44,249
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

384
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,332
Dad, Ulla and the girls are in Spain,

385
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,165
- so I have the house to myself.
- Mark.

386
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,207
Come on, Sarah.

387
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,540
- Strange here.
- Lund. I can't get hold of Brix.

388
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:30,124
- I'm in an interrogation.
- It's about the perpetrator.

389
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:35,374
- I'm talking to him right now.
- That plastic wrapper...

390
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,665
- I have to go.
- He filmed the whole thing.

391
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:44,957
Unless you think the husband would
do that, you have the wrong man.

392
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:52,249
I'd like to visit the house again
if that's OK.

393
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,999
Raben, you have a visitor.

394
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,915
Raben, for Christ's sake...

395
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:12,874
- Myg. What's up? How are you?
- Fine. How about you?

396
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,832
I'm OK. I get a lot of reading done,
as they say.

397
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,207
- Sit down.
- OK.

398
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:28,624
I'm sorry I don't come more often.
Full speed ahead, you know.

399
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,124
That's OK.

400
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,832
- Did you talk to Louise?
- Yes. Yesterday.

401
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:40,457
I don't know if this is of any help.
It's a master carpenter.

402
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,249
A retired sergeant, who rambled on
about the good old days.

403
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,124
He needs a man in a couple of months.

404
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:56,624
- Does he know where I am?
- Yes. He's helped the club before.

405
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,790
Just have someone call him,
and he'll send in the paperwork.

406
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:05,040
- Thanks, Myg.
- We help each other, right?

407
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,874
The club could get you an apartment.

408
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,374
I'll tell Louise before I go.

409
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:17,207
- Go where?
- I'm being deployed next week.

410
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,165
Louise can call them herself.

411
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,207
Barracks life has never been my thing.

412
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,040
It's too boring.

413
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,165
It's time to move on.

414
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,040
Where?

415
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,290
Helmand. Maybe up north.

416
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:41,207
It all happened so quickly.

417
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,957
I have to get going.

418
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:48,457
- Last time, you said you wanted out.
- I have to go.

419
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:52,749
What have you done?
I can help you, Myg.

420
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,332
You don't know jack shit.

421
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,290
When we got back,
I thought it was over and done with.

422
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,832
It's not over at all.

423
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,249
- Do you understand?
- Take care.

424
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,457
Guard, let me out.

425
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:18,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,624
Hi, sweetie.

427
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,332
He seems to be all right.

428
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:32,165
Someone from day-care dropped him off,
and I brought him here.

429
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,415
Thanks, Søgaard.

430
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,915
Let me know if I can help.

431
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,165
See ya, kid.

432
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,832
Let's take your jacket off.

433
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:57,790
I know the other kids can be idiots

434
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:00,249
but fighting isn't the answer.

435
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:05,999
You can only fight dragons.
And Grandpa.

436
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,832
They said things about Dad.

437
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,124
I'll talk to them.

438
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,999
Is Dad coming home?

439
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,540
Yes, he is.

440
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,124
But I'm not sure when.

441
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,374
I lost a tooth.

442
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,082
Really?

443
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,457
That's a nice one.

444
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,124
Can I see?

445
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,790
Did it hurt?

446
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:50,457
Is it OK if I give it to Dad?
I want to give it to him myself.

447
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:54,790
Yes. I'll call and see if we
can visit him today. AII right?

448
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,665
Special Branch's latest threat
assessment. Where is he?

449
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:09,165
- Still in the PM's office.
- I hope they set him straight.

450
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,874
He's only been here a day.
I have a question.

451
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,582
A day is plenty
to remove our parliamentary basis.

452
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,374
A link can't be opened till 5:03pm

453
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,749
It's from the Ministry of Finance.

454
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:26,624
It's their turn to host
the Friday get-together.

455
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,790
That's what I thought,
but they said no.

456
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:33,665
Am I interrupting?

457
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,499
A Special Branch report.
What did the PM say?

458
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:41,874
I didn't see him.
Instead I talked to people here.

459
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,415
- What about the People's Party
- Krabbe is on his way.

460
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,457
Let's go in.

461
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,165
- Did you work it out?
- Yes.

462
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,332
I'm glad.

463
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:59,207
I'm sorry I sounded a bit...

464
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:03,582
- But these things really matter.
- Of course. I feel the same way.

465
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,124
But our point of view is very simple.

466
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:12,499
Neither now nor in the future
will we compromise

467
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,374
on our constitution's protection
of basic democratic values.

468
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:21,457
No threat or scare campaign from you
or even from terrorists can change that.

469
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,457
I see.

470
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:32,624
If the government thinks
it's best served without us

471
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,374
we'll have to take that
under advisement.

472
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:41,415
Of course I'll have to tell the press
if you're quitting our collaboration.

473
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:45,749
I'm no ace at history,
but as far as I know

474
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:50,749
a Danish government has only once
before prohibited a legal association.

475
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:02,082
1941.
The Communist Party.

476
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:04,832
However, at the time they were
pressured by the Wehrmacht.

477
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:13,790
- There's no comparison.
- I have experts on constitutional law.

478
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,499
I enclosed their statements
at the back if you're interested.

479
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:24,457
Do you want to be part
of a broad agreement

480
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:28,707
or stand alone with an opinion
that hasn't been stated since the Nazis?

481
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:36,124
Lund, I can't stay here all night.
Get to the point. Why film it?

482
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:41,040
You said the victim was forced
into the chair after being stabbed.

483
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:46,207
- The amount of blood indicates...
- What if she was in the chair first?

484
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,540
And then stabbed?

485
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,874
- It doesn't fit a crime of passion.
- Who says it was a crime of passion?

486
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,124
Only one of the stab wounds
was deep enough to hit a vital organ.

487
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,957
Why didn't she defend herself?
Why are there no defense wounds?

488
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,874
You think she was tied up.

489
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,249
He stabbed her to get her talking

490
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,415
and saved the fatal wound till last.

491
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:14,957
She was in the middle of a divorce.
Why would someone interrogate her?

492
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:47,165
- What's that?
- A military ID.

493
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,999
Half of it is broken off.

494
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:56,374
Do you have
the address of the veterans' club?

495
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:16,165
Did you talk to the warden?

496
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,374
I left your application on his desk.

497
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,999
- You'll get an answer tomorrow.
- That's too late. Can't I call now?

498
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,790
Relax, man.

499
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:40,165
Hi. I applied for a phone call.
Do you know if the warden has seen it?

500
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,707
- No, I don't.
- Raben!

501
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:47,457
An army buddy visited me.
He isn't doing well.

502
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:53,124
- I need to call him.
- I'll tell the warden it's urgent.

503
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:57,499
- Thanks.
- We need to talk.

504
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,749
- Can't I make my call first?
- We'd better talk now.

505
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,957
The Probation Service
turned you down.

506
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:10,999
They usually take a long time
and follow our recommendation, but...

507
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:18,290
I don't know on what grounds yet,
but I'll let you know when I do.

508
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,082
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

509
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:26,665
- As I said...
- I completed the treatment.

510
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:31,707
You can apply again in six months.
It's important to keep up...

511
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:36,999
- I have a son.
- Step away from the clinical director.

512
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:40,374
I have to...
Fuck off!

513
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,207
Take it easy.

514
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:48,165
- You must remain calm.
- I am calm. I don't understand.

515
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:53,207
- I'm not a psycho or a paedophile.
- Move away from her, Raben.

516
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,082
Calm down!

517
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,290
Easy now!

518
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,332
I'll let him know. Thanks.

519
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:17,332
The People's Party accepts
the agreement with minor changes.

520
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,124
Good.

521
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,124
You don't look happy.

522
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,249
The law of 1941 cannot be compared
to the People's Party's suggestion.

523
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:34,332
Next time I'd appreciate it
if you asked me and not my legal experts.

524
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:38,832
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- There's something you have to see.

525
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:43,332
The Minister of Justice
will unfortunately be late. Thank you.

526
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:49,582
- I've just opened the link.
- What link?

527
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:59,082
- It's just been activated.
- Two minutes.

528
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:04,040
- IT says it's from a Hotmail.
- Come on. What is it?

529
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:27,624
- It's all very interesting, but...
- Wait. Here it comes.

530
00:53:55,916 --> 00:54:00,374
I accuse the hypocritical
Danish government

531
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,874
and the infidel Danish people
of crimes against humanity.

532
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,874
The time has come
for Allah's revenge.

533
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,374
The Muslim League will punish
the sufferings Denmark has caused

534
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,582
in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.

535
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:24,415
I plead guilty.
My blood will be shed.

536
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:27,665
And many will die along with me.

537
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:36,624
I haven't done anything...
I have a little girl...

538
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,249
The club for ex-servicemen
has 10-11,000 members nationwide.

539
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,165
The secretary of the local chapter
is Allan Myg Poulsen.

540
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:03,124
He lives in no. 46.

541
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:10,540
Wait here. I don't want any problems
with my report.

542
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,582
Hello?

543
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:16,415
Anybody home?

544
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:38,749
Hey!

545
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,499
Allan Myg Poulsen. Get a description
from the army and put out an APB.

546
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:50,540
Get a team out here
to search his place and... Hey!

547
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:56,249
I told you to wait outside.

548
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,457
What are you? Deaf?

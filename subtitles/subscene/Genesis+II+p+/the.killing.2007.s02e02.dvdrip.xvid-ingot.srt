1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Ten days ago a woman was murdered
under strange circumstances.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
You've probably read about
it in the newspapers.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Brix thinks you can offer new insight.
Tell him it's no use.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
It's Sarah. I'll be coming by train
in a couple of hours.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
And I can only stay until tomorrow.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Minister of Justice Monberg is in the
emergency ward after a heart attack..

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Hi Thomas. The government has worked
hard on the terrorism package.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Someone must lead the negotiations.
Would you like to be the new Minister of Justice?

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,440
We are at war.
The challenge is to find unity.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,820
We must pursue a broad national reconciliation.

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,000
The package doesn't consider
the current terrorist threat.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,280
The People's Party stance is too rigid.
We cannot support it.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,279
I'm having an interview with them.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,280
The lawyer is optimistic.
They can't say no this time.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Soon we'll be together so much,
that we'll miss being alone.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,159
Is Dad coming home?
Oh yes.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,160
You think he'll get out?
He seems to have a good chance.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
And if not?

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,880
She was attacked and stabbed 21 times.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Here is where she was found.
She had nothing to do with the park.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
What did she do for the army? She was a military
legal advisor in the Balkans, Iraq, Cyprus, Afghanistan.

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,160
There are pictures here of a dead woman
in the Memorial Grove.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Your predecessor wanted them to stay.
Memorial Grove is a national monument.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,240
We'd like to dispell any speculation.
If we're to bring charges today...we'll need more.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,600
You think he stabbed her...
to get her to talk. About what?

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Military ID.
An army buddy doesn't feel well.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I can help you, Myg.
You don't know a damn thing.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,760
The probation board has rejected
your application. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Calm down, calm down...
Let me go!

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,120
The killer filmed everything.
I just opened the link.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
"I accuse the hypocritical Danish Government.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
The Muslim League punishes Denmark
for the suffering it has inflicted on our brothers

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
...in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan."

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Where's the veterans association located?
The local Secretary is Allan Myg Poulsen.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The Killing II

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,240
In additional news. A few hours ago,
a terror threat was issued against Denmark.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Sources confirm
that there is a real threat.

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
The threat is a 45-second long
video recording, streamed online...

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
via an Islamic website at 17:03.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,280
The Justice Department
is aware of the video ...

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,320
but wouldn't comment before
hearing from the police and PET.

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
The victim is Allan Myg Poulsen, 36,
an unmarried, professional soldier.

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,840
He's been a soldier for a number of years
and was stationed at the Ryvangen Barracks.

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,400
He was active in the veterans' association.
"The Black Berets". Which has an office here.

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
We chased the man who ran away.

46
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,880
But Lund didn't get a good look at him.

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Are there any more witnesses? A neighbor
across the way saw the victim come home.

48
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,560
The back door was broken in.
The killer had been waiting for him.

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
The coroner says the victim defecated
himself and had thrown up.

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
The murderer was alone
with the victim for a long time.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,200
He must have known that the
building was abandoned at that time.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Have you found the murder weapon?
It's around his neck.

53
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Lund found him.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,960
And what about PET?

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,919
Where is she?

56
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
We need people over on the railway area.
He climbed over the barbed wire ...

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,519
and may have cut himself.

58
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
I saw only him, but there
may well have been more.

59
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Has PET said anything?
They were clearly taken by surprise.

60
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,920
We have to start from scratch.
Can I get a copy of the video?

61
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Lund, you're not actually on the case.

62
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,799
What do you mean?

63
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,800
You sent a man down to see me.
In order for me to review the case.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,640
You knew something was wrong,
otherwise you wouldn't have asked me ...

65
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,040
The situation's changed now,
but it's not your paperwork.

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,560
There are disciplinary problems ...topped by 
threatening a colleague with a loaded weapon.

67
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,919
They haven't forgotten that in the yard.

68
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Your failures are believed to have
contributed to Jan Meyers death.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Why should I trust you?

70
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Give me one reason to reconsider it.

71
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I know that I've made mistakes.

72
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I wish I could change that ...

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
But I can't.

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
This is what I do best.

75
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
I'll contact your office in Gedser.

76
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,840
We'll borrow you for a while,
first just for a few days...

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Then we'll see.

78
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,039
Do we understand each other?

79
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
The video is ready for you at the office.

80
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,720
They're here.
Give the girls a kiss for me.

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I told the press that your
response will come later.

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
The Prime Minister needs to be
briefed regularly on the matter.

83
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Eric Koenig, head of PET.
Deputy Commissioner Hedeby.

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
The link was activated at 5:03 pm.
It's the end of Ramadan.

85
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,860
We traced the site to a host server in London.

86
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
We contacted local authorities
which closed the site at 7:23 pm.

87
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,879
The video was sent via Hotmail to
key ministries and the media.

88
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Surely the email can be traced?
No. It went through an unsecured network.

89
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
The website is a forum for fundamentalists.

90
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,380
The lP address was created in this country.
By whom and when?

91
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Half a year ago.
We're looking for the owner.

92
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
And the Muslim League?
We know almost nothing about them.

93
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
It could be a new group...
or a offshoot of an existing one.

94
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,160
What do we know about
the woman in the video?

95
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,280
She was identified as the victim
from the Memorial Grove.

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,359
Anne Dragsholm, 35, a lawyer.

97
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,360
There's also a second victim.
When did that happen?

98
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
He was found when the video was activated.

99
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,640
The victim is a 36 year old man,
Allan Myg Poulsen, a soldier.

100
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,040
He had been on foreign missions to
lraq and Afghanistan.

101
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
It also seems relevant that...

102
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,520
the woman was also sent abroad
in military service as a legal advisor.

103
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
They are both symbolic targets
with military backgrounds.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes, It's clearly an act of revenge.

105
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
How can this be a surprise?

106
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,400
It's an unusual case. There was no indication
of terrorism in the Memorial Grove murder.

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
If we had known about ID tags sooner ...

108
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,880
We just found out about that tonight.

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
It's nobodys fault, no one is pointing fingers.
How do we solve this?

110
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,800
We'll coordinate with the police.
Send a warning to all the barracks.

111
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,560
But not a word to the media
about the second victim.

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No way. Two people are dead,
we are under threat.

113
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
People have a right to know
what is happening.

114
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,600
The Prime Minister has agreed to a press release.
Good. I'll talk to him later.

115
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Have the next of kin been informed?
Yes, they have.

116
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Got a minute?

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,799
Don't forget your tie.
Thank you.

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I'd like to point out that the ministry
has followed procedure in this situation.

119
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
But questions must still be asked.

120
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
The former Minister was aware of it.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But neither we nor PET could have foreseen
that it would come to this.

122
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,920
We must know where you stand.
This is a very serious matter ...

123
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Further spontaneous reactions
from you have to stop.

124
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
It won't happen again.
Thank you.

125
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,840
The settlement with the People's Party
should be published tomorrow.

126
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,480
We need to signal that we stand together.
Yes, that we stand together.

127
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,513
Is everything ready out there?

128
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Why shouldn't we stand together?
This is it. The press is waiting.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We need to search the railway area
and interview the train crew.

130
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Check the surveillance footage.
The guy couldn't have just disappeared.

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
PET can't give us a list of suspects?

132
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,479
We'll hear from them when they're ready.

133
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,480
We need everything on the victims' past
and military backgrounds.

134
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,999
The "Black Berets" may be a link.

135
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
See if their database has been hacked and
whether the victims are on their member list.

136
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Both sets of dog tags were cut in half.

137
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Find out where they're made
and who ordered them.

138
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Sarah Lund is on board and helping us.

139
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Some of you already know her,
some do not.

140
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,180
Make her feel at home.
Okay, let's get to work.

141
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,610
You'll partner with Strange.

142
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,040
The Muslim League? Isn't it strange
that you haven't heard of them?

143
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
It is very typical. Groups often arise
spontaneously in a given case.

144
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
And what about that website?
Still nothing new yet.

145
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
The PET will keep us informed.

146
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I think we should go
to Allan Poulsen's barracks.

147
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
They were his only family.
Good idea.

148
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,239
I am just ...

149
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,519
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Go ahead and take the desk opposite me.
Okay. Over there?

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I like to keep it neat, but you go ahead.

152
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Here.

153
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Strange can show you where your locker is.

154
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Shall we get going?
Yes.

155
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Both victims had been sent to
the Middle East by the army.

156
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,560
This might be revenge for our
role in the fight against terrorism.

157
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,239
This is Jarnvig.

158
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,759
Are you watching the news?

159
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,559
Yes. I've spoken to the Defense Command.

160
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Put extra guards and triple the men
in areas surrounding the the sites...

161
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,160
... as soon as possible. I can't say more.

162
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Why didn't you say something?
It started 14 days ago.

163
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,999
Okay, I'm on my way.

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
... We are still investigating.
And what about the terror package?

165
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Louise, I have to go now.

166
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Jonas is asleep.

167
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I've put a tin animal from the
tooth fairy under his pillow.

168
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Thanks, Dad.

169
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'd like to hear what happened out there.

170
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
The prison rejected his request.

171
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I couldn't see him because he
has a history of angry outbursts.

172
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360
How much does Jonas know?
Nothing.

173
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,999
The Superintendent has delayed
all discussions until tomorrow.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I've asked the lawyer for a meeting.
About what?

175
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,519
We need to appeal the decision.

176
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
The lawyer was very optimistic.
So this is nonsense.

177
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,240
We can apply again in six months.
Why did you take Jonah there?

178
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,799
Because he wanted to go.

179
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,800
If it takes another six months,
we can remodel the basement ...

180
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,920
...so Jonas could have his own room.

181
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll talk to you more about it tomorrow.

182
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,520
You don't really care
whether Jens is released.

183
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I have a message for the Colonel.
Come in.

184
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Do they know who did it?

185
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Thanks.

186
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
What's the matter?

187
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Have you seen Myg Poulsen today?

188
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
How are you doing?

189
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I don't know what came over me.

190
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,039
Can I talk to Louise?

191
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,479
She came to visit you.

192
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,480
You didn't get the message?
I told her why you couldn't come.

193
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
I didn't tell your son.

194
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Are you ready to come back to your cell,
do you think?

195
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,000
Was Jonas there too?
Yes.

196
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,880
I would like to talk with Louise.
One thing at a time.

197
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
We need to resume your treatment with medication.
I don't need medication.

198
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,400
Then you can't leave.
There is nothing wrong with me.

199
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
If you do not cooperate,
you'll have to stay here.

200
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,500
The police want to question you
about Allan Myg Poulsen.

201
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But based on this conversation,
that'll have to wait.

202
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Interrogate me. Why?
Your number was in his cell phone.

203
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
And he's been here on visits.

204
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,840
He was found dead tonight.
Murdered... I'm sorry.

205
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,639
I'll tell them to come back tomorrow.

206
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Murdered?
I don't know any more.

207
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll come back tomorrow.
Call the guard if you need anything.

208
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

209
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,879
The pamphlets with the body
have been translated.

210
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,880
"Battle for God's sake. Kill those
who defile God." Koran exerpts.

211
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Do we know who made the pamphlets?
They're looking for the printer.

212
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay, my name is Ulrik.

213
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I've been with the department
for about a year.

214
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm recently divorced and fine with it.
I have two wonderful kids.

215
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
It has been hard, but ultimately
it's better for everyone.

216
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I like soccer... and opera, without the screaming.

217
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:35,000
You have to make a left next time.
Allan Myg Poulsen had been decorated.

218
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And what about you?
I haven't been decorated.

219
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
There is not much else to tell.

220
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,000
You've been in Gedser.
And the rest you've probably heard.

221
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't listen to gossip.
I'd rather not talk about it.

222
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,500
But we can talk about everything else.

223
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not that I don't want to talk to you...

224
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,000
Was it left next time?
Yes.

225
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you.

226
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,900
Colonel Torsten Jarnvig.

227
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,500
Ulrick Strange.
Sarah Lund.

228
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
And this is Major Christian Sogaard.

229
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,950
Have a seat.
Thanks.

230
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,975
As you know, one of your people
has been found murdered.

231
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,887
How was he affiliated with the barracks?

232
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,680
Corporal Myg Poulsen was a good
soldier with many years of service.

233
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
We're very shocked by his death and
the manner of it

234
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
How long has he been in the army?

235
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
He was first drafted into the army
but has been on contract since then.

236
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
He had been to the Balkans,
Iraq and Afghanistan

237
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,840
When did you last see him?
At the morning roll call.

238
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
He had one week to go before
being deployed to Helmand.

239
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,160
How was he murdered?
We can't go into detail.

240
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Does it have to do with the terrorist threat?

241
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Is he one of the two victims?
As it looks now, yes.

242
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Has he received threats?
Not to my knowledge.

243
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Has the barracks received threats?
We receive them constantly.

244
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Phone calls and emails every day.
But not from the Muslim League.

245
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Can you give us copies of those e-mails and calls?

246
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,360
And Allan Myg Poulsen's personnel file.
Sogaard will take care of all that.

247
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
If there's nothing else,
I would personally like to inform my staff.

248
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Do you know this woman?

249
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Anne Dragsholm.
No, I don't know her.

250
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,960
She was a legal advisor for
the Defense Department.

251
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
We'd like to talk to people who knew
Myg Poulsen well.

252
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,839
His company commander
will show you around.

253
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,840
I should emphasize that this case
will create uncertainty and concern ...

254
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
...my people cannot have that when
they are so close to leaving on a mission.

255
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,680
It's important that all communications
go through me or Major Sogaard.

256
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Can we agree on that?
Of course.

257
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Most of the guys are at home right now,
just before departure.

258
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,679
This was his bunk.

259
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,680
And this was his locker.

260
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,679
How well did you know him?

261
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,400
Not so well. Nobody knew him very well.
He was a loner.

262
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,880
When did you last see him?
At the 6:30 am morning roll call.

263
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,920
And later in the day?
No, they came back after FUT.

264
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,280
FUT?
Physical Education and Training.

265
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Do you know when he put in for deployment?
Last week.

266
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Last week?
Wasn't that a bit sudden?

267
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,120
He was already planning for a while.

268
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
This is Strange.
Who is Raben?

269
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,119
I don't know.

270
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Okay, thanks.

271
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,999
They found the printer.

272
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The pamphlets were delivered to
Aisha Oman's bookstore in Norrebro.

273
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,959
Anything else?

274
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
No, thanks for your help.

275
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,880
The People's Party and the opposition
support the government unconditionally.

276
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,800
They want an update in the case before
they'll sign the settlement.

277
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
So they don't have a letter of agreement?

278
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Not without your update.
Plough was right.

279
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
They'll look for any excuse to criticise us.

280
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,500
When we have nothing to go by,
it becomes easier for them.

281
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Why don't you go home? There's nothing
more you can do right now.

282
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Still no news from the police or PET?
No.

283
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I promise that we'll call you
as soon as we hear anything.

284
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Write down the phone numbers
of Krabbe and Agger.

285
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Then I can get it over with immediately.

286
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
I've looked at your calendar
for tomorrow.

287
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Maybe you should have a talk
with your family.

288
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
My wife would probably prefer that I
be here to get a grip on things.

289
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,160
See you tomorrow.
Should I call the driver?

290
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,040
No, I'll find him. Thank you.
Thank you for your help today.

291
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Hi Buch, did you get my message?
Yes, hi Krabbe. Thank you.

292
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Of course you should be informed.
How bad is it?

293
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,680
As things stand right now...
Thomas?

294
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,040
PET found the person who created
the website with the video.

295
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,839
One moment... I'm just checking my calendar.

296
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,200
I'll catch up with you tomorrow morning.
Why not now?

297
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,800
There's something new that just come up
and I want to have Agger there. See you 8:00?

298
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
That's fine.
Okay, see you.

299
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Yes, this is Thomas Buch.

300
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,200
No one by that name lives here.
Are you sure it was a bookstore?

301
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Hi. We're looking for Aisha Oman.

302
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,639
Who lives here?

303
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,640
She has a bookstore.
It could be his room.

304
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Kodmani. He sells books.
But I haven't seen him today.

305
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,679
Thanks. We'll check it out.

306
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Maybe you're looking for his wife.

307
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,440
But she died a two or three years ago.
Thanks.

308
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,760
You knocked on the door?
Yes.

309
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Open up!
Police.

310
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Police!  Hands where I can see them.
Why didn't you open the door?

311
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,519
My children were sleeping.
What do you want?

312
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Is there anyone else here?
No. Who are you looking for?

313
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Don't be afraid.
Go back to bed.

314
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
It's okay.

315
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Three months ago you ordered
pamphlets in your deceased wife's name.

316
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Why?
I want to see a warrant?

317
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Where were you earlier today?
I want a lawyer.

318
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,040
I know my rights.
You can not just do this.

319
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I want to see your search warrant.

320
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Would you mind moving aside? Move over.

321
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,640
That's my basement.
I want to see the search warrant.

322
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Stay where you are.

323
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Wednesday, November 16th 7:43

324
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,740
His name is Abdel Hussein Kodmani.
A Fundamentalist and widower.

325
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,440
A Moroccan, who has lived in Denmark for 16 years.
Engineers say it's his website with the video.

326
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
But he's used a number of aliases to hide it.

327
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
That was the good news.
And the bad?

328
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,640
The PET will confirm.
Kodmani served time for inciting terrorism.

329
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,040
They've been watching him
and are angry over the arrest.

330
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Why?
You shouldn't stay at the hotel.

331
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I've prepared a bed for you.
No Mom, I don't want to bother you.

332
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You can have the key.
I'm still with Bjorn most of the time.

333
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,360
We'll figure it out on Sunday.
What's happening Sunday?

334
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Our wedding. Borjn's family
can sleep here at the hotel.

335
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,840
There are over thirty people.
I can get the rooms here.

336
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,680
I hope you have time to
eat with me and Bjorn.

337
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,440
I want him to get to
know him, but I get so busy.

338
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
And I would also like to see Mark.
You must surely have time to eat.

339
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Bjorn has a nice friend
that I want you to meet.

340
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,240
It doesn't have to be right now.

341
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,840
That's for me. I have to go.
I want to eat with you and Bjorn.

342
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Who is that?
Did you get the key for me?

343
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,439
Oh, yes.

344
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,719
Thank you.

345
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Sarah?
See you, Mom.

346
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Perhaps it would have gone differently,
if we had heard from you.

347
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,080
You have jeopardized the investigation.

348
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,720
The investigation is stalled.
There are two bodies in the morgue.

349
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,080
What are we doing here?
We regret that we have disturbed your operation.

350
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,080
The main thing is that we have the man.
No.

351
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480
It's not just him we're looking for.
Kodmani has an alibi.

352
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,080
And since we were watching him,
his alibi is pretty airtight.

353
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
It could be part of a larger plan.

354
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,640
He's had time to prepare.
We need to intensify the investigation.

355
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,279
Do you have any other suspects?

356
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,280
We need to focus on Kodmani
and his deciples. Agreed?

357
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Shall we?

358
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Any more news on the suspect?
They haven't interviewed him yet.

359
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,800
We'll release the news of our agreement today and
show the perpetrators that we won't be intimidated.

360
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
What are you surprised about?

361
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,280
The first murder seemed
like a marital crime of passion.

362
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,760
The foreign minister had no way of
knowing that it was terrorist-related.

363
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,800
And do we know any more?
No. What's your postion.

364
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Heaven knows that we're against this war.
These things will make no difference.

365
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,640
But we need to stick together.
It's important that we act together.

366
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,920
The most important thing is that you realize this is
exactly what the Popular Party warned us about.

367
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,300
You can't make policy based on current affairs.

368
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Two killed and a fundamentalist arrested.

369
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:41,000
We'll vote no on this package if the
crime involves groups we have warned about.

370
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,500
You don't know yet.
No. But it's not inconceivable.

371
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,320
But if the suspect is guilty,
I can't defend it to the voters.

372
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,399
I have a suggestion.

373
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Let's try to find out more about the suspect,
then meet later.

374
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
If everything is clear,
we can issue a statement tonight.

375
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,360
That's an excellent proposal.
Good. We'll be back.

376
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,999
Just so we understand each other ...

377
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
If they find so much as a parenthesis,
we are pulling out.

378
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
That won't happen. I'll see you later.

379
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Must we now negotiate with Krabbe?
He's under pressure from his people.

380
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We need to give him the impression
that we're meeting him half way.

381
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
The agreement is important.
Let's wait for PET and the police.

382
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,721
That's not going to be an issue, waiting for
 PET could take a while

383
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Hopefully, the discussion
with Krabbe won't be necessary.

384
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:45,761
We're up against it..

385
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The arrest last night wasn't
coordinated between PET and the police.

386
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
The suspect isn't just anybody.

387
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,800
My client is willing to cooperate.
We're looking forward to that.

388
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Tell us about the Muslim League.
I first heard about it yesterday.

389
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,160
The video was on your website.
My client would like to clear up some things:

390
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,040
He runs a publishing house and a bookstore
with the aim of spreading the message of Koran.

391
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,240
On the basis of his civil liberties ...

392
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,820
he uses his literary platform to
make a discussion forum available.

393
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,960
He knew nothing of the video
and has not turned to terrorism.

394
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,880
You are clever ...

395
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,881
..and maybe you run a good business

396
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,500
but there were execution videos
and militant material at your residence.

397
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Only material that falls within the law.

398
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Your pamphlets were at the crime scene,
Your web site is used as a tool.

399
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,080
You can choose between solitary confinement
or cooperation. No one believes you.

400
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I've been contacted over the last few weeks
by someone who calls himself a fellow believer.

401
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Faith-mates who seem to share my ideals.

402
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,960
He wrote that he wanted to upload a religious video.

403
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,240
It appeared suddenly on my website last night.

404
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Do you still have the messages?
Oh.. no, unfortunately I deleted them.

405
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,580
If he is a faith mate,
then you know who he is.

406
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
No, if my pamphlets were
used in a criminal context ...

407
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,160
he could have gotten them from a library.

408
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Can we have a list of libraries?
Sure... if you think that will help.

409
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Thank you. That's it for today.

410
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,039
Why shouldn't it help?

411
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,040
We are all in Allah's hands.
Allahu akbar.

412
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
We're running out of time.
We need to find this faith mate.

413
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Here's a list of Kodmani's
religious contacts, customers ...

414
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,700
and a printout of names
of people in this country...

415
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,080
...who've visited his website.
These should all be checked.

416
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,480
We found blood on the barbed wire,
the person cut himself on it ...

417
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,120
...but the DNA does n't match anyone known.
Okay.

418
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm going to be gone for an hour.
Okay. Where?

419
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Raben is an Army buddy that
Poulsen visited yesterday ...

420
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,199
...in the Herstedvester prison.

421
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,200
He should have been questioned last night,
but it got postponed.

422
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,680
We should concentrate on Kodmani.

423
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Why would Kodmani put
the video on his own site?

424
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Why question an Army buddy?
I don't know.

425
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,799
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
See you later.

427
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Sogaard?

428
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Have the police found out anything?
Not that we've heard.

429
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,360
We hope that they'll find something soon.

430
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,000
Did you know him well?
Not very.

431
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,320
But I spoke with him yesterday.
He was Jens' old friend.

432
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I'm sorry to hear that he was turned down again.

433
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Your dad said he was renovating the basement.
So you'll stay?

434
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,839
For now, yes.

435
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,479
I'm going to see him.

436
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Your list of vaccinations is in the hospital.
Thanks.

437
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Let me know if your father needs
help moving anything.

438
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Why can't I see him?
Because of his..

439
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,880
...anger and his refusal
to go back on medication.

440
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,920
He hasn't taken any
medication for a long time.

441
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Hopefully it's not a relapse.
But he must cooperate.

442
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,840
He usually cooperates.
Let's wait a week or so.

443
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We have a meeting with our lawyer
to discuss many things. The case and the decision.

444
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
I understand that.
But your husband needs rest.

445
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,120
The only thing my husband needs right now,
is to see me.

446
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I'll see what I can do.
But he needs to begin to cooperate.

447
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,920
It's a bad time to interrogate him.
Can't it wait?

448
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,399
It won't take long.
Why is he here?

449
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Kidnap and death threats.
What happened?

450
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,840
He was wounded and sent home
from military service.

451
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,280
He suffered from delusions.

452
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
He took a nurse hostage and
threatened her life.

453
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,520
He was sentenced to be in custody
and to indefinite solitary confinement.

454
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,200
He came to visit you?
I had invited him.

455
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,320
He had gotten me a job.

456
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,079
But I don't need it now.

457
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,080
How did he seem? Was he nervous?
As if he was afraid of something?

458
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Myg did not scare easily.

459
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,120
But he was very restless.

460
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,199
Maybe he was in trouble.

461
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
What kind of trouble?
I don't know.

462
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,440
How did he die?

463
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,520
He was suspended from his legs,
upside down ...

464
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,160
...and cut with his dog tags.
Does this mean anything to you?

465
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
No.

466
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,660
He hadn't been deployed for years.
Why would he leave again?

467
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,320
He didn't feel comfortable at home.

468
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,960
If that's all, I would like to get some rest.

469
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Fine. There is actually ...

470
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
...one more thing.

471
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,359
Do you know this woman?

472
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Anne Dragsholm, former military counselor.

473
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Did she know Allan Myg Poulsen?
Why is that important?

474
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
She was killed two weeks ago.
We think there may be a connection.

475
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
I don't know her.
And Myg never said anything about her.

476
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,919
Are you sure you don't know her?

477
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm sure, I don't know her.

478
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Well, thank you for your help. Goodbye.

479
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I want to cooperate.
Tell the superintendent.

480
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Did you find anything?
I don't know.

481
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,600
Okay, we have a lot of Kodmanis
disciples here for questioning.

482
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,880
But none of them seem like a suspect to me.

483
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,500
But there is something else. Do you remember
Bilal, from back in the barracks?

484
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Who?
Said Bilal, the company commander.

485
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
He is in Kodmani's customer database.
What?

486
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,320
He is apparently a big customer
of rabid Islamist literature.

487
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,359
I'm on my way.

488
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,360
He's a member of several Islamist organizations.

489
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,480
He claims that the website has been
misused to disseminate the video.

490
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,900
But he was previously convicted. Right?
Yes.

491
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,360
But we won't know what that means
until the investigation is complete.

492
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,080
We don't make laws based on
current affairs, but we have an offer.

493
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,520
We can set up a committee ...

494
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,160
...which examines the need for a ban on
the unions the Popular Party has mentioned.

495
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,279
Buch ...

496
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,639
I'm not interested in
ending up in pickle jar.

497
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
The credit for this committee
should go to the People's Party.

498
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,640
And the minister is prepared to provide
concrete data for your decisions.

499
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
You can look your voters in the eye.
The problem's solved.

500
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Thanks, but we don't make
decisions based on current events.

501
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Discuss it with your people...
please let us know tomorrow.

502
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Tomorrow? Try never, it's not going to happen

503
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,880
The vote on the package is next week.
That may be too soon.

504
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,200
We have to discuss how
we'll tackle fundamentalism.

505
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,479
What next?

506
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,919
Should I ban lslam?

507
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,920
We'll leave it here for today.

508
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,750
He wants to gain votes from this situation.
I won't stand for it.

509
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,120
The prime minister needs to intervene.
It is your supporting party.

510
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,400
You have to figure it out.
No. We agree with the opposition.

511
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Tell Birgitte we want a press conference tonight
to announce the ageement failure.

512
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,120
They're having their own news conference.

513
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,959
What press conference?
There's no press conference planned.

514
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Be clear with the press.
Give me two minutes.

515
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,360
I was just about to call you.
You should know about it before it happens.

516
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,919
What's the problem?
We're cutting ties.

517
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,920
You'll have to make do with People's Party.
The group no longer has confidence in you.

518
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,280
But you'd agreed with the proposal to Krabbe.

519
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,400
Buch, you tricked me.
Can we talk about this?

520
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I've been informed about the memo.
What memo?

521
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,119
The note, from PET to your predecessor...

522
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,120
...when they warned of a terror
connection with the first killing.

523
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Someone in your ministry's been asleep.

524
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,800
The Audit investigation showed
it's been known for sometime.

525
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,680
I don't know what you're talking about.
Buch, I've seen the memo.

526
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
If I were you, I wouldn't have made
so many promises.

527
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Do you have a minute?

528
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,900
The Colonel is in a meeting.
It's you we need to talk to.

529
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,760
Take over.

530
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Do you know Abdel Hussein Kodmani?

531
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,359
No.

532
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,360
You bought a few books from him.

533
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Al Jihad and Radical lslam.
ls that your taste?

534
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,999
I bought them online.
Why?

535
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,960
What's this about?
Just answer the question.

536
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,440
The books help my officers understand
the mentality of the enemy.

537
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,000
They need to know what they are dealing
with, so they can come home again.

538
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Are you a Muslim, or ...

539
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,360
I was asked to buy these books.
You're welcome to ask.

540
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,000
If that is all, I have work to do.

541
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,650
I think you're bleeding.

542
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
Where were you last night
before we arrived?

543
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,850
In my office.
Can anyone confirm that?

544
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,920
You're wasting your time.
Wait, we're not done yet.

545
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Are you willing to give us a blood sample?

546
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,920
Not unless the Colonel orders it.

547
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,500
We can apply again in six months,
but it requires your cooperation.

548
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,620
He has at all times,
other than this episode.

549
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,000
What happened yesterday,
can't happen again.

550
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,900
Can you promise?
Of course.

551
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,200
Can we be alone for a moment?
Yes.

552
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,975
I'm so sorry for what happened to Myg...
...but I need you now.

553
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,620
How is Jonas?
He's fine.

554
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
But you need to focus on this.
It's important.

555
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I want a plan.

556
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,100
Should we find another lawyer?

557
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,860
Should we appeal the decision?

558
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
What should we do?
We only have a minute.

559
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,300
I need to see the chief of staff now
about my medication.

560
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,620
We have all kinds of practical issues
we need to discuss...

561
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,300
...like, which school should Jonas go to?

562
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,179
Where should we live?

563
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,180
First, I need to clean up my own mess.

564
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,180
This is urgent.
I'll see you again, baby.

565
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,680
How's it going?
I missed you.

566
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Raben?

567
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,560
If you must change clothes,
please hurry.

568
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,100
Can I shower?
Yes. You have two minutes.

569
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,440
Raben?

570
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Here I am.

571
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,680
Let Raben through.

572
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Jens Peter Raben is on his way to psychiatry.
He should be there in about four minutes.

573
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,360
Raben. Dinner in about a half hour?
Okay, about a half hour.

574
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,200
I assure you that Bilal had nothing
to do with the murder.

575
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,080
Either he talks to us here,
or he comes along to the station.

576
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
All communication must go
through me or Major Sorgaard.

577
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,400
So I think that you should
make sure he tells us the truth then.

578
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:22,360
Corporal Myg was under my command.
I went to visit him to clear some things up.

579
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,920
The door was open, so I went inside.

580
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,360
Then I saw him hanging from the ceiling.
I saw no one else.

581
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Then you came...
and I took off back to the barracks.

582
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,720
Nice story.
What had Myg done?

583
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
There had been a serious breach of security.

584
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,720
How?
Our security chief had reported ...

585
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,600
...that someone hacked the firewall
and accessed our database.

586
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,240
The logs showed that Myg Poulsen
had downloaded confidential information.

587
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
What's in the database?
He had downloaded a PDF file.

588
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,799
What file?

589
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,800
A list of a team of soldiers.
It was his team from Afghanistan.

590
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,600
He probably used the list in his
work with the veterans association.

591
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,999
You need to submit your DNA.

592
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So that story you told us yesterday was false.

593
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,760
It's been reported. When you left,
Bilal told me everything.

594
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,840
I contacted PET and Bilal's
explanation has been accepted.

595
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,880
You'd have known that if you had
contacted me first as we had agreed.

596
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,400
It was Brix. PET has arrested three
people associated with Kodmani.

597
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,080
May I borrow that picture?

598
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,680
The arrangement with PET is clearly one way.

599
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,680
Okay. This is Lund, send two deputies to
the Herstedvester prison.

600
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Yes. Look at the bottom left corner.

601
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,640
What am I looking at?

602
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Besides Myg Poulsen. That's Raben,
his friend who I visited today.

603
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,320
So what?

604
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,145
Anne Dragsholm?
He said he didn't know her.

605
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,160
It's about inmate Jens Peter Raben.

606
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,500
He must be transferred for questioning
at the prison immediately.

607
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,760
He disappeared behind the MRI building.
There is a blind spot.

608
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,640
He didn't come out the other side.

609
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
Over here.

610
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:45,750

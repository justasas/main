1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:14,374
Ten days ago, a woman was
killed in strange circumstances.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,332
The Muslim League will avenge
the suffering Denmark has caused

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,874
in Palestine, Iraq
and Afghanistan.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,624
Brix thinks
you can give us a new angle.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,290
- You're wasting your time.
- I could use your help.

6
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:35,207
- Allan Myg Poulsen, soldier.
- And the murder weapon?

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,665
- Round his neck.
- You're not on this case.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,165
- The case calls for a clean slate.
- This is what I do best.

9
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,749
I'll tell your workplace
we want to borrow you.

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:53,374
Abdel Hussein Kodmani.
The video was on his website.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,499
Police!

12
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,165
The Government has put a lot
of work into the terrorism package.

13
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:09,207
We need you to head the negotiations.
Will you be Minister of Justice?

14
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,832
The link was activated at 5:03pm.
At sunset, the end of Ramadan.

15
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:17,707
Not only this victim,
but also the woman served abroad.

16
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:22,790
- How can this come as a surprise?
- Your predecessor knew of the case.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,832
But none of us thought
it would develop into such madness.

18
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,082
We should announce
our agreement today

19
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,082
to show the killers
we won't falter.

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,415
- My party will decide nothing now.
- It's up for vote next week.

21
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,582
I know about the memo Special
Branch gave your predecessor

22
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:48,915
warning him about terrorism.
We no longer have confidence in you.

23
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,249
The Probation Service
turned you down.

24
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,040
- Why?
- Why can't I visit him?

25
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:01,040
He had a fit of rage
and won't take his medicine.

26
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:05,915
- We have many decisions to make.
- There is nothing wrong with me.

27
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:10,332
The police want to question you
about Myg Poulsen. He's been killed.

28
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:18,957
I was contacted on my website
by someone calling himself Faith Fellow.

29
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,415
He wanted to upload
a religious video.

30
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,915
I didn't know what it was
before it was on my website.

31
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:31,040
Just focus on Kodmani
and his followers. Agreed?

32
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:36,457
- I like football and opera.
- Take the next left turning.

33
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,124
Myg Poulsen was a good soldier.

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,540
- Were there any threats?
- All the time.

35
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,332
This was his bunk
and this was his closet.

36
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,165
- Who is Raben?
- He was invalided.

37
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,624
Suffering from delusions,
he took a nurse hostage.

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,624
He was sectioned indefinitely.

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,749
Did you know Anne Dragsholm?
Was she connected to Myg Poulsen?

40
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,665
- She was killed two weeks ago.
- I don't know her.

41
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,082
I'm really sorry about Myg.
But I need you now.

42
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,749
See you, love.

43
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,499
- What am I to see?
- Next to Myg Poulsen is Raben.

44
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,915
So what?

45
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,165
- Anne Dragsholm?
- He said he didn't know her.

46
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:39,374
THE KILLING

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:55,374
He left his ward to see the clinical
director, but never showed up.

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,874
He got past the alarm system
and escaped through the sewers.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,040
- Do you know how far he's got?
- No, but it can't be far.

50
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,124
We were quick to pursue him,
and it's dark as hell.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,207
- Where does the sewer pipe lead to?
- It ends up at the disposal plant.

52
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,249
But it'll take more than luck
to find the way.

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,165
The prison followed
all the correct procedures.

54
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,332
We are investigating the getaway.

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:33,040
- But he'll soon tire of the stench.
- Strange speaking.

56
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:09,665
They're searching the sewers.
He's more cunning than they think.

57
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:14,040
- What are you looking for?
- Anything about him.

58
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,040
- Brix is asking for us.
- Is the medical director here?

59
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:22,499
Yes, but Brix wants a report.
Special Branch arrested three...

60
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,040
We'll see the medical director first.

61
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:36,790
Raben had applied for parole,
but then he was turned down.

62
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,665
- It must have caused a relapse.
- A relapse of what?

63
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:45,874
Post-traumatic stress caused
by his experiences in the war.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,790
What experiences?

65
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,374
He was committed
to this institution

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,999
due to his aggressive
behaviour on his return.

67
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:02,332
- What were these experiences?
- It's confidential. Is it relevant?

68
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,957
You are not bound to secrecy
when people's lives are at stake.

69
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,290
You just claimed
that this man is dangerous.

70
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:16,207
Some of his mates died in the war,
and he felt guilty.

71
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,540
However, his amnesia
spared him some grief.

72
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,540
Did he mention an army buddy
called Allan Myg Poulsen?

73
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,457
Not until yesterday.
He wanted to call him.

74
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,165
He was worried about him.

75
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:37,207
- What was he worried about?
- That he would harm himself.

76
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,665
Why do you ask?

77
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,707
What about her? Military legal
consultant Anne Dragsholm?

78
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,040
Raben hardly talked about war.

79
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,165
He focused on his future
and his family.

80
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,207
Could he have been
in touch with her?

81
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,665
No. Not without my knowledge.
Why?

82
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,957
- We're trying to get a picture...
- How can you be sure?

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,249
This is a list of his phone calls
and visits during his time here.

84
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,582
I don't know what you're after,
but we're not trying to hide anything.

85
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,415
His escape is unfortunate,
and we should have foreseen it

86
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,540
considering his diagnosis.

87
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:26,999
This is a recording of Raben's
examination before he was committed.

88
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,540
It may give you some idea.

89
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,374
He spent three weeks in that cell
before we could start treatment.

90
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:59,707
- Of course. I understand.
- He got out at the pumping plant.

91
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,415
It's 5km away. Shall we go?

92
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:08,290
The area must be searched and
we must visit his family and friends.

93
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:13,957
He's a missing person, not a suspect.
So no APE is issued.

94
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:20,124
He was photographed with the two
victims, but let's not mix things up.

95
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,040
We're not.
He knows something.

96
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,582
He knew both victims, lied and fled.

97
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:30,374
- Does he know the Muslim League?
- How should I know?

98
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,124
Brix says they have more on Kodmani.
He must be questioned again.

99
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,874
Raben could have escaped
a long time ago.

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,999
- He's capable of anything.
- Yet he chooses this moment.

101
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,874
- Let's just get on with it.
- Admit, it's strange...

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,624
I respect your methods, but they
have been known to lead to disaster.

103
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,540
- So now you're listening to gossip?
- No, I'm just saying...

104
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:07,249
Right. I'll talk to Brix.
I'm driving. Hand me the key!

105
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,707
No, he has no previous convictions.
I have it in writing.

106
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:39,082
I'll send you everything.
Thank you for looking into it. Bye.

107
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:44,082
Hi. I just spoke to another lawyer.

108
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,624
Louise... Do you have a moment?

109
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,457
He thinks we have grounds
for an appeal.

110
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,957
I promised to send him
all the documents...

111
00:09:56,083 --> 00:10:00,874
It seems he had been planning
his escape for a long time.

112
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,999
- When did he escape?
- Just after your daughter's visit.

113
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:15,040
If you have any idea where
he's heading, you should tell us.

114
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,165
We have no idea.

115
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:26,040
- Does he have any foreign contacts?
- Yes, he's an ex-serviceman.

116
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:30,165
He was stationed several places abroad.
So it's a possibility.

117
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,249
And did he tell you anything?

118
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,415
If my daughter knew anything,
she'd let you know.

119
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:43,582
You must understand
we are shaken up by this.

120
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:50,790
Right... Here's my card, in case
he contacts you. He is dangerous.

121
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,582
Thank you.
We got the message.

122
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,999
Do you want me to give you a hand?

123
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,499
Something's amiss.

124
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,249
He said he'd resume treatment.

125
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,832
Whatever he's done,
it must be for a reason.

126
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:34,207
He would have told me.
I know he wouldn't just run off.

127
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,290
Mummy...

128
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,082
Why aren't you asleep, Jonas?
Come along, darling.

129
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,332
Excuse me.
Could you give me a lift?

130
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,124
Go ahead, jump in.
Don't forget your seatbelt.

131
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,332
- I just need to cross the bridge.
- I'm not going across it.

132
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,415
- Can I drive with you anyway?
- I suggest you find someone else.

133
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:12,040
Are you crossing the bridge?
Can I ride with you? I'll behave.

134
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,207
Newly appointed
Minister of Justice, Thomas Buch

135
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,624
failed to get broad agreement
on the terrorism package.

136
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,832
The Opposition accuses
the Government of withholding facts

137
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,874
about the two murders,
believed to be acts of terrorism.

138
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,790
In a secret memo, Special Branch
warned the Ministry of Justice

139
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,999
that the killings
could be acts of terrorism.

140
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,999
I know nothing of that memo!

141
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,624
The Government did nothing.

142
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,707
Yes. I'll call the Prime Minister,
when I know more. Bye.

143
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,165
- Krabbe, People's Party
- First, I must talk to Plough.

144
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:23,457
- Where the hell is he?
- He's not answering his phones.

145
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,540
I'm sure
Plough can explain everything.

146
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,624
Yes, but where is he?
Shall I institute a search?

147
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,040
I apologise for the delay.
Shall we?

148
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,124
I asked our legal staff to assess

149
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,749
whether Agger's statement
is a breach of the Official Secrets Act.

150
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:48,374
- But is it true, what she says?
- Nobody knows what went wrong.

151
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,790
Is it true? I'm asking you!

152
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,499
Yes. There was a memo.

153
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,499
And, yes, it warned about terrorism.

154
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,832
Nobody can explain
how she got hold of it.

155
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,290
I don't give a shit how she got it!
But why haven't I got it?

156
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,790
- If you'll allow me to...
- I want to see that memo, right now!

157
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,582
The memo was sent directly to me.

158
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,582
I presented it to your predecessor.

159
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:29,290
It sums up the Memorial Park killing.
Special Branch were concerned

160
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,999
because of the location
and the victim's past.

161
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,665
- Is terrorism mentioned?
- Yes.

162
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,624
- Should I not have been informed?
- Yes, in hindsight.

163
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,374
Your predecessor Monberg and I
removed the memo from the file.

164
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,749
We couldn't risk it getting around.

165
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:52,040
Monberg said the information
could compromise national security.

166
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:57,082
- Which information?
- About the victim's past, I suppose.

167
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:02,582
- You suppose?
- Monberg fell ill after that.

168
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,165
- But I'm certain...
- So you don't know!

169
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,624
Monberg was going
to consult Special Branch.

170
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:16,040
He knew what he was doing.
He was a very conscientious Minister.

171
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,999
We must find that information.

172
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,582
Arrange a meeting
with König, Special Branch.

173
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,457
Will do. But the Prime Minister
wants to see you right away.

174
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:34,624
- Why didn't you act upon the memo?
- It was removed from the file.

175
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,040
- Removed? Why?
- That was before Monberg fell ill.

176
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,207
- It compromises national security.
- How?

177
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,249
I hoped you could help me
answer that question.

178
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,999
- Did Monberg ever tell...?
- I can assure you he didn't.

179
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,457
- If he had, it hadn't gone so far.
- Of course not.

180
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:02,332
Agger wants to smear us.
Put a lid on it. Focus on the package.

181
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,707
Do you have a hold
on the People's Party

182
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,999
- I wouldn't say that.
- They're biding their time.

183
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,457
You must repudiate
Agger's accusations.

184
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,249
Right. Monberg hasn't
regained consciousness.

185
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,707
So I am waiting for a report
from Special Branch.

186
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:28,374
This has shocked us all. We should
join forces instead of arguing.

187
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,874
It will only get worse
if the case isn't solved.

188
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,582
- It will be. I'll see to it.
- I'm counting on it.

189
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,290
You've been given a raw deal.

190
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:45,207
My door is open
if you need anything.

191
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,457
- Excuse me.
- I'll find my way out.

192
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,499
Agger is going to be
even more troublesome.

193
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:07,332
They want a consultation tomorrow.

194
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,457
They want answers
regarding the memo

195
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:14,415
but they hope you have none,
and will fry you in front of the press.

196
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,665
- I don't have any answers.
- You'll find some.

197
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,665
Find out why Monberg feared
for our national security

198
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,374
and get this business
out of the way. Understood?

199
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,749
Hello, darling. Yes!

200
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,290
Are the girls asleep?

201
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,540
I'm sorry I didn't
get to say goodnight.

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,290
Something came up...

203
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:11,082
Raben denied knowing the first victim.
But we found this.

204
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:18,082
Team Ægir consisted of 500 troops
stationed in Afghanistan.

205
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,040
Jens Peter Raben, Allan Myg Poulsen
and Anne Dragsholm.

206
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:27,165
I don't see any connection
to the Muslim League.

207
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:33,082
The killer got hold of the list
of all Team Ægir's members.

208
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:37,332
So we must get hold of Raben.
He knows what all this is about.

209
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:41,582
Special Branch found
a printout of the team list.

210
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,874
They've arrested three suspects
connected to Kodmani's organisation.

211
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,582
When searching
the organisation's premises

212
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,290
they found a key
to a PO box in Vesterbro.

213
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,749
It's registered in Kodmani's name.
The contents speak for itself.

214
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,957
- Lennart.
- Shall we get started?

215
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:17,624
You sympathise with the Taliban's war
against the international forces.

216
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,790
The Afghan people
have the right to defend themselves.

217
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,249
Is it OK
to kill Danish soldiers?

218
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,624
What can you expect?
You're at war. You kill too!

219
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,582
Is that why you collect dog tags?

220
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,540
- I have an alibi.
- This was in your PO box.

221
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,749
Also, we found a list of Team Ægir.
Among them are the two victims.

222
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,707
You registered the PO box
about a month ago.

223
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,290
It's not ours.
I've never seen it before.

224
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:57,165
The dog tags were made with tools
found at the crime scenes.

225
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,624
- They don't belong to us.
- They were in your box.

226
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,415
- Why?
- Why did you get that box?

227
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:11,374
Look at these photos.
Did you order this?

228
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,207
- I didn't give any orders.
- Look at the pictures!

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,624
Faith Fellow told me
to set up a PO box.

230
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:32,290
Bullshit! You were preaching
to the young members about injustice.

231
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:38,790
- Why have a PO box?
- You let others do your dirty work.

232
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,665
- In which language did he write?
- You must come clean.

233
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,832
Did he write in English?
Shut up, for the moment!

234
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,457
What did Faith Fellow write?
What about Raben?

235
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,290
Did he mention someone in Team Ægir
by the name of Jens Peter Raben?

236
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,665
- I'm not saying any more.
- Tell me something, damn it!

237
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,457
Who is Faith Fellow?
What do you know?

238
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,374
He and the three others
remain in custody.

239
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,749
- We'll keep at it.
- Yes.

240
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,374
Lund has been hired as a consultant.
She was formerly...

241
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,165
Thank you. I know about Lund.

242
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,915
She was with the border police
for a couple of years. Lennart,

243
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,957
I won't interfere
with your investigation, but damn...

244
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,457
She was thrown out,
and for many good reasons.

245
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,707
I'm sure she was accomplished,
but what we saw today

246
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,582
was extremely incompetent.

247
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,457
I'm sorry.
It wasn't my intention to...

248
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,957
- I want a word with Lund.
- Right.

249
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,165
I would like to say
that I support Lund.

250
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:43,665
I can't see how the evidence
could have been planted.

251
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,374
But we'd never have got so far,
if it hadn't been for Lund.

252
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,957
If she feels so strongly about Raben,
it may be worth checking.

253
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,790
Right. OK. Thanks.

254
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:12,374
Apart for his wife and son,
hardly anyone visited Raben.

255
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,499
- No friends?
- Myg Poulsen and his lawyer.

256
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,124
Someone from Team Ægir
can tell us about him and the victims.

257
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,665
The list has over 500 names.
We could start at the barracks tomorrow.

258
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,457
- I'll follow up on Raben.
- I'll look at Team Ægir.

259
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,832
And thank you for...

260
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,832
Don't mention it.

261
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,624
You would have continued,
no matter what.

262
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,582
- Is that a problem?
- No, on the contrary.

263
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,582
Strange? Someone is waiting for you.

264
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,207
I'm coming.

265
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,999
- See you tomorrow.
- Right.

266
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,957
Call me if something turns up.

267
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,832
Lund. I was to give you this.

268
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:38,290
Raben was seen at a filling station
south of Copenhagen, on their CCTV.

269
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,457
He was trying to get a lift
heading west.

270
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,832
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

271
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:11,290
The church is closed.
Come back tomorrow.

272
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,749
Hey! I said it's closed.

273
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,040
Hi, Priest.
Long time no see.

274
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,082
- Does any of it fit?
- Yes. It's fine.

275
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,749
This is all I could find.
Apart from hosts.

276
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,957
The altar wine is quite good.

277
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,915
What are you going to do?

278
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:52,707
- Have you been home, ever since?
- Yes.

279
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:57,124
I found a nice little parish here.
It suits me perfectly.

280
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,332
- Are you seeing any of the old team?
- No.

281
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,915
But I heard about Myg.
I don't know what you are up to.

282
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,499
But be careful.

283
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:13,040
Use your head.
Think of your wife and son.

284
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:17,499
I need your help, Priest.
There is someone I need to talk to.

285
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:24,124
It's important.
I don't know who else to ask.

286
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,249
Will you help me?

287
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,499
THURSDAY, 17 NOVEMBER
8:45AM

288
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,124
DAY 4

289
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,582
Raben appears to have crossed
the bridge. We're checking his contacts.

290
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,790
The three suspects are in custody.

291
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:50,499
I have search warrants for several
members of Kodmani's organisation.

292
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,415
Right. And what about Team Ægir?

293
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:08,749
I was on a date last night.
It got rather late.

294
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,915
Hold this for a moment.

295
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:19,082
Team Ægir was in active service abroad,
two and a half years ago.

296
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,957
Raben and Myg Poulsen
were together

297
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,832
but I don't know about Dragsholm.

298
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,749
- Is that all?
- Do you have a painkiller?

299
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,707
No! I haven't got any painkillers.

300
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,874
There's no reason to be jealous.
She's just an old friend.

301
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,332
- I couldn't care less!
- OK! What did you find on Raben?

302
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,124
Raben is 37. He's been in the army
most of his adult life.

303
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,124
His rank is staff sergeant. Trained
at the sergeant school in Sønderborg.

304
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,124
He was stationed abroad
with the armoured infantry.

305
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,540
- The last time with Team Ægir.
- OK.

306
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,540
He was decorated several times,
but was wounded and sent home.

307
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:22,249
He was getting better, but something
snapped. You know the rest.

308
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:28,457
However, he is married to Louise Raben,
and they have a son.

309
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:35,249
- Why is that important?
- Louise's father is Colonel Jarnvig.

310
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,957
Jens Peter Raben is his son-in-law.

311
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,665
OK. It's a small world.

312
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:47,165
The colonel was with Team Ægir.
He was battalion commander.

313
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,457
But he denied knowing
Anne Dragsholm.

314
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,499
Why didn't you tell me before?

315
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:01,124
You were busy being jealous.
Shall we drive on?

316
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,832
- You claim you never met her.
- I never did!

317
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:14,374
She's on a photo and a list of Team Ægir.
And you were their commander.

318
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,665
The picture was taken at Oksbøl,
before deployment.

319
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:25,999
Maybe she was there to teach
the soldiers about the law of war.

320
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:30,332
I can assure you
she was not on Team Ægir.

321
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,749
You can't remember all 500 of them.

322
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,374
Check with the Army
Operational Command.

323
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:41,207
I know my advisors.
She was never one of them.

324
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,165
I trust that will be all...

325
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:49,165
I'd like to hear about
your son-in-law, Jens Peter Raben.

326
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,874
- Why?
- He was wounded and demobbed.

327
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,207
What actually happened?

328
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:08,707
- What do those questions lead to?
- We found some coincidences...

329
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:14,874
Who cares about your coincidences?
Two soldiers were killed.

330
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:21,290
My men and their families are worried,
and you ask about Raben!

331
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:27,124
Do your work, and we'll do ours.

332
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,415
OK, thank you. Bye.

333
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,082
Army Operative Command confirms

334
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,499
that Dragsholm was only
at Oksbøl for a legal seminar.

335
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,957
- She was on the team list.
- They say she opted out.

336
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:50,915
If she knew Raben and Myg at all,
they weren't close.

337
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:57,915
- Any news about Raben?
- No. We must follow up on Kodmani.

338
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:02,665
The searches paid off.
We'll have to book them all.

339
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,790
Strange speaking.

340
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:10,832
- Just go. I'll follow later.
- Now what? Where are you going?

341
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,249
All right. We're on our way.
At least one of us is. Bye.

342
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:21,124
It's a network
connected to Ahl Al-Kahf

343
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,707
founded by Abdel Hussein Kodmani.

344
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:30,874
We've arrested three more suspects.
There are more to come.

345
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,665
- So the case is almost solved?
- Yes. The evidence is incriminating.

346
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:41,749
We have caught the culprits.
We'll inform the public today.

347
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:47,540
How could Agger know the contents
of a memo from Special Branch?

348
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,415
She doesn't have it from us.

349
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:55,707
It's important to know
the course of events.

350
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,999
What did my predecessor know?
What action was taken? And why?

351
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:04,874
We were investigating
the Memorial Park killing.

352
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,665
The victim had been in the army,
so we sent the Minister a memo.

353
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:15,582
- And you didn't pass it on to me?
- You hadn't been briefed.

354
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,540
And we weren't alone in the room.

355
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:23,249
How did my predecessor
react to your memo?

356
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:28,165
Isn't he the best person
to answer that?

357
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,165
I'm facing a consultation later
to clear things up.

358
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:36,332
I'm sure my predecessor would
appreciate it if you help us along.

359
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:43,540
Yes, of course.
The Minister was very concerned.

360
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:48,165
Why didn't Special Branch
inform the police?

361
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:52,665
For a very good reason.
Special Branch was looking for terrorism.

362
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:56,082
But why was the police
kept in the dark for two weeks?

363
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:00,082
- You knew it was terrorism.
- We weren't sure.

364
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:05,665
The Minister deemed it too risky
to inform the police.

365
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:11,374
He thought certain information would
compromise the nation's security.

366
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:17,790
- What information would that be?
- I'd like to know that too.

367
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,540
It's usually my business to know.

368
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:24,832
He would get back to me with
an explanation, but he didn't make it.

369
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,499
- So you don't know?
- Unfortunately not.

370
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:40,457
- Two files. The rest were shredded.
- It must be there, somewhere.

371
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,957
Agger's got a point. We didn't take
the threat of terrorism seriously.

372
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,707
I was Monberg's
Permanent Secretary for nine years.

373
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:55,290
- He never took a wrong step.
- He omitted to inform about this.

374
00:34:55,416 --> 00:35:01,707
He must have had his reasons.
Buch, you're damaging the walls!

375
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:07,082
I've found something.
I went through the files.

376
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,624
Monberg requisitioned
information about Anne Dragsholm.

377
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:17,124
- What sort of information?
- From the Ministry of Defense.

378
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,790
It was requisitioned and returned.

379
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,790
They should be able to retrieve it.

380
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:31,457
I don't understand. The Minister
can't do that without my knowledge.

381
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,915
Maybe you went to the loo, Plough!

382
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:38,040
We are busy. What can you do?

383
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:42,999
I'll contact the Permanent Secretary.
Karina, get the Minister ready.

384
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:48,040
- Run through the questions.
- Hurry up, damn it!

385
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,457
- Grüner...
- Hi, Priest. Where's the choir?

386
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:13,624
- The choir isn't coming, after all.
- Why not?

387
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,290
I brought my music.

388
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,415
Someone is here to see you.

389
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,915
The work is all right.
Not very interesting.

390
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,082
I'm still a bit choosy.

391
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:53,082
- How's Marie?
- Fine. We're doing all right.

392
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,124
- And the baby?
- Not a baby any more.

393
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,332
He is everything to me, man.

394
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:07,749
She wants to have a wheelchair
when she grows up, just like Daddy.

395
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,249
And I'm playing music again.

396
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,332
- When did they let you out?
- They didn't.

397
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,457
I didn't exactly walk out the door.

398
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,374
Have you spoken to anyone lately?

399
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,832
- Did Myg look you up?
- Why did you escape?

400
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,374
Because he's dead.

401
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,124
So is that lawyer woman.
Don't you watch the news?

402
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,874
Yes. But we don't exchange
Christmas cards.

403
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:46,165
- What is going on?
- I don't know anything.

404
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:51,249
Myg and the lawyer woman are dead.
Maybe it's the will of God.

405
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,957
Myg visited me
the day he was killed.

406
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:59,999
I know nothing!
Don't stir up that old shit.

407
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,582
- What are you on about?
- Let me go, damn it!

408
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:07,457
- I don't know shit!
- You know something.

409
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,082
Come here.

410
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,790
Let me go!

411
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,040
See you, Raben.
And good luck to you.

412
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:36,749
Grüner! If you want to talk
to me, call Priest. OK?

413
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:44,374
- I must get hold of the others.
- I don't know where they are.

414
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:49,082
You have connections.
You can find their whereabouts.

415
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:52,874
- Can I borrow your mobile?
- What for?

416
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,249
- I must tell Louise why I escaped.
- I don't understand it.

417
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,957
Be careful.

418
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,290
PRISONER ESCAPED

419
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:07,582
I told the police what I know.
Can't you leave me alone?

420
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:11,957
This woman is Anne Dragsholm.
Your husband knew her.

421
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,499
I don't know who she is.

422
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:21,249
- Did he seem worried or concerned?
- His mate had just been killed.

423
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:25,582
He had been turned down
by the Probation Service.

424
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,874
Do you think
that's why he escaped?

425
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,582
How long have you been married?

426
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,832
We met 14 years ago
and got married four years ago. Why?

427
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,957
How did you meet?

428
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:48,832
I visited my dad at the barracks.
Jens gave me a lift into town.

429
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:52,790
- He had just started here.
- And then you got together?

430
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:57,749
No. He wanted to travel the world
and make a difference.

431
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:02,624
I didn't want to be a soldier's girlfriend.
So it wasn't to be.

432
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,790
He decided
it was for the last time.

433
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,082
What happened?

434
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:18,415
They were ambushed
and cut off from the rest.

435
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,249
He was flown to a field hospital

436
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,207
until he could be transferred
to a hospital back home.

437
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,707
Several weeks passed
before they knew if he'd survive.

438
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,290
Do you have any idea
why he escaped?

439
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,499
No.

440
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:47,499
Do you know where he is?
Did he leave a message?

441
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:54,415
- I have to collect my son.
- Yes, of course.

442
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,874
If he contacts you,
you must call me.

443
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,332
- The border police at Gedser?
- My number is on the back.

444
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,999
That woman on the picture...

445
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,332
I think she visited Jens
in the hospital.

446
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,707
But she had a different surname.

447
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:23,665
Many people came to question him,
and I think she was among them.

448
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,165
- Lund here.
- I tried to call you.

449
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:34,207
Kodmani sent an email inciting
continuation of the war on Danish soil.

450
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:38,915
We've arrested everyone
connected to his organisation.

451
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,707
Anne Dragsholm
visited Raben in the hospital.

452
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,790
Louise Raben recognised her.

453
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:52,290
Dragsholm questioned Raben
about what happened in Afghanistan.

454
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:57,415
OK. Why would she question him?

455
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:00,832
You'll have to ask someone
in the army.

456
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,499
- I've talked enough with the army.
- Try again. Go there.

457
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:08,999
What was Dragsholm doing in the army
while Raben was in hospital?

458
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,332
- What will you do?
- I'll ask her husband.

459
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:16,915
Bad idea. He's suing for wrongful arrest.
And her funeral is today

460
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,540
Strange?

461
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:23,832
Special Branch wants a press conference
about the arrests.

462
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,874
If you uncover something new,
please let me know ASAP.

463
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,374
Lund, listen to me. Lund?

464
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,582
Louise...

465
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,415
- Do you want a lift?
- Yes!

466
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:07,040
I just took someone to the station,
so it's very convenient.

467
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:30,540
- This is Grüner.
- What's up?

468
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:39,790
That lawyer woman contacted me,
a few weeks before she was killed.

469
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:44,290
- What about, Grüner?
- Can we meet?

470
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:10,124
Hello. Sarah Lund, police detective.
May I offer my condolences?

471
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,249
I'm afraid I have
to ask you some questions.

472
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:21,374
I wouldn't bother you today
if it wasn't important.

473
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:30,040
I fear that others will suffer
the same fate as your wife...

474
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:39,124
Why did you confess?

475
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:44,624
In the end, I didn't care what you believed.
It was easier to confess.

476
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:49,540
It was more important
that she knew it wasn't me.

477
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:55,832
- Did she speak of her army work?
- Not much.

478
00:45:55,958 --> 00:46:00,457
- Did she ever mention Myg Poulsen?
- No. I've already been asked that.

479
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,124
- What about Jens Peter Raben?
- No.

480
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:11,499
Did she quit the army
because you met?

481
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:14,790
No. We knew each other
years before we got married.

482
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:20,082
I wanted her to find another job,
but she liked the army.

483
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:27,082
- Why did she resign?
- She was fired. So it seemed to her.

484
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:30,374
Fired? Why?

485
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,124
There was a conflict.

486
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,790
About an incident
with some soldiers in Afghanistan.

487
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:41,874
- What incident?
- That's all I know.

488
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,582
I must get home and see to my guests.

489
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:48,249
But the army got her
to investigate that incident.

490
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:53,374
That was part of the problem.
She did it on her own initiative.

491
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,415
The army didn't seem to take
the team's account seriously.

492
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,957
The team of soldiers.
She conducted their case.

493
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,665
- So she was their lawyer?
- Yes.

494
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:12,999
- Thank you.
- All right.

495
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:28,999
I asked around at Defense Command.
They'll look into it.

496
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,124
No need for that now.
Do you have the list of Team Ægir?

497
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,290
We must get hold of someone
from Raben's group.

498
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,999
The Opposition claims
the memo was not taken seriously.

499
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:47,165
That is incorrect. Special Branch
was investigating the case

500
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:53,124
and was keeping the groups
involved under surveillance.

501
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:59,165
Terrific! But why did your
predecessor withhold information

502
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,915
to the fact
that it was a terror threat.

503
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:08,207
This was out of consideration
to national security.

504
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:12,624
- I wish to hear more about that.
- This meeting was at short notice.

505
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,040
Patience is a virtue
that would suit Ms. Agger.

506
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:19,582
I'm expecting Karina
to bring the documents.

507
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:24,999
Is it correct that members
of Ahl Al-Kahf have been arrested?

508
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,165
That is correct, but...

509
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:33,374
That is one of the organisations
the People's Party want to ban.

510
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,082
If your predecessor thought
it was an act of terror

511
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:42,957
why did the police spend ten days
questioning the victim's husband?

512
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:47,874
Because Special Branch
focused on the terror lead.

513
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,915
Surely, the police were informed about
Special Branch's terrorism theory?

514
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,290
No, the police were not informed.

515
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:06,415
- Who was responsible for that?
- Special Branch was on the case.

516
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:11,082
So your predecessor decided
to keep the police in the dark

517
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,332
thus jeopardising
the entire investigation.

518
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:20,832
My predecessor cannot answer,
but I've told the committee everything.

519
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,874
Yes, about national security.
But what does that cover here?

520
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,374
The People's Party
has not been informed about this.

521
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,624
If there is no further explanation,
we will have to conclude

522
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,957
that the Ministry of Justice
has withheld information

523
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,499
thus misleading our Parliament.

524
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,999
The Minister seems confused.

525
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:52,332
He must be informed
of the rules of these consultations.

526
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:56,290
Although he probably won't need
to know for much longer!

527
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:14,207
I apologise for the interruption.
Where were we?

528
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:19,082
The Government's responsibility
for this tragedy.

529
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:23,665
The Special Branch memo
was classified information.

530
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:29,290
Publishing it would cause discord
when we should stand united.

531
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:35,165
The Government has caused mistrust.
We demand a thorough investigation.

532
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:39,624
You shall have one. But first,
you should see this document

533
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:45,749
about the risk involved
in publicising what the victim knew.

534
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:50,582
An open investigation
could reveal information

535
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:56,874
which would compromise
our military strategy in Afghanistan

536
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,249
thus endangering
the lives of Danish soldiers.

537
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:09,707
- We will have to look into this.
- It is classified information.

538
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:14,790
It must be treated
with absolute confidentiality.

539
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:18,415
Obviously, it is not
to be released to the press.

540
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:23,582
So unless others doubt
my predecessor's motive

541
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:27,207
I will withdraw and resume my duties.
Thank you.

542
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:41,499
- Damn, we were good!
- You wrapped it up neatly.

543
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:47,374
- Thanks to you. Did we go too far?
- No! She asked for it!

544
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,249
We just need to find out
how she got hold of the memo.

545
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:57,124
- It's the Prime Minister.
- Send out a press release.

546
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:02,290
Hi, Thomas. Congratulations.
I hear it went quite well.

547
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:05,915
Thanks.
My staff prepared me well.

548
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:09,749
Now you can concentrate
on the terrorism package.

549
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:13,999
- I'll talk to the People's Party.
- Good luck.

550
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:17,832
Come in. Have a drink.

551
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:22,957
Krabbe will try to force you
to ban that organisation.

552
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:27,582
- They know who they're up against!
- Karina, come and have a drink.

553
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,082
Send some bottles
to the Ministry of Defense.

554
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:36,040
I was collecting Monberg's private
documents and came across this.

555
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:40,915
- Just send him everything.
- Cheers! Thanks for your help.

556
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:45,874
Plough, Monberg had a private diary
I didn't know about.

557
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,999
Evidently,
he knew Anne Dragsholm personally.

558
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:56,374
I don't get it, but at least twice
he has had a meeting with her.

559
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,290
It has been confirmed
as her mobile number.

560
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:04,249
Their last meeting was in a hotel,
the weekend before the killing.

561
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,207
- Check it out.
- Right.

562
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,665
- Are we having dinner soon?
- In a moment, darling.

563
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,665
I'm chopping off the dragon's head,
but he has acid for blood.

564
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:57,582
Good. You must be hungry.

565
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:11,374
How would you like
to have your own room?

566
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:16,332
Granddad says you can have his.

567
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,915
We could make it really cosy
with all your toys.

568
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,457
Shall we do that?

569
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:32,415
And I've found a school for you,
which we should go and see.

570
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:36,790
- Am I starting school this summer?
- Yes, that's right.

571
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,749
Hello?

572
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,665
Isn't Daddy going to have
his own room?

573
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,249
Yes, but...

574
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,915
We'll see about that.
It's dinner time.

575
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,040
- May I draw?
- Of course.

576
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,665
- Our guards found Jonas' mitten.
- Oh? Thanks.

577
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:06,124
You must have dropped it on the way.
Lucky, it had his name tag.

578
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:11,082
There was no name tag.
And we drove in Søgaard's car.

579
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,207
Well, anyway,
it was found by the gate.

580
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,165
How are things, Jonas?

581
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,790
Grüner?

582
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:06,874
- Was Dragsholm the team's lawyer?
- Yes. We need to confirm that.

583
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,749
But that was several years ago.

584
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:14,832
- What was his name?
- David Grüner.

585
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:19,915
- He's on the evening shift.
- Are you sure it's here?

586
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:24,624
Yes. Go inside. I'll drive round
and look for a main entrance.

587
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,457
Hey!

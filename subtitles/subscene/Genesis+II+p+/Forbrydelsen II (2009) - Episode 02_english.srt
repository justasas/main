1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:17,665
About ten days ago, a woman
was killed under strange circumstances.

2
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,874
You'll have read about it
in the papers.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,957
Brix believes
you may give us a new angle.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,915
Tell Brix I'm not interested.

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:32,249
Sarah Lund here.
I'll take the train in a couple of hours.

6
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,124
I'm only staying
until tomorrow.

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:42,499
Minister of Justice Monberg
is in hospital due to a heart attack.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,999
Hi, Thomas. The government
has worked hard on the terror package.

9
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,499
We need you to head the negotiations.

10
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,624
Will you be Minister of Justice?

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,165
We are at war. Like it or not,
we have to find unity.

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,665
So we need to work towards
a broad, national agreement.

13
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,457
The terror package
doesn't cover the actual threat.

14
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,874
The People's Party won't budge,
so we're out.

15
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,040
They interview me
and then evaluate me.

16
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,790
According to my lawyer and the doctor
I stand a good chance this time.

17
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:21,249
We'll be together so much
the two of you'll miss being alone.

18
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,124
- Is Daddy coming home?
- Yes, he is.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,957
- Is he getting out now?
- It is possible.

20
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,207
What if it doesn't happen?

21
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,540
She was attacked in her kitchen.
She was stabbed 21 times.

22
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:41,249
- This is where we found her.
- She had no connection to this place.

23
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:46,915
- She was in the Danish Defense?
- As military legal advisor.

24
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:52,582
I have some photos of a dead woman
in Memorial Park.

25
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,124
Your predecessor wanted
to be kept up-to-date.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,707
Memorial Park
is a national monument.

27
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:03,082
This gives rise to speculation,
which we want to quash.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,790
Did he stab her to make her talk?
What about?

29
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,790
- Dog tag.
- My old army buddy is troubled.

30
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,874
- I can help you, Myg.
- You don't know shit!

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,415
The Probation Service
turned you down. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:28,040
- Easy now, easy.
- Let me go!

33
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:32,624
- The killer got it on film.
- I just opened the link.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,332
I accuse the Danish government
of hypocrisy.

35
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,999
The Muslim League will avenge
the suffering Denmark has caused

36
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,415
in Palestine,
Iraq and Afghanistan.

37
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,457
Where is the veterans' club located?

38
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,624
The secretary is Allan Myg Poulsen.

39
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,665
Hey!

40
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,415
THE KILLING

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,082
News special. A terror threat
has been issued against Denmark.

42
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,415
Our sources confirm
the validity of this threat.

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,082
A video recording
lasting 45 seconds

44
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:31,499
was streamed onto an Islamist website
at 5:03pm today.

45
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:36,207
Sources in The Ministry of Justice
do not wish to comment

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:40,582
until they have been informed
by the police and Special Branch.

47
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:09,374
The victim is Allan Myg Poulsen, 36,
unmarried. Professional soldier.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,749
For some years, he worked for the army
out of the nearby barracks.

49
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,915
He also did odd jobs
for a veterans' club,

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:23,082
The Black Berets,
whose office is at this address.

51
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,249
We have instituted a search
for the man who ran off.

52
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,749
But Lund barely saw him.

53
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,332
- Are there any other witnesses?
- A neighbour saw him come home.

54
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,499
The back door was forced open.
His assailant was waiting for him.

55
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,124
According to Forensics
the victim threw up and shat himself.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,707
I think the perpetrator was alone
with the victim for some time.

57
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:59,249
He must have known
the building was derelict.

58
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,999
- Have you found the murder weapon?
- It's around his neck.

59
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,457
Lund found him.

60
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,374
What about Special Branch?

61
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,499
Where is Lund?

62
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,915
We must search the tracks.

63
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,374
He scaled a barbed wire fence.
He may have bled.

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,915
I saw only him,
but there might have been others.

65
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,582
Have Special Branch said anything?

66
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,165
They were clearly taken by surprise.

67
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:40,874
We have to start from scratch.
May I have a copy of the video?

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,082
Lund, you're not on this case.

69
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,499
What do you mean?

70
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:54,499
- You sent someone for me.
- To have you look at the case.

71
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,999
You knew something was amiss,
or you wouldn't have asked me.

72
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,374
The situation has changed.
But your record hasn't.

73
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,040
There are disciplinary problems,

74
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,707
and you threatened
a colleague with at loaded gun.

75
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,874
They haven't forgotten
at police headquarters.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,665
Your negligence may have caused
the death of Jan Meyer.

77
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,207
Why should I trust you?

78
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,499
Give me one good reason
for taking you on.

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,749
I know I have made mistakes.

80
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,874
I only wish I could...

81
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,665
But I can't.

82
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,874
This is what I do best.

83
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,207
I'll contact
your work place in Gedser.

84
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:18,290
We'll borrow you for a while,
a couple of days to start with.

85
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,790
We'll take it from there.

86
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,665
Are we agreed on the matter?

87
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,832
The video is ready for you
at police headquarters.

88
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,874
- They have arrived.
- Kiss the girls for me. Bye.

89
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,749
I told the press
to wait for your comments.

90
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,415
The Prime Minister's office
must be kept informed about the case.

91
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:58,915
Erik König, chief of Special Branch.
Deputy Commissioner Ruth Hedeby.

92
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:04,290
The link was activated at 5:03pm.
At sunset, the end of Ramadan.

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,499
We traced the website
to a server in London.

94
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,665
The authorities closed
the website down at 5:23pm.

95
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,415
- How many saw the video?
- Quite a few.

96
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,499
They were sent
to the ministries and the media.

97
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,957
Can't you trace who sent them?

98
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,415
No. They were sent from hotspots.

99
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,957
The website is a forum
for fundamentalists.

100
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,165
It was registered in Denmark.

101
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,165
By whom and when?

102
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,665
Six months ago.
We are tracing the holder.

103
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,582
- What about the Muslim League?
- We have nothing on them at present.

104
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:51,124
Either the group is new
or a branch of an existing one.

105
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,290
What do we know
about the woman in the video?

106
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:59,707
She has been identified
as the victim in Memorial Park.

107
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,790
Anne Dragsholm, 35, solicitor.

108
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,249
There is also a second victim.

109
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,665
When did that happen?

110
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,499
We found him,
while the video was being sent out.

111
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,832
The victim is a man of 36,
Allan Myg Poulsen, soldier.

112
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:24,540
He has served abroad,
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

113
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,957
It seems quite important

114
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:35,249
that the woman also served abroad
as military legal advisor.

115
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,790
Both are symbolic targets
connected to the army.

116
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,290
It was clearly an act of retribution.

117
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,790
How could this take us by surprise?

118
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,040
Well, it's an unusual case.

119
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:57,582
There was no indication of terror
at the Memorial Park killing.

120
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,832
Had we heard
about the dog tag earlier...

121
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,665
It wasn't found until this evening.

122
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,665
Nobody's blaming anybody.

123
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,832
- But how do we solve this?
- We will coordinate with the police.

124
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,874
Issue a warning to all barracks.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,499
But keep the media in the dark
concerning the second victim.

126
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,207
Out of the question!

127
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,915
Two people are dead.
We are under threat.

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,124
People are entitled to know
what is going on.

129
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,165
The Prime Minister
has agreed to a press release.

130
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,540
Great. I'll see him later today.

131
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,332
- Have the bereaved been informed?
- Yes.

132
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,665
Do you have a moment?

133
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,582
- You'll need your tie.
- Thanks.

134
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:54,707
Please note how the ministry
has followed procedure in this case.

135
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,249
I'm sure you have,
but the question still has to be asked.

136
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:02,290
The former minister
was aware of the case.

137
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:07,415
But none of us thought
it would develop into such madness.

138
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:13,790
Carina and I must know your position.
This is a serious matter.

139
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:18,165
It doesn't allow for any more
spontaneous reactions on your part.

140
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,999
- It won't happen again.
- Thank you.

141
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:27,832
We should announce
the agreement tomorrow.

142
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,749
We must show unity.

143
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:35,415
- If indeed we have it to show.
- Why shouldn't we?

144
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,582
- We're ready.
- Go on. The press is waiting.

145
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,332
We must search the tracks
and interview the train staff.

146
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:53,249
Look for any CCTV recordings.
He didn't vanish into thin air.

147
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,957
Couldn't Special Branch
give us a list of suspects?

148
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,124
We'll hear from them
in due course.

149
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,832
Find out about the victims,
their past, their military records.

150
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,874
Is Black Berets the connection?

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,915
Have their files been accessed?
Did they contain the victim's names?

152
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:18,457
The two dog tags were forged.

153
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,540
Where did they come from?
And who ordered them?

154
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,832
Sarah Lund is here to assist us.

155
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,582
Some of you know her, others don't.

156
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,957
- I expect you to welcome her.
- Right! Let's get started.

157
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,499
You'll be driving with Strange.
Report directly to me.

158
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,957
The Muslim League?
Why have we never heard of them?

159
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,165
That's not unusual.

160
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,415
Groups are formed spontaneously
for a certain cause.

161
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,624
- What about the website?
- No new facts yet.

162
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,040
Special Branch
will get back to us on that.

163
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,582
Let's start with visiting
Allan Myg Poulsen's barracks.

164
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:12,915
- That's all the family he had.
- I agree. Let me...

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,665
Sorry.

166
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,915
You'd better take
the desk opposite mine.

167
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:26,165
I have some degree of tidiness here.
But the other side is all yours.

168
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,415
Here you are.

169
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,040
Strange will show you
where the lockers are.

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,665
- Shall we hit the road?
- Yes.

171
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,790
Both victims have been
stationed abroad by the army.

172
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:03,624
The murders may be retaliation
for our part in the war against terror.

173
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,874
Jarnvig here.
Are you watching the news?

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,249
Yes.
I spoke to the Defense Command.

175
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:18,040
Put guards on all exits and triple shifts
in the surrounding terrain.

176
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:23,082
...the perpetrator asap.
This is all I can say at present.

177
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,249
- Why didn't you know about it?
- What about the perpetrator?

178
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,415
Very well.
I'll be right there.

179
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,124
- ...hard for us. Thank you.
- And the terror package?

180
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,374
Louise, I have to leave now.

181
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,374
Jonas is asleep.

182
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,582
I put a coin from the tooth fairy
under his pillow.

183
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,165
Thanks, Dad.

184
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,415
I want to know
what happened out there.

185
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,457
The Probation Service
refused his application.

186
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:09,415
They wouldn't let me see him.
The doctor said he was in a rage.

187
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,707
- Did Jonas hear anything?
- No, nothing.

188
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,499
The doctor postponed
any further talk till tomorrow.

189
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,790
- I want a meeting with the lawyer.
- What about?

190
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,082
We must file a complaint
about the refusal.

191
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:29,082
Our solicitor said he stood a fair chance.
So it doesn't make sense.

192
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,082
- We can apply again in six months.
- Why did you take Jonas?

193
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,832
He wanted to go.

194
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,374
If you have to wait six months,
we could redecorate our ground floor.

195
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,707
Jonas can have his own room.

196
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,665
I'll get it started tomorrow.

197
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,624
You don't care
whether Jens gets out or not.

198
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,249
- Yes?
- I have a message to the colonel.

199
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,832
Come in.

200
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,790
Do they know who did it?

201
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,165
Thank you.

202
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,624
What's up?

203
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,082
Have you seen Myg Poulsen today?

204
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,707
How are you?

205
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,207
I don't know what came over me.

206
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,874
Can I talk to Louise?

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,457
She came to visit you.

208
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,457
You weren't told in time.

209
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,082
I told her why you didn't come.

210
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,499
I didn't tell your son anything.

211
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,624
Are you ready to return to your cell?

212
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,582
Was Jonas here too?

213
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:30,040
- I wish to speak to Louise.
- One thing at a time.

214
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:35,457
- You must get back on medication.
- I don't want any.

215
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,874
- Then I can't get you out of here.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,290
If you won't cooperate,
you'll have to stay here.

217
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,957
The police want to question you
about Allan Myg Poulsen.

218
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:56,040
But judging by this conversation
they will have to wait.

219
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,332
Question me. Why?

220
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,374
Our number is on his mobile.

221
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,082
And he came here to visit.

222
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:09,957
He was found killed this evening.
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,999
I'll tell them
to come back tomorrow.

224
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,915
- Killed?
- That's all I know.

225
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,582
I'll look in on you tomorrow.
If you need anything, ask the guard.

226
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,499
OK. Thanks. Bye.

227
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,457
The flyers by the body
have been translated.

228
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,499
"Fight for God's cause. Kill those
who place others next to God."

229
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,249
- Citations from the Koran.
- Do the flyers give any other clues?

230
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,374
They are trying to find out
where they were printed.

231
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,040
OK. I'm Ulrik.

232
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,040
I've been in the department
a year or so.

233
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,832
I'm recently divorced
and that's OK.

234
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,999
I have two wonderful kids.

235
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:12,332
It's hard for them now,
but in the long run, it's best for everyone.

236
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,749
I like football
and opera, up to a point.

237
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:22,249
Take the next left turning.
Allan Myg Poulsen was decorated.

238
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,540
- How about you?
- I was never decorated.

239
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,332
There is not much to tell.

240
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,999
You've been to Gedser.
And the rest of it you've heard about.

241
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:38,499
- I don't listen to gossip.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

242
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,332
We can talk about everything else.

243
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,832
It's not, that I don't want
to talk with you.

244
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,290
- Next left turning?
- Yes.

245
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,332
Thank you.

246
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,624
- Colonel Torsten Jarnvig.
- Ulrik Strange.

247
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,790
Sarah Lund.

248
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,957
Major Christian Søgaard.

249
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,790
Please be seated.

250
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,290
One of your men was found killed
a few hours ago.

251
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,290
In which way was he connected
to the barracks here?

252
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:53,665
Lance corporal Myg Poulsen
did service for many years.

253
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,624
We are deeply distressed
upon receiving the news.

254
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,457
How long had he been here?

255
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,624
He started as a conscript
and went on to be a contract soldier.

256
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,249
He was stationed in the Balkans,
Iraq and Afghanistan.

257
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,832
- When did you last see him?
- This morning, at roll call.

258
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:19,040
He was to be stationed
in Helmand, in a week.

259
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,540
- How was he killed?
- We can't reveal the details.

260
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,082
Is his death connected
to the terrorism threat?

261
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,040
- Is he one of the two victims?
- So it would seem.

262
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,957
- Had he been threatened?
- Not as far as I know.

263
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,665
- Have you received any threats?
- We get them all the time.

264
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:44,415
Phone calls and mails, every day,
but never from the Muslim League.

265
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,207
Could we have printouts
of the mails and phone calls?

266
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,874
And Allan Myg Poulsen's
personnel file.

267
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,332
Søgaard will give you
what you require.

268
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:02,290
If that's all, I would like
to inform my staff personally.

269
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,124
Do you know this woman?

270
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,165
- Anne Dragsholm.
- No. I don't know her.

271
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,624
She wasn't trained here,
but she was military legal advisor.

272
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,332
We would like to talk to someone
who knew Myg Poulsen well.

273
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,249
His company commander
will show you around.

274
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:30,290
This case will cause
insecurity and worry.

275
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,207
The last thing my men need
before getting into that plane.

276
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:42,582
It is vital that all communication
go through me or major Søgaard.

277
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,832
- Are we agreed on this?
- Of course.

278
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,165
The barracks room is for eight,
but most of them are at home now.

279
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,082
This was his bunk
and this was his closet.

280
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,499
How well did you know him?

281
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,915
Not very well. Nobody did.

282
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,332
- He was a loner.
- When did you last see him?

283
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,624
At roll call this morning at 06:30.

284
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,582
And later in the day?

285
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,290
No. They had the rest of the day off.

286
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,249
- When?
- After physical training.

287
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,999
When did he sign up
to be stationed abroad?

288
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,249
- Last week.
- Last week?

289
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,874
Was it a sudden decision?

290
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,624
He had been
considering it for a while.

291
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,249
- Strange speaking.
- Who is Raben?

292
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:57,040
- I don't know.
- Right. Thanks.

293
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,374
They've found the printers.

294
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,499
The flyers were delivered at Aisha
Oman's bookshop in Nørrebro.

295
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,707
- Anything else?
- No. Thank you.

296
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:30,790
The People's Party and the Opposition
support the government.

297
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:37,624
However, they insist
on being informed about the case

298
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,374
before going public
with the agreement.

299
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,332
So they won't make
any statement of agreement yet?

300
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:48,374
- Not until they've heard from you.
- Plough was right.

301
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,707
They're just waiting
for an excuse to criticise us.

302
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:55,999
Telling them we're at a loss in the case
is playing into their hands.

303
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,582
Go home.
There's nothing you can do here now.

304
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:03,665
- Still no news of the investigation?
- No.

305
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:08,415
We'll call you
as soon as we hear anything.

306
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:13,457
Give me Krabbe's and Agger's
phone numbers.

307
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,124
I'll call them on my way home.

308
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,582
I checked your diary
for the next couple of days.

309
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:26,290
- You should warn your family.
- No problem.

310
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:30,957
My wife would prefer me to be here
and try to sort things out.

311
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,707
See you tomorrow.
Shall I call the driver?

312
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,582
No, I'll find him.
Thank you. Goodbye for now.

313
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,332
Thank you.

314
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,499
- Hi, Buch. Did you get my message?
- Yes, Krabbe. Thank you.

315
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,582
- Of course you should be informed.
- How bad is it?

316
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:56,624
- At present the situation is...
- Thomas?

317
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:04,290
Special Branch have discovered
who set up the website with the video.

318
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,582
Excuse me,
I needed to consult my diary.

319
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:11,124
I'll brief you tomorrow morning.

320
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,665
- Why not now?
- Something came up.

321
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:18,124
And I'd like Agger to be present.
How about eight o'clock?

322
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,957
- Yes. Fine.
- Good. Bye.

323
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,207
Thomas Buch speaking.

324
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:35,207
- No one of that name lives here.
- Are you sure it was a bookshop?

325
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:40,582
Hi. We are looking for Aisha Oman.

326
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,082
- You've come to the wrong place.
- She owns a bookshop.

327
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,374
Check the ground floor.

328
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,207
Kodmani. He sells books.
But I haven't seen him today.

329
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,249
- We'll check.
- Thanks.

330
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,957
Perhaps you're looking for his wife.

331
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:03,040
- But she died a couple of years ago.
- Thanks.

332
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,207
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes.

333
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,332
Open the door! Police!

334
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:42,207
Police. Hands up!
Why don't you answer the door?

335
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,749
My children were in bed asleep.
What do you want?

336
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:48,957
- Anyone else in the flat?
- No. Who are you looking for?

337
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:52,874
Don't be afraid.
Just go back to bed.

338
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,624
It's all right.

339
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,915
Three months ago, you ordered
some flyers using your wife's name.

340
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:15,332
- Why did you do that?
- Do you have a search warrant?

341
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,915
- Where were you earlier today?
- I demand a solicitor.

342
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,915
I know my rights.
And you have no right to do this.

343
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:28,832
I want to see your search warrant.

344
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,165
- Move aside a bit.
- Come on.

345
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,874
That's my storeroom.
I demand to see a search warrant.

346
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,915
Stay where you are!

347
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,832
We'll just wait here. Stay calm.

348
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,457
WEDNESDAY 16 NOVEMBER
7:43AM

349
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:11,582
Abdel Hussein Kodmani.
Fundamentalist, widower.

350
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,207
Moroccan, living in Denmark
for 16 years.

351
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,749
The video was on his website.

352
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:21,124
But he has several cover names.

353
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,790
- That was the good news.
- And the bad news?

354
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,040
Special Branch is calling a meeting.

355
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:32,124
Kodmani served time
for inciting to terrorism.

356
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,124
They had their sights on him
and are pissed off about the arrest.

357
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,915
- Why?
- You shouldn't stay at a hotel.

358
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:45,457
- I've made up a bed for you.
- I don't want to disturb you.

359
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:50,249
I'll give you the key. I'm at Bjørn's place
most of the time anyway.

360
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:55,082
- We'll talk about Sunday later.
- What about Sunday?

361
00:30:55,208 --> 00:31:00,957
Our wedding.
Bjørn's relatives are staying here.

362
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,957
We'll be more than 30 people.
I'll get you that key.

363
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,999
I hope you'll have time
to have dinner with Bjørn and me.

364
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:16,457
I'd like to get to know him,
but I'm going to be busy.

365
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,499
- And I'd like to see Mark too.
- You must have time to eat!

366
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:25,415
Bjørn has a very nice colleague
I would like you to meet.

367
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,999
Well, I suppose it doesn't
have to be right now.

368
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,665
That's for me. Must dash.

369
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:36,582
I'd love to have dinner
with Bjørn and you.

370
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,040
- Who is he?
- Have you got that key for me?

371
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,749
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks.

372
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,457
- Sarah?
- See you, Mum.

373
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:55,374
We had to act upon the situation.
Maybe you should have informed us.

374
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,624
You jeopardised the investigation.

375
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,874
It had ground to a halt.

376
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,749
There are two corpses
in the forensic morgue.

377
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,457
Right. Where do we go from here?

378
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,582
Sorry for the inconvenience.

379
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,624
- The main thing is we got our man.
- No.

380
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,374
We are not only after him.
Kodmani has an alibi.

381
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,999
And since we're watching him,
his alibi is watertight.

382
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,624
It could be part of a greater plan.

383
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,374
He had time to make preparations.
We'll intensify the investigation.

384
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,165
Any other suspects?

385
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,957
Just focus on Kodmani
and his followers.

386
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,915
Agreed?

387
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,290
Shall we?

388
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,790
- What about the man they arrested?
- He has not yet been questioned.

389
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:04,582
Let's go public
with the agreement today

390
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:08,374
to show the killers
that we shall not be moved.

391
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,124
Why were you taken by surprise?

392
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,249
The first murder seemed
to be a crime of passion.

393
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:20,582
The ministry couldn't know
it had any connection to terrorism.

394
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:25,499
- Anything else you need to tell us?
- No. What is your position?

395
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,749
God knows
we're opposed to this war.

396
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,832
This won't make us
change our attitude.

397
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:39,165
- But we must stick together.
- It is important to show unity.

398
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,290
But you must admit that the
People's Party warned you about this.

399
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:50,749
We don't pass any bills
on the basis of current cases.

400
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,582
Two people died.
A fundamentalist was arrested.

401
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,707
Save your breath.

402
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:59,957
We will not vote
for the terror package

403
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,874
if the killing points to the groups
we warned against.

404
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,374
- You don't know that.
- No, but it's a probability.

405
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,124
What if the suspect is guilty?
I can't justify it to our voters.

406
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,832
Might I make a suggestion?

407
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:21,832
Let's find out more about the suspect
and meet later.

408
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:25,207
If all is clear,
we can go public this evening.

409
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:32,665
- A very good suggestion.
- Right. We'll get back to you.

410
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,874
I want to make sure
you realise...

411
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,499
If you alter the agreement,
you can count us out.

412
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:47,207
That won't happen.
I'll call you later.

413
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:53,124
Must we negotiate with Krabbe now?

414
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,124
He is under pressure due to the case.

415
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,374
He must feel
that we are forthcoming.

416
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,665
- I won't compromise.
- Let's hear what the police say.

417
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:10,082
- Maybe there's no problem.
- I think there is.

418
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,790
The police made the arrest
without asking Special Branch

419
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:18,124
The suspect isn't just anybody.

420
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:27,207
- My client is willing to cooperate.
- We're looking forward to it.

421
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:32,040
- Tell us about the Muslim League.
- I only heard about it yesterday.

422
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:38,040
- The video was on your website.
- I have the following statement.

423
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:44,624
"My client sells and publishes books
to spread the word of the Koran.

424
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,915
"Using his freedom
of religion and of speech

425
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:53,957
"he offers the website as a literary
platform and an international forum.

426
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:58,790
"He knew nothing of the video
and has never incited to terrorism."

427
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,832
You've got wiser.

428
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:04,290
Nevertheless we found evidence
at your address,

429
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:07,290
videos and written material
inciting to militant action.

430
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:11,915
AII of it is within my legal rights.

431
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:16,874
Your flyers were at the scene
of the crime.

432
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,832
Your website was used.

433
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:24,457
It's either solitary confinement
or cooperation. Nobody believes you.

434
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:48,082
In the last few weeks I have been
contacted through my website

435
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,582
by someone calling himself
'Faith Fellow'.

436
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:55,499
Faith Fellow
seems to share my ideals.

437
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,665
He described a religious video,
which he wanted to upload.

438
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:04,290
It suddenly appeared
on my website last night.

439
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:09,332
- Do you still have his messages?
- I've deleted them, unfortunately.

440
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:14,415
If your Faith Fellow exists,
you'll know who he is.

441
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:18,415
No. If my flyers
were being used by criminals

442
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,499
they must have got them
at the public library.

443
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:27,624
- May we see a list of libraries?
- Sure. If you think, it's any use.

444
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,790
Thank you.
That'll be all for today.

445
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,124
Why shouldn't it be of any use?

446
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,207
We are all in the hands of Allah.
Allahu akbar.

447
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:49,915
Don't waste your time
on the Faith Fellow.

448
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:55,082
Here's a list of Kodmani's
religious circles, his customer file

449
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:58,957
and a print-out with names
of people in Denmark

450
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,999
who have visited his website.
They must all be questioned.

451
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:09,624
And by the way,
we found blood on the barbed wire.

452
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,290
- But we have no match on the DNA.
- Right.

453
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,707
- I'll be gone for an hour or so.
- Now what?

454
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,832
Raben is the name of the army buddy
Myg Poulsen visited yesterday

455
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,457
in the institution
at Herstedvester.

456
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,957
He should have been questioned,
but the institution put it off.

457
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:36,249
Brix told us
to concentrate on Kodmani.

458
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:41,165
Why would Kodmani upload
the video onto his own website?

459
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,207
- Why question some army buddy?
- I can't say.

460
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,165
No!

461
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,499
Sorry.

462
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,124
- See you.
- AII right...

463
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,790
Søgaard?

464
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,415
- Did the police find anything?
- Not that we know of.

465
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,540
The men are in shock,
so let's hope they do, soon.

466
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,624
- Did you know him well?
- Not really.

467
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,374
But we met the other day.
He was an old friend of Jens'.

468
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:35,415
I'm sorry to hear
he was turned down yet again.

469
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,874
Your father told me
his basement is being redecorated.

470
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,874
- Evidently you're staying on.
- For a while, at least.

471
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,790
I'm going to see them now.

472
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:51,707
I left a list of vaccinations
for you in the infirmary.

473
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,415
Let me know,
if your father needs help moving out.

474
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,790
- Why can't I see him?
- AII things considered.

475
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,999
His rage.
He won't take his medicine.

476
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,582
He hasn't for a long time.
Why now?

477
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:18,332
Let's hope it's not a relapse.
He'll have to cooperate.

478
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,124
He usually does.

479
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,790
Let's give it another week.

480
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:27,915
We have a meeting with our lawyer.
There are decisions to be made.

481
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,790
His case and the ruling.

482
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,290
I understand.
But your husband needs rest now.

483
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:40,624
AII my husband needs
is to see me.

484
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:48,290
I'll see what I can do.
But he must be more cooperative.

485
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:11,374
It's a bad time to question him.
There was an incident. Can't it wait?

486
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,040
I won't be long.
Why is he here?

487
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,665
Abduction and threats.

488
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,915
How's that?

489
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,249
He was wounded
and discharged from service.

490
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,832
He was committed
suffering from delusions.

491
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,624
He took a nurse hostage
and threatened to kill her.

492
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:34,624
He was committed
to this institution indefinitely.

493
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,457
- He hadn't been here for a while.
- I asked him to come.

494
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,290
He had found a job for me.

495
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,124
But I won't be needing it now.

496
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:55,082
Was he nervous?
Did he seem afraid of something?

497
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,957
Myg wasn't easily scared.

498
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,290
But he seemed very uneasy.

499
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,665
Perhaps he was in trouble.

500
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,374
- Of what sort?
- I don't know.

501
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,040
How did he die?

502
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,457
He...

503
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,707
He had been strung up by his legs,
head down.

504
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,082
He had been slashed with a dog tag.
Does that ring a bell?

505
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,957
No.

506
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:46,957
He hadn't served abroad for years.
Why didn't he want to now?

507
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:51,499
He wasn't happy about being at home.

508
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,915
If that's all,
I'd like a bit of peace now.

509
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,665
Of course.

510
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,665
Actually,
there was one other thing.

511
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,874
Do you know this woman?

512
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,457
Anne Dragsholm,
former military legal consultant.

513
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,832
Was she connected
to Allan Myg Poulsen?

514
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,499
Why is that important?

515
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,249
She was killed two weeks ago.

516
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,332
We believe
there may be a connection.

517
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:30,165
I don't know her.
If Myg did, he never mentioned her.

518
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,665
- You're quite sure you don't know her?
- I don't know her.

519
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,207
No...

520
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:52,082
Well, thank you for your assistance.
Goodbye.

521
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,915
Thanks.

522
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,957
I wish to cooperate.
Tell the clinical director.

523
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,582
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure.

524
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:29,707
OK. We have many of Kodmani's
disciples in for questioning.

525
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,749
But none of them seem suspicious.

526
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:37,332
But something else came up.
Remember the guy at barracks?

527
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:42,415
- Who?
- Said Bilal, company commander.

528
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,374
- He's in Kodmani's customer file.
- What?

529
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,790
Yes. He's bought
a lot of rabid Islamist literature.

530
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,124
I'm on my way.

531
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,165
He is a member of several
Islamist organisations.

532
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:05,332
He claims his website was misused
by others to get the video out.

533
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,457
But he has a criminal record.
Isn't that correct?

534
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,249
Until the investigation is over,
we can't be sure.

535
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:20,082
We don't make laws according
to current cases, but we have an offer.

536
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:23,957
We can form a committee
to investigate the necessity

537
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:29,082
of banning the organisations
mentioned by the People's Party.

538
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,707
Buch.

539
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,790
I don't want it
to land on the shelf.

540
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:38,915
The People's Party could take
full credit for this committee.

541
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:45,707
And the minister is willing
to set fixed dates for its conclusions.

542
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,457
You won't let your voters down.

543
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,874
- Problem solved.
- Thanks.

544
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,832
But we won't make any decisions
as things are now.

545
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,999
Discuss it
and get back to us tomorrow.

546
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,999
By tomorrow?
Indefinitely is more like it.

547
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:05,957
- It's is up for vote next week.
- That may be too soon.

548
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,915
If we are to prove ourselves able

549
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:13,749
we must talk about
how to fight fundamentalism.

550
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:15,999
What next?

551
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,124
You'd have me ban Islam?

552
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,124
I think it's time we call it a day.

553
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:28,124
He's taking advantage of the case.
I won't tolerate it!

554
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,499
- The Prime Minister must step in.
- It's your supporting party.

555
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:38,999
- You must work things out.
- No. We agree with the Opposition.

556
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:42,832
Tell Birgitte the press conference
tonight is off. I'll call her.

557
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:46,582
She has her own press conference.

558
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,957
What? There isn't any.

559
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:53,082
- Let the press know the plain facts.
- Just give me a moment.

560
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,790
- I was going to call you about it.
- What's going on?

561
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:01,332
We are out. You'll have to make do
with the People's Party.

562
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:06,040
The party is agreed.
We no longer have confidence in you.

563
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:09,665
You agreed
on our proposal to Krabbe.

564
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,957
- Buch. You have cheated on me.
- Let's have a talk.

565
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,874
I know about the memo.

566
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,665
What memo?

567
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:21,332
The memo Special Branch
gave your predecessor,

568
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:25,374
warning him about terrorism
in connection with the first killing.

569
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:29,165
Someone in your ministry
has been asleep on the job.

570
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:35,499
The control committee should
have looked at the case long ago.

571
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:40,624
- I've no idea what you're on about.
- I've seen that memo.

572
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:44,499
If I were you, I'd wouldn't
make too many promises.

573
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,832
Do you have a moment?

574
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,082
The colonel
is at a meeting in town.

575
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:25,749
- It's you we want to talk to.
- Take over.

576
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:34,207
Do you know
Abdel Hussein Kodmani?

577
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,207
No.

578
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,082
You've bought many books of him.

579
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:46,165
'AI Jihad' and 'Radical Islam'.
Is this a special interest of yours?

580
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,457
- I bought the books on the Internet.
- Why?

581
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:51,790
- What is this about?
- Just answer the question.

582
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:57,165
So that my platoon commanders
may get to know the mentality.

583
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,582
They should know what to expect.
I want them back in one piece.

584
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,082
You yourself are a Muslim...

585
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,124
I was ordered to buy those books.

586
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,540
Ask my superior officers.

587
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,499
If that's all,
I'd like to get on with it.

588
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,707
I think you're bleeding.

589
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:34,374
What were you up to last night,
before we came out here?

590
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:39,415
- I was in my office.
- Any witnesses?

591
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:44,207
- You are wasting your time.
- Stay here. We want a word with you.

592
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,915
Do you consent
to giving a blood sample?

593
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:55,249
Not before the colonel gets back.

594
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:04,124
We can apply again in six months,
but you must cooperate.

595
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,915
But that's what
he's been doing all along.

596
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:13,040
There can be no repetition
of the incident yesterday.

597
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:15,790
- Can you manage that?
- Yes, of course.

598
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,249
Can we have a moment alone?

599
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,415
Yes.

600
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:40,915
I'm really sorry about Myg.
But I need you now.

601
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,624
- How is Jonas?
- He's fine.

602
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:50,457
But you must focus on this.
This is more important.

603
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,790
I would like us to plan a strategy.

604
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,999
Should we find another lawyer?

605
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,874
Should we file a complaint?

606
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,999
- What shall we do?
- It will have to wait.

607
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:13,540
I have to see the clinical director
about my medication.

608
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:17,374
We have many practical matters
to decide upon.

609
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,624
Where should Jonas go to school?

610
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,457
Where shall we live?

611
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:27,749
I have messed up.
So I have to put it right.

612
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:32,374
- But it can't wait.
- See you, love.

613
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,624
- What's up, Raben?
- I missed you all.

614
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,415
Raben?

615
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:12,165
If you need to change clothes,
you'd better hurry.

616
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,749
- Do I have time for a shower?
- I'll give you two minutes.

617
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,290
Raben?

618
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,707
Coming...

619
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,290
Let Raben out.

620
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:46,540
Jens Peter Raben is on his way
to the psychiatric ward.

621
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:49,207
He'll be with you in four minutes.

622
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:53,999
- Raben? Dinner in half an hour?
- Right. In half an hour.

623
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,790
I can assure you that Bilal
has nothing to do with the killing.

624
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,582
If he doesn't start talking,
we'll book him.

625
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:17,332
AII communication must pass
through me or major Søgaard.

626
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,624
Then get your man
to open his mouth.

627
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:30,290
Lance corporal Myg
was under my command.

628
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:33,832
I went to see him
to sort things out.

629
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:37,165
The door was open,
so I walked in.

630
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:41,874
I saw him hanging from the ceiling.
I didn't see anyone but him.

631
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,040
I heard you arrive, and bolted
to protect the barrack's reputation.

632
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,540
- Some explanation!
- What had Myg done?

633
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,540
There had been
a serious security breach.

634
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,165
How's that?

635
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:09,249
Our chief of security informed me
of an illegal entry into our database.

636
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,582
The log files showed that Myg Poulsen
had accessed confidential data.

637
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,957
What is in that database?

638
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:20,874
- He had downloaded a pdf-file.
- Containing what?

639
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,582
A list of soldiers in a team.

640
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,249
His own team in Afghanistan.

641
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,457
He probably needed the list
for the veterans' club.

642
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,415
You'll have to give up some DNA.

643
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,915
Had you given us that yarn yesterday,
we might have believed it.

644
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:42,665
It was reported.

645
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:47,290
After you left,
Bilal came and told me all about it.

646
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:53,790
I contacted Special Branch, and
Bilal's explanation has been accepted.

647
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,165
You would know about it,
if you'd contacted me as agreed.

648
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:04,499
OK.

649
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,249
That was Brix.

650
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:11,290
Special Branch has arrested
three persons connected to Kodmani.

651
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,915
May I borrow that photograph?

652
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:24,582
Coordination with Special Branch
only seems to be one-way.

653
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:29,915
Never mind. Send two officers
to the institution at Herstedvester.

654
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,374
Yes.
Bottom left corner.

655
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,790
What am I supposed to see?

656
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,665
Next to Myg Poulsen.

657
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:51,165
That's Raben, his friend,
whom I visited today.

658
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,165
So what?

659
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,624
- Anne Dragsholm?
- He claimed not to know her.

660
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:07,832
Concerning a detainee
Jens Peter Raben. Unlock it please.

661
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,249
He is to be brought in
for questioning immediately.

662
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,332
He disappeared behind the building.
There's a blind angle.

663
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:35,457
But he didn't come
out on the other side.

664
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:37,415
Over here!

1
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,212
Even though I...

2
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:37,569
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down

3
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:43,238
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I found my way back 'round

4
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:48,716
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it

5
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:54,503
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it

6
00:00:54,503 --> 00:01:00,676
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still

7
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:06,414
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look my eyebrows: thick as hell

8
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:10,834
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you're a woman, I don't know how you deal

9
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:14,949
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels; I feel for you

10
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:20,649
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror

11
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:26,846
But it's clear that you can't face what's wrong; no need to fix
What God already put his paint brush on; your roommate yelling

12
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:30,837
"Why you gotta take so long?" What it's like to have a crooked smile

13
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:36,070
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down

14
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,684
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I found my way back 'round

15
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:47,943
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling

16
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:53,956
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure

17
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:59,780
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing

18
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,089
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not

19
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:11,046
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care

20
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:17,909
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you

21
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,669
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around

22
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:29,938
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while, but I wanna see that crooked smile

23
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:35,583
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down

24
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:41,616
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I found my way back 'round

25
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:46,243
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em

26
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:52,687
(You're the one that was tryna keep me way down)
(But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round...)

27
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:57,925
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens

28
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:05,183
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten

29
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:10,517
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail; wonder why we inhale

30
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:16,479
Cause we in hell already - I ask if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?

31
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,651
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil'

32
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:27,395
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail

33
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:34,547
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hey, hell naw - I ain't snitching cause

34
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,984
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now

35
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:41,999
How you like this crooked smile?

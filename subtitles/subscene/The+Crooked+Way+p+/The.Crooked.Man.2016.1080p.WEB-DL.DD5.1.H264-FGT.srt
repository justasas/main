1
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,302
- Okay.
- Mom!

2
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,804
What did I tell you about
watching this stuff?

3
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,074
It's a sleepover.
What are we supposed to do?

4
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,709
Have a pillow fight?

5
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,680
Okay, I'm gonna go
get ready upstairs.

6
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,282
Pizza is on its way.

7
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,117
Be good.

8
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,553
Oh, have fun, ladies.

9
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,229
Okay, Mia, I'm gonna be
out of your hair in a minute.

10
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,765
Don't worry.
I've got it all under control.

11
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,247
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to work.

12
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,316
You're writing a love song.

13
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,684
I'm expressing my pain,

14
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,652
not that I'd expect
a 12-year-old girl

15
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,287
to know anything about that.

16
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,358
That's probably the pizza.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,495
Just... keep it down, huh?

18
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,134
Speaking of songs,
have any of you heard of the one

19
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,169
that kills you
after you sing it?

20
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,404
- Oh, come on.
- I saw it online.

21
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,440
Then it has to be real.

22
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,709
No, she's right.

23
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,411
Apparently these boys
down in Milford tried it.

24
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,213
Two of them died,

25
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,716
like full-on tongues
hanging out,

26
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,453
bones shattered, dead.

27
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,221
They make that stuff up
so kids don't believe

28
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,857
- everything they see online.
- Prove it.

29
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,726
- No way.
- What's wrong, olive?

30
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,361
If it's not real,

31
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,930
there's nothing
to be afraid of, right?

32
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,667
You're serious.

33
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,271
What better way to prove it?

34
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,775
Ready?

35
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,273
- You're serious.
- Keep going.

36
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,466
- Boo!

37
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,768
- Not funny!
- You should've seen your faces.

38
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,737
It was totally worth it!

39
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,910
Oh, great.

40
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,513
- We didn't do anything!
- It was not our fault!

41
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,983
I'm late already.
Are you guys gonna be okay?

42
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,851
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

43
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,253
Are you sure?

44
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,854
I can check out
the circuit breaker.

45
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,823
Great. Thank you.

46
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,591
All right, I will see you guys
in the morning.

47
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,362
Please be good for Mia.
I love you, kiddo.

48
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,499
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,368
Let me go check out
the breakers.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,508
I told you it was
just the breakers!

51
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,383
Alice.

52
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,718
What are you doing up?

53
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,119
I thought I heard something.

54
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,421
Something's up there.

55
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,490
There's no one else here.

56
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,677
Told you.

57
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,913
Come on.

58
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,432
- Give me the light.
- No.

59
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,833
- Give me the light!
- No!

60
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,568
- Give me the light!
- No!

61
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,685
- Mia, wake up.
- What is it?

62
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,527
Come on.

63
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,197
Stay back.

64
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,113
Crooked man was here.

65
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,092
She could have come.

66
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,529
Things hadn't been that great
even before everything happened.

67
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,533
I'm sure she'd love to see you
when you get settled.

68
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,072
Do you ever see the other girls?

69
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,175
No one really sees
Alice all that much.

70
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:35,146
I heard that Charlotte was
waitressing at the diner,

71
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,982
and the other one, um...

72
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,917
- Violet.
- Yeah.

73
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,020
She was working
at a store in town.

74
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,523
She sure had the judge
convinced.

75
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,959
Crazy little olive.

76
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,529
The girl who killed her friend.

77
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,964
Six years is a long time, Livy.

78
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:56,735
People move on.
They forget.

79
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,136
Mom didn't.

80
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,625
Welcome home, Olivia.

81
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,773
Crazy Olivia's back
from the loony bin.

82
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,212
It's a small town.
People talk.

83
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,318
Livy!

84
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,065
Whoa, Livy.

85
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,199
You scared me.

86
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,722
Is everything okay, Livy?

87
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,090
It's fine.

88
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,651
Getting settled, huh?

89
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,223
You gonna be okay?

90
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,859
I'm just tired.

91
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,430
Leave it on!

92
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,265
Please?

93
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,734
Good night.

94
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,902
Leave it open.

95
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,673
Just a crack.

96
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,775
Sure, whatever you want.

97
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,833
I thought we'd go to the market,
if you felt up to it.

98
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,403
I don't even know
what you like anymore.

99
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,907
Mom used to make my eggs
soft scrambled.

100
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,209
Well, I'll try.

101
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,014
I am trying.

102
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,850
Thank you.

103
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,256
After breakfast, do you think
you can take me somewhere?

104
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,292
Sure. Anywhere in particular?

105
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:11,796
I'd love something to read
that's not for 12-year-olds.

106
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,031
Okay.

107
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,987
It's like they've never seen
a pretty girl before.

108
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,157
You're Olivia Shaw.

109
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,358
Noah.

110
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,260
Becky Harris' brother.

111
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,262
Oh, Noah!

112
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,198
Wow. You're a... a cop?

113
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,401
What can I say?
Family business.

114
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,337
How is Becky anyway?

115
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,773
She's down at brown.
She's a freshman.

116
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,143
So what's it like
being back home?

117
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,245
It's a little weird.

118
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,915
And then there's that.

119
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,985
Hey, would you like a selfie
or maybe an autograph?

120
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,787
Murderer.

121
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,155
Thanks.

122
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,390
Don't mention it.

123
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,492
You meet a new friend?

124
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,127
Dad, this is Noah.

125
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,129
I went to school
with his sister.

126
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,564
Oh.

127
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,299
- It's nice to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

128
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,134
Well, listen,
I really have to be going.

129
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:27,505
But if you need anything or any
help with the local paparazzi,

130
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,073
I'm here.

131
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,942
I will.

132
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,978
It's good to meet you.
Bye, Mr. Shaw.

133
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,315
See? I told you everything
was gonna be fine.

134
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,494
Dad, is that you?

135
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,992
What's going on?

136
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,163
Oh, honey, it's okay, it's okay.

137
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,038
It's all right.

138
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,180
- Good night, Steven.
- Good night.

139
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,630
Hello?

140
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,298
Marilyn?

141
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,212
Someone there?

142
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,052
- Hello?

143
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,378
Too much caffeine.

144
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,379
Shouldn't somebody check it out?

145
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,214
An act of mischief?

146
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,683
It was a threat
against my daughter!

147
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,321
Well, you know what?
Forget it!

148
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,390
What'd they say?

149
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,325
They don't have the time
or the resources

150
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,261
to dedicate
to something like this.

151
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,630
It's okay, dad.

152
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,367
You know what?
I'm gonna go to the garage.

153
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,570
I might have a piece of wood
big enough to cover that glass.

154
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,306
Promise me you'll just
try to calm down.

155
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,508
When you have a daughter,
you'll understand.

156
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,725
<i>Steven, who was 28,
is described by his colleagues</i>

157
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,429
<i>as a hardworking
and thoughtful young attorney.</i>

158
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,198
<i>A lifelong resident
of Eastborough,</i>

159
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,501
<i>many remember Steven as
a bright and ambitious student</i>

160
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,203
<i>who delivered pizzas</i>

161
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,605
<i>while putting himself
through law school.</i>

162
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:37,415
There is no easy way to describe
the loss of someone like Steven,

163
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:41,586
someone with such hope
and promise for the future.

164
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,454
A light that shined so brightly,

165
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,691
but could be snuffed out
so easily.

166
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:50,661
Whatever problems Steven had
in this world,

167
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,397
whatever demons
he may have been facing,

168
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,466
we can find comfort and solace

169
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,837
in the fact that his soul
is now in a better place,

170
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,708
a place where love and peace
are eternal,

171
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,643
where there is no pain
and suffering.

172
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,780
And we know that one day
we shall be reunited with him,

173
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,849
in this glorious heaven.

174
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,220
"I lift up my eyes to the hills.

175
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,289
Where does my help come from?

176
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,292
My help comes from the lord,

177
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:25,596
the maker of heaven
and earth."

178
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,699
In accordance with his wishes,

179
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,636
we now return Steven
to the earth,

180
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,838
which he enjoyed so much.

181
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,934
This must feel familiar for you.

182
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,236
You're gonna start that now?

183
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,238
It would've been her birthday
today, you know that?

184
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,906
No.

185
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,810
She's in a graveyard nearby
if you wanna pay your respects.

186
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,912
I'm sure she'd love
to hear from you.

187
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,281
I didn't do anything to her,
and you know it.

188
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,584
Funny, because there was
only one person

189
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,719
holding the knife
that killed her,

190
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,689
and it wasn't the boogeyman.

191
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,294
Hey, hey, forget it.

192
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,330
They're not worth
the aggravation.

193
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,332
You don't know what it's like.

194
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,235
Maybe not, but my bitch meter
is pretty reliable.

195
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,471
Anything I can do?

196
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,342
Is swatting Violet an option?

197
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,646
Maybe an anonymous
noise complaint?

198
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:53,351
Actually, I could use a favor.

199
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,286
Okay.

200
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,889
Can you give me photos
of Steven's body?

201
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,558
Why?

202
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,892
Call it a hunch.

203
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,494
We already know what happened.

204
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,463
You know what the witness said.

205
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,031
My dad would have my badge.

206
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,400
It's important.

207
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,869
I won't say anything to anybody.

208
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,571
I swear.

209
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,896
Hello, Jill.

210
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,355
Let her go!
Let her go!

211
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,730
Mrs. Hutchinson.

212
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,833
The next-door neighbor called
and said she thought

213
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,001
someone was trying
to break into my house.

214
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,472
I'm sorry. I didn't...

215
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,507
I thought the place was empty.

216
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,542
Haven't you done enough already?

217
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,845
I know what you're thinking,

218
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,814
and you have to believe me.

219
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,750
I didn't hurt Jill.

220
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:09,553
I heard all about the evil ghost
man or whatever you said it was.

221
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,856
I'm here to find the answers.

222
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,425
You may have convinced everybody
else that you're crazy,

223
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,628
but I know exactly what you are.

224
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,031
Hear that?

225
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,701
That is the sound of Karma.

226
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:27,638
I'd leave before they get here,
if I were you.

227
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,956
Did you just see that?

228
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,617
Thank you, Noah.

229
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,793
That's not possible.

230
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,166
- This is Noah.
- <i>Jill. Six years ago.</i>

231
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,136
The face, contorted body,

232
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,171
<i>it's the same.</i>

233
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,576
What if he came back?

234
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,177
Who?

235
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,847
<i>The crooked man.</i>

236
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,081
<i>Olive, are you...</i>

237
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,016
The lyrics said,

238
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,219
"down your crooked paths,
he follows."

239
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:51,622
- Here you go.
<i>- "Paths." Plural.</i>

240
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,592
What if he's coming after
everyone who was in the house?

241
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:56,060
<i>Look, you wanted to see photos,</i>

242
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,795
I sent you photos.

243
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,664
You want my advice?
Drop it.

244
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,633
One more favor.

245
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,568
Can you look up the file
on Jill?

246
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,737
- Olive...
- <i>I just want to see</i>

247
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,639
if she had any broken bones too.

248
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:11,075
I told you,
Steven fell out a window.

249
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,576
Just check.

250
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,278
All right, I'll think about it,

251
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,113
but I gotta run, okay?

252
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,548
Okay.

253
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,008
Whoa.

254
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,192
Mrs. Larson?

255
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,260
Oh.

256
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,218
Help me!

257
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,803
Why are you digging up
that old case?

258
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,311
I ran into Olivia Shaw at
the Sanderson funeral yesterday.

259
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,481
She tell you how they found
her standing over Jill's body?

260
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,984
Covered in blood,

261
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,919
holding the knife
that matched the stab wounds?

262
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,455
It says here the victim
had multiple broken bones.

263
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,291
You don't think that was
relevant to bring up in court?

264
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,427
Olivia pushed her
down the stairs.

265
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,929
What about the intruder
Olivia said she saw?

266
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,531
We searched the property.

267
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,299
We questioned all the neighbors
on the block.

268
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,769
No one saw anyone.

269
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,871
You know, your sister was
supposed to be there that night.

270
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,206
Could've been her picture
in that file.

271
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,477
Do yourself a favor, son.
Stay away from Olivia Shaw.

272
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,126
Table four says they've been
waiting five minutes for coffee.

273
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,494
I'm on it, I'm on it.

274
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,963
Can you do me a favor
and refill number four?

275
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,199
Okay, what can I get for...

276
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,072
I just need five minutes.

277
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,374
I don't think so.

278
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:13,143
I came to warn you.

279
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,145
I think the crooked man is back.

280
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,816
I saw a picture
of Steven's body.

281
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:23,020
Whatever happened to him,
it looked just Jill.

282
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:26,023
Violet says I'm not supposed
to listen to you.

283
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,558
Charlotte...

284
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,894
She says you're dangerous
and unstable.

285
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,263
She's just trying
to protect herself.

286
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:37,501
Charlotte, do you really think
I killed Jill?

287
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,139
<i>Eastborough police
are investigating</i>

288
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,875
<i>the tragic death
of grace Hutchinson.</i>

289
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:48,078
<i>Our investigators say it
initially looked like suicide.</i>

290
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,881
<i>They are not ready
to make that claim just yet.</i>

291
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,516
<i>Family and friends of Hutchinson</i>

292
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,485
<i>say there is no way
this career woman and mother</i>

293
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,221
<i>would take her own life.</i>

294
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,089
<i>Investigators say
the tragic death</i>

295
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,024
<i>of Hutchinson's
teenage daughter...</i>

296
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,940
Olive, you're right.

297
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,509
Everyone who was there
that night is dying.

298
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,912
Where did you get that?

299
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,347
I just found it.

300
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,648
It's targeting us, isn't it?

301
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,984
We need to let everyone know.

302
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,521
Toss your bike in the back.
I'll drive.

303
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,464
We need to talk.

304
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,965
I'm working.

305
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,268
Violet, Jill's mother
died last night.

306
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,938
Let me guess.
The boogeyman did it?

307
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,975
Kind of a coincidence,
don't you think?

308
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,511
All of this happening
just as I get back into town?

309
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:58,181
You're not actually
listening to this, are you?

310
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,250
Steven's body...

311
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:04,388
It looked like just like
what happened to Jill.

312
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,990
Look at it!

313
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,159
What did happen to Jill, olive?

314
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,695
You don't remember that night?

315
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,631
What I remember was
a stupid, childish game,

316
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,034
and my best friend
being found dead.

317
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,337
Look, you don't think I get it.

318
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,940
If I'm the girl who killed Jill,

319
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,942
then none of this
was your fault.

320
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:28,045
But if I'm right,
and the crooked man is back...

321
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,681
What, Olivia?
What do you suggest we do?

322
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,583
Go into hiding because you think
something you did six years ago

323
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,119
has come back to kill us?

324
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,155
Come on, you don't really
believe this, do you?

325
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:41,458
Tell me, have you seen
or experienced

326
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,026
anything strange lately?

327
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,461
Does this conversation qualify?

328
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,396
This is not a joke, Violet!

329
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,733
No, I haven't.

330
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,202
But if you're right,
and if your little homecoming

331
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,638
has somehow brought
this thing back,

332
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,607
then there's really
only one answer, isn't there?

333
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,509
Leave.

334
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,379
I have to get back to work.

335
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:04,514
Just do me one favor, okay?

336
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,383
- Please stay out of the dark.
- Olive, let's go.

337
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,385
It lives in the dark.

338
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,288
Just make sure you're always
in the light, no matter what!

339
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,640
You're wasting your time.

340
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,543
No one's seen her in years.

341
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,545
I'll be right back.

342
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,634
Who is it?

343
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,370
Olivia Shaw.

344
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,272
Alice isn't here.

345
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,307
Do you know when she'll be back?

346
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,543
She doesn't want to see you.

347
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,712
That's not what I asked.

348
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,449
- I think you should go.
- Please!

349
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:15,452
It's really important
that I speak to your daughter.

350
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,254
Go away!

351
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,531
That didn't work.

352
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,204
Wait. So the babysitter's
the last one?

353
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,773
Assuming we even know
how to find her.

354
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,643
Actually, that's an easy one.

355
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,549
Mother?

356
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,556
Trust me.

357
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,391
It's for your protection.

358
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,589
This is taking way too long.
Come on.

359
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,791
Excuse us, excuse me, sorry.

360
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,593
Sorry. Gotta get through.

361
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,495
Please, please,
our friend is in danger.

362
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,163
- Go on in.
- Thank you.

363
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,665
You're good.

364
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

365
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,415
Mia Johanssen.

366
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,752
There she is!

367
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,728
Good evening, Eastborough.
Thanks for coming out tonight.

368
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,730
It's good to be back
in my hometown.

369
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,516
What is it?

370
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:02,786
The darkness. It's here.

371
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,401
Um, um...

372
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,904
Excuse me.

373
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,985
- Whoa!
- We have to get back there.

374
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,254
- You got a pass?
- She's a friend of ours.

375
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,522
Get lost.

376
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,595
Go away!

377
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,549
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

378
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,894
Hello! Come on!

379
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,796
Anyone in there?!

380
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,031
Excuse me.

381
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,335
You two can't take a hint.

382
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,969
- Something's wrong.
- Mia?

383
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,638
She's just taking a break.

384
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,039
We think she might be
in trouble.

385
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,474
You're not getting in there.

386
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,042
You do it then. Please!

387
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,413
Fine. You two wait here.

388
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,522
No, no.

389
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,047
No! No! No!

390
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,456
Mia!

391
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,028
Mia! Everything okay?

392
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,672
Mia!

393
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,749
Mia?

394
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,151
Are you here?

395
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,553
Jesus!

396
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,129
I can't comment on whether
it was a suicide or not

397
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,532
'cause I haven't seen
the autopsy.

398
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,707
You know how long it took my dad
to get off the case?

399
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,577
- What are you doing?
- Look at this.

400
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,212
"Classmates of the two
missing teens

401
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,548
mentioned that the two
had recently displayed

402
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,919
a fascination for an Internet
meme known as the crooked man.

403
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,855
There's gotta be
at least 50 stories here:

404
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:02,625
Suicides, homicides,
disappearances.

405
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,561
"Crooked man uncovered?"

406
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,030
The original site
was taken down.

407
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,132
But according to this,

408
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,635
a lot of people
had recited that rhyme.

409
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,238
Uh-huh.

410
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,141
I thought maybe there might be
some information

411
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,910
on how to stop this thing.

412
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:25,582
Unfortunately there's no contact
information listed or anything.

413
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,952
- I have an idea. Come on.
- Where are we going?

414
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,258
- The crooked man?
- You've heard of it?

415
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,527
Internet meme that kills people?

416
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:41,798
So can you find whoever put up
that website or not?

417
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,200
All you have to do is put the
domain into a who is search,

418
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:47,103
and you should get
what you need.

419
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,976
Got a P.O. Box in Leveritt.

420
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,245
No name?

421
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:58,047
Looks like whoever did this
wanted their privacy.

422
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,818
But that should be pretty easy
for you to trace, right?

423
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,653
I thought you said
this was going to be hard.

424
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,089
We're cyber forensics.
We can do anything.

425
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,091
All I have to do is
go into the system,

426
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:12,195
find out who registered
the box, and...

427
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,033
It's been abandoned
for three years.

428
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,035
Great.

429
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,070
So back to square one?

430
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,573
Wait.

431
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,241
What are you doing?

432
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,677
Most computers automatically
imprint their files

433
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,078
with a level of metadata,

434
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,014
such as who created them
and where.

435
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,849
Kinda like a fingerprint.

436
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,052
So, for example,
if the site has any photos,

437
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,055
I can find out where the
computer was that posted them.

438
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,633
Thanks.

439
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,168
- You can't leave now!
- Look, olive...

440
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,304
I'm sorry I told everyone
you were crazy,

441
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,339
and I'm sorry I didn't support
you all those years ago,

442
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,575
but I am not going to sit around
and wait to die!

443
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,711
This guy maybe will have
some answers for us.

444
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,914
Is that gonna help Jill
or Jill's mom or Mia?

445
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,083
All gassed up!

446
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,651
Violet's not coming.

447
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,086
What do you mean,
she's not coming?

448
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,888
We had a plan.

449
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,324
What if you're wrong?
What if you can't stop it?

450
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,825
You think running will help?

451
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,795
I do know staying here won't.

452
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,998
Come with me. You don't need
to be a part of this.

453
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,235
Yes, I do.
We've been hiding too long.

454
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,237
- It's your funeral.
- Violet...

455
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,739
Violet.

456
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,744
Be careful. Please?

457
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,912
You too.

458
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,184
- Alice!
- Olive.

459
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,420
What are you doing?

460
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,191
Alice!

461
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:23,292
Grab my hand!

462
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,171
Olivia, what are you doing here?

463
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,272
I need to talk to you.

464
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,940
You need to leave.

465
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,142
It's not safe.

466
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,312
Alice...

467
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,782
What happened?

468
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,251
Please go.

469
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:52,121
Not until I talk to you first.
It's important.

470
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,133
These drawings...

471
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,204
You can't just come in here
and go through my stuff.

472
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,306
- Alice!
- It's private!

473
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:13,443
Alice, you're not alone.

474
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,245
I've seen them too.

475
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,083
We're being warned.

476
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:23,853
Look, there's a site I found.

477
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:26,089
Dozens of cases just like ours.

478
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,458
- The crooked man?
- Yes.

479
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,061
Noah had a friend
at the police station

480
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,831
track down
whoever put the site up.

481
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,201
If they've been doing
all the research,

482
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,370
then maybe they know
how to stop it.

483
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,005
It's too late.

484
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,908
This is why I need you
to come with me.

485
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,478
- I can't.
- Alice...

486
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,147
Mother says never leave
the house without her.

487
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,915
People are dying!

488
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,417
She says I'm safe here.

489
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,153
Do you believe her?

490
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,759
Alice...

491
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:07,864
This could be our chance
to finally fix what we did.

492
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:10,800
We can make things right.

493
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,238
I get carsick.

494
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,509
We'll crack a window.
Come on.

495
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,312
Olivia?

496
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,047
You saw something, didn't you?

497
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,820
Olivia?

498
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,488
It's over here.

499
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,837
Hello?

500
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,872
Is anyone there?

501
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,146
Anybody?

502
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,357
What are you doing here?

503
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,293
- Olivia.
- How do you know my name?

504
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,528
You're very lucky.

505
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,297
Not many people
have come face to face

506
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,065
with the crooked man
and survived.

507
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,600
You know about that?

508
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,203
Of course.

509
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,538
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

510
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,408
To find someone who can
give you all the answers.

511
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,177
Let's start with what this
thing is and where it came from.

512
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,621
In the 1800s,

513
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:50,660
a writer researching
legends and folklore

514
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:53,362
discovered dozens
of different cultures

515
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,231
in dozens
of different languages,

516
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,233
all referring to the same thing.

517
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,469
He called it the crooked man.

518
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:05,408
Imagine a death sentence
that no mortal could escape,

519
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,644
that no human law could pardon,

520
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,514
an eternal, unstoppable force

521
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:15,017
bringing certain death
to anyone who dare summon it.

522
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,622
It probably started
as an tribal incantation.

523
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,462
A curse.

524
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,665
The words were translated and
passed down through the ages,

525
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,635
evolving with the times.

526
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:37,640
Over the years, it was
transcribed and studied.

527
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,977
Part of it was even turned
into a nursery rhyme.

528
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,083
Eventually
someone put it online.

529
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:52,021
And with that, the proverbial
Pandora's box was out there.

530
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:57,326
The crooked man
now belonged to the world.

531
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:00,162
You were the one
that put it up on Creepyhollow.

532
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,567
Funny thing about the Internet.

533
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,670
You can take content down,
but it never really goes away.

534
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,740
By the time I realized
what was happening,

535
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:13,642
that the crooked man was real,

536
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,745
it was too late.

537
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:18,514
I tried to get back online
to warn people.

538
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,584
Four people in our town
are dead!

539
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:26,756
And not a minute goes by where
I'm not tormented by what I did.

540
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:30,393
I'm up in that sanctuary
every day,

541
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:34,430
praying for the souls
of the people I killed.

542
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,699
Now, ever since I came back...

543
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,801
The crooked man returned.

544
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,436
Why?

545
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,441
When you left, somehow you...

546
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,143
You paused the curse.

547
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,812
But now that you're back,

548
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:55,117
now that all who were marked
have returned and reunited,

549
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,453
it's like you never left.

550
00:50:57,455 --> 00:51:01,190
I tried to warn you.

551
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,692
I tried to get you to leave
before he returned.

552
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,728
What are you talking about?

553
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,196
The rock.

554
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,697
That was you.

555
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,233
But now it's too late.

556
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,802
What if she left again?

557
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,540
Too many people have died now.

558
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:20,342
He's coming for you.

559
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:23,546
There's no order,
no rhyme, no reason.

560
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:29,151
Where there's darkness,
he will be there.

561
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,420
But there has to be
a way to stop him, right?

562
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,223
You can't.

563
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,393
He cannot be stopped.

564
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:40,596
You cannot hide,

565
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,832
and you cannot run.

566
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:46,402
If you have been cursed by
the crooked man,

567
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:49,705
he will kill you eventually,

568
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,208
no matter what.

569
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,388
Keep it down!

570
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,561
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

571
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:48,397
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

572
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,671
I thought you were sleeping.

573
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:03,739
There's something I have to do.

574
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,608
Wait. Hey, where...

575
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,864
Wait a minute.

576
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,512
No way.

577
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,851
Classical fairy tales?

578
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,721
- Ancient mythology?
- Noah.

579
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,056
Your dad said you'd be here.

580
00:55:27,058 --> 00:55:29,358
- What's wrong?
- Can we go talk?

581
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,627
Yeah, of course.

582
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,966
Noah, what is it?

583
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,372
Noah, how do you have this?

584
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,475
Noah.

585
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,477
I have to tell you something...

586
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,045
About when we were kids.

587
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,613
What?

588
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,716
The night of the sleepover?

589
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:57,052
The night Jill died?

590
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,554
I was there.

591
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:02,558
My sister was supposed
to be there.

592
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,460
I was on my way home
from basketball practice,

593
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:08,364
and I thought I'd swing by
and give 'em a little scare.

594
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:12,401
But by the time I got there,
I realized she wasn't there.

595
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:13,635
It was too late.

596
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,438
And then when
the lights went off,

597
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,442
I got so scared that
I would be seen, so I left.

598
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:21,677
I'm screwed, aren't I?

599
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,114
Noah, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.

600
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:26,782
But it's gonna be
okay now, right?

601
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,417
Because you figured out
where the website came from,

602
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:29,785
so you're gonna make it stop.

603
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,020
Not quite.

604
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,556
That's encouraging.

605
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,058
But I'm working on it.

606
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,494
So I am screwed.

607
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,661
Hey.

608
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:45,634
We're gonna fix this, okay?

609
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:46,935
I promise.

610
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,971
Yeah.

611
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:01,583
Noah, what is it?

612
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,852
You really don't see that.

613
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,956
It's him, isn't it?

614
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,158
What is he doing?

615
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:16,598
He's trying to get us...

616
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,133
But he can't.

617
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,607
It's the light.

618
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,711
As long as we stay out of
the dark, we should be okay.

619
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,918
He's gone.

620
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,220
Come on.
I have an idea.

621
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:43,125
"Only with this crooked song
shall the crooked man yield."

622
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,995
At first, I thought it was
talking about the rhyme itself.

623
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,564
Yeah?

624
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,867
But what if
it literally means "song"?

625
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:56,071
What if this music box
is the key to the whole thing?

626
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,809
Milo said there was
a writer in the 1800s

627
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,845
who was doing research
on old legends

628
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,546
and found out about
the crooked man.

629
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:05,981
He found the music box,

630
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,984
and he accidentally
summoned the crooked man.

631
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,587
If this box is out there,

632
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:14,556
we might be able
to stop this thing.

633
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:17,960
All we have to do is find it.

634
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,563
What is it?

635
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,831
We have to turn around. Now.

636
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,310
Anything?

637
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,112
Voicemail.

638
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,201
- Hope we're not too late.
- Come on!

639
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:59,828
See you soon, Olivia.

640
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,022
She didn't do anything.

641
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:29,324
Oh, I forgot.

642
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,827
It's the boogeyman, right?

643
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,895
Son, a word.

644
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:36,765
Olivia and I have been
together the whole time.

645
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:37,933
Five people are dead, Noah.

646
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,302
She left three suicide notes.

647
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,271
You saw the body. You think
she did that to herself?

648
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,774
Not exactly.

649
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,243
Please tell me you're not
drinking the fruit punch.

650
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:50,912
- I know it sounds crazy.
- You are a police officer.

651
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,281
- I know what I saw!
- Here's what's gonna happen.

652
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,651
- You're not listening.
- Take her down to the station.

653
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,085
You're gonna arrest her?

654
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:01,156
I'll talk to her
as soon as I'm done here.

655
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:05,661
Do you want me to have
somebody else do this?

656
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,663
No.

657
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,233
How could she have
felt so helpless?

658
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,101
I'm sorry.

659
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,037
What are you doing?

660
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,705
I have no choice.

661
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,373
- Noah!
- Don't make a scene.

662
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,442
You can't do this!

663
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,944
Just get in the car, please.

664
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,288
This is 4-30.

665
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,357
Suspect in custody.
10-7 to station.

666
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,392
<i>Copy that, Noah.</i>

667
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,140
What are you doing?

668
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,909
Noah!

669
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,285
Shh. We're alone now.

670
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,122
We got about 20 minutes

671
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,424
until my father realizes
where we're going.

672
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,159
I'm sorry.

673
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,270
So where do we go now?

674
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,127
<i>Looks like a place
a professor would live.</i>

675
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:53,235
It's always nice to meet
some of dad's former students.

676
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:56,805
He always spoke so highly
of you and your mom.

677
01:02:56,807 --> 01:03:00,075
I thought, since we happened
to be in the area,

678
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,978
that we should pay our respects.

679
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,516
Oh, you found Milo, I see.

680
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:11,953
He was my dad's
teaching assistant for years.

681
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,556
Which class of his
did you take again?

682
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,892
World culture and mythology.

683
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,026
Yeah.

684
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:21,997
That was one of his favorites.

685
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,566
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

686
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:29,838
He always would tell
the most interesting stories.

687
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,239
He would make you feel

688
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,108
like you were
right in the middle of it all.

689
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,311
It must've been amazing, growing
up with a father like that,

690
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,113
all the stories
he must have had.

691
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,848
To tell you the truth,

692
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,350
he saved most of that
for his students.

693
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:49,291
I can only imagine all the
things he must have left behind.

694
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:52,460
I heard he had
quite the collection.

695
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,229
You want to see it?

696
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,276
- Huh.
- Whoa.

697
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,245
Look at all this stuff.

698
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:18,253
Some of these items
must be pretty valuable.

699
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:22,324
Yeah, well, you can't put
a price on your father's memory.

700
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:24,559
I imagine not.

701
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:36,371
That was one of his
more recent finds.

702
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,506
I remember him talking about it.

703
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:40,542
May I?

704
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,585
Who are you?

705
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,556
- We told you.
- No.

706
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:57,559
First of all,

707
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:02,364
what, were you 12 years old
when he still taught that class?

708
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,532
And second of all,

709
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:07,002
he never never would've
spoken very highly of me.

710
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,572
Certainly not my mother,

711
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,441
so do you wanna tell me
what you're really doing here?

712
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,578
Have you heard the rhyme
about the crooked man?

713
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,514
Of course. My father wrote
a book about the author.

714
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,519
We believe it's real.

715
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,421
After your father died,

716
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,424
Milo posted the means
to summon him online.

717
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:32,360
Six people have died,

718
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:36,464
and unless we can figure out
how to undo our mistake,

719
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:38,533
there will be more.

720
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:42,604
We believe this box might be
the only way to stop it.

721
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:45,607
I'm gonna show you something.

722
01:05:55,551 --> 01:06:00,055
Something that I have not
shown anyone.

723
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,524
Not the police.

724
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,698
But when I found my father's
body in the classroom...

725
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,469
He had this.

726
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,547
We can end it.

727
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:28,416
For good.

728
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:31,619
We just need to borrow the box.

729
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,755
Please.

730
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,997
You get that son of a bitch.

731
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:52,340
<i>Harris and Olivia Shaw
are being sought by police</i>

732
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:55,143
<i>in connection with last night's
brutal slaying that...</i>

733
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:00,582
I always knew she was trouble.

734
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:02,584
I always said it.

735
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,553
Hey!

736
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,523
Not at the dinner table.

737
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,167
Dear lord, bless this food
that we are about to eat

738
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:20,668
and all that it provides.

739
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,170
- Amen.
- Amen.

740
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:46,661
Looks like a storm is coming in.

741
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:49,230
Now...

742
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,466
Where were we?

743
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,808
I am going to check
the breakers.

744
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,843
No! I mean, um...

745
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,279
I'll come with you.

746
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,547
I'll get some candles.

747
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,158
Maybe it's the whole block.

748
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,397
Maybe.

749
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,591
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.

750
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,186
Mother?

751
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,587
Alice?

752
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:22,457
Mother, I can't open the door!

753
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:23,758
Alice!

754
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,199
Mother?

755
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,302
Mother, are you okay?

756
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,377
I'm scared!

757
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,584
Ow!

758
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,866
Mother? Is that you?

759
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:02,523
How 'bout a light?

760
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,550
I should've been there.

761
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:32,287
You can't blame yourself.

762
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:33,721
For six years,

763
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,957
her mother tried
everything she could,

764
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,959
and probably
more than she should,

765
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,895
to keep Alice safe.

766
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,731
Hey, she's alive.

767
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:48,002
How many people have died
because of me?

768
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:51,906
Jill, Steven, Mia,
Charlotte, Violet.

769
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:54,375
You're the one
that's trying to save them.

770
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:56,844
He called my name.

771
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,849
What are you talking about?

772
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:04,352
Back at the house,

773
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,854
when I touched the music box,

774
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,791
he called my name.

775
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:12,860
And it wasn't the first time.

776
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:18,766
This is all my fault.
All of this.

777
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:21,969
- He's taunting me.
- No, you can't think like that.

778
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,639
No, I killed them, Noah.
I killed all of them!

779
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,808
Shh, shh, shh.

780
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:30,812
Think she can hear me?
She's in a coma because of me.

781
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,714
Don't you understand?
Because of me!

782
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,682
Come on, let's go.

783
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,886
Don't you ever
turn the light off! Ever!

784
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:41,122
She's just a little tired.
Excuse us.

785
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:44,559
I'm the one who started it.
I'm the one who needs to end it.

786
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,794
How?

787
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:49,364
The music box,
it showed me something.

788
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:50,998
A crooked house.

789
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,867
I think that's where
we have to find him.

790
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,635
Did it show you where it was?

791
01:12:54,637 --> 01:12:57,739
All I saw were woods.

792
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:59,440
Think.

793
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:02,143
Were there any specific
characteristics or landmarks?

794
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:03,578
Anything specific?

795
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,813
Just a clearing.

796
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:09,851
But I did notice two large rocks
and giant pine tree.

797
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,520
As if that even helps.

798
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:14,155
Actually, it does.

799
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:17,892
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

800
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,438
Let's go, let's go.

801
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,489
I was a cub scout
when I was a kid.

802
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:51,459
One day my troop went for a hike
through this park.

803
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:55,196
We found this clearing
and two rocks.

804
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,198
Just like your vision.

805
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,573
You ready?

806
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,842
- For Alice.
- For Alice.

807
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,578
We're close.

808
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,825
We're here.

809
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,961
This is exactly what I remember.

810
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:03,197
The rocks, the trees.

811
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,503
And the house was somewhere...

812
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,805
Right...

813
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,076
- Did you see...
- No.

814
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,144
This house was not there
a minute ago.

815
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,114
So what happens now?

816
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,717
We kill the crooked man.

817
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,291
I'll go check the upstairs.

818
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:05,159
Be careful.

819
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,247
Olive!

820
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,284
Oh, god.

821
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:38,719
You all right?

822
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,089
All right? You okay?

823
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,691
Yeah.

824
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:47,194
- What are you doing?
- Making a call.

825
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:31,338
Something's happening.

826
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,181
He's here.

827
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,926
What do you want?!

828
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,762
Haven't you taken enough
already?

829
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:29,230
The box.

830
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,268
Hey there.

831
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,237
You should really see somebody

832
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,205
about that posture problem
of yours.

833
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:39,907
Is it working?

834
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,477
Yeah.

835
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,866
Hey!

836
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,406
I saw that going differently.

837
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,502
What am I missing?

838
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,476
Hey!

839
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:23,478
It's me again.

840
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,163
- Are you okay?
- It's not working.

841
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:44,565
"Only with this crooked song."

842
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,233
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

843
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,536
When you recite the poem,
it summons him, right?

844
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:51,472
And so the box
must serve the same purpose.

845
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:55,009
In order to reverse its effects
and take him back, we've got...

846
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:57,311
To play it backwards!
Okay, okay!

847
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,282
I'm going as fast as I can!

848
01:22:03,953 --> 01:22:07,087
Whatever happens, keep playing.

849
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:19,533
Noah!

850
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,071
Keep...

851
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:25,239
Playing.

852
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,600
Go back to hell,
you son of a bitch!

853
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,042
You're alive!

854
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:04,745
Come on.
We need to get out of here.

855
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:15,456
Come on.

856
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,058
Come on, Noah!

857
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,177
It's over.

858
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,014
It's over now.

859
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,283
Finally.

860
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,267
That's so old school.

861
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:37,071
How about the one with
the killer in a hockey mask?

862
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:39,073
Or the killer doll?

863
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,541
I know.

864
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:43,110
Have you any of you heard about
the song that kills you

865
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:45,546
if you sing it?

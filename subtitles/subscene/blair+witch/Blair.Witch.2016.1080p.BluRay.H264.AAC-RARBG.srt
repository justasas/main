2
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,389
- <i>Did you see her?</i>
<i>- What do you mean? I--</i>

3
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>I missed it the first time, too.</i>
<i>Hang on.</i>

4
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:28,247
Okay.
What is that?

5
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,367
Lisa, I think that might be my sister.

6
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,918
Wait, wait, okay. Uh...

7
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,704
How did you even find it?

8
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,373
Did you have, like, a search alert set up?

9
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,541
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
And usually, it's nothing.

10
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,126
But the guy who uploaded this video

11
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,004
said it was from a tape he found
in the Black Hills Woods.

12
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,589
But those woods
have been searched, right?

13
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,132
- They never found the house.
- Mmm-hmm.

14
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,051
Yeah, but the Black Hills Forest is huge.

15
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:51,512
So maybe they weren't looking
in the right place, you know?

16
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:53,597
That's why I want us to start
where the tape was found.

17
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,057
- So we can set up camp at night--
- Lisa.

18
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,017
- Hi.
- Hey.

19
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,310
What are you guys doing?

20
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,021
We're doing Lisa's
documentary class project, starring me.

21
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:04,242
Boring!

22
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,118
Okay, so try on
that earpiece camera.

23
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,869
Wh-- which is...

24
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,329
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

25
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,123
And then press the button on the side.

26
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:22,974
- Okay.
- And then it should be recording.

27
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:27,008
The cool thing about these
is they've got built-in GPS.

28
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,926
Huh?

29
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:33,303
How's that?

30
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:35,180
You're getting more of these
for Peter and Ashley, right?

31
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:38,100
Yeah. We just have to make sure
we remember to switch out the cards.

32
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,031
Okay.

33
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:46,900
Temp narration take one--

34
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,201
Take two-- Three.

35
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,448
When James was four years old,

36
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,075
his older sister disappeared
while making a documentary

37
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,706
near the town of Burkittsville, Maryland.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,128
<i>Some of the footage
shot by James' sister was later found.</i>

39
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,631
<i>The final moments of it showed
her going into a house,</i>

40
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:12,482
<i>seemingly within the Black Hills Forest.</i>

41
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:25,022
<i>That area was extensively searched
by police and FBI,</i>

42
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:26,482
<i>but they could find no evidence</i>

43
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,953
<i>of an existing house in those woods.</i>

44
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:32,362
<i>Investigators concluded that James' sister
might have vanished elsewhere,</i>

45
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:36,503
<i>despite her crew's equipment and footage
being found nearby.</i>

46
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:40,704
<i>For as long as I've been friends
with James,</i>

47
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:43,248
<i>he's wondered what happened to her.</i>

48
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,501
<i>His continued search to find closure</i>

49
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:47,836
<i>and answers to his sister's disappearance</i>

50
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,507
<i>is the subject of this documentary.</i>

51
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:57,721
<i>How long have you and James
been friends?</i>

52
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,806
<i>Our parents were friends,</i>

53
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:01,308
so I guess we grew up together.

54
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,319
So you knew him
when his sister disappeared?

55
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:05,604
Yeah.

56
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,655
I don't really remember Heather
all that well, to be honest.

57
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:14,326
But after she went off into those woods
and she didn't come back...

58
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,044
Yeah. I remember all that.

59
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,953
Okay, I'm trying to prove a point.

60
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,913
That's why you're about to die.

61
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:23,997
Found one.

62
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,499
That's me. You're shooting me.

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,417
Peter...

64
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,796
Can you give us an idea
of what we're going to be doing out there?

65
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,714
Four of us, we're gonna go out there

66
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,050
and we're gonna try to find this house.

67
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,220
James, he's been messaging with the guy
who uploaded that video.

68
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:41,223
He's gonna show us exactly where
in the woods he found the DV tape.

69
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,350
And James, you think
you're gonna find the house?

70
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,060
Um, maybe. I hope so.

71
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,353
So you really think your sister

72
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,021
could still be out there
after all these years?

73
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,662
All I know is...

74
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,734
if there is any chance at all

75
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,570
that I could find out
what happened to her,

76
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,822
I need to at least try.

77
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:58,073
And what about the legends?

78
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,616
"Legends"?

79
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,326
Yeah, do you believe, at all,

80
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,087
in the stories about the Blair Witch?

81
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,132
Hey, Lisa, I can't tell,
is this thing recording or not?

82
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,258
Yeah, it should be.

83
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,136
Did you-- did you press and hold
the button when you did it?

84
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:20,220
Yeah.

85
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,346
These things are so small.

86
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,598
Like, where do you put it?

87
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,266
Okay. Recording. We are recording.

88
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:27,227
Just, uh, make sure
it's always facing forward.

89
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,562
And make sure
you press the button down.

90
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,272
- Did you hold it down?
- Okay, got it, got it, got it.

91
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:31,648
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you hold it down?

92
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,233
Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down.

93
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,776
- Hey, Peter!
- Yeah?

94
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:35,944
How do I look?

95
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:37,745
Yeah, that's sexy.

96
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:43,035
The thing is, he's going back out
to those woods

97
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:45,120
to look for his sister, Lisa.

98
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,747
'Cause he thinks she could still be there

99
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,875
'cause of some blurry footage
that some weirdo put online.

100
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,293
So, like, how's that gonna look?

101
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:53,629
I don't wanna exploit anyone.
That's not the point.

102
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,922
All right, then don't tell anyone
about it. Okay?

103
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,632
How 'bout that? Use that.
There's an option.

104
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,884
Don't tell anyone.
Just come out there with us.

105
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,636
Film it like he wants you to,
as his friend.

106
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:03,267
Don't use the footage for your movie.

107
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,434
- I can't promise that. No, I can't.
- Right.

108
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,353
- I know. I know you can't.
- I can't promise that, Peter,

109
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,605
because like what if something
actually happens out there?

110
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,315
I see you, Lisa.
Yeah, right, okay, I'ma get a beer.

111
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:15,567
What if we find something
that they never found?

112
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:16,693
I'm so sorry.

113
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,278
He and James
have just been friends forever.

114
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,655
Just because I haven't been friends
with him

115
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,323
for as long as you guys
doesn't mean I don't care.

116
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,464
I know that!
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

117
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:28,205
Ah, fuck me, man.

118
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,332
How are you feeling?

119
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,334
You're asking if I regret getting drunk

120
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:35,170
the night before going camping
in the woods?

121
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,181
I do not.

122
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,151
Okay. Let's just move back a little bit.

123
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,891
How far does it go?

124
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,902
Like, 100 meters is the max, I think.

125
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,198
Ashley and I have used these
in class before.

126
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,075
Just like cheap helicopter shots,
you know.

127
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,869
It could be useful in terms
of finding our way around the forest.

128
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,705
Yeah,
but we're gonna have a GPS though, right?

129
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:10,789
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,999
It's built into the earpiece camera,

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,709
but it only works when it's on, though.

132
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,220
So just keep an eye on the battery
in case we get separated.

133
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,675
<i>Com check, over.</i>

134
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,967
"Com check"?

135
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:33,185
<i>Yeah, that's like,
what people say in the military, over.</i>

136
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,653
Okay, anyways, it's working.

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,434
Over.

138
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:42,275
<i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

139
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:45,443
- Hey, the walkie-talkies work.
- Yeah, we know.

140
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:50,111
He's got the bass in his voice.

141
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:52,582
Somebody wasn't hydrated.

142
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,382
Whoa...

143
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,507
- Boom, we're safe.
- Okay, which one is you guys'?

144
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:03,925
- We're this one.
- Oh, this is ours.

145
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:06,766
- Okay!
- Whoa!

146
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,604
- Lay with us.
- Oh, no.

147
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:18,365
- We got room.
- James! James! James!

148
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,697
Good night, folks.

149
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,825
Oh, yeah.

150
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,948
- I don't know...
- He has been a little...

151
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,419
Who you bragging to?

152
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,411
And this used to be called Blair?

153
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:32,746
Sort of.

154
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:36,249
There was a town called Blair
back in the 1700s,

155
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,460
but it was discovered abandoned.

156
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:42,431
So they founded a new town,
called it Burkittsville.

157
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,011
I think so?

158
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,112
My god.

159
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,569
They're here!

160
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,655
- Hey! Hey, come in.
- Hey.

161
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:09,416
- Hope they fixed...
- Hey.

162
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,201
Hi.

163
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,662
Can I get anybody, like,
water or anything to drink?

164
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:15,872
- Water or...
- I'm okay. Thank you.

165
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:16,957
I'll take some water.

166
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,334
- Feel free to make yourself
at home. Just through there.

167
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:23,046
Yeah, have a seat in there
and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.

168
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,113
Hey, I'm glad
you're all recording this.

169
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,207
Not every day we get
like-minded investigators

170
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,760
coming out here to discuss
the Blair Witch.

171
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,095
There you go.

172
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,780
Hey, I may need to get you guys

173
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,307
to sign some release forms
later if that's...

174
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,308
Yeah, sure, that's cool.

175
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,439
I'll probably need you to sign one, too.

176
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,785
So, you're Darknet666?

177
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:44,150
Yeah. Well, we both are,
but, uh, you can call me Lane.

178
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,831
- This is-- this is Talia.
- Hi.

179
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:49,865
So... Okay, well, first off,

180
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:52,576
I was hoping you could show us
where you found the tape.

181
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:54,244
We're gonna make that
our starting point.

182
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,621
Are you guys really gonna go camping
out in those woods?

183
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:59,472
Yep. That's the plan. Why?

184
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,043
You ask 'em.

185
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:05,046
Uh, we wanna go out there with you.

186
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,715
I mean, if you're gonna be looking around,

187
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,009
we wanna be a part of that.

188
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,345
It's not, you know...
We're not gonna be a burden or anything.

189
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,805
- We go camping all the time.
- Mmm-hmm.

190
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:17,896
Hey, look, that's the deal if you want us
to show you where we found it.

191
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:25,317
Is it okay if we talk it over in private,
real quick?

192
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:28,868
No, yeah, oh, yeah,
yeah, sure, go ahead.

193
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,120
- What do you think?
- Nope.

194
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:39,915
Well, don't we need them to show us
exactly where they found the tape?

195
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,208
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I didn't think they'd want

196
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,679
to stick around after that.

197
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,927
Well, they didn't exactly make it sound
like we have an option.

198
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,317
What are you bragging about?

199
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,693
No, I-- I'm serious.

200
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:11,124
You say that to people?

201
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:21,297
Look at this guy.
You crack me up.

202
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,753
We made it.

203
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:36,830
Yeah. All right. Lisa. Got you.

204
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,341
Baby, what the hell
do you have in here?

205
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,395
It's heavy.

206
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:43,895
Lisa.

207
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:47,691
And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp.
Okay.

208
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,651
Hey,
it's cool if we leave our cars here?

209
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,611
Yeah, it's fine. 
They're safe.

210
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,122
No one comes out this way.

211
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,958
I'm already hungry.

212
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,038
Yeah, I'm thinkin' I could eat.

213
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,743
Could eat all these
granola bars in the backpack.

214
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,088
Hey, what do you think
they're smoking up there?

215
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,469
Mmm, definitely bath salts.

216
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,802
You know what? 
I'm gonna go ask.

217
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,970
Peter, wait! No!

218
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,472
Hey, yo, Darknet666, wait up!

219
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,391
I saw some of your other videos.

220
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,559
Yeah?

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,060
Yeah. 
Before we came out here.

222
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:25,395
Saw this one, 
it was really interesting

223
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,366
where you guys, like,
found this little pile of rocks.

224
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,333
Would you stop?

225
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:32,902
Symbols.

226
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,362
"Symbols"? 
Oh, they were symbols.

227
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:36,623
No, no, no, seriously.

228
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,916
So, do you guys really believe
all these old stories?

229
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:43,705
I mean, 'cause someone's died everywhere,
at some point, right?

230
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:46,750
Doesn't mean that every square foot
of this planet is haunted.

231
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,251
Did you grow up here?

232
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:50,503
- No.
- See, I-- I did.

233
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,524
Talia did. We both-- 
we both grew up here.

234
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:55,216
And the older folks in town

235
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:57,385
used to talk a lot
about these woods when I was little.

236
00:12:57,386 --> 00:13:04,350
And after... his sister and her crew
went missing and their stuff got found,

237
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:08,031
suddenly, everyone I know
just wanted to forget it.

238
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,440
This area has a history
of things happening

239
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,109
that no one really likes to talk about.

240
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,237
Rustin Parr. Coffin Rock.

241
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,618
List goes on and on.

242
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,085
Hmm.

243
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,967
- Watch yourself. Watch your step!
- Yeah. It goes down here.

244
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:36,049
Back in the 1940s,
Rustin Parr brought eight kids

245
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,259
out to his house in these woods.

246
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,053
Killed seven of 'em.

247
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,179
But Parr claimed

248
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,931
<i>that he heard the voice
of an old woman</i>

249
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,099
<i>telling him to kill the children.</i>

250
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,434
<i>He would take them up to his attic</i>

251
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,102
<i>and make one stand in a corner</i>

252
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,480
while he killed the other one.

253
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,941
There's been some debate
on that actually, where

254
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,443
whether it was the attic or the basement.

255
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:58,655
So he thought he heard the Blair Witch
telling him to kill people?

256
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,198
Well, he never said who it was.

257
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,533
He just said that it sounded

258
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,952
like this voice of an old woman.

259
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,329
They hanged him out
in these woods, near his house.

260
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,081
So wait, he had a house out here?

261
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:10,041
Yeah. That's not the one
we're looking for though.

262
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,932
Parr's house was burnt down
after he was hanged.

263
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,921
Supposedly they found a bunch of old
tunnels and stuff underneath

264
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,089
that didn't go anywhere.

265
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,480
Some kind of underground railroad thing,
I think.

266
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,294
Oh, my back.

267
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,165
Okay, so this is, uh,

268
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,085
this is technically where
the Black Hills Woods start.

269
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,546
Back from when this was private land.

270
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,840
Uh, well, who owns it now?

271
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:01,551
No one. It's the state's, I guess.

272
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,887
So, we're not trespassing
or anything, right?

273
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:08,648
No. No one cares. No one living, that is.

274
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,947
If we have to go camping with the locals,

275
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,574
could you please not piss them off?

276
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,284
Baby, I Di-- I didn't say anything.

277
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:29,585
You don't have to say anything,
Peter, you know that.

278
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,623
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:32,999
Sorry.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,140
Okay, Goofy.

281
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,840
The glare on the plastic...

282
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:44,177
You just, you we-- you were
walking by and you saw it?

283
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,346
This is where we found the DV tape.

284
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,431
And there was nothing else
on the tape?

285
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:49,974
No. Like I said, it was all static

286
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,851
except for that bit that we uploaded.

287
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,269
Why does the tree look like that?

288
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,855
Lightning.
Sometimes when it hits the tree,

289
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,982
the electricity goes into the ground

290
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:00,873
and it burns the tree from the roots up.

291
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:03,029
- Was it just underneath here?
- Yeah.

292
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,948
It was like half under and half out,
but we had to dig a little.

293
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,117
...wasn't your fault.

294
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:11,248
I just couldn't help laughing at you.

295
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,766
A girl drowned in this creek.

296
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,260
It was around when Burkittsville
was founded.

297
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,513
Her family was doing the washing
and her mother said

298
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:32,734
she saw a hand reach out of the water
and pull her daughter in.

299
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,894
Probably the only reason
we still know about it is

300
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,270
'cause there were newspaper articles,

301
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,951
'cause the girl's body was never found.

302
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:44,079
Are we crossing this?

303
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,119
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

304
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,246
- Yeah, let us know how it is.
- Ooh, it's freezing.

305
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,622
I'm walking across the water.

306
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:55,706
That's great.

307
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,625
- Oh!
- Oh! That's cold.

308
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,710
Leeches are fine?
What do you mean?

309
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,587
Wait, wait, you said
there was leeches?

310
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,756
No, I'm just asking.

311
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:04,966
Are you coming?

312
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,592
Did you get a pedicure
before you came here?

313
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,553
Yes.

314
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:12,824
- Ah!
- I know, I know.

315
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,977
You sure this is a good idea?

316
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,604
Uh, will you hold the camera for me
for just one second?

317
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,735
My shoes...

318
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,944
- All right. Oh, oh!
- Careful there.

319
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,195
Ah! That's cold!

320
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,488
Wait, I got it, I got it.

321
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,115
You got it? All right.

322
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,126
Careful.

323
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:37,045
- You all right?
- Oh...

324
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:45,256
Ashley!

325
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:47,508
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, okay.

326
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,843
I cut my foot on a rock

327
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,095
- or a piece of broken glass or something.
- You'll be all right.

328
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,763
Okay, there we go. We gotcha.

329
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,348
- You okay?
- Yeah.

330
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,058
You're all right,
you're all right.

331
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,649
Careful, careful, careful.

332
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,443
Okay. Let's see that foot.

333
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,028
Okay. Ah, you're all right.

334
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,362
You're all right.
You're all right.

335
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:10,865
Is it bad? It just feels
like it's really deep and it hurts.

336
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:13,451
No, it's not bad at all.
I just gotta clean it.

337
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:14,994
Lisa, do you mind gettin'
my first-aid kit?

338
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,329
- It's in my bag over there.
- Huh?

339
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,207
- Lisa. First-aid kit. Bag. Please.
- Oh, shit!

340
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,917
- Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.
- Thank you very much.

341
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:24,045
- Lane! Jesus! Manners, dude.
- Hey! Hey! Back up! Back up!

342
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:25,880
I'll get this shot really quick
and then I'll be good.

343
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:27,715
- Get back over there.
- Just like one more second?

344
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,050
- I swear...
- All right, all right.

345
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:30,426
All right,
I've seen much worse than this.

346
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:31,886
There you go. Oh, oh, it's okay.

347
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,055
- Try not to move it too much.
- Feels like it's really big.

348
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:37,141
No, it feels a lot worse
than it actually is. I promise.

349
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,602
- Pressure. It's okay. It's all right.
- Ah!

350
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:42,230
Now we just gotta wrap it up
and you'll be good to walk on it.

351
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,451
Gotta bring it around.

352
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:45,900
Thank you, James.

353
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,360
No problem, man.

354
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,778
Okay. You wanna try standing up?

355
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,029
- Yeah.
- Okay.

356
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,822
All right,
don't put too much pressure on it.

357
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,908
Ready? One, two, three.

358
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:56,369
- There you go. You all right?
- Yeah.

359
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,880
- Not so bad.
- Not so bad.

360
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,892
- Oh. Ow.
- You okay?

361
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,900
Come to my palace in the woods.

362
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,597
This is how we roll.

363
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,848
In style without--

364
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,726
No, that's what I'm trying
to say is, um...

365
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,103
Is it-- fuck.

366
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,063
- Babe, Babe, it's bent.
- Babe, I got it, I got!

367
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,857
Please, let me just put the tent together.
Okay?

368
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,067
I'm just saying that the pole is--

369
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,443
I just need to put
the tent together right now.

370
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,113
It's not supposed to be bent,
I know. So you just bend--

371
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,115
This-- is this supposed to be bent?

372
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:36,075
This is not the entrance.

373
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,916
That's not.
Well, that's not either.

374
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:40,876
Fuck!

375
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,331
Fuck!

376
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,417
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

377
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,928
Fuck you! Fuck you, tent!

378
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,940
Okay. Everything's good.

379
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,975
Hey, I'm gonna go
get some firewood

380
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,102
before it gets totally dark, okay?

381
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,146
Looks like the sun's
coming down pretty quick.

382
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,440
Well, hold up.
Let's finish this and I'll come with you.

383
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,031
No, man,
I'm not goin' too far, okay?

384
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,485
I'll keep my camera on.

385
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,404
You can see me on the GPS, all right?

386
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,488
Okay.

387
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,324
Well, take a walkie-talkie
with you, please.

388
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:19,118
Man. Brother, already got one.

389
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,299
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

390
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:01,713
<i>What exactly</i>
<i>should we be looking for?</i>

391
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:04,364
<i>We're looking for the house
from Heather's footage.</i>

392
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,016
<i>Do you see the-- do you see any clearings?
Anything like that?</i>

393
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,310
<i>I shouldn't take
this thing too much further up,</i>

394
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,111
but, I mean, 
I don't see anything yet.

395
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,463
Yeah. That was a good movie.

396
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,291
I'm unsettled, immediately.

397
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,293
All right.

398
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,545
Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,322
- Ew! Ew!
- I'm uncomfortable with this.

400
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,400
What?

401
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:40,466
Why do you have
to eat it like that?

402
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,384
- I didn't mean to.
- Eat it a little bit quicker.

403
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,761
You don't have to go all slow like that.

404
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,732
Oh, god!

405
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,993
It really,
really did scar me for life.

406
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,924
I don't want to ever fish again.

407
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:10,012
Okay, so the Blair Witch.

408
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,443
Who is she really?

409
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:14,817
Elly Kedward.

410
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,567
That's what most people say.

411
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,441
She was accused of witchcraft

412
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,151
after some of the children
in town said that

413
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,872
she'd taken blood from them.

414
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:29,990
There wasn't much
of a trial system back then.

415
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,701
Townspeople took her out
to these woods,

416
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:36,462
tied her to a tree and
left her to die of exposure.

417
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,458
In the spring they went back
to look for her body

418
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,752
but there was no trace of it.

419
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:45,813
They assumed she was eaten
by animals or something, but...

420
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,677
then people in the town
started disappearing.

421
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,471
First the children who'd accused her,
and their families.

422
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,612
Then others.

423
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,184
Eventually, everyone who was left

424
00:22:57,185 --> 00:23:00,187
just abandoned their homes, fled the town.

425
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:02,022
Well...

426
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:03,993
What?

427
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,860
- What?
- Well, I was just gonna add...

428
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,154
According to this book I read,
published in 1809,

429
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,074
they didn't just tie
Elly Kedward to a tree.

430
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,617
I mean, they did tie her to a tree,

431
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,868
but they tied her up really high

432
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,079
and they strung these heavy rocks
to her arms and legs

433
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,205
as weights, stretching her.

434
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,415
Ugh.

435
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,542
They left her to die on a makeshift rack.

436
00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:23,893
Okay. 
Thanks.

437
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:27,674
Ever since,
there's been a curse on these woods.

438
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:29,859
The legend says if you look
directly at the witch

439
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:32,553
you'll die just from the fright of it.

440
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:35,694
That's why Rustin Parr
stood in that corner.

441
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:38,517
They say no one's ever seen her
and lived to talk about it.

442
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:42,488
Or, alternately,
no one has ever seen her, period.

443
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:44,932
This is all just stories, okay?

444
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:47,443
I've been to these woods before.

445
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,195
When I was a kid
with about 100 other people.

446
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:53,326
You were part
of those search teams?

447
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,630
I remember that.

448
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:59,079
Yeah.

449
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,415
So how come I'm okay?

450
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,876
Nothing got me then.

451
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,378
Maybe it did.

452
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,719
You're back, right?

453
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,258
All right, real theory, real theory.

454
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,159
One that I've read online.

455
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,478
Whatever spell the witch
put on these woods,

456
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:19,533
you have to be out here
at night for it to get you.

457
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,908
You have to spend the night.

458
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:25,064
Wait, well, then how come
you're still alive?

459
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:27,066
That's a good point.

460
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,443
Maybe she's using us
to lure you all out here.

461
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,445
Okay, on that note,
I'm going to bed.

462
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,946
- Yeah, me, too.
- We should get some rest.

463
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,490
We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow.

464
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:37,171
- 'Night, dudes.
- Yeah, good night, man.

465
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,124
Good night, James.

466
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,925
'Night.

467
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:10,907
I just heard something
moving outside.

468
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:32,458
Oh, my...

469
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,944
Shit.

470
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:55,955
Shit!

471
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:04,945
What the fuck?

472
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,021
Hey, Lisa.

473
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,053
Lisa?
What the hell are you doing?

474
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:21,597
- Did you hear that out there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it.

475
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:24,268
There's something out there,
out in the woods, like a bear.

476
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:28,729
Okay, here.

477
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,570
Thanks.

478
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,030
What the fuck was that?

479
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:39,698
It's okay. It's just my walkie-talkie.

480
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,366
- It's all right, that's all right.
- Shit!

481
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,207
Peter, is that you? Com check.

482
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:47,748
<i>James,
what the hell was that?</i>

483
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:49,041
Oh, fuck.

484
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,251
I don't know, man,
I don't know.

485
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:52,794
<i>Are you okay?</i>

486
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,713
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're okay, we're okay.

487
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,131
Lisa's here too, we're okay.

488
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:58,091
I mean, she just came, like,
just now came into my tent.

489
00:26:58,092 --> 00:26:59,259
Like 30 seconds ago.

490
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,650
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

491
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:05,349
Yeah, we're fine. You two good?

492
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,434
No. Lane's not here.

493
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:08,644
Where is he?

494
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,229
Well, he went--
he went off to pee,

495
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,731
but he always goes far off for privacy.

496
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,912
Oh, god.

497
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,615
Hey, Lane!

498
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,042
Lane!

499
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,956
Lane!

500
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:28,338
Oh, god damn it.

501
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:32,459
We should probably go look for him, right?
Make sure he's okay?

502
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,585
- No.
- No.

503
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,753
No, I'm not goin' out there.

504
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:35,963
That is definitely
not a good idea.

505
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:38,298
Well, I'm gonna go.
He's been gone for a while.

506
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,133
Okay. I'll come with you.

507
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:41,635
Um...

508
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:45,097
- Shit, he might be lost, okay?
- Um...

509
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,181
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

510
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:48,642
I guess I should probably go back
to my tent.

511
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,561
- I mean, you can stay here if you want.
- Okay.

512
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:53,146
- Yeah?
- Okay.

513
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,982
All right. I'll be back soon.

514
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:57,203
All right.

515
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:00,662
Hey, good luck, man.

516
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:06,788
- Careful. There.
- Thanks.

517
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:17,717
Lane!

518
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:23,806
Lane!

519
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:32,154
Lane!

520
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:37,157
God, where is he?

521
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:40,488
Lane!

522
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:43,406
Lane!

523
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:51,173
Lane!

524
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,550
Did you see that tree that fell?

525
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:06,219
Sounded like it landed nearby.

526
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,360
Yeah, but sounds can travel
pretty far out here.

527
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,477
Did you guys hear that?

528
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:14,728
Lane!

529
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:15,896
Lane, what the fuck, man?

530
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,147
I'm sorry, man.

531
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:18,398
Tell me you recorded those sounds.

532
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,566
Did you get those sounds?

533
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:21,568
- Yeah, Lisa and I were recording.
- Okay.

534
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,403
I went to see if I could find
what was makin' those noises.

535
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,280
I couldn't find anything.
Did you guys find anything?

536
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:26,365
No, dude.

537
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,075
Just let's get back to the camp, okay?

538
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:31,086
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

539
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:34,089
- You okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:36,258
Okay.

541
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:51,232
You guys, get out here!

542
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,979
No. No, no, no, I'm getting out of here.

543
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,440
I'm packing, I'm leaving.
This is fucked up.

544
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:01,942
Holy shit.

545
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,443
I wanna go home, okay?

546
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:04,945
Where'd this stuff
come from?

547
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,947
Someone must've put these things up
while we were asleep.

548
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:08,740
Why, what's going on?
What's wrong?

549
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,659
What do you think?

550
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,285
We should film these.
Talia, get the camera.

551
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:13,787
You guys should be taking pictures!

552
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,330
What is it?

553
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:16,456
Thank you.

554
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:17,749
What? What is it?

555
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,960
You guys, seriously
I want to go home now.

556
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,253
We need to get out of here.

557
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,130
Hey, James,
that's not a bad idea, okay?

558
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:24,506
We're not prepared for this.

559
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:25,799
Okay, I've seen this stuff before.

560
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,925
This was in Heather's footage, guys.

561
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,635
Shit, there's another one back here.

562
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:30,637
That's my tent!

563
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:31,972
Does anybody know
what time it is?

564
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:33,640
My watch is sayin' 2:00 p.m.

565
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,184
What?
How is it even possible we just woke up?

566
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,269
Look, I know I was tired,

567
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,645
but how did we sleep
till 2:00 in the afternoon?

568
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:39,938
Can we please get out of here?

569
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,189
You know what? Ashley's right.

570
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,191
Let's just pack up our stuff
and get back to my car, okay?

571
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,985
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Are you sure?

572
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:47,070
Yeah, yeah, this is too weird.

573
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,655
I dunno, we found something, right?

574
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,157
Like, we can show the footage
to the police.

575
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:51,700
Maybe they'll reopen Heather's case.

576
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,244
Wait, I wanna get that on camera.

577
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:55,495
I think it's just...

578
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:58,626
Just rip it off the tree,
for Christ's sake.

579
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,001
Oh, holy shit.

580
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:02,377
Wait, wait, that's the shot,
that's the shot.

581
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:03,462
I have an idea.

582
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,172
Why don't you stay here
and get all the footage you want?

583
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:06,590
All right, that's it.
Come on, turn it off.

584
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:07,716
Turn it off. Let's go!

585
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:09,807
I wanna get a shot of it, okay?

586
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:12,767
Oh, fuck this.

587
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:54,304
So, hey,
what kinda camera is that, man?

588
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:55,889
Oh, it's a DV camera.

589
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,057
Oh, yeah?

590
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,892
It's old. It's good in low light.

591
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,727
- It's better than modern cameras.
- Okay.

592
00:32:00,728 --> 00:32:02,187
Does it use tapes?

593
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:04,272
Like the one you found? Or is it...

594
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:06,775
You know, there's not too many brands
of them anymore. Why?

595
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,068
Oh, nothing, I... Just curious.

596
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,403
Well, I mean, I recommend it.
Everything is cards now,

597
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:13,448
but in some ways, you know tapes are
more reliable and cheaper.

598
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,075
Do have to carry
a lot of batteries, though.

599
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,201
Oh, yeah?

600
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,285
Ow! Ah!

601
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,495
Ooh! Ashley!

602
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,872
- Hey, you all right?
- You okay? What's going on?

603
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,376
I'm fine. It's just my foot.

605
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,752
Want me to take
the boot off?

606
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:28,088
No, it just hurt for a second,
but feels fine now.

607
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:29,923
- Okay. Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

608
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:31,258
- Does that hurt?
- It's fine.

609
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,593
Hey, Lane. Lane.

610
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:34,844
Stop it. 
Stop it!

611
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,429
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What is this?

612
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,139
This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys?

613
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,599
Yeah, that's rope. 
And kindling.

614
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,101
That's useful for camping.
Give that to me!

615
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:42,477
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
Get back.

616
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:44,354
You have the symbols from the camp,
don't you, Talia?

617
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:45,564
So can I see one?

618
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:47,274
Because this rope looks exactly the same.

619
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,358
What the hell?

620
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,859
Definitely does not look the same.

621
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,111
Rope is rope. 
Open your eyes.

622
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,280
But let her see it, then.
She doesn't need to see it!

623
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,115
- Let her see it.
- Get the fuck off me, man!

624
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,449
Hey, hey!
 Listen, stop it!

625
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,452
Listen, we weren't trying to scare you
or anything, we just...

626
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:02,122
We weren't lying about the things
that are going on in these woods.

627
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:04,124
We just needed somebody
to see what was happening.

628
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,005
Oh, no, no, no!

629
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:09,423
Did you... 
You faked this?

630
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,438
Yeah, yeah, we faked it.

631
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,679
All right, but look we faked
it because it's real, okay?

632
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,352
There really is something happening here,
guys, in these woods.

633
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:21,795
And that makes sense to you?

634
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,120
Hey, we didn't fake
those noises last night.

635
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:27,689
And sleeping until 2:00?
How could we fake that?

636
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,275
There is something really going on
out here in these woods.

637
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,776
Right. For all we know
you guys put sleeping pills

638
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,111
in our water or something.

639
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:34,446
- What?
- Did you?

640
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,489
- No!
- No, 'course not.

641
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,992
Okay, fuck this. 
I'm out.

642
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,161
You guys-- you guys want this.

643
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,092
This is on you.

644
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,764
Hey, get a shot of this!

645
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,872
Lane.

646
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:53,256
Those fucking assholes.

647
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:56,387
Uh, guys...

648
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:59,012
Uh...

649
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:01,139
We don't have the GPS thing.

650
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,266
There's no cell reception out here,
so I mean...

651
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,560
- That's not our problem, man.
- Just hear me out.

652
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,663
What if-- what if we get lost, okay?
What if we get lost?

653
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,108
I thought you guys
came out here all the time?

654
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,360
- We've been following you!
- I don't know what--

655
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:15,195
Oh, my god!
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man!

656
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:16,863
We've never been as far as the creek,
but nobody has.

657
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:18,031
Nobody's been here for years.

658
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,324
- Shit, man!
- We don't know where we are!

659
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,742
- Okay, just calm down. We meant to..
- Fuck!

660
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,202
- We wanted safety in numbers, okay?
- Jesus Christ!

661
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:23,703
There's more of us,
so the odds are better.

662
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:25,455
Is there anything that you two told us
that is not a lie?

663
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:27,165
And I guess it's just a coincidence
that your camera uses

664
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,167
the exact same kind of tape
that you found?

665
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,210
No, it wasn't...

666
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:33,004
Okay, I think you two got
all the footage you need.

667
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,382
You walk that way for about two miles,
you'll hit the fence.

668
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:37,342
Look, can we just calm down?
We could just talk about this.

669
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:38,885
- No! Get outta here!
- Guys, come on, please!

670
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:41,721
- Okay, okay, sure, sure! Go, go.
- Please! Just come on.

671
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,473
Cut the camera off.

672
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,684
You guys don't understand,
okay, you're not from here.

673
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:47,060
- Get out of here!
- Just go! We're done talking!

674
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:48,436
It's time to go! Let's go!

675
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,021
- Stop it!
- Please, man!

676
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,492
- Take him. Go.
- Come on!

677
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,026
Guys, are you sure this is--

678
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,696
Does this have to happen?
We could talk about this.

679
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:59,698
- We could talk about it. I have like...
- Hey, we're done--

680
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,450
Lane, I swear to-- Fuck you!

681
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,036
Oh, my god, no!
Wait, hold on! Stop!

682
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,047
Fuck.

683
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,750
Hey... James, man.

684
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,721
I'm so sorry.

685
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,424
I actually thought that...
Heather could still be out here.

686
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:20,135
They're pathetic, man.

687
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:24,734
God, I should've known they were--
Fuck.

688
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,903
I guess I just...

689
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,869
Oh, god.

690
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,822
Yeah, well...

691
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,991
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel a little bit,

692
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:45,410
you know,
less scared being in the woods now.

693
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:46,661
Yeah.

694
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:48,788
Are you gonna be okay?

695
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:52,542
- I'm all right, man. I'm okay.
- I'ma give you a hug.

696
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:53,960
- Don't give me a hug.
- I'ma give you a hug.

697
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,837
Don't give me a hug...

698
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,598
Aw, look at that.

699
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,975
Oh, sorry.

700
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:11,146
That's okay.

701
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:26,477
I've got it.

702
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:30,881
Lisa, come on. Let's go.

703
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:38,898
Hey, James.

704
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:40,965
We anywhere close to the fence yet?

705
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,306
Yep. Should be.

706
00:37:11,205 --> 00:37:13,164
This looks familiar.

707
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,874
That's a good thing, right?

708
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,543
How can you even tell?

709
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:20,014
I don't know. Just...
I thought we'd...

710
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,561
Baby, what?

711
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:29,198
No. No! 
No way! No way!

712
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,515
We've been walking in a circle?

713
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,477
That doesn't make sense.
I've been following the GPS.

714
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:34,578
Then we should've reached
the fence hours ago!

715
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:37,522
We shouldn't be back at the same fuckin'
campsite we just left!

716
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:40,623
- Can I see the GPS, James?
- Yeah. It must be broken.

717
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:43,528
- We're lost.
- No, we're not lost.

718
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,196
We, we got turned around. 
We gotta...

719
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,240
"Got turned around."

720
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,867
Let's look around with the drone.

721
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,077
We can start hiking for the road.

722
00:37:51,078 --> 00:37:53,168
Yeah, okay, let's do that.

723
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,915
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

724
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,939
Hey, are you okay?

725
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,587
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

726
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:02,839
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

727
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,965
- You can't--
- I'm fine.

728
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,800
You can't keep walkin'.

729
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:07,927
- We gotta camp here tonight, y'all.
- No, no, no, no...

730
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:09,387
No, no, no, babe, you gotta...

731
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,930
- Ahh!
- Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

732
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:13,141
I can't stay here
another night, Peter!

733
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:15,101
I can't stay here another night, okay?

734
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:16,936
Hey, hey, hey, you need to rest.

735
00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:18,563
Okay? You gotta let that foot heal.

736
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,106
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

737
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:22,233
Look, let's just set up the tents.

738
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:26,584
We'll be okay. This is fine.
We'll-- we'll figure it out.

739
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:29,240
Can you please

740
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,242
at least take down
those creepy stick figures?

741
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:34,753
- I can't look at those things anymore.
- I got it, I got it.

742
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,341
Hey, can I see your camera?

743
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:47,550
Just wanna charge the batteries

744
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:49,218
and change the cards out and stuff.

745
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:51,099
Yeah.

746
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:54,145
- Did you hear that?
- What?

747
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,143
Nothing.

748
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,645
Nothing. My ears are playing tricks on me.

749
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:02,026
You know what?
I thought I heard a voice earlier--

750
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:05,777
Hey.

751
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,612
Hey, how you doin'?

752
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,947
I'm fine. I'm just freezing.

753
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,825
Can you tell James to start a fire?

754
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:14,786
Okay.

755
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:15,953
Oh, babe.

756
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,039
Hey, we should check out
this cut on your foot.

757
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,260
Yeah, okay.

758
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,729
Okay... I'll just take that off.

759
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:39,018
- Ow!
- Oh, babe, okay.

760
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:42,359
- Be careful, it hurts.
- I gotcha. All right.

761
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,278
Looks like you...

762
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,114
It's a bit irritated.

763
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:53,074
Is it bad?

764
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,660
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. No, it's fine.

765
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,078
I mean, uh, we should just,

766
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,831
you know, um, put some ointment on it.

767
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:00,915
I'll go get James and--

768
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,959
What, what, what, what, what?

769
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,210
Don't do that! Ow!

770
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,963
What was that? What just happened?

771
00:40:06,964 --> 00:40:09,184
Okay, okay.

772
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,592
It's fine now. Just...

773
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:14,095
be careful how you touch it, okay?

774
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:17,516
That's how it felt
when I fell earlier today.

775
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:23,688
O-- okay, um...
I'm gonna set your foot down. Okay?

776
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,398
And, uh...

777
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,276
You should just stay lying down.
I'll be right back.

778
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:31,957
Okay. I'm just gonna rest my eyes.

779
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:34,206
Okay.

780
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:40,455
Hey, I need to talk to you.

781
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,966
That cut on Ashley's foot,
it's gotten worse.

782
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,427
But-- No, no, whatever it was,

783
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:55,928
it was really fuckin' weird, man, and--

784
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,639
Okay.
You said it looked like a muscle spasm?

785
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,433
Yeah, or something like--

786
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,685
I don't know. Whatev--
There's something inside of her cut.

787
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:04,854
Now she's cold
and I think she has a fever.

788
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,147
So I just...

789
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:08,107
Okay.
Okay, I'll go take a look at it right now.

790
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:10,118
- Thank you.
- Yep.

791
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,570
I wanna keep
a fire goin' for her tonight.

792
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:15,490
So I'm gonna gather some wood
if you guys think you can get it started.

793
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,074
- That's a good idea.
- Thanks, man.

794
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,875
- Hey, keep your walkie-talkie on.
- Of course.

795
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:22,121
Hey, will you look at this?

796
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:24,552
What? What is it?

797
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:27,752
Well, I don't see a road
or the creek or anything.

798
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:30,473
Should I take it further out?

799
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:33,174
Maybe it's the angle or something?

800
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:34,675
What?

801
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:36,013
Whoa. 
What happened?

802
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,238
I don't know. I don't...

803
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,193
Oh, my god. 
Oh, shit!

804
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:47,395
Fuck!

805
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:59,617
Oh, god damn it.

806
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,619
Lisa, if you're watching this footage,

807
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,010
I think you're gonna wanna delete it.

808
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:34,696
How is she?

809
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:38,781
It's infected
and she has a fever.

810
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:43,462
Did you see anything, like...
moving, like Peter said?

811
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,376
Uh, nothing like that.

812
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:54,213
But we should take her
straight to the closest ER tomorrow.

813
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:56,354
Okay.

814
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,990
Damn it.

815
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,710
Hey, James, is that you?

816
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:26,591
Hey, genius,
I think you're sittin' on your walkie.

817
00:43:32,502 --> 00:43:34,432
Okay.

818
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:41,136
Shit. Fuck, shit. Come on.

819
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:45,348
Oh, shit.

820
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:47,939
Hello? Hey!

821
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,647
Someone out there?

822
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:58,242
Oh, shit!

823
00:44:05,827 --> 00:44:07,662
Oh, no, no, no!

824
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:10,164
No! No, no, no! No, no!

825
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:12,585
Come on! Come on!

826
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,400
Fuck, man.

827
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:39,241
Okay,
hopefully the batteries last.

828
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,255
What was that?

829
00:44:59,256 --> 00:45:02,136
Sounded like another tree falling.
Take this.

830
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,719
- James.
- Peter!

831
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,179
- Wait! James!
- Peter!

832
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,150
James!

833
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,007
<i>Peter, can you hear me?</i>

834
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:46,688
Peter!

835
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:03,036
Peter!

836
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:08,666
Peter!

837
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:11,212
Peter!

838
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:14,706
Peter!

839
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,876
Peter?

840
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:20,722
Peter!

841
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,270
Peter!

842
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,281
Peter!

843
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:43,276
Peter, can you hear me?

844
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,029
Peter, if you're hurt
or you can't speak or something

845
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,697
just press the button
on your walkie-talkie twice.

846
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:50,748
Two clicks.

847
00:46:50,951 --> 00:46:55,761
Peter, if you can hear me, just press
the button on your walkie-talkie.

848
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,970
Peter!

849
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,840
Fuck.

850
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:43,627
Lisa.

851
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:44,962
What?

852
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,603
I don't feel so good.

853
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:50,843
Where's Peter?

854
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:53,012
Um, he went to go get some firewood,

855
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:55,097
but he'll be back soon, okay?

856
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:58,148
Come on, let's get you back to bed.

857
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:13,741
Lisa!

858
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:14,867
Hey.

859
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:17,708
Would everyone stop doing that?

860
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,220
Oh, fuck.

861
00:48:24,753 --> 00:48:27,129
I found Peter's flashlight out there.

862
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,060
Shit.

863
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,190
That was him
screaming out there, right?

864
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:38,098
- I think so.
- Oh, god!

865
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:41,060
No, James, look, it'll be okay.

866
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:44,021
Look, we need to stay together.

867
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:46,190
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

868
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,566
Let's just keep the fire going.

869
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:50,907
If he sees it,
he can find his way back.

870
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,459
Okay.

871
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:19,515
You know, I actually thought that

872
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:21,776
Heather could still be out
in these woods, somehow.

873
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,870
But now... Peter's lost.

874
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:30,786
And Ashley's hurt.

875
00:49:31,444 --> 00:49:33,754
It'll be okay.

876
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,497
Did you hear that?

877
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:45,418
Yeah.

878
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,214
Do you think that could be Peter?

879
00:49:52,215 --> 00:49:54,475
I don't know.

880
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:04,185
Peter!

881
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:19,457
Peter?

882
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:23,328
Lane? Talia?

883
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,289
- What are you guys doing here?
- Is that really them?

884
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,124
No, no, no. It's not really them!
Okay? Don't go close.

885
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,168
It's a trick. It's a trick.

886
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:31,128
When was the last time you saw us?

887
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,809
Uh, earlier this afternoon.

888
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:36,467
They're not lying.

889
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:39,261
It's been five days since we saw you.
Maybe six.

890
00:50:39,262 --> 00:50:40,929
I don't even fucking know. The sun--

891
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,556
the sun is not coming up!

892
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:44,558
The sun is not fucking coming up!

893
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,268
What are you talking about?

894
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:47,394
Hey, where--
where are the other two?

895
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:49,521
Peter and what's-her-name?

896
00:50:49,522 --> 00:50:51,940
Um, Ashley's sleeping.
She's not feeling well,

897
00:50:51,941 --> 00:50:54,951
and we don't know where Peter is.

898
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,653
It's starting for them. We have to go.

899
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,030
- Come on, we have to go.
- No, I don't wanna go.

900
00:50:58,031 --> 00:50:59,948
Guys, we're not gonna fall
for your stupid shit again!

901
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:01,283
Can you just tell us what's going on?

902
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:02,951
Do I look like I'm messing with you?

903
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:04,036
Do you have any food?

904
00:51:04,037 --> 00:51:05,454
No, no, get back!

905
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:06,580
Please.

906
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:07,998
Will you get back here, please?

907
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,500
I want it!

908
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:10,667
Stop it!

909
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,169
We're alive!
Don't you see that? You crazy?

910
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,171
Look at them!
They're doing better than us, aren't they?

911
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,214
Are they?

912
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,174
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

913
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:18,383
No, no, no, no, no!

914
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:20,094
If you wanna stay here, you go ahead.

915
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:21,637
Please, Lane, don't!
No, please don't!

916
00:51:21,638 --> 00:51:23,639
These people are gonna die.

917
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,474
And they're gonna be here forever.

918
00:51:25,475 --> 00:51:28,560
Not me! 
Not me!

919
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:30,781
Lane!

920
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:36,235
Talia.

921
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:57,221
We're just gonna go sit by a fire

922
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:01,688
and we'll set up a tent for you, okay?

923
00:52:05,098 --> 00:52:07,568
Is he coming back?

924
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:46,438
I don't think I can sleep.

925
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,378
Me neither.

926
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,199
What? 
Makes no sense.

927
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,450
What?

928
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:27,711
Well I set the alarm for 7:00,
but it's still dark outside.

929
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,835
Okay. 
We should pack up.

930
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:34,756
Okay.

931
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,756
What the hell?

932
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,936
Oh, my god!

933
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:50,727
Oh, my god.

934
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,813
Lisa...

935
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,231
Lisa, get out here.

936
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,492
What the fuck is that?

937
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,655
Oh, my god.

938
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,283
Oh, my god.

939
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,876
How did we not hear this?

940
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:11,498
Holy shit.

941
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,719
Oh, fuck.

942
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:17,104
They're everywhere.

943
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,465
Who could have done this?

944
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,636
Oh, my god.

945
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,101
Oh, the web cam!

946
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,890
Shit, the battery's dead.

947
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:29,391
Have to go, we have to go,
we have to go!

948
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,185
We have to go. We...

949
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,895
We have to go now.

950
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:35,906
Yeah. Okay.
Let's pack up our things.

951
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:38,567
Ashley.

952
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:41,028
What the shit?

953
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,289
Are you okay?

954
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,159
What is going on?

955
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,590
What is she doing here?
Where is Peter?

956
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,497
Talia came back a few hours ago.
She got lost, but...

957
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,582
You're okay.
You're okay.

958
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,893
- Peter... We're not sure.
- It's okay. You just bumped it.

959
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,556
Ashley?

960
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:03,842
Ashley? Ashley? Ashley?

961
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:05,010
Ashley?

962
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,941
I feel sick.

963
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,348
Okay. Okay, well...

964
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,017
What about the, um...
What about the drone camera?

965
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,393
Can you send the drone camera up?

966
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,519
Can you look for him with that?

967
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,104
- Like you were looking for--
- Ashley, it crashed.

968
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,815
No! No! Don't tell me that!

969
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,484
This is hair.

970
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,986
This is hair.

971
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,330
My...

972
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,036
This is my hair.

973
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,121
Of course, it's your hair.
- She took my hair.

974
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,540
- You did this!
- Ashley, Ashley, no, no, no.

975
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,376
No, just shut up! Shut up, get away!

976
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:39,257
Don't!

977
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,242
Oh, my god!

978
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:47,487
God! Oh, my god!

979
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,684
No, don't look, don't look,
don't look!

980
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:56,945
I didn't mean it! Oh, my god!

981
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,480
Is she gonna be okay.

982
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,548
Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley,

983
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:03,217
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

984
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,348
Run like hell!

985
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,894
My god!

986
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:27,388
Oh, my god!

987
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,911
James!

988
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:50,042
Ashley!

989
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,999
James!

990
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,390
Lisa!

991
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:04,468
Lisa, I'm here!

992
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:07,632
James!

993
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,773
Lisa, here I am.
You okay? Are you all right?

994
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:15,766
Yeah. I'm all right.

995
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:16,975
Where's Ashley?

996
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,771
I... I don't... I don't know.

997
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,106
- I don't know, we got split up.
- We have to go find her.

998
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,150
- We have to backwards-- backtrack.
- Okay.

999
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,535
All right,
stay close to me. Stay close.

1000
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,289
Lisa!

1001
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,423
James!

00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,139
Peter!

1003
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,021
Okay.

1004
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:31,818
She couldn't have gone far, right?

1005
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,593
I don't know.

1006
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:36,916
Ashley!

1007
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,085
Holy shit.

1008
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,590
Ashley!

1009
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,719
Ashley!

1010
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,140
Okay, it's okay.
We'll find her.

1011
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,897
Hello?

1012
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,941

Don't look anywhere else.

You're okay. You're okay.

Real slow.

1028
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,183
It's okay.

01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,236
Yeah, we gotta go.

01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:40,537
Okay. This way.

1037

Easy, slowly, slowly.

Okay.

Real slow.

1042
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,610
Oh, look the drone.

1043
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:22,581
Okay, okay, I can set that up.
I can set it up. Okay.

1044
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,706
Come on.

1045
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:37,723
Shit! Shit! Shit! It's stuck! Shit!

1046
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:43,269
Okay. I can, I can... Okay.

It's okay. Keep goin'. It's all right.

1054
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:21,722
It's all right.

1055
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:26,597
Ashley!

1056
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:38,810
Is that her?

1057
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,561
Where's that coming from?

1058
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,796
This way! 
Come on!

1059
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,076

Ashley!

1063
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:06,754
Oh, my god!

1064
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:10,029
We found it! 
This is it!

1065
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:17,382
Hey, come on!

1066
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,017
Don't touch me!
I don't wanna go in there.

1067
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,358
- I don't think we should go.
- Listen!

1068
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:22,979
James!

1069

I don't know what happened
to your sister, James,

1072
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,694
but that's not her.
That can't be her.

1073
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:31,821
Let's go.

1074
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,239
No! 
No, I have to go in!

1075
01:06:33,264 --> 01:06:33,989
Please!

1076
01:06:34,014 --> 01:06:36,135
My sister's in that house!
I have to get her!

1077
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,327
James, please.

1078
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:39,248
- Lisa...
- Please.

1079
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:42,922
You know this is 
what I came here for.

1080
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,349
Please, James!

1081

Heather!

1091
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:01,938

1100
01:09:27,472 --> 01:09:29,193
Hello?

1101
01:09:29,218 --> 01:09:31,088
Heather!

1102
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:34,811
Heather!

1103
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:38,806
Heather!

1104
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:44,087
Oh, fuck this!

1105
01:09:45,574 --> 01:09:46,908
Oh, no!

01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:48,743
Come on!

1107
01:09:48,744 --> 01:09:50,714
Come on!

1108
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:04,266
Ashley!

1109
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:09,306
James!

1110
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:28,748
James!

1111
01:10:29,785 --> 01:10:32,335
James!

1112
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,923
James?

1113
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:07,841
James?

1114
01:11:18,417 --> 01:11:20,377
Hello?

1115
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:24,884
James?

1116
01:11:40,272 --> 01:11:41,856
Lisa!

1117
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:43,441
Who is that?

1118
01:11:43,442 --> 01:11:45,109
You look exactly how I remember.

1119
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,610
Oh, my god. Lane?

1120
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:48,237
Figures, she couldn't have let you go.

1121
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,948
She had to find people
who remembered.

1122
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:53,419
Rustin Parr understood.

1123
01:11:53,452 --> 01:11:57,712
You have to do 
what she tells you!

1124
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,978
Please!

1125
01:12:34,427 --> 01:12:36,687
Lane!

1126
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,799
Lane!

1127
01:12:56,448 --> 01:12:58,218
Fuck!

1128
01:13:15,926 --> 01:13:18,936
Okay. 
It's gotta lead outside.

1129
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:52,604
I don't wanna be here.

1130
01:15:10,982 --> 01:15:12,612
Okay.

1131
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:21,539
Breathe. 
Breathe.

1132
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:24,662
You're not stuck.

1133
01:15:24,663 --> 01:15:28,053
It's okay.
 Keep going.

1134
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:08,520
No, no, no, no. 
No, no, no.

1135
01:16:13,378 --> 01:16:16,858
No. 
Fuck!

1136
01:16:22,053 --> 01:16:23,523
No!

1137
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:22,401
No!

1138
01:17:31,456 --> 01:17:32,976
No!

1139
01:18:07,759 --> 01:18:09,589
- Lisa?
- James.

1140
01:18:12,414 --> 01:18:13,580
Oh, my god.

1141
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:16,921
The attic. 
We're in the attic?

1142
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,294
Wait, wait!
She's right behind me.

1143
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:21,025
Oh, shit.

1144
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:35,718
What the fuck was that?

1145
01:18:35,743 --> 01:18:37,618
Oh, god!

1146
01:18:40,525 --> 01:18:42,359
What are we gonna do?

1147
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,160
The corner, get in the corner! 
Come on!

1148
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,530
James, what are you doing?

1149
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:49,051
Face the corner now! 
Come on!

1150
01:18:53,965 --> 01:18:57,154
Don't turn around! 
Don't look!

1151
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:01,545
- James...
- Shh, shh! Quiet!

1152
01:19:07,218 --> 01:19:09,285
Just keep your eyes closed.

1153
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,531
She only takes sacrifices.

1154
01:19:11,556 --> 01:19:14,276
We can't look directly at her.

1155
01:19:16,978 --> 01:19:19,278
She's in here.

1156
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:22,557
Shh!

1157
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:29,147
It's cold. 
So cold.

1158
01:19:29,172 --> 01:19:30,902
Close your eyes.

1159
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:38,552
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1160
01:19:41,419 --> 01:19:44,049
This is all my fault.

1161
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:56,653
Heather?

1162
01:19:59,354 --> 01:20:01,524
What are you doing?

1163
01:20:02,524 --> 01:20:04,414
Is that really you?

1164
01:20:05,944 --> 01:20:08,754
Who are you talking to?

1165
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:22,928
James!

1166
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,146
James, where are you?

1167
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:08,323
If you don't look at her,
she can't hurt you.

1168
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:43,465
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1169
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:48,230
James?

1170
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:16,661

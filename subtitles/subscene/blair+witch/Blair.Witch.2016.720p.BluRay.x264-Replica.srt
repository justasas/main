1
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,413
<i>- Did you see her?
- What do you mean? I...</i>

2
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,780
<i>I missed it the first time, too.
Hang on.</i>

3
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,547
Okay. What is that?

4
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,180
Lisa, I think that might be my sister.

5
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,218
Wait, wait, okay. Uh...

6
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:35,719
How did you even find it?

7
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,450
Did you have, like, a search alert set up?

8
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,564
Yeah, yeah, exactly.
And usually, it's nothing.

9
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,142
But the guy who uploaded this video

10
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:44,017
said it was from a tape he found
in the Black Hills Woods.

11
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,666
But those woods
have been searched, right?

12
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,209
- They never found the house.
- Mmm-hmm.

13
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,073
Yeah, but the Black Hills Forest is huge.

14
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,532
So maybe they weren't looking
in the right place, you know?

15
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,674
That's why I want us to start
where the tape was found.

16
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,134
- So we can set up camp at night...
- Lisa.

17
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,988
- Hi.
- Hey.

18
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,328
What are you guys doing?

19
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:01,041
We're doing Lisa's
documentary class project, starring me.

20
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,542
Boring!

21
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,799
Okay, so try on
that earpiece camera.

22
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,889
Wh... which is...

23
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,350
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,140
And then press the button on the side.

25
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,274
- Okay.
- And then it should be recording.

26
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:26,308
The cool thing about these
is they've got built-in GPS.

27
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:30,646
Huh?

28
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,317
How's that?

29
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,257
You're getting more of these
for Peter and Ashley, right?

30
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,121
Yeah. We just have to make sure
we remember to switch out the cards.

31
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,331
Okay.

32
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:46,922
Temp narration take one...

33
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,501
Take two... Three.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,470
When James was four years old,

35
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,049
his older sister disappeared
while making a documentary

36
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,006
near the town of Burkittsville, Maryland.

37
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,480
<i>Some of the footage
shot by James' sister was later found.</i>

38
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,649
<i>The final moments of it showed
her going into a house,</i>

39
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,782
<i>seemingly within the Black Hills Forest.</i>

40
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,037
<i>That area was extensively searched
by police and FBI,</i>

41
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,503
<i>but they could find no evidence</i>

42
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,253
<i>of an existing house in those woods.</i>

43
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:32,384
<i>Investigators concluded that James' sister
might have vanished elsewhere,</i>

44
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,803
<i>despite her crew's equipment and footage
being found nearby.</i>

45
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,717
<i>For as long as I've been friends
with James,</i>

46
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,265
<i>he's wondered what happened to her.</i>

47
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,519
<i>His continued search to find closure</i>

48
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,852
<i>and answers to his sister's disappearance</i>

49
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,807
<i>is the subject of this documentary.</i>

50
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,736
<i>How long have you and James
been friends?</i>

51
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:58,822
<i>Our parents were friends,</i>

52
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,777
so I guess we grew up together.

53
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,619
So you knew him
when his sister disappeared?

54
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,621
Yeah.

55
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,955
I don't really remember Heather
all that well, to be honest.

56
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:13,626
But after she went off into those woods
and she didn't come back...

57
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,344
Yeah. I remember all that.

58
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,030
Okay, I'm trying to prove a point.

59
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,934
That's why you're about to die.

60
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,024
Found one.

61
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,518
That's me. You're shooting me.

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
Peter...

63
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,808
Can you give us an idea
of what we're going to be doing out there?

64
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,727
Four of us, we're gonna go out there

65
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,065
and we're gonna try to find this house.

66
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,241
James, he's been messaging with the guy
who uploaded that video.

67
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,241
He's gonna show us exactly where
in the woods he found the DV tape.

68
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,374
And James, you think
you're gonna find the house?

69
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,081
Um, maybe. I hope so.

70
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,401
So you really think your sister

71
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,098
could still be out there
after all these years?

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,962
All I know is...

73
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,752
if there is any chance at all

74
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,585
that I could find out
what happened to her,

75
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,301
I need to at least try.

76
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,093
And what about the legends?

77
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,224
"Legends"?

78
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,337
Yeah, do you believe, at all,

79
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,387
in the stories about the Blair Witch?

80
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,153
Hey, Lisa, I can't tell,
is this thing recording or not?

81
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,283
Yeah, it should be.

82
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,149
Did you... did you press and hold
the button when you did it?

83
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,237
Yeah.

84
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,361
These things are so small.

85
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,617
Like, where do you put it?

86
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,279
Okay. Recording. We are recording.

87
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,247
Just, uh, make sure
it's always facing forward.

88
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,639
And make sure
you press the button down.

89
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,349
- Did you hold it down?
- Okay, got it, got it, got it.

90
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,725
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you hold it down?

91
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,310
Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down.

92
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,794
- Hey, Peter!
- Yeah?

93
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,957
How do I look?

94
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,045
Yeah, that's sexy.

95
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,097
The thing is, he's going back out
to those woods

96
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,136
to look for his sister, Lisa.

97
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,824
'Cause he thinks she could still be there

98
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,888
'cause of some blurry footage
that some weirdo put online.

99
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,306
So, like, how's that gonna look?

100
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,654
I don't wanna exploit anyone.
That's not the point.

101
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,999
All right, then don't tell anyone
about it. Okay?

102
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,709
How 'bout that? Use that.
There's an option.

103
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,903
Don't tell anyone.
Just come out there with us.

104
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,705
Film it like he wants you to,
as his friend.

105
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,567
Don't use the footage for your movie.

106
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,511
- I can't promise that. No, I can't.
- Right.

107
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,430
- I know. I know you can't.
- I can't promise that, Peter,

108
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,682
because like what if something
actually happens out there?

109
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,392
I see you, Lisa.
Yeah, right, okay, I'ma get a beer.

110
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,586
What if we find something
that they never found?

111
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:16,708
I'm so sorry.

112
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,355
He and James
have just been friends forever.

113
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,732
Just because I haven't been friends
with him

114
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,400
for as long as you guys
doesn't mean I don't care.

115
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,764
I know that!
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

116
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,223
Ah, fuck me, man.

117
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,346
How are you feeling?

118
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,353
You're asking if I regret getting drunk

119
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,185
the night before going camping
in the woods?

120
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,481
I do not.

121
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,451
Okay. Let's just move back a little bit.

122
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,579
How far does it go?

123
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,202
Like, 100 meters is the max, I think.

124
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,971
Ashley and I have used these
in class before.

125
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,089
Just like cheap helicopter shots,
you know.

126
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,886
It could be useful in terms
of finding our way around the forest.

127
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,782
Yeah,
but we're gonna have a GPS though, right?

128
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:10,806
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,076
It's built into the earpiece camera,

130
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,730
but it only works when it's on, though.

131
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,520
So just keep an eye on the battery
in case we get separated.

132
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,775
<i>Com check, over.</i>

133
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,067
"Com check"?

134
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,285
<i>Yeah, that's like,
what people say in the military, over.</i>

135
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,753
Okay, anyways, it's working.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,250
Over.

137
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:41,375
<i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

138
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,755
- Hey, the walkie-talkies work.
- Yeah, we know.

139
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,507
He's got the bass in his voice.

140
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,682
Somebody wasn't hydrated.

141
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,482
Whoa...

142
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,584
- Boom, we're safe.
- Okay, which one is you guys'?

143
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,002
- We're this one.
- Oh, this is ours.

144
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,066
- Okay!
- Whoa!

145
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,619
- Lay with us.
- Oh, no.

146
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,665
- We got room.
- James! James! James!

147
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,997
Good night, folks.

148
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,125
Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,025
- I don't know...
- He has been a little...

150
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,719
Who you bragging to?

151
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,432
And this used to be called Blair?

152
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,762
Sort of.

153
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,267
There was a town called Blair
back in the 1700s,

154
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,480
but it was discovered abandoned.

155
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,731
So they founded a new town,
called it Burkittsville.

156
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,033
I think so?

157
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,412
My god.

158
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,589
They're here!

159
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,130
- Hey! Hey, come in.
- Hey.

160
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,716
- Hope they fixed...
- Hey.

161
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,642
Hi.

162
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,682
Can I get anybody, like,
water or anything to drink?

163
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,893
- Water or...
- I'm okay. Thank you.

164
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:16,973
I'll take some water.

165
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,348
- Feel free to make yourself
at home. Just through there.

166
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:23,015
Yeah, have a seat in there
and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.

167
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,517
Hey, I'm glad
you're all recording this.

168
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,568
Not every day we get
like-minded investigators

169
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:28,837
coming out here to discuss
the Blair Witch.

170
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,861
There you go.

171
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,856
Hey, I may need to get you guys

172
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,328
to sign some release forms
later if that's...

173
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,328
Yeah, sure, that's cool.

174
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,009
I'll probably need you to sign one, too.

175
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,794
So, you're Darknet666?

176
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:44,172
Yeah. Well, we both are,
but, uh, you can call me Lane.

177
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,131
- This is... this is Talia.
- Hi.

178
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,875
So... Okay, well, first off,

179
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,586
I was hoping you could show us
where you found the tape.

180
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,277
We're gonna make that
our starting point.

181
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,635
Are you guys really gonna go camping
out in those woods?

182
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,772
Yep. That's the plan. Why?

183
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,063
You ask 'em.

184
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,364
Uh, we wanna go out there with you.

185
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,792
I mean, if you're gonna be looking around,

186
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,526
we wanna be a part of that.

187
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,360
It's not, you know...
We're not gonna be a burden or anything.

188
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,882
- We go camping all the time.
- Mmm-hmm.

189
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:17,196
Hey, look, that's the deal if you want us
to show you where we found it.

190
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,628
Is it okay if we talk it over in private,
real quick?

191
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,168
No, yeah, oh, yeah,
yeah, sure, go ahead.

192
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:37,138
- What do you think?
- Nope.

193
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,982
Well, don't we need them to show us
exactly where they found the tape?

194
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,226
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I didn't think they'd want

195
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,979
to stick around after that.

196
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:48,227
Well, they didn't exactly make it sound
like we have an option.

197
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,328
What are you bragging about?

198
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,708
No, I... I'm serious.

199
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,424
You say that to people?

200
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:20,387
Look at this guy.
You crack me up.

201
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,694
We made it.

202
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,407
Yeah. All right. Lisa. Got you.

203
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,407
Baby, what the hell
do you have in here?

204
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,869
It's heavy.

205
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,753
Lisa.

206
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,706
And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp.
Okay.

207
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,672
Hey,
it's cool if we leave our cars here?

208
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,592
Yeah, it's fine. They're safe.

209
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,422
No one comes out this way.

210
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,258
I'm already hungry.

211
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,061
Yeah, I'm thinkin' I could eat.

212
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,059
Could eat all these
granola bars in the backpack.

213
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,110
Hey, what do you think
they're smoking up there?

214
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,769
Mmm, definitely bath salts.

215
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,816
You know what? I'm gonna go ask.

216
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:16,993
Peter, wait! No!

217
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,111
Hey, yo, Darknet666, wait up!

218
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,123
I saw some of your other videos.

219
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,582
Yeah?

220
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,080
Yeah. Before we came out here.

221
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,472
Saw this one, it was really interesting

222
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,666
where you guys, like,
found this little pile of rocks.

223
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,633
Would you stop?

224
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:32,917
Symbols.

225
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,383
"Symbols"? Oh, they were symbols.

226
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,923
No, no, no, seriously.

227
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,296
So, do you guys really believe
all these old stories?

228
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,715
I mean, 'cause someone's died everywhere,
at some point, right?

229
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,246
Doesn't mean that every square foot
of this planet is haunted.

230
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,271
Did you grow up here?

231
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,942
- No.
- See, I... I did.

232
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,824
Talia did. We both... we both grew up here.

233
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,228
And the older folks in town

234
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,462
used to talk a lot
about these woods when I was little.

235
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:04,156
And after... his sister and her crew
went missing and their stuff got found,

236
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,331
suddenly, everyone I know
just wanted to forget it.

237
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,462
This area has a history
of things happening

238
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,131
that no one really likes to talk about.

239
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,010
Rustin Parr. Coffin Rock.

240
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,918
List goes on and on.

241
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,385
Hmm.

242
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:31,267
- Watch yourself. Watch your step!
- Yeah. It goes down here.

243
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,068
Back in the 1940s,
Rustin Parr brought eight kids

244
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,280
out to his house in these woods.

245
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,070
Killed seven of 'em.

246
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,204
But Parr claimed

247
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,950
<i>that he heard the voice
of an old woman</i>

248
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,872
<i>telling him to kill the children.</i>

249
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,511
<i>He would take them up to his attic</i>

250
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,115
<i>and make one stand in a corner</i>

251
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,043
while he killed the other one.

252
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,961
There's been some debate
on that actually, where

253
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,462
whether it was the attic or the basement.

254
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,384
So he thought he heard the Blair Witch
telling him to kill people?

255
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,216
Well, he never said who it was.

256
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,549
He just said that it sounded

257
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,594
like this voice of an old woman.

258
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,353
They hanged him out
in these woods, near his house.

259
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,100
So wait, he had a house out here?

260
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,118
Yeah. That's not the one
we're looking for though.

261
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,232
Parr's house was burnt down
after he was hanged.

262
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,998
Supposedly they found a bunch of old
tunnels and stuff underneath

263
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,112
that didn't go anywhere.

264
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,780
Some kind of underground railroad thing,
I think.

265
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,594
Oh, my back.

266
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,182
Okay, so this is, uh,

267
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,096
this is technically where
the Black Hills Woods start.

268
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,266
Back from when this was private land.

269
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,857
Uh, well, who owns it now?

270
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,571
No one. It's the state's, I guess.

271
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,612
So, we're not trespassing
or anything, right?

272
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,948
No. No one cares. No one living, that is.

273
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,970
If we have to go camping with the locals,

274
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,588
could you please not piss them off?

275
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,295
Baby, I Di... I didn't say anything.

276
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,885
You don't have to say anything,
Peter, you know that.

277
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,635
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:32,774
Sorry.

279
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,440
Okay, Goofy.

280
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,817
The glare on the plastic...

281
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,531
You just, you we... you were
walking by and you saw it?

282
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,358
This is where we found the DV tape.

283
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,447
And there was nothing else
on the tape?

284
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,992
No. Like I said, it was all static

285
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,825
except for that bit that we uploaded.

286
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,292
Why does the tree look like that?

287
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,870
Lightning.
Sometimes when it hits the tree,

288
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,996
the electricity goes into the ground

289
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,173
and it burns the tree from the roots up.

290
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,503
- Was it just underneath here?
- Yeah.

291
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,970
It was like half under and half out,
but we had to dig a little.

292
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,139
...wasn't your fault.

293
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,548
I just couldn't help laughing at you.

294
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,066
A girl drowned in this creek.

295
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,281
It was around when Burkittsville
was founded.

296
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,531
Her family was doing the washing
and her mother said

297
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,034
she saw a hand reach out of the water
and pull her daughter in.

298
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,971
Probably the only reason
we still know about it is

299
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,347
'cause there were newspaper articles,

300
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,251
'cause the girl's body was never found.

301
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,379
Are we crossing this?

302
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,142
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

303
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,260
- Yeah, let us know how it is.
- Ooh, it's freezing.

304
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,637
I'm walking across the water.

305
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,723
That's great.

306
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,637
- Oh!
- Oh! That's cold.

307
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,726
Leeches are fine?
What do you mean?

308
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,611
Wait, wait, you said
there was leeches?

309
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,228
No, I'm just asking.

310
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,977
Are you coming?

311
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,669
Did you get a pedicure
before you came here?

312
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,903
Yes.

313
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,124
- Ah!
- I know, I know.

314
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,994
You sure this is a good idea?

315
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,618
Uh, will you hold the camera for me
for just one second?

316
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,035
My shoes...

317
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,959
- All right. Oh, oh!
- Careful there.

318
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,205
Ah! That's cold!

319
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,506
Wait, I got it, I got it.

320
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,129
You got it? All right.

321
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,426
Careful.

322
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,345
- You all right?
- Oh...

323
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,273
Ashley!

324
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,585
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, okay.

325
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,859
I cut my foot on a rock

326
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,172
- or a piece of broken glass or something.
- You'll be all right.

327
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,776
Okay, there we go. We gotcha.

328
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,374
- You okay?
- Yeah.

329
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,079
You're all right,
you're all right.

330
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,949
Careful, careful, careful.

331
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,286
Okay. Let's see that foot.

332
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,054
Okay. Ah, you're all right.

333
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,439
You're all right.
You're all right.

334
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,883
Is it bad? It just feels
like it's really deep and it hurts.

335
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,466
No, it's not bad at all.
I just gotta clean it.

336
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,071
Lisa, do you mind gettin'
my first-aid kit?

337
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,406
- It's in my bag over there.
- Huh?

338
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,220
- Lisa. First-aid kit. Bag. Please.
- Oh, shit!

339
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,994
- Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.
- Thank you very much.

340
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,058
- Lane! Jesus! Manners, dude.
- Hey! Hey! Back up! Back up!

341
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,957
I'll get this shot really quick
and then I'll be good.

342
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,792
- Get back over there.
- Just like one more second?

343
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,127
- I swear...
- All right, all right.

344
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,503
All right,
I've seen much worse than this.

345
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,897
There you go. Oh, oh, it's okay.

346
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,132
- Try not to move it too much.
- Feels like it's really big.

347
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,986
No, it feels a lot worse
than it actually is. I promise.

348
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,622
- Pressure. It's okay. It's all right.
- Ah!

349
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,253
Now we just gotta wrap it up
and you'll be good to walk on it.

350
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,751
Gotta bring it around.

351
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,915
Thank you, James.

352
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,131
No problem, man.

353
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,801
Okay. You wanna try standing up?

354
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,009
- Yeah.
- Okay.

355
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,890
All right,
don't put too much pressure on it.

356
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,933
Ready? One, two, three.

357
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,389
- There you go. You all right?
- Yeah.

358
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,180
- Not so bad.
- Not so bad.

359
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,192
- Oh. Ow.
- You okay?

360
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,200
Come to my palace in the woods.

361
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,615
This is how we roll.

362
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,868
In style without...

363
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,739
No, that's what I'm trying
to say is, um...

364
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,117
Is it... fuck.

365
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,124
- Babe, Babe, it's bent.
- Babe, I got it, I got!

366
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,884
Please, let me just put the tent together.
Okay?

367
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,144
I'm just saying that the pole is...

368
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,520
I just need to put
the tent together right now.

369
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,134
It's not supposed to be bent,
I know. So you just bend...

370
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,884
This... is this supposed to be bent?

371
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,046
This is not the entrance.

372
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,216
That's not.
Well, that's not either.

373
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,176
Fuck!

374
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,346
Fuck!

375
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,432
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

376
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,228
Fuck you! Fuck you, tent!

377
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,240
Okay. Everything's good.

378
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,985
Hey, I'm gonna go
get some firewood

379
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,076
before it gets totally dark, okay?

380
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,163
Looks like the sun's
coming down pretty quick.

381
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,457
Well, hold up.
Let's finish this and I'll come with you.

382
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,331
No, man,
I'm not goin' too far, okay?

383
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,500
I'll keep my camera on.

384
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,416
You can see me on the GPS, all right?

385
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,505
Okay.

386
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,339
Well, take a walkie-talkie
with you, please.

387
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,135
Man. Brother, already got one.

388
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,599
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

389
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,681
<i>What exactly
should we be looking for?</i>

390
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,312
<i>We're looking for the house
from Heather's footage.</i>

391
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,929
<i>Do you see the... do you see any clearings?
Anything like that?</i>

392
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,227
<i>I shouldn't take
this thing too much further up,</i>

393
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,311
but, I mean, I don't see anything yet.

394
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,663
Yeah. That was a good movie.

395
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,499
I'm unsettled, immediately.

396
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,542
All right.

397
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,464
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,815
- Ew! Ew!
- I'm uncomfortable with this.

399
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,839
What?

400
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,384
Why do you have
to eat it like that?

401
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,361
- I didn't mean to.
- Eat it a little bit quicker.

402
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,738
You don't have to go all slow like that.

403
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,932
Oh, god!

404
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,812
It really,
really did scar me for life.

405
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,024
I don't want to ever fish again.

406
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,833
Okay, so the Blair Witch.

407
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,543
Who is she really?

408
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,917
Elly Kedward.

409
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,667
That's what most people say.

410
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,257
She was accused of witchcraft

411
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,028
after some of the children
in town said that

412
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,972
she'd taken blood from them.

413
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,515
There wasn't much
of a trial system back then.

414
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,521
Townspeople took her out
to these woods,

415
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,562
tied her to a tree and
left her to die of exposure.

416
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,277
In the spring they went back
to look for her body

417
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,069
but there was no trace of it.

418
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,913
They assumed she was eaten
by animals or something, but...

419
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,870
then people in the town
started disappearing.

420
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:52,248
First the children who'd accused her,
and their families.

421
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,712
Then others.

422
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,004
Eventually, everyone who was left

423
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,005
just abandoned their homes, fled the town.

424
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,258
Well...

425
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,093
What?

426
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,429
- What?
- Well, I was just gonna add...

427
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,971
According to this book I read,
published in 1809,

428
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,885
they didn't just tie
Elly Kedward to a tree.

429
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,435
I mean, they did tie her to a tree,

430
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:14,745
but they tied her up really high

431
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,899
and they strung these heavy rocks
to her arms and legs

432
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,060
as weights, stretching her.

433
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,226
Ugh.

434
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,356
They left her to die on a makeshift rack.

435
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,993
Okay. Thanks.

436
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,574
Ever since,
there's been a curse on these woods.

437
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,697
The legend says if you look
directly at the witch

438
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,794
you'll die just from the fright of it.

439
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,794
That's why Rustin Parr
stood in that corner.

440
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,342
They say no one's ever seen her
and lived to talk about it.

441
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,588
Or, alternately,
no one has ever seen her, period.

442
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,835
This is all just stories, okay?

443
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,755
I've been to these woods before.

444
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,014
When I was a kid
with about 100 other people.

445
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,426
You were part
of those search teams?

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,730
I remember that.

447
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,482
Yeah.

448
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,770
So how come I'm okay?

449
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,066
Nothing got me then.

450
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,527
Maybe it did.

451
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,819
You're back, right?

452
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,195
All right, real theory, real theory.

453
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,865
One that I've read online.

454
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,412
Whatever spell the witch
put on these woods,

455
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,038
you have to be out here
at night for it to get you.

456
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,884
You have to spend the night.

457
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,336
Wait, well, then how come
you're still alive?

458
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,465
That's a good point.

459
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,257
Maybe she's using us
to lure you all out here.

460
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,264
Okay, on that note,
I'm going to bed.

461
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,823
- Yeah, me, too.
- We should get some rest.

462
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,367
We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow.

463
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,271
- 'Night, dudes.
- Yeah, good night, man.

464
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:43,939
Good night, James.

465
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,025
'Night.

466
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,007
I just heard something
moving outside.

467
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,738
Oh, my...

468
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,136
Shit.

469
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,055
Shit!

470
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,147
What the fuck?

471
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,121
Hey, Lisa.

472
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,898
Lisa?
What the hell are you doing?

473
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,474
- Did you hear that out there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it.

474
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,818
There's something out there,
out in the woods, like a bear.

475
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,918
Okay, here.

476
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,670
Thanks.

477
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,848
What the fuck was that?

478
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,521
It's okay. It's just my walkie-talkie.

479
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,243
- It's all right, that's all right.
- Shit!

480
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,307
Peter, is that you? Com check.

481
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,567
<i>James,
what the hell was that?</i>

482
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,859
Oh, fuck.

483
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,862
I don't know, man,
I don't know.

484
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,612
<i>Are you okay?</i>

485
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're okay, we're okay.

486
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,954
Lisa's here too, we're okay.

487
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,968
I mean, she just came, like,
just now came into my tent.

488
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,082
Like 30 seconds ago.

489
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,750
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

490
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,172
Yeah, we're fine. You two good?

491
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,250
No. Lane's not here.

492
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,455
Where is he?

493
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,045
Well, he went...
he went off to pee,

494
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,550
but he always goes far off for privacy.

495
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,012
Oh, god.

496
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,715
Hey, Lane!

497
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,142
Lane!

498
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,056
Lane!

499
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,438
Oh, god damn it.

500
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:32,284
We should probably go look for him, right?
Make sure he's okay?

501
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
- No.
- No.

502
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,606
No, I'm not goin' out there.

503
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:35,840
That is definitely
not a good idea.

504
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,124
Well, I'm gonna go.
He's been gone for a while.

505
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,949
Okay. I'll come with you.

506
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,124
Um...

507
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,906
- Shit, he might be lost, okay?
- Um...

508
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,058
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

509
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,462
I guess I should probably go back
to my tent.

510
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,383
- I mean, you can stay here if you want.
- Okay.

511
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,962
- Yeah?
- Okay.

512
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,547
All right. I'll be back soon.

513
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,303
All right.

514
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,762
Hey, good luck, man.

515
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,888
- Careful. There.
- Thanks.

516
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,817
Lane!

517
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,906
Lane!

518
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,254
Lane!

519
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,257
God, where is he?

520
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,588
Lane!

521
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,506
Lane!

522
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,273
Lane!

523
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,366
Did you see that tree that fell?

524
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,451
Sounded like it landed nearby.

525
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,460
Yeah, but sounds can travel
pretty far out here.

526
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,292
Did you guys hear that?

527
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,548
Lane!

528
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:15,709
Lane, what the fuck, man?

529
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:16,797
I'm sorry, man.

530
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,275
Tell me you recorded those sounds.

531
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,379
Did you get those sounds?

532
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,387
- Yeah, Lisa and I were recording.
- Okay.

533
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,280
I went to see if I could find
what was makin' those noises.

534
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,157
I couldn't find anything.
Did you guys find anything?

535
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,181
No, dude.

536
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,886
Just let's get back to the camp, okay?

537
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,186
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

538
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,189
- You okay?
- Yeah.

539
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,358
Okay.

540
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,332
You guys, get out here!

541
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,631
No. No, no, no, I'm getting out of here.

542
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm packing, I'm leaving.
This is fucked up.

543
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,761
Holy shit.

544
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,263
I wanna go home, okay?

545
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,764
Where'd this stuff
come from?

546
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,824
Someone must've put these things up
while we were asleep.

547
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,218
Why, what's going on?
What's wrong?

548
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,481
What do you think?

549
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,162
We should film these.
Talia, get the camera.

550
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,596
You guys should be taking pictures!

551
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:14,858
What is it?

552
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,271
Thank you.

553
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,567
What? What is it?

554
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,780
You guys, seriously
I want to go home now.

555
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,071
We need to get out of here.

556
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,954
Hey, James,
that's not a bad idea, okay?

557
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,321
We're not prepared for this.

558
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,676
Okay, I've seen this stuff before.

559
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,802
This was in Heather's footage, guys.

560
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,446
Shit, there's another one back here.

561
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,076
That's my tent!

562
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:31,849
Does anybody know
what time it is?

563
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,463
My watch is sayin' 2:00 p.m.

564
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,001
What?
How is it even possible we just woke up?

565
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,085
Look, I know I was tired,

566
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,522
but how did we sleep
till 2:00 in the afternoon?

567
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,756
Can we please get out of here?

568
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,039
You know what? Ashley's right.

569
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,068
Let's just pack up our stuff
and get back to my car, okay?

570
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,802
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Are you sure?

571
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,346
Yeah, yeah, this is too weird.

572
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,471
I dunno, we found something, right?

573
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,034
Like, we can show the footage
to the police.

574
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,518
Maybe they'll reopen Heather's case.

575
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,061
Wait, I wanna get that on camera.

576
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,305
I think it's just...

577
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,726
Just rip it off the tree,
for Christ's sake.

578
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:00,859
Oh, holy shit.

579
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,254
Wait, wait, that's the shot,
that's the shot.

580
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,278
I have an idea.

581
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,049
Why don't you stay here
and get all the footage you want?

582
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,467
All right, that's it.
Come on, turn it off.

583
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,531
Turn it off. Let's go!

584
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:08,907
I wanna get a shot of it, okay?

585
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:11,867
Oh, fuck this.

586
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,119
So, hey,
what kinda camera is that, man?

587
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,705
Oh, it's a DV camera.

588
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,870
Oh, yeah?

589
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,708
It's old. It's good in low light.

590
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,553
- It's better than modern cameras.
- Okay.

591
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,998
Does it use tapes?

592
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,088
Like the one you found? Or is it...

593
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,593
You know, there's not too many brands
of them anymore. Why?

594
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,916
Oh, nothing, I... Just curious.

595
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,219
Well, I mean, I recommend it.
Everything is cards now,

596
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,274
but in some ways, you know tapes are
more reliable and cheaper.

597
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,952
Do have to carry
a lot of batteries, though.

598
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,016
Oh, yeah?

599
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,102
Ow! Ah!

600
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,266
Ooh! Ashley!

601
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:20,686
- Hey, you all right?
- You okay? What's going on?

602
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:21,943
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,194
I'm fine. It's just my foot.

604
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,567
Want me to take
the boot off?

605
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,913
No, it just hurt for a second,
but feels fine now.

606
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,739
- Okay. Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

607
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,084
- Does that hurt?
- It's fine.

608
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,409
Hey, Lane. Lane.

609
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:34,664
Stop it. Stop it!

610
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,306
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What is this?

611
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,960
This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys?

612
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,420
Yeah, that's rope. And kindling.

613
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,978
That's useful for camping.
Give that to me!

614
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,302
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
Get back.

615
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,231
You have the symbols from the camp,
don't you, Talia?

616
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,375
So can I see one?

617
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,105
Because this rope looks exactly the same.

618
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:48,175
What the hell?

619
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,679
Definitely does not look the same.

620
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,930
Rope is rope. Open your eyes.

621
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,102
But let her see it, then.
She doesn't need to see it!

622
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,941
- Let her see it.
- Get the fuck off me, man!

623
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,266
Hey, hey! Listen, stop it!

624
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,270
Listen, we weren't trying to scare you
or anything, we just...

625
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,993
We weren't lying about the things
that are going on in these woods.

626
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,983
We just needed somebody
to see what was happening.

627
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,105
Oh, no, no, no!

628
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,649
Did you... You faked this?

629
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,538
Yeah, yeah, we faked it.

630
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,556
All right, but look we faked
it because it's real, okay?

631
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,460
There really is something happening here,
guys, in these woods.

632
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,791
And that makes sense to you?

633
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,956
Hey, we didn't fake
those noises last night.

634
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,505
And sleeping until 2:00?
How could we fake that?

635
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,090
There is something really going on
out here in these woods.

636
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,653
Right. For all we know
you guys put sleeping pills

637
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,887
in our water or something.

638
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,262
- What?
- Did you?

639
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,307
- No!
- No, 'course not.

640
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,810
Okay, fuck this. I'm out.

641
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,983
You guys... you guys want this.

642
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,192
This is on you.

643
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,864
Hey, get a shot of this!

644
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,074
Lane.

645
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,618
Those fucking assholes.

646
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,487
Uh, guys...

647
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,248
Uh...

648
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,963
We don't have the GPS thing.

649
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,080
There's no cell reception out here,
so I mean...

650
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,377
- That's not our problem, man.
- Just hear me out.

651
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,731
What if... what if we get lost, okay?
What if we get lost?

652
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:10,375
I thought you guys
came out here all the time?

653
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,219
- We've been following you!
- I don't know what...

654
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,072
Oh, my god!
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man!

655
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,740
We've never been as far as the creek,
but nobody has.

656
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,908
Nobody's been here for years.

657
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,201
- Shit, man!
- We don't know where we are!

658
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,619
- Okay, just calm down. We meant to..
- Fuck!

659
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,079
- We wanted safety in numbers, okay?
- Jesus Christ!

660
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,580
There's more of us,
so the odds are better.

661
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,332
Is there anything that you two told us
that is not a lie?

662
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,042
And I guess it's just a coincidence
that your camera uses

663
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,936
the exact same kind of tape
that you found?

664
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,068
No, it wasn't...

665
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,821
Okay, I think you two got
all the footage you need.

666
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,259
You walk that way for about two miles,
you'll hit the fence.

667
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,219
Look, can we just calm down?
We could just talk about this.

668
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,762
- No! Get outta here!
- Guys, come on, please!

669
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,116
- Okay, okay, sure, sure! Go, go.
- Please! Just come on.

670
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,082
Cut the camera off.

671
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,504
You guys don't understand,
okay, you're not from here.

672
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,937
- Get out of here!
- Just go! We're done talking!

673
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,251
It's time to go! Let's go!

674
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,837
- Stop it!
- Please, man!

675
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,592
- Take him. Go.
- Come on!

676
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,469
Guys, are you sure this is...

677
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,507
Does this have to happen?
We could talk about this.

678
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,575
- We could talk about it. I have like...
- Hey, we're done...

679
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,269
Lane, I swear to... Fuck you!

680
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,151
Oh, my god, no!
Wait, hold on! Stop!

681
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,147
Fuck.

682
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,566
Hey... James, man.

683
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:11,821
I'm so sorry.

684
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,660
I actually thought that...
Heather could still be out here.

685
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,235
They're pathetic, man.

686
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:23,834
God, I should've known they were...
Fuck.

687
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,003
I guess I just...

688
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,969
Oh, god.

689
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,263
Yeah, well...

690
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,813
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel a little bit,

691
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,232
you know,
less scared being in the woods now.

692
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,311
Yeah.

693
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,022
Are you gonna be okay?

694
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,689
- I'm all right, man. I'm okay.
- I'ma give you a hug.

695
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,837
- Don't give me a hug.
- I'ma give you a hug.

696
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,651
Don't give me a hug...

697
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,698
Aw, look at that.

698
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,788
Oh, sorry.

699
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,246
That's okay.

700
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,851
I've got it.

701
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,981
Lisa, come on. Let's go.

702
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,739
Hey, James.

703
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,783
We anywhere close to the fence yet?

704
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,406
Yep. Should be.

705
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,765
This looks familiar.

706
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,685
That's a good thing, right?

707
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,355
How can you even tell?

708
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,114
I don't know. Just...
I thought we'd...

709
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,661
Baby, what?

710
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:28,617
No. No! No way! No way!

711
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,363
We've been walking in a circle?

712
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,536
That doesn't make sense.
I've been following the GPS.

713
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,271
Then we should've reached
the fence hours ago!

714
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:37,335
We shouldn't be back at the same fuckin'
campsite we just left!

715
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,723
- Can I see the GPS, James?
- Yeah. It must be broken.

716
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:43,354
- We're lost.
- No, we're not lost.

717
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,009
We, we got turned around. We gotta...

718
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,767
"Got turned around."

719
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,691
Let's look around with the drone.

720
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,954
We can start hiking for the road.

721
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,268
Yeah, okay, let's do that.

722
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,728
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

723
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,486
Hey, are you okay?

724
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,421
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

725
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,358
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

726
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,780
- You can't...
- I'm fine.

727
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,616
You can't keep walkin'.

728
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,804
- We gotta camp here tonight, y'all.
- No, no, no, no...

729
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,158
No, no, no, babe, you gotta...

730
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,748
- Ahh!
- Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

731
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,961
I can't stay here
another night, Peter!

732
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,922
I can't stay here another night, okay?

733
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,752
Hey, hey, hey, you need to rest.

734
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,377
Okay? You gotta let that foot heal.

735
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,924
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

736
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,047
Look, let's just set up the tents.

737
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,684
We'll be okay. This is fine.
We'll... we'll figure it out.

738
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,055
Can you please

739
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,061
at least take down
those creepy stick figures?

740
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,853
- I can't look at those things anymore.
- I got it, I got it.

741
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,155
Hey, can I see your camera?

742
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:47,427
Just wanna charge the batteries

743
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,041
and change the cards out and stuff.

744
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,199
Yeah.

745
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,245
- Did you hear that?
- What?

746
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,501
Nothing.

747
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,464
Nothing. My ears are playing tricks on me.

748
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,546
You know what?
I thought I heard a voice earlier...

749
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,338
Hey.

750
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,428
Hey, how you doin'?

751
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,773
I'm fine. I'm just freezing.

752
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,178
Can you tell James to start a fire?

753
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,936
Okay.

754
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:15,767
Oh, babe.

755
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,864
Hey, we should check out
this cut on your foot.

756
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,360
Yeah, okay.

757
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,829
Okay... I'll just take that off.

758
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,837
- Ow!
- Oh, babe, okay.

759
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,459
- Be careful, it hurts.
- I gotcha. All right.

760
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,099
Looks like you...

761
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,509
It's a bit irritated.

762
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:52,385
Is it bad?

763
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,475
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. No, it's fine.

764
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,901
I mean, uh, we should just,

765
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,649
you know, um, put some ointment on it.

766
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,732
I'll go get James and...

767
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,776
What, what, what, what, what?

768
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,030
Don't do that! Ow!

769
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,781
What was that? What just happened?

770
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,284
Okay, okay.

771
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,408
It's fine now. Just...

772
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,913
be careful how you touch it, okay?

773
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,616
That's how it felt
when I fell earlier today.

774
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:23,508
O... okay, um...
I'm gonna set your foot down. Okay?

775
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,799
And, uh...

776
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,089
You should just stay lying down.
I'll be right back.

777
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,057
Okay. I'm just gonna rest my eyes.

778
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:33,306
Okay.

779
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,269
Hey, I need to talk to you.

780
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:43,066
That cut on Ashley's foot,
it's gotten worse.

781
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,235
But... No, no, whatever it was,

782
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,805
it was really fuckin' weird, man, and...

783
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,459
Okay.
You said it looked like a muscle spasm?

784
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,250
Yeah, or something like...

785
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,562
I don't know. Whatev...
There's something inside of her cut.

786
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,666
Now she's cold
and I think she has a fever.

787
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:05,955
So I just...

788
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,928
Okay.
Okay, I'll go take a look at it right now.

789
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,218
- Thank you.
- Yep.

790
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,386
I wanna keep
a fire goin' for her tonight.

791
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,311
So I'm gonna gather some wood
if you guys think you can get it started.

792
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,891
- That's a good idea.
- Thanks, man.

793
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,975
- Hey, keep your walkie-talkie on.
- Of course.

794
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,944
Hey, will you look at this?

795
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,652
What? What is it?

796
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:27,566
Well, I don't see a road
or the creek or anything.

797
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:29,573
Should I take it further out?

798
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,988
Maybe it's the angle or something?

799
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,485
What?

800
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,946
Whoa. What happened?

801
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,076
I don't know. I don't...

802
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,293
Oh, my god. Oh, shit!

803
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,050
Fuck!

804
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,773
Oh, god damn it.

805
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,438
Lisa, if you're watching this footage,

806
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,110
I think you're gonna wanna delete it.

807
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,796
How is she?

808
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,598
It's infected
and she has a fever.

809
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:42,562
Did you see anything, like...
moving, like Peter said?

810
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,187
Uh, nothing like that.

811
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:53,737
But we should take her
straight to the closest ER tomorrow.

812
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,454
Okay.

813
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,090
Damn it.

814
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,810
Hey, James, is that you?

815
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,691
Hey, genius,
I think you're sittin' on your walkie.

816
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,532
Okay.

817
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:40,236
Shit. Fuck, shit. Come on.

818
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:45,165
Oh, shit.

819
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,039
Hello? Hey!

820
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,747
Someone out there?

821
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,342
Oh, shit!

822
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,477
Oh, no, no, no!

823
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,983
No! No, no, no! No, no!

824
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,685
Come on! Come on!

825
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,500
Fuck, man.

826
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,341
Okay,
hopefully the batteries last.

827
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,070
What was that?

828
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,236
Sounded like another tree falling.
Take this.

829
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,204
- James.
- Peter!

830
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,410
- Wait! James!
- Peter!

831
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,250
James!

832
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,107
<i>Peter, can you hear me?</i>

833
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,788
Peter!

834
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,136
Peter!

835
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,766
Peter!

836
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:10,312
Peter!

837
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,806
Peter!

838
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:16,976
Peter?

839
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:19,822
Peter!

840
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,370
Peter!

841
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,381
Peter!

842
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:42,376
Peter, can you hear me?

843
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,850
Peter, if you're hurt
or you can't speak or something

844
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,574
just press the button
on your walkie-talkie twice.

845
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:49,848
Two clicks.

846
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:54,861
Peter, if you can hear me, just press
the button on your walkie-talkie.

847
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,070
Peter!

848
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,940
Fuck.

849
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,454
Lisa.

850
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:44,778
What?

851
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,703
I don't feel so good.

852
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,287
Where's Peter?

853
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:52,834
Um, he went to go get some firewood,

854
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,923
but he'll be back soon, okay?

855
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,248
Come on, let's get you back to bed.

856
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:13,556
Lisa!

857
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:14,682
Hey.

858
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,808
Would everyone stop doing that?

859
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,320
Oh, fuck.

860
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,953
I found Peter's flashlight out there.

861
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,160
Shit.

862
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,290
That was him
screaming out there, right?

863
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,615
- I think so.
- Oh, god!

864
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,459
No, James, look, it'll be okay.

865
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,261
Look, we need to stay together.

866
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:46,012
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

867
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,381
Let's just keep the fire going.

868
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,007
If he sees it,
he can find his way back.

869
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,559
Okay.

870
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,333
You know, I actually thought that

871
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,416
Heather could still be out
in these woods, somehow.

872
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,970
But now... Peter's lost.

873
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,886
And Ashley's hurt.

874
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,854
It'll be okay.

875
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,321
Did you hear that?

876
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,518
Yeah.

877
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,030
Do you think that could be Peter?

878
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,575
I don't know.

879
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,285
Peter!

880
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:18,557
Peter?

881
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,145
Lane? Talia?

882
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,166
- What are you guys doing here?
- Is that really them?

883
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,001
No, no, no. It's not really them!
Okay? Don't go close.

884
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,435
It's a trick. It's a trick.

885
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:30,649
When was the last time you saw us?

886
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,909
Uh, earlier this afternoon.

887
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,284
They're not lying.

888
00:50:36,368 --> 00:50:39,078
It's been five days since we saw you.
Maybe six.

889
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,752
I don't even fucking know. The sun...

890
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,370
the sun is not coming up!

891
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,377
The sun is not fucking coming up!

892
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,089
What are you talking about?

893
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,271
Hey, where...
where are the other two?

894
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,335
Peter and what's-her-name?

895
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,762
Um, Ashley's sleeping.
She's not feeling well,

896
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,051
and we don't know where Peter is.

897
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,530
It's starting for them. We have to go.

898
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,907
- Come on, we have to go.
- No, I don't wanna go.

899
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,825
Guys, we're not gonna fall
for your stupid shit again!

900
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,160
Can you just tell us what's going on?

901
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,774
Do I look like I'm messing with you?

902
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:03,852
Do you have any food?

903
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:05,267
No, no, get back!

904
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:06,395
Please.

905
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,821
Will you get back here, please?

906
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,319
I want it!

907
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:10,491
Stop it!

908
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,046
We're alive!
Don't you see that? You crazy?

909
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,048
Look at them!
They're doing better than us, aren't they?

910
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,072
Are they?

911
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,985
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

912
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,195
No, no, no, no, no!

913
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,914
If you wanna stay here, you go ahead.

914
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:21,475
Please, Lane, don't!
No, please don't!

915
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,458
These people are gonna die.

916
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,290
And they're gonna be here forever.

917
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:28,375
Not me! Not me!

918
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,881
Lane!

919
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,335
Talia.

920
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:56,321
We're just gonna go sit by a fire

921
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,788
and we'll set up a tent for you, okay?

922
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,668
Is he coming back?

923
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:45,655
I don't think I can sleep.

924
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,578
Me neither.

925
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,077
What? Makes no sense.

926
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,370
What?

927
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:26,911
Well I set the alarm for 7:00,
but it's still dark outside.

928
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,749
Okay. We should pack up.

929
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:33,956
Okay.

930
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,385
What the hell?

931
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,136
Oh, my god!

932
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:50,652
Oh, my god.

933
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,018
Lisa...

934
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:53,864
Lisa, get out here.

935
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:55,692
What the fuck is that?

936
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,855
Oh, my god.

937
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
Oh, my god.

938
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,076
How did we not hear this?

939
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:11,422
Holy shit.

940
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:12,919
Oh, fuck.

941
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,304
They're everywhere.

942
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,092
Who could have done this?

943
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,836
Oh, my god.

944
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,301
Oh, the web cam!

945
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,814
Shit, the battery's dead.

946
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:29,368
Have to go, we have to go,
we have to go!

947
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,102
We have to go. We...

948
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,806
We have to go now.

949
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:35,106
Yeah. Okay.
Let's pack up our things.

950
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:38,477
Ashley.

951
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,698
What the shit?

952
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:42,489
Are you okay?

953
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,491
What is going on?

954
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,790
What is she doing here?
Where is Peter?

955
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,421
Talia came back a few hours ago.
She got lost, but...

956
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,498
You're okay.
You're okay.

957
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,093
- Peter... We're not sure.
- It's okay. You just bumped it.

958
00:54:58,546 --> 00:54:59,756
Ashley?

959
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:03,763
Ashley? Ashley? Ashley?

960
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:04,933
Ashley?

961
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,141
I feel sick.

962
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,267
Okay. Okay, well...

963
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,939
What about the, um...
What about the drone camera?

964
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,338
Can you send the drone camera up?

965
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,496
Can you look for him with that?

966
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,081
- Like you were looking for...
- Ashley, it crashed.

967
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,725
No! No! Don't tell me that!

968
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,146
This is hair.

969
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:21,945
This is hair.

970
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,413
My...

971
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:30,949
This is my hair.

972
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,037
Of course, it's your hair.
- She took my hair.

973
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,462
- You did this!
- Ashley, Ashley, no, no, no.

974
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,291
No, just shut up! Shut up, get away!

975
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,457
Don't!

976
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,296
Oh, my god!

977
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:46,804
God! Oh, my god!

978
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,604
No, don't look, don't look,
don't look!

979
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:56,145
I didn't mean it! Oh, my god!

980
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,395
Is she gonna be okay.

981
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,691
Ashley. Ashley, Ashley, Ashley,

982
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:03,145
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

983
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,832
Run like hell!

984
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,094
My god!

985
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,588
Oh, my god!

986
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,111
James!

987
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,242
Ashley!

988
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,247
James!

989
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,590
Lisa!

990
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,668
Lisa, I'm here!

991
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:07,549
James!

992
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,973
Lisa, here I am.
You okay? Are you all right?

993
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,966
Yeah. I'm all right.

994
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:16,892
Where's Ashley?

995
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,686
I... I don't... I don't know.

996
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,053
- I don't know, we got split up.
- We have to go find her.

997
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,067
- We have to backwards... backtrack.
- Okay.

998
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,741
All right,
stay close to me. Stay close.

999
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,489
Lisa!

1000
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:36,623
James!

1001
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,339
Peter!

1002
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,221
Okay.

1003
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,742
She couldn't have gone far, right?

1004
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,279
I don't know.

1005
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:36,116
Ashley!

1006
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,285
Holy shit.

1007
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:50,916
Ashley!

1008
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,641
Ashley!

1009
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,810
Okay, it's okay.
We'll find her.

1010
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,810
Hello?

1011
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,608
Ashley, is that you?

1012
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:12,282
<i>Com check.</i>

1013
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,530
That's Peter! He's okay.

1014
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:16,322
Peter? Is that you?

1015
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,202
<i>Help me.</i>

1016
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,912
Oh, god!

1017
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,958

01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:35,337
Hey, It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Lisa, come here.

1020
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,225
Look at me. It's okay.

1021
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:46,558
Don't look anywhere else.

1022
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,354
You're okay. You're okay.

1023
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,023
Let's keep goin'. Okay?

It's okay. Okay. Okay.

Just breathe. Just breathe.

1026
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,538
Real slow.

1027
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,383
It's okay.

1028
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,013
Okay, yeah.

1033
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,650

1034
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,146
Yeah, we gotta go.

1035
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,737
Okay. This way.

1036
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,576
Easy, slowly, slowly.

1037
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,450
What's that? What's that?

1038
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:47,787
Okay.

1039
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:49,872
All right, steady.

1040
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,287
Real slow.

1041
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,533
Oh, look the drone.

1042
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:21,781
Okay, okay, I can set that up.
I can set it up. Okay.

1043
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:24,906
Come on.

1044
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,923
Shit! Shit! Shit! It's stuck! Shit!

1045
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,469
Okay. I can, I can... Okay.

Ashley!

1051
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,781
Ashley!

1052
01:05:15,788 --> 01:05:18,418
It's okay. Keep goin'. It's all right.

1053
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:20,922
It's all right.

1054
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,797
Ashley!

1055
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:38,731
Is that her?

1056
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,481
Where's that coming from?

1057
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,897
This way! Come on!

1058
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,276
Ashley!

1059
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,701
Ashley!

1060
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,037
Ashley!

1061
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,501
Ashley!

1062
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:06,667
Oh, my god!

1063
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,915
We found it! This is it!

1064
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:17,642
Hey, come on!

1065
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:18,994
Don't touch me!
I don't wanna go in there.

1066
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:20,558
- I don't think we should go.
- Listen!

1067
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:22,904
James!

1068
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,610
- Heather!
- Stop!

1069
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,770
That's my sister!

1070
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,778
I don't know what happened
to your sister, James,

1071
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,860
but that's not her.
That can't be her.

1072
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,737
Let's go.

1073
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:32,952
No! No, I have to go in!

1074
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,122
Please!

1075
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,079
My sister's in that house!
I have to get her!

1076
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,240
James, please.

1077
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:38,448
- Lisa...
- Please.

1078
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:42,122
You know this is what I came here for.

1079
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,549
Please, James!

1080
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,217

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Hello?

1087
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,559
Peter! Peter!

1088
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,202
James!

1089
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,660
Heather! Heather!

1090
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,865
Heather!

1091
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,142
Heather!

1092
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,136
Heather!

1093
01:08:38,157 --> 01:08:39,447
Oh, god.

1094
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,336
Heather!

1095
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,916
Heather!

1096
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,295
Heather?

1097
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,526
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1098
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,294
Heather?

1099
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,042
Hello?

1100
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,536
Heather!

1101
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,211
Heather!

1102
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:38,506
Heather!

1103
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:43,387
Oh, fuck this!

1104
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:46,734
Oh, no!

1105
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,059
Come on!

1106
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:49,814
Come on!

1107
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,366
Ashley!

1108
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,406
James!

1109
01:10:25,848 --> 01:10:27,848
James!

1110
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:31,435
James!

1111
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,423
James?

1112
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:07,141
James?

1113
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:19,477
Hello?

1114
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:23,907
James?

1115
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:41,672
Lisa!

1116
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:43,257
Who is that?

1117
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:44,932
You look exactly how I remember.

1118
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,430
Oh, my god. Lane?

1119
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,031
Figures, she couldn't have let you go.

1120
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,178
She had to find people
who remembered.

1121
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,519
Rustin Parr understood.

1122
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:56,812
You have to do what she tells you!

1123
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,180
Please!

1124
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:35,686
Lane!

1125
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:38,899
Lane!

1126
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:57,418
Fuck!

1127
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:17,936
Okay. It's gotta lead outside.

1128
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,704
I don't wanna be here.

1129
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,012
Okay.

1130
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:20,639
Breathe. Breathe.

1131
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,977
You're not stuck.

1132
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:27,153
It's okay. Keep going.

1133
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,020
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1134
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:15,858
No. Fuck!

1135
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:23,123
No!

1136
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,135
No!

1137
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:32,476
No!

1138
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:08,889
- Lisa?
- James.

1139
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:13,404
Oh, my god.

1140
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:16,321
The attic. We're in the attic?

1141
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,110
Wait, wait!
She's right behind me.

1142
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,525
Oh, shit.

1143
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,295
What the fuck was that?

1144
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:36,958
Oh, god!

1145
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,585
What are we gonna do?

1146
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,260
The corner, get in the corner! Come on!

1147
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,350
James, what are you doing?

1148
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,351
Face the corner now! Come on!

1149
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:56,437
Don't turn around! Don't look!

1150
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:00,445
- James...
- Shh, shh! Quiet!

1151
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:09,328
Just keep your eyes closed.

1152
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,372
She only takes sacrifices.

1153
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:13,376
We can't look directly at her.

1154
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,378
She's in here.

1155
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,125
Shh!

1156
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:29,063
It's cold. So cold.

1157
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,600
Close your eyes.

1158
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,652
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1159
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,149
This is all my fault.

1160
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,253
Heather?

1161
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,924
What are you doing?

1162
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:04,014
Is that really you?

1163
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,854
Who are you talking to?

1164
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,028
James!

1165
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:42,046
James, where are you?

1166
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:07,533
If you don't look at her,
she can't hurt you.

1167
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:42,765
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1168
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:47,897
James?

REPORTER: I knew you'd find it.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Boy, I could sure use a drink.

8
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:12,924
I wonder if any big shots
are getting married today?

9
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,011
Looks like the same suckers
get married every day.

10
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,428
Come on.

11
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,641
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

(Slow instrumental music)

13
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:32,610
Now what's he hiding from?

14
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:39,116
- Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?
- Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic?

15
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,953
No, it's not him. But what a scoop it'd be!

16
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:46,624
The guy who wroteThe Bachelor's Bible
getting hooked. It's too good to be true.

17
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,168
Let's snap the mayor
in his new fire helmet and go.

18
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,294
Let's stick around, see who the guy is.

00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,473
Thank you. Yours?

24
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:08,394
- (Whispers) Mortimer Brewster.
- How's that?

25
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:09,938
Mortimer Brewster.

26
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:19,489
CLERK: Speak up, sonny.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

27
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,282
I want to keep this undercover.

28
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,702
Love her? Of course you love her.
You're marrying her, right?

29
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,620
You don't understand. Come here.

30
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,830
I don't want this to get out for a while.

31
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,166
I'm Mortimer Brewster.

32
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,292
You're who?

That's him!

REPORTER: Mr. Brewster!

37
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,811
Now, look--

38
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:58,275
MORTIMER: Goodbye, dear.

39
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,944
MORTIMER: Don't you understand?
How can I marry you?

40
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:04,323
Me, the symbol of bachelorhood.
I've sneered at every love scene.

41
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,742
I've written four million words
against marriage!

42
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:11,038
Not only hooked, but to a minister's
daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn.

43
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,791
Look at the way you look!
What is that contraption you've got there?

44
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,712
A pin I borrowed from your aunts.
You know, "Something borrowed-- "

45
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:21,756
I know, "Something borrowed,
something blue." Old, new.

46
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:24,384
Rice and old shoes.
Carry you over the threshold.

47
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,595
Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe.
Is this what I've come to?

48
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:30,514
I can't go through with it.
I won't marry you. That's that.

49
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:33,768
- Yes, Mortimer.
- What do you mean, "Yes, Mortimer"?

50
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,145
Aren't you insulted?
Aren't you going to cry?

51
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:39,273
- No, Mortimer.
- And don't "No, Mortimer" me, either!

52
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:41,400
Marriage is a superstition.

53
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:55,497
It's old-fashioned. It's...

54
00:04:55,498 --> 00:05:28,820
(The Wedding March continues)

55
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:31,490
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't realize...

56
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,618
...l'm turning over to you
the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn.

57
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:38,288
Now look at that old church.
And them old houses.

58
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,416
Did George Washington ever sleep here?

59
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:44,753
Of course he did. This whole neighborhood
just stinks with atmosphere.

60
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:47,964
- And look at that old house.
- The original owners still there?

61
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,675
BROPHY: Don't crack wise
about the Brewster sisters.

62
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:54,762
They're two of the dearest, sweetest
old ladies that ever walked the earth.

63
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,348
They're out of this world.

64
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,018
They're like pressed rose leaves.

65
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,896
Pressed rose leaves?

66
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,732
PAT: The old girls must be kind of hard up.

67
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,026
Their old man left them fixed for life.

68
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,278
Don't you call them "the girls," either.

69
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,030
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around?

70
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,990
So what are they renting rooms for?

71
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,326
They don't. But you can bet
if anybody came looking for a room...

72
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:22,956
...they wouldn't go away
without a good meal and a couple of bucks.

73
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,084
BROPHY: That's their way
of digging up people to do good to.

74
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:33,425
(Harpsichord music plays)

75
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,845
Reverend Harper, I do hope
you don't disapprove of Mortimer...

76
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:41,557
...because he's a dramatic critic
and takes your daughter to the theater.

77
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:44,310
It's not that I disapprove
of his being a critic...

78
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:49,815
...but no man with this published attitude...

79
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:53,151
...should take any man's daughter
anyplace, at any time.

80
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,737
(Loud sneeze)

81
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,531
I must be catching cold.

82
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:02,244
ABBY: No, dear. It was Reverend Harper
who sneezed. Bless you.

83
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,496
ABBY: We mustn't be angry with Mortimer.

84
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:08,958
He's so very much in love with her.
Sister Martha and I are so happy.

85
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,295
He used to come to see us
only occasionally, and now...

86
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:16,091
...he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

87
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:18,384
BROPHY: Remember now,
watch your language.

88
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:20,512
PAT: You know I'm not a swearing man.

89
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,597
BROPHY: You'd be surprised
what they'd consider swearing.

90

(Doorbell rings)

91
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:32,397
Will you excuse me?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

92
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:36,360
- Come right in, Mr. Brophy.
- Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

93
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:39,154
This is Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my beat.

94
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:42,324
PAT: How do you do, miss?
ABBY: Welcome to our neighborhood.

95
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,868
Gentlemen, what news
have you brought me?

96
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:49,664
Colonel, we have nothing to report.

97
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,834
No, absolutely nothing to report.

98
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,377
Splendid!

99
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,964
Thank you, gentlemen. At ease.

100
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:01,259
You know the Reverend Dr. Harper
from the church next door?

101
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,804
Hello. This is Officer O'Hara,
the new man on the beat.

102
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:10,684
PAT: How do you do, sir?
It's nice to meet you.

103
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:17,983
The toys are on the chair up here,
by the library door.

104
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:22,862
Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your
Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

105
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:26,032
They're all packed.

106
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,410
REV. HARPER: That's splendid work
you men do...

107
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,954
...fixing up discarded toys
for the kids at camp.

108
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:34,791
(Shouts) Charge!

(lndulgent laughter)

111
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:52,474
It gives us something to do at the station.
You get tired of playing cards.

112
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:55,519
BROPHY: So these are the toys?
ABBY: How's Mrs. Brophy?

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,438
She's better, thank you.
But a little weak, still.

114
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:01,274
I'll get some beef broth
for you to take to her.

115
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,236
Please don't bother.
You've done so much already.

116
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:07,448
ABBY: Stop the nonsense!
I won't be a minute.

117

(Cheery instrumental music)

118
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:16,998
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness
and absolute generosity are...

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,918
...it's because I've known
the Brewster sisters.

120
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,505
(Bugle blows)

121
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:27,550
BROPHY: Teddy, you promised me
you wouldn't do that anymore.

122
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,761
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting
to get those supplies.

123
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,388
BROPHY: Now don't do that again.
Do you hear me?

124
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,268
(Door slams, clock chimes)

125
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,269
BROPHY: He used to do that at night...

126
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,105
...and the neighbors raised Cain.
They're afraid of him.

127
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:46,318
Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn't swear,
but what the heck--

128
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,736
What's going on here?

129
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,530
- He's quite harmless.
- He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.

130
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:55,868
There's a lot of worse guys
he could think he was.

131
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,245
That's right.

132
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,789
I'll make a note.
He's an interesting character.

133
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,083
Isn't it a shame, Father...

134
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:07,714
Isn't it a shame, Reverend, that this nice
family should be hatching a cuckoo?

135
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:09,923
Well, now, isn't this nice!

136
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:13,052
BROPHY: Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
MARTHA: How do you do?

137
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,971
- Good afternoon.
- Reverend, how do you do?

138
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:18,808
Miss Martha, Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my duties.

139
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,059
How do you do?

140
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,604
MARTHA: I'm very glad to know you.
PAT: Thank you.

141
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:25,189
ABBY: Martha, you're back.

142
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,442
ABBY: Here's the broth.
Be sure it's good and hot.

143
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,944
BROPHY: You bet I will,
and thank you very much.

144
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,363
The Army and Navy are ready for action.

145
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:36,616
BROPHY: Colonel, this is grand.
It'll make a lot of kids happy.

146
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,869
What's this? The Oregon?

147
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,037
Teddy, dear, put it back.

148
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:44,082
TEDDY: But the Oregon goes to Australia.
ABBY: Now, Teddy...

149
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,792
No, it goes to Australia.

150
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:51,297
BROPHY: These are lovely. Thank you.
ABBY: Not at all.

151
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:54,675
BROPHY: The children will go crazy.
MARTHA: Don't mention it.

152
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,344
So long, Colonel.

153
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,054
Hey, Sarge.

154
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:02,140
Yes.

155
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,226
Dismissed!

156
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:07,187
BROPHY: Goodbye and thank you.
ABBY: Don't mention it.

157
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:14,360
ABBY: Careful of the step with the toys.
BROPHY: Good night.

158
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:21,034
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

159
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:25,955
Goodbye.

160
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:30,335
REV. HARPER: Well, I must be going.
TEDDY: (Shouts) Charge!

161
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:34,672
Charge the blockhouse!

162
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:39,010
(Clock chimes)

163
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,219
Blockhouse?

164
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:44,681
The stairs are always San Juan Hill.

165
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,016
Bless you!

166
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:48,519
Have you tried to persuade him
he wasn't Roosevelt?

167
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,314
- Oh, no!
- He's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

168
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,650
ABBY: Do you remember, Martha?

169
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:58,278
Once, a long time ago,
we thought if he'd be George Washington...

170
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,405
...it might be a change for him,
and we suggested it.

171
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,408
And do you know what happened?

172
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:07,870
He just stayed under his bed for days
and wouldn't be anybody.

173
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:11,624
Well, if he's happy, and what's
more important, you're happy...

174
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,502
MARTHA: Our only worry for Teddy
is after we're gone.

175
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:17,130
REV. HARPER: Yes, indeed.
That is quite a problem.

176
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:19,799
Mortimer's made all the arrangements
for Teddy...

177
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,843
...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium
after we pass on.

178
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:27,222
Splendid idea! A very pleasant place.

179
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:30,058
(Cheery instrumental music)

180
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,646
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

181
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:38,275
You know, Martha,
I do believe he's beginning to see the light.

182
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,276
I'm sure we needn't worry about him.

183
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:44,614
He won't interfere with our plans
for Mortimer and Elaine.

184
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:46,615
Did you just have tea?

185
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,410
Yes.

186
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,829
And dinner's going to be late, too.

187
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,330
So, why?

188
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:57,751
(Door slams)

189
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:59,670
ABBY: Good news for you.

190
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:03,840
You're going to Panama
and dig another lock for the canal.

191
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,926
Delighted!

192
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,178
That's bully! Just bully!

193
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:12,891
I shall prepare at once for the journey.

194
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,645
TEDDY: Charge!

195
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,146
(Door slams)

196
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:20,190
(Cheery instrumental music)

197
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,401
Abby! While I was out?

198
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,111
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you.

199
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:28,490
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and Reverend Harper was coming.

200
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,825
- But all by yourself.
- I got along fine.

201
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,662
- I'll run right downstairs and see.
- No, dear.

202
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:41,043
There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

203
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:44,838
Well?

204
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:54,056
Just look in the windowseat.

205
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:58,685
(Light instrumental music)

206
00:13:58,686 --> 00:13:59,686
(Knock on window)

207
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:05,025
MARTHA: It's Elaine!
ELAINE: Hello, darlings.

208
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,318
- But, Elaine!
- What did she mean?

209
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,280
You don't suppose they've gone and--

210
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,656
Elaine!

211
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:14,450
(The Wedding March plays)

212
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:15,535
Listen, buddy.

213
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:19,246
- This old cab has seen osculation but...
- You ain't seen anything yet.

214
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:22,417
- You've got to drive us to the station.
- Take her hat.

215
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,876
CAB DRIVER: Wait a minute.
And her brooch.

216
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:31,967
If you find her hairpins, keep them.
Hold on to that.

217
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,844
There they are.

218
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:36,054
Here's your hat.

219
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,723
Just throw it.
I don't like that look in your eyes.

220
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:43,186
- What's the matter with it?
- Father preached about it only last Sunday.

221
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:45,063
He did? What did he say?

222
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:48,942
- He was against it.
- But that was only Sunday.

223
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,611
(Light, playful instrumental music)

224
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,696
Please! For heaven's sake!

225
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:56,491
But, Mortimer, right out here
with everyone looking?

226
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:59,160
Yes, right out here with everyone looking.

227
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:02,412
Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

228
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:06,542
(Abby and Martha giggle)

229
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:11,505
(Mortimer grunts)

230
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:14,842
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me
for my mind, too?

231
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,552
One thing at a time.

232
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:20,388
ELAINE: There's that look again!

233
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,725
"There's that look again, Mortimer! "
You better get used to it.

234
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:28,437
You'll see it often. It goes just before this.

235
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,732
You know what we're doing?
Wasting time.

236
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,943
I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your...

237
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:36,571
No, don't tell your father.
You'll run his cold into a pneumonia.

238
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,781
I can handle Father. He's a dear.

239
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:42,117
Look, why don't we wire him
from Niagara Falls?

240
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,203
Niagara Falls?

241
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,330
That's why you stopped at your office.

242
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,916
Yes, certainly!
We're going to go the whole hog.

243
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,668
Niagara Falls!
Everybody ought to go there.

244
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,254
You should've seen my secretary's face.

245
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:57,341
We've a room on the train,
the bridal suite in the hotel...

246
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:01,427
...and tomorrow morning
we go over the falls in a barrel.

247
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,304
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

248
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:06,266
I don't have to.
I started packing the day after I met you.

249
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,267
MORTIMER: There, you see! You see?

250
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,230
That's what I mean.
That's what I hate about women.

251
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:14,816
(Slow instrumental music)

252
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:21,530
I wonder what Mary's doing now?

253
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,742
- The train leaves in an hour, hurry.
- It'll be a few minutes.

254
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:27,870
- Father may want to pray over me.
- Whistle when you're ready.

255
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:28,996
Elaine?

256
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:31,081
When you whistle, open the front door fast.

257
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:37,879
If you see a tall, dark streak of light,
it's me.

258
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,507
(Elaine whistles)

259
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,591
What? Now?

260
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,010
No, not now!

261
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:48,848
Look surprised when he tells us.

262
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,308
Hold on to your bustles.

263
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,685
We're married. Elaine and I are married.

264
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,729
ABBY: Oh, darling, how wonderful!

265
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,981
Isn't it wonderful? They're married!

266
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:01,152
Don't pretend to be so surprised either,
you two old frauds.

267
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,988
MORTIMER: Can I use the telephone?
ABBY: Of course.

268
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,282
Isn't it too, too wonderful?

269
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:09,577
And to think that it happened
right here in this room!

270
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,037
Now, here.

271
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:14,456
Benson's Florists?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

272
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:17,334
Did you send those roses
to Mrs. Brewster? Good.

273
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:20,879
Send four dozen more to drawing room A,
Grand Central Station.

274
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,923
Hurry. And throw in a flock
of orange blossoms.

275
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,551
But before you go,
we can have our celebration.

276
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,887
I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing.

277
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,805
And we'll invite a few neighbors in.

278
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:34,642
- And, of course, a wedding cake.
- You won't have time to bake a cake.

279
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:37,019
We're going to Niagara Falls.
A taxi's waiting.

280
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,522
It's all ready. It's been ready since--

281
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,191
I bet it's been ready
since the first day I met her.

282
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,943
Did everybody know
I was getting married, except me?

283
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:49,406
We knew you'd find out about it in time.

284
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,825
I've got the two nicest aunts in the world.

285
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:55,079
Of course, you've got
the nicest nephew in the world, too.

286
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,499
MARTHA: Well, I'll run along
and get everything ready.

287
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,501
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend
isn't too angry.

288
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,378
You know how your books upset him.

289
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:07,799
I'm going to burn all my books.
I'll let the Reverend light the first match.

290
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,134
Did I leave some notes here
for my new book?

291
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:12,845
You mean Mind Over Matrimony?

292
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:13,972
Where are they?

293
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:16,516
- I hid them someplace--
- Come along.

294
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:17,600
Now you behave.

295
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:24,774
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

296
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,985
Hello, Mortimer!

297
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:31,572
- How are you, Mr. President?
- Bully, thank you. Just bully.

298
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:35,200
- What news have you brought me?
- The country's squarely behind you.

299
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,620
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

300
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,789
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

301
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,833
MORTIMER: Goodbye, Mr. President.

302
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,460
A new lock for the canal, you know.

303
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:49,297
TEDDY: (Sings)
"Oh, tell the news to Mother"

304
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,091
- Oh, dear.
- Find those notes? What's wrong?

305
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:56,137
There's a baby picture
of your brother Jonathan.

306
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:00,350
MORTIMER: You ought to put that in
the fire with my books. My, what a face!

307
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,727
I remember now.
He'd scare grownups with it.

308
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:05,187
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me.

309
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:10,234
Do you remember how he used to cut
worms in two with his teeth?

310
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,988
Jonathan? He's probably in prison
or hanged or something by now.

311
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:17,658
MORTIMER: I saw a play, had a character
in it, reminded me of Jonathan.

312
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,285
Really?

313
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:23,413
MORTIMER: A honey of a lunatic. One of
those whodunits called Murder Will Out.

314
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,581
ABBY: Oh, dear!

315
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:27,750
Yeah, what a play.

316
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,838
When the curtain goes up,
the first thing you see is a dead body.

317
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:44,975
The next thing--

318
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:52,858
Hey, mister.

319
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,902
(Elaine whistles)

320
00:19:54,903 --> 00:20:06,413
(Mortimer tries to whistle, unsuccessfully)

321
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:17,757
(Abby hums cheerfully)

322
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:23,512
MARTHA: Happy bridegroom!
ABBY: Congratulations, darling!

323
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,848
Never mind that now.

324
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,517
Now, listen, darlings.

325
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,061
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha...

326
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,481
You know how we've always planned
to send Teddy to Happy Dale?

327
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,150
Yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

328
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,654
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper
about it.

329
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,115
Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now.
At once!

330
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:47,452
- He's in the cellar. Get him up here now.
- There's no such hurry as that.

331
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:52,123
When Teddy's working on the canal,
you can't get his mind on anything else.

332
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,875
Well, look, darlings.

333
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:57,504
I'm frightfully sorry,
but I've got an awful shock for you.

334
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:00,506
Teddy's killed a man, darlings!

335
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:01,757
Nonsense!

336
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:03,843
There's a body in the windowseat!

337
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:09,431
Yes, dear. We know.

338
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,809
- You know?
- Of course.

339
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,396
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

340
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:18,357
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it.

341
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:21,235
Forget you ever saw the gentleman.

342
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,277
Forget?

343
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:25,406
We never dreamed you'd peek.

344
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,782
What the...

345
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,117
Who is he?

346
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,912
He's a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins.

347
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:36,708
That's really all I know about him,
except that he's a Methodist.

348
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,168
He's a Methodist? lsn't that nice.

349
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:41,546
That's all you know?
What's he doing here?

350
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,131
- What happened to him?
- He died.

351
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,593
Aunt Martha, men just don't get
into windowseats and die.

352
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:50,763
No, dear. He died first.

353
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:53,766
Wait! Stop all this.

354
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,684
Now look, how did he die?

355
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:58,937
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive.

356
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:05,902
The gentleman died because he drank
some wine with poison in it.

357
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,197
How did the poison get in the wine?

358
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:10,824
We put it in wine
because it's less noticeable.

359
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:14,577
When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

360
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,913
You mean you...

361
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,457
You put it in the wine?

362
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,043
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat...

363
00:22:22,044 --> 00:22:27,507
...because Reverend Harper was coming.

364
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:31,135
Look at me, darling.

365
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:34,972
You knew what you'd done and didn't want
Reverend Harper to see the body?

366
00:22:34,974 --> 00:22:40,977
Well, not at tea.
That wouldn't have been very nice.

367
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,521
It's first-degree.

368
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:46,608
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it
and just forget about it.

369
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:54,366
I do think that Martha and I have the right
to our own little secrets.

370
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:58,119
Abby, while I was out I dropped in
on Mrs. Schultz. She's much better.

371
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,663
But she wants us to take Junior
to the movies again.

372
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,958
We must do that, tomorrow or next day.

373
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:06,294
Yes, but this time we'll go
where we want to go.

374
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:11,090
Junior's not going to drag me
into another one of those scary pictures.

375
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:16,804
ABBY: They ought not to be allowed
to make pictures just to frighten people.

376
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:35,197
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

377
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:36,782
Operator?

378
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,618
Can you hear my voice?

379
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,203
You can?

380
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:43,621
Are you sure?

381
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,291
Then I must be here.

382
00:23:46,292 --> 00:24:02,473
(Elaine whistles)

383
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:12,983
(Children squeal)

384
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,153
ABBY: The dears. Isn't Halloween
a wonderful time for them?

385
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,988
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

386
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,407
(Abby hums cheerfully)

387
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,909
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient.

388
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,454
- We'll let you lick the bowl.
- Lick the bowl?

389
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:28,123
I don't want to.
I want to know what we're going to do!

390
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,958
We're going to celebrate.

391
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,877
Celebrate? There's a body
in the windowseat!

392
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:35,088
ABBY: Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins.

393
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:38,340
I know what his name is. I want to know
what we're going to do.

394
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,133
We can't turn you over to the police.

395
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:41,968
MARTHA: Stop worrying about it.

396
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,054
We told you to forget the whole thing.

397
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:48,350
Forget? Can't I make you realize
that something has to be done?

398
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,477
Now, Mortimer, you behave.

399
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:54,314
You're too old
to be flying off the handle like this.

400
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,774
- But Mr. Hodgekiss--
- Hoskins, dear.

401
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:59,444
Whatever his name is,
you can't leave him in there.

402
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:01,112
We don't intend to, dear.

403
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:10,204
Teddy's down in the cellar now,
digging the lock.

404
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:12,749
You're going to bury
Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar?

405
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,460
Yes, dear.
That's what we did with the others.

406
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,589
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

407
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,093
MORTIMER: Others?
ABBY: The other gentlemen.

408
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:27,220
When you say "others,"
do you mean "others"?

409
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:29,974
- More than one "others"?
- Yes, dear.

410
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:33,226
Let me see now. This is 11, isn't it, Abby?

411
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,645
No, dear. This makes 12.

412
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:39,816
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
This one is only 11.

413
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:43,444
No, dear, because I remember
when Mr. Hoskins first came in...

414
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:48,366
...it occurred to me
that he'd make just an even dozen.

415
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:52,787
MARTHA: But, Abby, dear, I really don't
think you should count the first one.

416
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:56,374
ABBY: I was counting the first one,
and that makes it 12.

417
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,001
It does?

418
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:02,296
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is.

419
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:04,799
I get them mixed up sometimes.

420
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,055
Makes it 12.

421
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:13,306
(Phone rings)

422
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:17,685
Hello.

423
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:20,605
Whatever is the matter
with Mortimer today?

424
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:23,733
Why, Abby,
what do you think happened to him?

425
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,609
Hello?

426
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:30,907
(Whistling over the phone)

427
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:36,204
Not now. For heaven's sake,
keep your shirt on!

428
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:41,667
Elaine, I didn't mean--

429
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,669
Now, let's see. Where were we?

430
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,504
Twelve. Twelve!

431
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:46,839
MARTHA: Yes, dear.

432
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,550
Abby thinks we should count the first one.

433
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,927
Never mind about that. Just sit down.

434
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:54,137
Tell me, who was the first one?

435
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:56,932
Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist.

436
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,851
MARTHA: He was such a lonely,
old gentleman.

437
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,104
ABBY: All his kith and kin were dead.

438
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:04,397
We felt so sorry for him.

439
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:07,525
And then, when his heart attack came...

440
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:11,362
...and he sat there dead in that chair...

441
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,950
...looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha?

442
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:18,619
We made up our minds, then and there...

443
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:21,830
...that if we could help
other lonely, old men...

444
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,250
...to find that same peace...

445
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,586
...we would.

446
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:28,086
Why, you poor...

447
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:33,884
You mean, he dropped dead
right in this chair?

448
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,387
And then, you see,
Teddy came up from digging in Panama...

449
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:40,974
...and he thought Mr. Midgely
was a yellow-fever victim.

450
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:44,477
And that meant
he had to be buried immediately.

451
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:47,647
So, we all took him down to Panama...

452
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:52,026
...and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial.

453
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:56,614
MARTHA: There, now you see? That's why
we told you not to bother about it...

454
00:27:56,615 --> 00:28:02,661
...because we know exactly
what's to be done.

455
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:04,163
Wait a minute!

456
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:07,166
Come here, darling.
What about the others?

457
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:10,044
All 12 of them didn't walk in here
and drop dead.

458
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,837
No, dear. Of course not!

459
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:20,971
Well, so...

460
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:22,597
- (Whispers) Mortimer.
- What?

461
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:25,600
Do you remember those jars of poison
on the shelves...

462
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:28,061
...in Grandfather's laboratory
all these years?

463
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:31,064
You know your Aunt Martha's knack
for mixing things.

464
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:33,900
You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

465
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:37,320
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine...

466
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:40,114
...l take one teaspoonful of arsenic...

467
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:42,616
...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine.

468
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:48,497
And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

469
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,666
Should have quite a kick.

470
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,209
Yes.

471
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,629
As a matter of fact,
one of our gentlemen found time to say:

472
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,964
"How delicious! "

473
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:59,507
He did? Well, wasn't that nice of him?

474
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:02,677
Abby, we mustn't be standing here
gossiping all night.

475
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,346
We must get that cake frosted.

476
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:07,641
Don't worry about the cake.
I couldn't eat a thing.

477
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:11,686
You newlyweds! A sip of wine
will give you an appetite.

478
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:15,022
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of...
A sip of wine!

479
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:31,205
Wine!

480
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:36,502
(Cat meows)

481
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:40,839
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

482
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,135
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark.
Singing away, digging locks.

483
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:48,262
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim.

484
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:50,098
I can see the headlines now:

485
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,310
"Murder lncorporator Rides Again"
right across the front page.

486
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,271
Let me see...

487
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:59,691
Teddy! Of course.
Everybody knows he's crazy.

488
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:03,153
Let me see. Who can I call up?
Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell?

489
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:05,654
No, Winchell's no good.

490
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,072
Old Judge Cullman!

491
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:09,950
I wonder if I got his number.

492
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:12,119
What am I doing with tickets?

493
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:19,209
Information.

494
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,377
Information?

495
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:24,089
Get me the number of Judge Cullman
on North Shore Road, Brooklyn.

496
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,177
Yeah, would you call me back?

497
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:32,931
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if he wasn't there?

498
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:33,932
ELAINE: Hey, you!

499
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,808
(Mortimer yelps)

500
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,644
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

501
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,354
What are you doing here?

502
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,233
What am I doing here?
Didn't you hear me whistle?

503
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,026
Whistle? Oh, yes.

504
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:47,277
I heard you whistle.

505
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,029
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

506
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,615
- Run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

507
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,618
You know I always call you up
every day or two.

508
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,330
You and your gags! Where's your hat?
The bags are in the taxi.

509
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:01,332
- Come on!
- I'm so sorry. Something's happened.

510
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,126
What'd you do, lose your nerve?

511
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,796
Where's that look
I was going to see so often?

512
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,964
(Elaine whistles The Wedding March)

513
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,800
Stop! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

514
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,719
What's wrong? Look at your hair.

515
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,263
What color is it? Has it turned?

516
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:20,059
Darling, what's the matter?
What happened?

517
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,894
Those flowers are so beautiful.

518
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:24,898
If I could only tell you, Elaine.
You smell so nice.

519
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,107
(Phone rings)

520
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:27,483
You better go home!

521
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:30,987
- But, darling, we were married today.
- Go to bed, get some rest!

522
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:34,156
Rest?

523
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:36,825
Who? Judge Cullman?

524
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:41,163
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you
why I called you. It's about Teddy.

525
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:43,374
I've got to come over
and see you right away.

526
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,417
It won't wait until tomorrow, Judge.

527
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:48,795
It's very, very important.
We've got to do something immediately.

528
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:52,673
But it's a matter of life and... Elaine!

529
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:53,967
Will you get out of here?

530
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:56,928
What on earth is going on here?
I don't know where I stand!

531
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:59,848
- Anywhere, but don't stand there!
- But Niagara Falls!

532
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,600
- If it does, we'll let it!
- Wait a minute! Listen.

533
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,852
You can't marry me
and then throw me out!

534
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:12,985
I'm not throwing you out of the house!
Will you get out of here?

535
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:15,237
I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.

536
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:19,033
Judge, about Teddy, he's--

537
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:20,575
It's his bugle blowing.

538
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:25,080
The police want to throw him
into a state institution.

539
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,832
How do you like that?

540
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:36,883
- I read an ad here about a room to rent.
- Shut up!

541
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:40,845
If you sign the papers and Teddy commits
himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.

542
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:42,680
It's a wonderful place.

543
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:43,848
You will?

544
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:46,642
Fine! I'll be over
as soon as I've made another call.

545
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,686
(Doorbell rings)

546
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:55,234
Doorbell's ringing, dear.

547
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:57,195
ABBY: How do you do? Come in.

548
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:59,738
MR. GIBBS: I understand you've got
a room to rent.

549
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,699
ABBY: Do step in.

550
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,077
- Are you the lady of the house?
- Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

551
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:07,705
MORTIMER: Operator?
Give me long distance, please.

552
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:10,665
And this is my sister.
Another Miss Brewster.

553
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:14,210
MR. GIBBS: My name's Gibbs.
ABBY: Well, do sit down.

554
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,922
I'm sorry,
we're just setting the table for dinner.

555
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:22,552
Now, this would be
a nice comfortable chair.

556
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:26,597
Long distance? I want the Happy Dale
Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

557
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:30,809
ABBY: ls Brooklyn your home?
MR. GIBBS: I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

558
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:34,564
Are your family Brooklyn people?

559
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:38,150
- Haven't got any family.
- All alone in the world?

560
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,401
Yeah.

561
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:42,738
ABBY: Well, Martha...
MORTIMER: No, Happy Dale.

562
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,740
ABBY: Well, you've come
to just the right house.

563
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,951
ABBY: Do sit down.
MORTIMER: Dale.

564
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:50,579
MORTIMER: "D" Iike in "dig,"
when you dig a lock.

565
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,749
That's right.
"A " Iike in "arsenic. " Got that?

566
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,084
Is there always this much noise?

567
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:57,794
He doesn't live with us.

568
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:01,631
I can see the headlines now. Please.

569
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:04,634
I'd like to see the room.
I don't think I'll like it.

570
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:06,219
The room's upstairs.

571
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,764
Won't you try a glass of our wine
before we start up?

572
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,265
Never touch it.

573
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:17,145
Well, we make this ourselves.
It's elderberry wine.

574
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:20,983
Elderberry?

575
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:23,944
I haven't tasted elderberry wine
since I was a boy.

576
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,238
MR. GIBBS: Thank you.
MORTIMER: Operator!

577
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,866
I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry!
I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium!

578
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,785
Sanitarium! Sanitarium!
Yes, like a broken record!

579
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:38,291
- Have your own elderberry bushes?
- No, but the cemetery's full of them.

580
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,126
Well, skoal.

581
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,962
MORTIMER: Hello, operator!
What's taking so long?

582
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:45,631
It's only across the river!
I could swim it faster!

583
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,425
Yes!

584
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:49,343
Hello! Hell--

585
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:50,219
What--

586
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,804
What, they're busy?

587
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,430
Busy?

588
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:55,307
They're busy and you're dizzy!

589
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:58,602
No, I'm not drunk, madam,
but you've given me an idea!

590
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:03,732
(Banging)

591
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,692
Mortimer, no...no.

592
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:08,987
Darling, I'm nervous. Don't do that.

593
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:12,908
Not that.

594
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:19,915
MORTIMER: (Shrieks) No!

595
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:28,089
Get out of here! Do you want
to be poisoned, murdered, killed?

596
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,966
They're nuts!

597
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:39,558
CAB DRIVER: You're telling me!

598
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:49,568
Look, you can't do things like that!

599
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:54,322
Now I don't know
how I can explain this to you...

600
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:58,326
...but it's not only against the law,
it's wrong.

601
00:35:58,328 --> 00:36:00,328
ABBY: Oh, piffle!

602
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,081
It's not a nice thing to do.

603
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:09,128
People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand.

604
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,215
What I mean is...

605
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:15,677
This is developing into a very bad habit!

606
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:23,350
(Phone rings)

607
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:25,519
Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium?

608
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,897
That's amazing, operator.

609
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:30,607
Happy Dale?
Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please.

610
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:32,942
Mr. Witherspoon speaking.

611
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:37,030
How do you do, Mr. Brewster?
How are you?

612
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:41,201
Mr. Witherspoon, do you--
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

613
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:45,079
Do you remember our conversation about
committing my brother to Happy Dale?

614
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,166
You do? Well, we want
to commit him there immediately.

615
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,416
Oh, dear.

616
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,961
Oh, dear. That's too bad.

617
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,422
Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him
for some time yet.

618
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:58,592
We have several Theodore Roosevelts
at the moment...

619
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:02,262
...and it would lead to trouble.

620
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,390
Well, now, if he thought that--

621
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,310
Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short
of Napoleons at present.

622
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:12,731
Bonaparte. And if--

623
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,733
Oh, I see. Of course.

624
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:18,278
Well, if your mind is made up. Yes.

625
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,862
Have you had the papers drawn up?

626
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,324
No, but I'll do it now
and call you as soon as I have them.

627
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,410
Thank you, Mr.-- What?

628
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:28,705
All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon.

629
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,333
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear.

630
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:36,128
Now listen, I'm going to Judge Cullman's,
but I want you to promise me something.

631
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,047
MARTHA: Well, we'd have to know
what it was first.

632
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,175
I love you both very much.

633
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,636
You know I'd do anything for you,
don't you?

634
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:44,970
ABBY: Yes, dear.

635
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,639
I want you to do one thing for me,
like good girls.

636
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,391
ABBY: What do you want us to do?

637
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,894
Don't do anything.
I mean, don't do anything!

638
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,023
Don't let anyone in the house
and leave Mr. Whosit where he is.

639
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,901
Get off that thing. I can't talk to you...
I can't concentrate.

640
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,904
I wouldn't want anything
in the world to happen to you.

641
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,448
What on earth could happen to us?

642
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,907
Well, darling...

643
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:10,036
Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me,
won't you?

644
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,163
Where's my hat? There it is.

645
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,290
MARTHA: But, Mortimer.
MORTIMER: What?

646
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,877
We were planning to hold services
before dinner.

647
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,798
- Couldn't that wait until I get back?
- You could join us in the hymns!

648
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,718
Yes, darling, I'll sing with you,
I'll dance with you, anything.

649
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:28,971
Remember, don't let anybody in the house
until I get back.

650
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:30,431
You promise?

651
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,349
Good.

652
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,683
ABBY: Mortimer!

653
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:36,603
What?

654
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,605
Stop that. What is it?

655
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:40,857
Mr. Hoskins' hat!

656
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:45,653
(Mortimer yelps)

657
00:38:45,654 --> 00:38:49,365
CAB DRIVER: Do you still want me to wait?
MORTIMER: Yes! Call me a cab!

658
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:53,035
- Hey, cab! Here you are.
- Don't open it. I'll sit with you!

659
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:56,789
Yeah, that's right.
I can go faster that way. Sure.

660
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:03,337
Wait a minute! What am I doing?

661
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:07,549
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat
all mussed up.

662
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,094
Shame! Such a nice hat.

663
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:16,099
MARTHA: You know, Mortimer didn't seem
to be quite himself today.

664
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,893
No.

665
00:39:17,894 --> 00:39:27,110
Oh, well.

666
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:29,696
What were you saying about Mortimer?

667
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:32,865
I think I understand why
he seemed so upset.

668
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,284
Why?

669
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:37,328
He's just been married.

670
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:40,498
I believe that always makes
a man a little nervous.

671
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:44,960
Yes. The poor dears.

672
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:48,089
I'm so happy for Elaine.

673
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,256
MARTHA: Abby!

674
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:53,719
If Mortimer's coming back for the services,
we'll need another hymnal.

675
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,098
There's one up in my room.

676
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,143
I'll go, dear.

677
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:10,068
We promised Mortimer
we wouldn't let anyone come in.

678
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:12,654
It's two men,
and I've never seen them before.

679
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:15,364
ABBY: Are you sure?
MARTHA: Yes.

680
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:21,454
ABBY: Let me look.
MARTHA: You look.

681
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:27,459
- Do you recognize them?
- No, they're strangers to me.

682
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:32,756
We'll just have to pretend
we're not at home.

683
00:40:32,757 --> 00:41:01,492
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

684
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:07,165
JONATHAN: Come in, doctor.

685
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:10,375
This is the home of my youth.

686
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:14,879
As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape
from this house.

687
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:18,800
Now I'm glad to escape back into it.

688
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,720
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

689
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:27,559
The family must still live here.

690
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,521
I hope there's a fatted calf
awaiting the return of the prodigal.

691
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,731
DR. EINSTEIN: A fatted calf?.

692
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,150
Johnny, I'm so hungry.

693
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:39,153
Look, Johnny. Drink.

694
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:41,530
As if we were expected.

695
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:43,157
A good omen.

696
00:41:43,158 --> 00:41:45,242
Who are you?

697
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:48,787
What are you doing here?

698
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:53,083
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha.

699
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:55,044
It's Jonathan.

700
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,379
You get out of here!

701
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm Jonathan, you know.

702
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,716
Your nephew, Jonathan.

703
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:03,135
ABBY: No, you're not.

704
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:06,555
You're nothing like Jonathan,
so don't pretend you are.

705
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:08,265
You just get out of here.

706
00:42:08,266 --> 00:42:11,518
I see you're still wearing
the lovely garnet ring...

707
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,146
...that Grandma Brewster
bought in England.

708
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:18,024
And you, Aunt Martha,
still the high collar...

709
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:22,611
...to hide the scar
where Grandfather's acid burned you.

710
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:27,700
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

711
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:30,410
Have you been in an accident?

712
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:33,080
My face.

713
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,125
Dr. Einstein is responsible for that.

714
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:38,502
He's a plastic surgeon.

715
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:43,631
But I've seen that face before.

716
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:47,093
Do you remember when we took
the little Schultz boy to the movies...

717
00:42:47,094 --> 00:42:48,845
...and I was so frightened?

718
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:53,766
MARTHA: It was that face.

719
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:55,936
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy.

720
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:59,356
Don't worry. The last five years,
I give him three different faces.

721
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,899
I give him another one right away.

722
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,611
That last face. I saw that picture, too...

723
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:10,116
...just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

724
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:13,201
JONATHAN: You see, doctor,
what you've done to me?

725
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:16,455
- Even my own family think I'm--
- Johnny, Johnny!

726
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:20,667
You are home in this lovely house.

727
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,461
You know...

728
00:43:23,462 --> 00:43:26,340
...how many times he tells me...

729
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:30,010
...about Brooklyn, about this house
and about his aunts...

730
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:31,970
...he loves so much?

731
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:33,263
They know you.

732
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:38,017
DR. EINSTEIN: Please tell him so.

733
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,061
Jonathan...

734
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:41,896
...it's been a long time.

735
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:47,985
JONATHAN: Bless you.
It's good to be home again.

736
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:50,071
Well, Martha...

737
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:54,575
We mustn't let what's on the stove
boil over.

738
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:57,494
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan.

739
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:03,292
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.

740
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:19,265
(Slow foreboding instrumental music)

741
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,517
Well, Johnny...

742
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:24,270
Where do we go from here?

743
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:27,482
You know, we got to think fast.

744
00:44:27,483 --> 00:44:32,236
The police got pictures of that face.
I got to operate on you right away.

745
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:35,572
We got to find someplace.

746
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:39,367
We got to find someplace
for Mr. Spenalzo, too.

747
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:41,870
Don't waste any worry on that rat.

748
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:45,373
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

749
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,418
JONATHAN: Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

750
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:51,379
But, Johnny, we can't leave
a dead body in the rumble seat.

751
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,297
You shouldn't have killed him.

752
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:59,804
Just because he knows something
about us, what happens?

753
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:06,060
We come to him for help
and he tries to shake us down.

754
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:13,275
Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff.

755
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:15,111
That's your work, doctor.

756
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,737
You did that to me.

757
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:18,781
Please, Johnny, take it easy.

758
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,243
We'll find some place
and I'll fix you up right away.

759
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:25,162
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

760
00:45:25,163 --> 00:45:28,707
JONATHAN: This time, I want the face
of an absolute nonentity.

761
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,043
Yes. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

762
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:35,588
You see, I'm going to take this piece here
and lift it up--

763
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,841
Be careful about the stitches this time.

764
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:39,676
You leave that up to me.

765
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:41,344
I'll give you nice ears and--

766
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:44,305
- You were careless last time.
- And new stitches.

767
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:47,767
And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt.
That's my specialty.

768
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:51,312
- I take it together like this--
- Leave the eyes alone.

769
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,230
Leave the nose alone.

770
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:55,274
Poor Teddy.

771
00:45:55,275 --> 00:46:00,028
I imagine it's for the best.

772
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:03,657
"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do-- "

773
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:06,368
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me.

774
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:08,119
Right there.

775
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,165
Sometimes I think,
with the world in its present chaotic state--

776
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:16,544
Yes, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale.
I sign here as next of kin, don't l?

777
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:20,298
Only last week I created a mild sensation...

778
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:23,468
...at the Bar Association, when I said--

779
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:25,679
Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

780
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,933
JUDGE: Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over
this week. I've been feeling rather lonely.

781
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:32,977
No! Never tell them
you've been lonely. Never!

782
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:36,272
JUDGE: Why, I don't--
MORTIMER: Judge!

783
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,816
Tell me, are you a drinking man?

784
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:41,735
Why, no. I never indulge.

785
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:43,820
Good! Then you'll live longer.

786
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:46,114
JUDGE: Of course a little wine now--

787
00:46:46,115 --> 00:46:51,119
(Shouts) No! For heaven's sake, no wine!

788
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,915
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

789
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:59,794
ABBY: Well, I'm sure you both want to get
to wherever you're going.

790
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:04,340
My dear, sweet aunties,
I'm so full of your delicious dinner...

791
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:08,219
- ...l'm unable to move a muscle.
- Yes, it's nice here.

792
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:12,139
I found it!

793
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,769
Gentlemen, be seated.

794
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,064
Here it is, gentlemen.
The story of my life, my biography.

795
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:23,359
Here's the picture I was telling you about.
Here we both are.

796
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,236
President Roosevelt and General Goethals
at Culebra Cut.

797
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:29,531
TEDDY: That's me, General, and that's you.

798
00:47:29,532 --> 00:47:32,367
My, how I've changed!

799
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:36,829
That picture hasn't been taken yet.
We haven't started work on Culebra Cut.

800
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,456
We're still digging locks.

801
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:42,460
And now, General, we will both go
to Panama and inspect the new lock.

802
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,712
ABBY: No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

803
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:48,841
Maybe some other time, Mr. President.
Panama is a long ways off.

804
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:52,261
- Nonsense! It's just down in the cellar.
- The cellar?

805
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:56,307
We let him dig the Panama Canal
in the cellar.

806
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,600
- General Goethals?
- Yes, sir.

807
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,770
As President of the US, Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy...

808
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:03,897
...and the man who gave you this job...

809
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:07,693
...l demand that you accompany me
on the inspection of the new lock.

810
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:10,612
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

811
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:14,115
I beg your pardon. Who are you?

812
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:18,411
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

813
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:22,457
No, you're not Wilson.
But your face is familiar.

814
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:26,711
You're not anyone I know now.
Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa.

815
00:48:26,712 --> 00:48:30,173
You look like someone
I might meet in the jungle.

816
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:33,676
ABBY: I think, perhaps,
you had better go to bed, Teddy.

817
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,305
He and his friend want to get back
to their hotel.

818
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:40,307
General Goethals, inspect the canal.

819
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:43,018
All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama.

820
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:49,358
Bully, bully! Follow me, General.

821
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,738
It's down south, you know.

822
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:59,743
Well, bon voyage!

823
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:01,453
Aunt Abby...

824
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:04,789
I must correct your misapprehension.

825
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,875
You talked of our hotel.

826
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:10,878
We have no hotel. We came here directly.

827
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:15,383
This is not your home,
and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

828
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:19,595
(Dramatic instrumental music)

829
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:23,932
Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep.

830
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:28,020
You remember that, as a boy,
I could be disagreeable.

831
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:31,481
It would not be pleasant for any of us if...

832
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,943
I don't have to go into details, do l?

833
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:37,946
Perhaps we'd better let them
stay here tonight.

834
00:49:37,947 --> 00:49:39,489
Hey, Johnny...

835
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,366
Come here. Quick.

836
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:42,992
JONATHAN: I forgot to tell you...

837
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:47,121
...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather's
laboratory into an operating room.

838
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:53,335
We expect to be very busy.

839
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:56,046
- Down here, what do you think I find?
- What?

840
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:58,632
The Panama Canal.

841
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,552
And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo.

842
00:50:01,553 --> 00:50:05,222
See the hole he's digging.
Four feet wide, six feet long.

843
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:06,766
He just fits!

844
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:10,602
You'd think he knew
we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along.

845
00:50:10,603 --> 00:50:12,687
That's hospitality.

846
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:14,731
Rather a good joke on my aunts.

847
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:20,904
They're living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar.

848
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:23,114
How do we get him in here?

849
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:27,326
Yes, we can't just walk
Mr. Spenalzo in through the door.

850
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:32,081
We'll get the car and after they're in bed,
we'll bring him in through the window.

851
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:35,626
Bed.

852
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:39,130
We're moving the car behind the house.
You'd better get to bed.

853
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:41,924
ABBY: The car is all right where it is
until morning.

854
00:50:41,925 --> 00:50:50,766
I don't want to leave it in the street.
That might be against the law.

855
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:51,892
Abby?

856
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:53,977
What are we going to do?

857
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:58,273
We're not going to let them spend
more than one night in this house.

858
00:50:58,274 --> 00:51:00,191
What would the neighbors think?

859
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:04,779
People coming in here with one face
and going out with another.

860
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,907
What are we going to do
about Mr. Hoskins?

861
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:09,951
Mr. Hoskins!

862
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:13,162
ABBY: It can't be very comfortable
for him in there.

863
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:17,959
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.

864
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,088
I think Teddy had better take
Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away.

865
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:29,261
General Goethals was very pleased.
He said the canal was just the right size.

866
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:33,140
Teddy, there's been
another yellow-fever victim.

867
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:37,519
Dear me!
This will be a shock to the General.

868
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,522
ABBY: No, we must keep it a secret.

869
00:51:40,523 --> 00:51:41,940
Yes.

870
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:43,317
A state secret?

871
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:45,443
Yes, a state secret.

872
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:47,320
Promise?

873
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:50,198
You have the word of the President
of the United States.

874
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,578
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see.

875
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:57,205
How are we going to keep it a secret?

876
00:51:57,206 --> 00:52:00,958
Teddy, I think you'd better get back down
into the cellar.

877
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:02,292
And then...

878
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:06,380
...when I turn out the lights,
when everything's dark here...

879
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,300
...you come up and take
the poor man down to the canal.

880
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:10,676
Now get along.

881
00:52:10,677 --> 00:52:14,722
MARTHA: And we'll come down later
and hold services.

882
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:17,724
TEDDY: Where is the poor devil?
MARTHA: ln the windowseat.

883
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,267
It seems to be spreading.

884
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:25,899
We've never had yellow fever there before.

885
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,068
I've never even seen Mr. Hoskins!

886
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:33,489
My goodness! That's right, you were out.

887
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:37,868
You just come right along
and see him now.

888
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:44,833
You know, he's really very nice looking,
considering that he's a Methodist.

889
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:51,215
(Abby and Martha scream)

890
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:59,473
(Threatening instrumental music)

891
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:08,482
We're bringing the luggage through here.

892
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:13,111
ABBY: Your room is waiting for you.
You can go right up.

893
00:53:13,112 --> 00:53:17,282
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours.
You two run along to bed.

894
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:20,618
But you must be very tired. Both of you.

895
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:25,039
- And we don't go to bed this early.
- It's time I came home to take care of you.

896
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,291
Take the bags upstairs.

897
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:30,336
For the instruments, I'll come back later.

898
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:32,213
Good night.

899
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:33,798
Now, we'll all go to bed.

900
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:38,385
I'll wait until you're up
and then turn out the lights.

901
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:41,680
JONATHAN: Run along, Aunt Martha.

902
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:51,606
Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

903
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,358
- All right, Aunt Abby.
- I'll be right up.

904
00:53:54,359 --> 00:54:03,993
Now! Turn out the lights.

905
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:28,474
(Dramatic instrumental music)

906
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:33,396
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby.

907
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:37,567
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

908
00:54:37,568 --> 00:55:03,634
(Footsteps)

909
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:26,990
(Windowseat hinges creak)

910
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:33,454
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

911
00:55:33,455 --> 00:56:20,582
(Cat yowls)

912
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:35,263
(Tumbling and crashing noises)

913
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:45,856
DR. EINSTEIN: He's all right, Johnny.

914
00:56:45,857 --> 00:56:49,360
JONATHAN: I'll open the window.
You go round and hand him through.

915
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:53,281
But he's too heavy for me.

916
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:57,034
DR. EINSTEIN: You go outside and push,
and I'll stay here and pull.

917
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:59,996
And then together we take him
down to Panama.

918
00:56:59,997 --> 00:57:04,333
JONATHAN: All right. We must be quick.
I'll take a look around outside the house.

919
00:57:04,334 --> 00:57:07,002
When I tap on the glass,
you open the window.

920
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:16,011
DR. EINSTEIN: Yeah.

921
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:19,556
DR. EINSTEIN: It's dark in here.

922
00:57:19,557 --> 00:57:21,599
(Crashing)

923
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,768
(Dr. Einstein whimpers)

924
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:31,191
(Windowseat hinges creak)

925
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,444
Where am l?

926
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:35,821
Here I am.

927
00:57:35,823 --> 00:57:38,198
Who left this open?

928
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:43,787
(Tap on window)

929
00:57:43,788 --> 00:57:47,082
DR. EINSTEIN: Okay, wait a minute.
Hand him over.

930
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:51,211
Now I have him. Allez, up!

931
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:57,759
Now, wait a minute, Johnny.
You lost a leg somewhere.

932
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,844
Help me. He's so heavy.

933
00:57:59,845 --> 00:58:04,098
Now I have him. Now I got him.

934
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:08,477
JONATHAN: Be careful.
DR. EINSTEIN: But his shoe came off.

935
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:11,606
Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.

936
00:58:11,607 --> 00:58:13,942
Now I've got him!

937
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:15,484
(Knock on door)

938
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:18,946
DR. EINSTEIN: Johnny,
somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.

939
00:58:18,947 --> 00:58:22,574
I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick!

940
00:58:22,575 --> 00:58:27,997
(Knock on door)

941
00:58:27,998 --> 00:58:32,000
(Creaking)

942
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:35,796
(The Wedding March plays
with an eerie nuance)

943
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:41,717
ELAINE: Mortimer!

944
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,804
Aunt Abby!

945
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:49,267
Aunt Martha!

946
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:51,436
(Door closes)

947
00:58:51,437 --> 00:58:52,603
Who is it?

948
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:54,147
Is that you, Teddy?

949
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:55,481
JONATHAN: Who are you?

950
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:57,858
ELAINE: I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

951
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:59,652
JONATHAN: What are you doing here?

952
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:02,154
ELAINE: I came here
to see my husband, Mortimer.

953
00:59:02,155 --> 00:59:04,490
JONATHAN: Why did you say
your name was Harper?

954
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:06,783
ELAINE: It is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster.

955
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:09,369
I'm not very used to it.
I'm a brand-new Brewster.

956
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,663
JONATHAN: Doctor!

957
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:22,799
It's all right. It's okay.

958
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,885
ELAINE: Maybe you'd better explain
what you're doing here.

959
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:28,221
JONATHAN: We happen to live here.

960
00:59:28,222 --> 00:59:29,848
ELAINE: You don't live here.

961
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:32,642
I'm in this house every day,
I've never seen you before.

962
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:36,979
Where are Martha and Abby?
What have you done to them?

963
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,898
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves.

964
00:59:39,899 --> 00:59:42,985
May I present Dr. Einstein?

965
00:59:42,986 --> 00:59:45,195
Dr. Einstein?

966
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:50,075
JONATHAN: A surgeon of great distinction.

967
00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:52,994
And something of a magician.

968
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:59,208
- I suppose you'll tell me you're Boris--
- I am Jonathan Brewster.

969
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,878
- You're Jonathan.
- You've heard of me?

970
01:00:01,879 --> 01:00:05,006
- Yes, they talk about you.
- What do they say about me?

971
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:09,218
Just that there's another brother
named Jonathan, that's all.

972
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:12,555
That explains everything.
Now that I know who you are...

973
01:00:12,556 --> 01:00:29,113
...l'll just be running along
if you'll kindly unlock the door.

974
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:32,866
"That explains everything."
Just what do you mean by that?

975
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:35,577
Why do you come here
at this time of night?

976
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,998
I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.
I suppose it was you.

977
01:00:39,999 --> 01:00:42,667
(Dramatic instrumental music)

978
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:45,462
You thought you saw someone drive up?

979
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:48,423
Yes. Weren't you just outside?
lsn't that your car?

980
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:51,133
JONATHAN: You saw someone at the car?
ELAINE: Yes.

981
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:54,428
JONATHAN: What else did you see?
ELAINE: Just that, that's all!

982
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,056
JONATHAN: I see.
Is that why you came over here?

983
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:00,768
No, I came to see Mortimer.
But if he's not home, I'll run--

984
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:02,895
- You've given two names.
- You're hurting me!

985
01:01:02,896 --> 01:01:05,188
I think she's dangerous.

986
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:10,360
No visitors. It's going to be
a private funeral.

987
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:11,570
ELAINE: Teddy!

988
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:15,448
- Tell these men who I am!
- That's my daughter, Alice.

989
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,659
No!

990
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,579
Don't be a tomboy.
Don't play rough with the gentlemen.

991
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:25,958
Charge!

992
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,880
(Dramatic instrumental music)

993
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:34,259
JONATHAN: Doctor, the cellar.

994
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,803
ELAINE: (Yells) Let go of me!

995
01:01:36,804 --> 01:01:39,639
Let go of me!

996
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,811
MARTHA: What's the matter?
What's happening down there?

997
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:48,813
ABBY: What's the matter?
What are you doing there?

998
01:01:48,815 --> 01:01:52,443
JONATHAN: We caught a burglar,
a sneak thief. Go back to your room.

999
01:01:52,444 --> 01:01:54,361
ABBY: We'll call the police.

1000
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:56,947
JONATHAN: I'll handle this.
Go back to your room.

1001
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:58,323
Do you hear me?

1002
01:01:58,324 --> 01:02:01,034
(Knock on door)

1003
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:03,619
JONATHAN: Don't answer that.

1004
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,204
Don't answer that!

1005
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:09,835
ELAINE: (Screams) Miss Abby!

1006
01:02:09,836 --> 01:02:18,593
(Doorbell rings insistently)

1007
01:02:18,594 --> 01:02:22,638
Where's Teddy? ls he upstairs?
Never mind that now, darling.

1008
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,933
What are you doing
with your best clothes on?

1009
01:02:25,934 --> 01:02:30,270
Holy... What's that?

1010
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:33,023
What's that thing that looks like
a cigar-store dummy?

1011
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:37,736
- It's your brother and Dr. Einstein.
- Didn't I tell you not to let anybody in?

1012
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:41,115
- Who did you say it was?
- It's your brother, Jonathan!

1013
01:02:41,116 --> 01:02:45,994
(Overlapping conversation)

1014
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,330
JONATHAN: I've come back home.
MORTIMER: What?

1015
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,332
I've come back home, Mortimer.

1016
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:55,628
"I've come back home, Mortimer."
Listen, it talks!

1017
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:58,172
Yes, I talk.

1018
01:02:58,173 --> 01:03:02,927
Mortimer, have you forgotten
the things I used to do to you...

1019
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:05,179
...when you were tied to the bedpost?

1020
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,933
The needles under your fingernails.

1021
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:18,984
- Mortimer, he--
- Wait a minute.

1022
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:20,860
Holy mackerel!

1023
01:03:20,861 --> 01:03:22,029
It is Jonathan!

1024
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,574
JONATHAN: I'm glad you remember,
Mortimer.

1025
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:27,492
Yeah, I remember.

1026
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:29,660
How could I forget you?

1027
01:03:29,661 --> 01:03:32,705
Where'd you get that face? Hollywood?

1028
01:03:32,706 --> 01:03:37,251
Don't you two boys start quarreling
the minute you've seen each other.

1029
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:41,131
We invited Jonathan
and Dr. Einstein to stay.

1030
01:03:41,132 --> 01:03:43,340
- What?
- Just for tonight.

1031
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,425
No, I'm staying here tonight.

1032
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:48,179
- In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
- What about me?

1033
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,305
There's no room for anybody else here.

1034
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:51,849
Please, just a moment.

1035
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,435
So take that little squirt and beat it!

1036
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:58,396
Where's Teddy?
I've got to see him right away.

1037
01:03:58,397 --> 01:04:00,441
DR. EINSTEIN: We don't take up
much room.

1038
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:03,651
Johnny can sleep on the sofa,
and I'll sleep on the windowseat.

1039
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,278
Nothing to...

1040
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:07,489
Windowseat?

1041
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,157
Certainly not on the windowseat.

1042
01:04:09,158 --> 01:04:11,868
I'm going to sleep on the windowseat.

1043
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:13,911
I'll sleep on the windowseat from now on.

1044
01:04:13,912 --> 01:04:15,956
Mortimer!

1045
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:17,999
Now look.

1046
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,584
Now, be a good fellow.

1047
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:25,047
Here's $10. Go out
and haunt yourself a hotel.

1048
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:30,011
Mortimer, you know what I do
to people who order me around.

1049
01:04:30,012 --> 01:04:32,513
Johnny...

1050
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:34,180
Mr. Spenalzo.

1051
01:04:34,182 --> 01:04:35,349
JONATHAN: What?

1052
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:39,895
DR. EINSTEIN: What's going to happen
to Mr. Spenalzo?

1053
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:48,361
We can't leave him here
in the windowseat.

1054
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:52,031
Doctor, I've completely lost track
of Mr. Spenalzo.

1055
01:04:52,032 --> 01:04:54,701
MORTIMER: Wait!
Who's this Mr. Spenalzo?

1056
01:04:54,702 --> 01:04:57,203
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

1057
01:04:57,204 --> 01:04:59,872
Don't bring anyone else in here.
Now, beat it!

1058
01:04:59,873 --> 01:05:01,374
It's all right, Johnny.

1059
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:10,549
While we are packing,
I'll tell you about him.

1060
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:14,470
I'll take care of you, Mortimer,
in just a little while.

1061
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:16,305
MORTIMER: How do you like that?

1062
01:05:16,306 --> 01:05:19,808
The guy stays away for 20 years
and picks tonight to come back.

1063
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:21,935
Elaine, what are you doing here?

1064
01:05:21,936 --> 01:05:24,312
- Mortimer!
- What's the matter, darling?

1065
01:05:24,313 --> 01:05:28,442
- I almost got killed.
- Killed?

1066
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:31,361
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha!

1067
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,488
No! It was Jonathan!

1068
01:05:33,489 --> 01:05:35,698
He mistook her for a sneak thief.

1069
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,201
MORTIMER: Oh, that.
ELAINE: It was worse than that.

1070
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:39,619
He's some kind of a maniac.

1071
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,745
I'm afraid of him.

1072
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:44,082
MORTIMER: Darling, don't worry about it.
I'm here now. Forget it.

1073
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:47,460
ELAINE: We were married today,
we were going over Niagara Falls...

1074
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:51,172
...your brother tries to strangle me,
a taxi's waiting...

1075
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:53,549
...and now you want to sleep
on a windowseat!

1076
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,717
Windowseat. Witherspoon.

1077
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,845
- You'd better run along home.
- What?

1078
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:00,764
Go on home like a good girl.
I got things to do.

1079
01:06:00,765 --> 01:06:02,391
ELAINE: But--
MORTIMER: Please.

1080
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:05,310
Operator?
Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

1081
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,896
But didn't you hear what I was just saying?

1082
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,191
Your own brother Jonathan,
he was trying to strangle me!

1083
01:06:11,192 --> 01:06:14,276
- Please! This is important!
- That?

1084
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,612
Mr. Witherspoon?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

1085
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:19,282
Yes, Mr. Brewster.

1086
01:06:19,283 --> 01:06:21,158
Well, I don't understand you.

1087
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:24,829
ELAINE: He was going to kill me!
MORTIMER: Wait, I can't hear the man.

1088
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:27,164
Well, look.
I've got the papers all drawn up.

1089
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:31,836
I know it's late, but come down here
and get my brother immediately!

1090
01:06:31,837 --> 01:06:33,003
Please, darling.

1091
01:06:33,004 --> 01:06:37,091
By the way, you've had the papers signed
by your brother and the doctor, of course?

1092
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:38,425
By the doctor?

1093
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:41,470
Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor!

1094
01:06:41,471 --> 01:06:43,388
ELAINE: (Cries) Mortimer!

1095
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:46,725
Please, be quiet! Can't you see
I've got to get a doctor?

1096
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:48,935
What kind of a doctor? A family doctor?

1097
01:06:48,936 --> 01:06:52,522
You can take your honeymoon,
wedding ring, taxi, windowseat...

1098
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:55,608
...put them in a barrel,
and push them all over Niagara Falls!

1099
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:57,443
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

1100
01:06:57,444 --> 01:06:59,654
Why don't you come down here anyway?

1101
01:06:59,655 --> 01:07:03,241
While you're getting here,
I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures.

1102
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:04,283
(Door slams)

1103
01:07:04,284 --> 01:07:05,367
Elaine!

1104
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:08,413
I'll get both signatures.
Yeah, well, come right away.

1105
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:12,792
Elaine! What's the matter with her?

1106
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:21,216
Elaine! Elaine!

1107
01:07:21,217 --> 01:07:25,387
Let me sit down.
Let me think about this thing.

1108
01:07:25,388 --> 01:07:29,057
Doctor, Teddy, signature...

1109
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:48,909
Hoskins!

1110
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:52,496
Ye gods! There's another one!

1111
01:07:52,497 --> 01:07:53,998
Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha!

1112
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:56,292
MORTIMER: Come in here!
ABBY: We're busy.

1113
01:07:56,293 --> 01:08:00,337
No, you come in here now!

1114
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:03,090
Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine?

1115
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:05,467
Didn't you promise not to let anyone in?

1116
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:07,886
- Jonathan just walked in.
- I don't mean Jonathan!

1117
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:11,056
I don't mean Dr. Einstein!
Who is that in the windowseat?

1118
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:12,891
We told you. Mr. Hoskins.

1119
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:16,102
It is not Mr. Hoskins!

1120
01:08:16,103 --> 01:08:19,272
There!

1121
01:08:19,273 --> 01:08:23,193
Who can that be?

1122
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:26,946
- Are you saying you've never seen him?
- I certainly am.

1123
01:08:26,947 --> 01:08:28,739
This is a fine how-do-you-do!

1124
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,325
It's getting so anyone thinks
he can walk in!

1125
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:35,454
Don't you try to get out of this!
That's another one of your gentlemen!

1126
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:38,082
How can you say such a thing?

1127
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:41,209
That man's an impostor.

1128
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:46,757
And if he came here to be buried
in our cellar, he's mistaken.

1129
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:49,426
You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat.

1130
01:08:49,427 --> 01:08:50,344
Yes, I did.

1131
01:08:50,345 --> 01:08:53,263
This man couldn't have got the idea
from Mr. Hoskins!

1132
01:08:53,264 --> 01:08:56,974
- By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins?
- He must have gone to Panama.

1133
01:08:56,975 --> 01:08:58,852
- What? You buried him?
- Not yet.

1134
01:08:58,853 --> 01:09:01,938
He's down there
waiting for the services, poor dear.

1135
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:07,569
We haven't had a minute,
what with Jonathan in the house.

1136
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:08,653
Oh, dear.

1137
01:09:08,654 --> 01:09:12,489
We've always wanted
to hold a double funeral.

1138
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:17,328
But I will not read services
over a total stranger!

1139
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:20,330
A total stranger. How can I believe you?

1140
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:23,334
There are 12 men down there,
you admit you poisoned them!

1141
01:09:23,335 --> 01:09:28,004
Yes, I did. But you don't think
I'd stoop to telling a fib!

1142
01:09:28,005 --> 01:09:29,130
ABBY: Martha!

1143
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,424
What do you think has happened?

1144
01:09:31,425 --> 01:09:48,816
"A fib! "

1145
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:53,320
This may interest you, Mortimer.
I've decided that we're staying.

1146
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:57,992
And I've also decided that you're leaving,
and I mean now.

1147
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,161
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood
to debate the question.

1148
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:04,456
Are you getting out,
or am I throwing you out on your ear?

1149
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:07,585
I've led a strange life.

1150
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:09,503
Martha, you come straight along here.

1151
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:14,340
You just look and see
what's in that windowseat.

1152
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:37,446
No. Don't...

1153
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:39,156
Jonathan...

1154
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:45,955
Let Aunt Martha see
what's in the windowseat.

1155
01:10:45,956 --> 01:10:49,249
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

1156
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:54,045
I've got some very good news for you.
Jonathan is leaving.

1157
01:10:54,046 --> 01:11:03,555
And he's taking Dr. Einstein
and that cold companion with him.

1158
01:11:03,556 --> 01:11:06,640
Listen. You're my brother,
you're a Brewster.

1159
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:10,102
I'll give you a chance to get away
and take the evidence with you.

1160
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:13,397
You can't ask for more than that.

1161
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:17,109
Well?

1162
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:22,490
All right, in that case,
I'll have to call the police.

1163
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:24,575
Don't reach for the telephone.

1164
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:28,662
JONATHAN: Remember, what happened
to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

1165
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:30,206
Spenalzo?

1166
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:33,333
I knew he was a foreigner.

1167
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:35,376
Put down that telephone.

1168
01:11:35,377 --> 01:11:44,219
(Doorbell rings)

1169
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,553
ABBY: Officer O'Hara!

1170
01:11:45,554 --> 01:11:48,515
I saw the lights and thought
you might have sickness...

1171
01:11:48,516 --> 01:11:50,516
You got company? Sorry I disturbed you.

1172
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:53,061
- No! Come in.
- Yes, do come in.

1173
01:11:53,062 --> 01:11:56,105
Come right in, Officer.
This is our nephew, Mortimer.

1174
01:11:56,106 --> 01:11:58,149
- Pleased to meet you.
- Glad to see you.

1175
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,067
And this is another nephew, Jonathan.

1176
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:02,319
PAT: Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1177
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,489
Your face is familiar.
Haven't I seen a picture of you?

1178
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,407
I don't think so.

1179
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:08,826
PAT: I'll be running along.

1180
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:10,661
Why? Stay until my brother leaves.

1181
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:12,162
I got to ring in, Mr.--

1182
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:15,499
Are you "the" Mortimer Brewster,
the writer and dramatic critic?

1183
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,416
Yes, why?

1184
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:20,545
What a break for me! I'm a playwright.
I'm working on a play now.

1185
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:24,132
You are? Well, well, well!

1186
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:27,426
- Maybe I can help you with it.
- Would you? What a break!

1187
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:30,012
I get wonderful ideas,
but I can't spell them.

1188
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,556
I can spell like the dickens.
Constantinople?

1189
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,351
Let's go into the kitchen.
You can tell me all about it.

1190
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,436
Couldn't you whip up a sandwich?

1191
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:40,940
MARTHA: I hope you don't mind
eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.

1192
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:42,983
And where else would you eat?

1193
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,109
(Laughter)

1194
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,612
MORTIMER: See you in a moment.

1195
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,281
This is your last chance.

1196
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:52,034
I'll keep O'Hara busy
to give you a chance to get out.

1197
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,620
All three of you:
you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo.

1198
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:59,166
If you don't leave here, I'll introduce
Officer O'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo.

1199
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,751
My play takes place in--

1200
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:04,546
I'll be right with you, O'Hara.
Right with you.

1201
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:07,132
Just give me one moment.

1202
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:19,602
Now get going! All three of you.

1203
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:23,022
This affair between my brother and myself
has got to be settled.

1204
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:27,067
DR. EINSTEIN: But we've got
trouble enough as it is. Come, let's go.

1205
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:30,279
We're not going.
We're sleeping right here in this house.

1206
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,532
DR. EINSTEIN: With a cop in the kitchen
and Spenalzo in the windowseat?

1207
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:38,328
That's all he's got on us. We'll take
Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.

1208
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:41,957
After that, we're coming back here.
Then if he tries to interfere--

1209
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,875
No, no, Johnny. No, please.

1210
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:47,253
We've got a wonderful setup here.
We can make a fortune.

1211
01:13:47,254 --> 01:13:52,050
Two old ladies as a front.
Only Mortimer stands in our way.

1212
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:54,636
JONATHAN: I never did like Mortimer.

1213
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:57,096
DR. EINSTEIN: Please, take it easy. Please!

1214
01:13:57,097 --> 01:13:59,348
Doctor, you know
when I make up my mind--

1215
01:13:59,349 --> 01:14:02,727
DR. EINSTEIN: When you make up
your mind, you lose your head.

1216
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:06,688
Look, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

1217
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:10,776
Okay, Johnny. Okay!

1218
01:14:10,777 --> 01:14:15,531
JONATHAN: Take the instruments
and hide them in the cellar. Move fast.

1219
01:14:15,532 --> 01:14:16,698
Mr. Brewster...

1220
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:20,035
- You don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
- I don't know.

1221
01:14:20,036 --> 01:14:22,954
- My mother was an actress.
- Legitimate?

1222
01:14:22,955 --> 01:14:24,747
Of course. She was my mother.

1223
01:14:24,749 --> 01:14:27,458
- Excuse me.
- Peaches La Tour was her name.

1224
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:28,585
Hey, Johnny...

1225
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:30,545
- Come quick!
- What's the matter?

1226
01:14:30,546 --> 01:14:32,088
You know that hole in the cellar?

1227
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:33,256
JONATHAN: Yes.

1228
01:14:33,257 --> 01:14:37,259
Well, we got an ace in the hole.

1229
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,596
It's no fly-by-night idea.
I worked on it for 12 years.

1230
01:14:40,597 --> 01:14:42,973
Well, rehash it. I'll be back in a minute.

1231
01:14:42,974 --> 01:14:44,767
- Swell.
- I like the first act.

1232
01:14:44,768 --> 01:14:54,318
I didn't tell you the first--

1233
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,112
I thought I told you...

1234
01:14:58,114 --> 01:15:01,033
Jonathan!

1235
01:15:01,034 --> 01:15:04,786
JONATHAN: Yes, Mortimer.

1236
01:15:04,787 --> 01:15:08,206
MORTIMER: What are you doing still here?
I thought I said beat it.

1237
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:09,332
We're not going.

1238
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,501
MORTIMER: You're not going?
DR. EINSTEIN: No.

1239
01:15:11,502 --> 01:15:13,253
MORTIMER: You stay out of this.

1240
01:15:13,254 --> 01:15:15,463
All right, you asked for it.

1241
01:15:15,464 --> 01:15:18,007
MORTIMER: Officer O'Hara?
PAT: Coming.

1242
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:20,593
If you tell O'Hara
what's in the windowseat...

1243
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:22,762
...l'll tell him what's in the cellar.

1244
01:15:22,763 --> 01:15:24,054
Cellar?

1245
01:15:24,055 --> 01:15:29,393
There's an elderly gentleman down there
who seems to be very dead.

1246
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:32,188
- What were you doing there?
- What's he doing there?

1247
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:34,899
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara?

1248
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,402
Your aunts want to hear the rest.
Shall I bring them in here?

1249
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:41,279
You can't do that now.
You'd better ring in.

1250
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,157
The heck with ringing in!
I want to tell you the plot.

1251
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:46,701
You can't tell me
in front of those two fellas.

1252
01:15:46,702 --> 01:15:47,911
Lowbrows, huh?

1253
01:15:47,912 --> 01:15:51,498
Let's go where we can be alone.
I'll meet you there later.

1254
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:54,000
How about the backroom at Kelly's?

1255
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:57,003
Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere.
Genius at work.

1256
01:15:57,004 --> 01:15:59,130
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

1257
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:01,716
JONATHAN: Why don't you both go down
in the cellar?

1258
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:03,759
That's all right with me.

1259
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,138
There's a much more literary atmosphere
in Kelly's, I assure you.

1260
01:16:07,139 --> 01:16:08,764
PAT: This opening will kill you.

1261
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:10,849
I'm waiting to be born and the doctor--

1262
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:12,184
The doctor!

1263
01:16:12,185 --> 01:16:14,854
Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

1264
01:16:14,855 --> 01:16:17,939
You won't stand me up, will you?
This is a great play.

1265
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,109
- I'll see you down there.
- Can't wait!

1266
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,526
Doctor, doctor.

1267
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:25,489
Where are those papers? There they are.

1268
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:29,534
You're smug, aren't you? You think
you've got it over me. You haven't.

1269
01:16:29,536 --> 01:16:33,621
You think I'm afraid to tell about Spenalzo
because of Hoskins. Well, I'm not!

1270
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,123
The moment I get Spenalzo...

1271
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:38,584
The moment the doctor signs,
I don't care who knows about Hoskins.

1272
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:41,879
And you better feel the same way
about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo!

1273
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:43,380
JONATHAN: Where are you going?

1274
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:45,090
To the doctor's. Where do you...

1275
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:48,678
When I come back,
I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!

1276
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:51,680
We'll wait for him.

1277
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:54,058
Did he look guilty!

1278
01:16:54,059 --> 01:16:58,770
Well, Martha,
I think we can start the services now.

1279
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:00,730
ABBY: We thought we heard you leave.

1280
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:03,900
Perish the thought, dear aunties.
That was just Mortimer.

1281
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:05,944
And speaking of services...

1282
01:17:05,945 --> 01:17:11,032
...will you make us some coffee
while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar?

1283
01:17:11,033 --> 01:17:13,826
MARTHA: No, Jonathan.
You've got to take him with you!

1284
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:17,288
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs
waiting for him.

1285
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:21,084
ABBY: A friend of Mortimer's?
JONATHAN: Take his feet, Doctor.

1286
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:24,003
Mr. Spenalzo and he
will get along fine together.

1287
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:26,380
They're both dead.

1288
01:17:26,381 --> 01:17:28,257
He must mean Mr. Hoskins.

1289
01:17:28,258 --> 01:17:34,972
DR. EINSTEIN: Mr. Hoskins?

1290
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:37,224
You know about what's down there?

1291
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:40,727
Of course we do.
And he's no friend of Mortimer's.

1292
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:43,647
- He's one of our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

1293
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:47,692
Yes. And we won't have
any strangers buried in our cellar.

1294
01:17:47,693 --> 01:17:50,945
- But Mr. Hoskins--
- Mr. Hoskins is no stranger.

1295
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:53,573
Besides, there's no room for Mr. Spenalzo.

1296
01:17:53,574 --> 01:17:55,575
The cellar's crowded already.

1297
01:17:55,576 --> 01:17:57,201
Crowded? With what?

1298
01:17:57,202 --> 01:18:06,169
There are 12 graves down there now.

1299
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,795
Twelve graves.

1300
01:18:07,796 --> 01:18:11,424
That leaves very little room
and we're going to need it.

1301
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:14,260
You mean, you and Aunt Martha
have murdered 12--

1302
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:17,596
Murdered? Certainly not.
It's one of our charities.

1303
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:20,557
MARTHA: Why, what we've been doing
is a mercy.

1304
01:18:20,558 --> 01:18:24,978
So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo
out of here.

1305
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:29,816
(Dr. Einstein cackles)

1306
01:18:29,817 --> 01:18:32,444
You've done all that...

1307
01:18:32,445 --> 01:18:37,865
...right here in this house
and buried them in the cellar?

1308
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:40,701
That's wonderful, Johnny!

1309
01:18:40,702 --> 01:18:43,120
We've been chased all over the world...

1310
01:18:43,122 --> 01:18:47,375
...and they stay right here in Brooklyn,
and they do just as good as you do.

1311
01:18:47,376 --> 01:18:49,877
What?

1312
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:52,630
You got 12, they got 12.

1313
01:18:52,631 --> 01:18:54,006
I've got 13.

1314
01:18:54,007 --> 01:18:57,593
- No, Johnny, 12. Don't brag.
- Thirteen.

1315
01:18:57,594 --> 01:19:01,388
There's Mr. Spenalzo.
Then the first one in London.

1316
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:04,390
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney,
one in Melbourne...

1317
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,227
...two in San Francisco,
one in Phoenix, Arizona.

1318
01:19:07,228 --> 01:19:08,520
Phoenix?

1319
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:11,147
- The filling station.
- Filling...

1320
01:19:11,148 --> 01:19:14,317
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend.

1321
01:19:14,318 --> 01:19:15,736
That makes 13.

1322
01:19:15,737 --> 01:19:19,281
You cannot count the one in South Bend.
He died of pneumonia.

1323
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:22,325
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia
if I hadn't shot him.

1324
01:19:22,326 --> 01:19:24,744
You cannot count him.

1325
01:19:24,745 --> 01:19:27,330
You got 12, they got 12.

1326
01:19:27,331 --> 01:19:33,669
DR. EINSTEIN: The old ladies
is just as good as you are.

1327
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,839
They are, are they?

1328
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,591
Well, that's easily taken care of.

1329
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:42,344
All I need is one more.

1330
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:46,556
That's all. Just one more.

1331
01:19:46,558 --> 01:19:50,811
And I've a pretty good idea who it is.

1332
01:19:50,812 --> 01:19:54,147
I'm a lucky man to have caught you
at home, Dr. Gilchrist.

1333
01:19:54,148 --> 01:19:56,024
This is most irregular.

1334
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:59,861
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed,
but only you can help me.

1335
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:03,698
I know Teddy blows bugles,
but I can't commit a man just on that.

1336
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,199
If you'd talk with him...

1337
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,202
...l'm sure you'd be convinced.
Here's the house l--

1338
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,705
(Abby and Martha sing hymns)

1339
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,665
- There goes Hoskins.
- Who?

1340
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:16,711
What? Did I say...

1341
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:18,295
- You better wait.
- Here?

1342
01:20:18,296 --> 01:20:19,672
I'll bring Teddy out.

1343
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:22,758
I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies,
seeing a doctor.

1344
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:25,218
- You wait here.
- In the cemetery?

1345
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:26,553
It's Halloween.

1346
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:29,014
The pixies won't be out till after midnight.

1347
01:20:29,015 --> 01:20:33,393
Make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.

1348
01:20:33,394 --> 01:20:35,145
- Hey, $22.50!
- What?

1349
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:36,312
$22.50!

1350
01:20:36,313 --> 01:20:39,274
Oh, yes, looks good on you!

1351
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:42,527
CAB DRIVER: Not the suit, the meter!

1352
01:20:42,528 --> 01:20:49,533
"Looks good on me." $22.50.

1353
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:52,828
- Did you give him a 21-gun salute?
- Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

1354
01:20:52,829 --> 01:20:55,247
CAB DRIVER: Five more bucks
and you'll own it.

1355
01:20:55,248 --> 01:20:59,167
No, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

1356
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:02,296
- Mr. President, may I present--
- Dr. Livingstone!

1357
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:05,591
- Livingstone?
- That's what he presumes.

1358
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:08,510
The doctor would like
to have a few words with you.

1359
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:11,680
Certainly. Welcome to Washington.

1360
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:14,641
Arlington is beautiful
at this time of year, is it not?

1361
01:21:14,642 --> 01:21:21,356
DR. GILCHRIST: Yes, indeed.

1362
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:23,942
Well now, that's that.

1363
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:29,906
It gives me a chance to rest.

1364
01:21:29,907 --> 01:21:34,118
So far, so good.

1365
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:41,583
Not so good.

1366
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:43,711
Do you or do you not love me?

1367
01:21:43,712 --> 01:21:45,463
Oh, Elaine...

1368
01:21:45,464 --> 01:21:49,216
How can you say such a thing?
Darling, of course I love you.

1369
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:51,093
- Do you?
- Yes, darling.

1370
01:21:51,094 --> 01:21:57,641
Then why have you been treating me
the way you have?

1371
01:21:57,642 --> 01:22:04,022
Darling, I love you so much,
I can't go through with our marriage.

1372
01:22:04,023 --> 01:22:05,732
Have you suddenly gone crazy?

1373
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:08,651
I don't think so,
but it's only a matter of time.

1374
01:22:08,652 --> 01:22:12,405
Darling, would you want to have children
with three heads?

1375
01:22:12,406 --> 01:22:16,617
You wouldn't want to set up housekeeping
in a padded cell.

1376
01:22:16,618 --> 01:22:19,995
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I don't quite know.

1377
01:22:19,996 --> 01:22:23,540
I probably should have told you this before,
but you see...

1378
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,835
...well, insanity runs in my family.

1379
01:22:26,836 --> 01:22:27,961
(Hymns continue)

1380
01:22:27,962 --> 01:22:31,923
It practically gallops.

1381
01:22:31,924 --> 01:22:34,634
Just because Teddy's strange,
that doesn't mean--

1382
01:22:34,635 --> 01:22:37,387
No, darling. It's way back before Teddy.

1383
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:41,516
This goes back to the first Brewster
who came over on the Mayflower.

1384
01:22:41,517 --> 01:22:45,978
You know how in those days
the lndians used to scalp the settlers?

1385
01:22:45,979 --> 01:22:48,982
He used to scalp the lndians.

1386
01:22:48,983 --> 01:22:50,900
Darling, that's ancient history.

1387
01:22:50,901 --> 01:22:54,612
Doctor, I'll run for a third term,
but I won't be elected.

1388
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:57,657
That'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
in the White House.

1389
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:01,244
- That's what you think.
- Of course, if the country insists...

1390
01:23:01,245 --> 01:23:03,620
Darling, all this doesn't prove a thing.

1391
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:06,707
Look at your aunts.
They're Brewsters, aren't they?

1392
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:12,004
They're the sweetest,
sanest people I've ever known.

1393
01:23:12,005 --> 01:23:15,006
Well, even they have their peculiarities.

1394
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:18,093
What of it? So your family's crazy.
So you're crazy.

1395
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:20,345
That's the way I love you.

1396
01:23:20,346 --> 01:23:23,098
I'm crazy too, but kiss me.

1397
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:28,436
No, no. I...

1398
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:31,939
Goodbye, Ambassador.
I've enjoyed this little talk very much.

1399
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:41,490
Anytime you're in Washington,
drop in to see me at the White House.

1400
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:44,451
- Those papers.
- Go away. Papers!

1401
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:47,079
- I'll commit him to any place.
- You will?

1402
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,498
I've just been appointed
Ambassador to Bolivia!

1403
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:52,292
You see? Didn't I tell you?

1404
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:56,588
Don't worry about that.
Just go on signing the papers.

1405
01:23:56,589 --> 01:23:59,966
Thank you.

1406
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:03,929
ABBY: All right! We'll find out
whose house this is!

1407
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:06,723
ABBY: I'm warning you, you better stop it.

1408
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:10,393
There's no use doing what you're doing.
It'll just have to be undone.

1409
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:12,228
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby, go to bed!

1410
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:16,399
It's a terrible thing to do to bury
a good Methodist with a foreigner.

1411
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,942
Where have you been?

1412
01:24:17,943 --> 01:24:20,694
Getting some papers signed.
Is Teddy in his room?

1413
01:24:20,696 --> 01:24:22,571
What is the matter with you?

1414
01:24:22,572 --> 01:24:25,700
Running around getting papers signed
at a time like this.

1415
01:24:25,701 --> 01:24:27,993
Martha and I are going for the police.

1416
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:29,744
Police!

1417
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:31,038
Wait!

1418
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:33,582
- You can't go for the police.
- Oh, no?

1419
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:35,417
You know what Jonathan's doing?

1420
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:38,503
He's putting Mr. Hoskins
and Mr. Spenalzo in together.

1421
01:24:38,504 --> 01:24:39,880
All right, let him.

1422
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:42,840
DR. EINSTEIN: This is all fixed up nice now.

1423
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:45,468
Nice and smooth like a lake.

1424
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:51,265
The President will be very proud
of his Panama Canal.

1425
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:53,810
Johnny, bed feels good already.

1426
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:57,646
You know, we didn't get any sleep
for 48 hours.

1427
01:24:57,647 --> 01:25:00,733
You're forgetting, Doctor.

1428
01:25:00,734 --> 01:25:04,236
If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo
aren't out this house before morning...

1429
01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:06,155
...we're going for the police.

1430
01:25:06,156 --> 01:25:07,948
I'll get them out, I promise!

1431
01:25:07,949 --> 01:25:12,536
- Then you get the wedding silver.
- Remember, no police! No police!

1432
01:25:12,537 --> 01:25:14,663
Look, go to bed, will you?

1433
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:18,458
Get out of those clothes!
You look like a double blackout.

1434
01:25:18,459 --> 01:25:21,210
My brother, Mortimer.

1435
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:23,671
I just heard him upstairs.

1436
01:25:23,672 --> 01:25:26,299
No! I am tired.

1437
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,970
You forget, I got to operate
on your face tomorrow.

1438
01:25:30,972 --> 01:25:34,056
JONATHAN: You are going
to operate tomorrow, Doctor.

1439
01:25:34,057 --> 01:25:36,976
But tonight we are taking care
ofMortimer.

1440
01:25:36,977 --> 01:25:40,229
But Johnny, not tonight! I'm sleepy.

1441
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:43,149
We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.

1442
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:46,026
JONATHAN: Look at me, Doctor.

1443
01:25:46,027 --> 01:25:50,156
You can see that it's got to be done,
can't you?

1444
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:53,992
Yeah, I know that look.

1445
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:57,620
It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

1446
01:25:57,621 --> 01:26:00,248
Okay, Johnny. Okay, we'll do it.

1447
01:26:00,249 --> 01:26:03,793
But the quick way, huh?
The quick twist like in London.

1448
01:26:03,794 --> 01:26:08,631
No, Doctor. I think this calls
for something special.

1449
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:12,343
I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

1450
01:26:12,344 --> 01:26:15,263
Not the Melbourne method, please!

1451
01:26:15,264 --> 01:26:17,181
Two hours!

1452
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:19,851
And then when it was all over, what?

1453
01:26:19,852 --> 01:26:25,564
The fellow in London was just as dead
as the fellow in Melbourne.

1454
01:26:25,565 --> 01:26:27,315
Don't do that, Mr. President.

1455
01:26:27,317 --> 01:26:30,402
But I cannot sign anything
without consulting my Cabinet.

1456
01:26:30,403 --> 01:26:31,779
This must be secret.

1457
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,740
A secret proclamation? How unusual.

1458
01:26:34,741 --> 01:26:37,784
Yes, it's the only way
we can outsmart the other fellow.

1459
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:40,203
- Who's the other fellow?
- That's the secret.

1460
01:26:40,204 --> 01:26:42,581
Oh, I see!

1461
01:26:42,582 --> 01:26:44,207
Very clever.

1462
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:46,918
A secret proclamation
has to be signed in secret.

1463
01:26:46,919 --> 01:26:50,088
- Of course, Mr. President.
- I'll put on my signing clothes.

1464
01:26:50,089 --> 01:26:52,381
You already have them on, Mr. President.

1465
01:26:52,382 --> 01:26:58,179
So I have. Wait here.

1466
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,347
(Whispers) Hey, Mr. Brewster.

1467
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:05,144
MORTIMER: What is it, mice?

1468
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:08,314
- You get out of this house.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

1469
01:27:08,315 --> 01:27:17,197
(Bugle blows)

1470
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,532
Thank you, Mr. President.

1471
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:22,369
What a load off my mind.
Boy, could I use a drink!

1472
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:26,164
- Get out of here, will you, please?
- What? Speak up. I can't hear you.

1473
01:27:26,165 --> 01:27:28,124
Johnny's in a bad mood. Get out!

1474
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:31,711
- Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
- Please listen to me. Get out.

1475
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:35,548
Stop all this! What are you doing?
Look, Doc-- Are you really a doctor?

1476
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:37,550
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919.

1477
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:40,344
Heidelberg?
How'd you hook up with Jonathan?

1478
01:27:40,345 --> 01:27:45,391
I tell you later about that, but you go now.
Please listen to me.

1479
01:27:45,392 --> 01:27:46,851
Stop it, Doctor!

1480
01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:49,936
You get out of here!
Look, when Johnny's in that mood...

1481
01:27:49,938 --> 01:27:52,439
...he's a madman. He's a maniac!

1482
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,609
And then things happen. Horrible things.

1483
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,987
- Get out of here!
- Will you stop it?

1484
01:27:57,988 --> 01:28:00,781
Stop telling me about Jonathan,
I'll take care of him.

1485
01:28:00,782 --> 01:28:03,783
You take care of yourself.
Get going, little fellow.

1486
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:05,994
- What's that? Wait.
- My schnapps.

1487
01:28:05,995 --> 01:28:09,789
- I could use that.
- That's mine.

1488
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,042
Please. Only for dramatic critics.

1489
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:14,961
You beat it before things start popping
around here.

1490
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:17,213
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please.

1491
01:28:17,214 --> 01:28:18,923
You've just been married.

1492
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:22,718
You have a nice little wife waiting for you.
Please go now.

1493
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,596
Please.

1494
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:28,182
(Exasperated mutters)

1495
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:31,268
Don't those plays you see all the time
teach you anything?

1496
01:28:31,269 --> 01:28:35,063
Don't get me on the subject of plays!
I've got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon.

1497
01:28:35,064 --> 01:28:37,691
At least people in plays
act like they got sense.

1498
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:40,694
Did anybody in a play
ever act like they got intelligence?

1499
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:44,114
- How can somebody be so stupid?
- You ought to have my job.

1500
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:48,577
When you get out of prison, have yourself
wheeled to the Garrick Theater.

1501
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:52,122
There's a play that's so bad,
it'll still be running when you get out.

1502
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:54,082
There's a man... Now listen to this.

1503
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:57,752
He knows he's in the house with murderers
and should know he's in danger.

1504
01:28:57,753 --> 01:29:00,337
He's even been warned to get out.
And does he go?

1505
01:29:00,338 --> 01:29:02,423
No, he doesn't. He stays!

1506
01:29:02,424 --> 01:29:07,219
This fellow doesn't even have sense
to be scared or to be on his guard.

1507
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,347
The murderer even invites him to sit down.

1508
01:29:09,348 --> 01:29:11,432
- What do you think he does?
- I don't know.

1509
01:29:11,433 --> 01:29:13,225
He sits down!

1510
01:29:13,226 --> 01:29:16,603
He deliberately pulls up a chair
and he sits down in it.

1511
01:29:16,604 --> 01:29:18,981
Isn't that great?

1512
01:29:18,982 --> 01:29:23,235
So there he is,
all waiting to be trussed up and gagged.

1513
01:29:23,236 --> 01:29:28,322
What do you think they tied him up with?
The curtain cord.

1514
01:29:28,324 --> 01:29:30,158
DR. EINSTEIN: Curtain cord?

1515
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,202
But didn't he see him get it?

1516
01:29:32,203 --> 01:29:35,497
No. The silly chump sits down
with his back toward the murderer.

1517
01:29:35,498 --> 01:29:39,834
All he has to do is look around,
but does he? No!

1518
01:29:39,835 --> 01:29:43,671
MORTIMER: See, brother Heidelberg,
in a play or even in a movie...

1519
01:29:43,672 --> 01:29:47,049
...a fellow never sees or hears anything.
That's right.

1520
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:49,218
DR. EINSTEIN: But what does he do?

1521
01:29:49,219 --> 01:29:53,097
The big chump sits there.
This fellow's supposed to be bright.

1522
01:29:53,098 --> 01:29:56,725
Now get a load of this.
Look at the attitude.

1523
01:29:56,726 --> 01:30:01,104
Large as life! He sits there
waiting to be tied up and gagged.

1524
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:05,233
The big dope!

1525
01:30:05,235 --> 01:30:11,614
(Dramatic instrumental music)

1526
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:16,744
You were right about that fellow.
He wasn't very bright.

1527
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,330
JONATHAN: Yes, Mortimer.

1528
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:22,249
I've been away for 20 years.

1529
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:28,005
But never, my dear brother,
were you out of my mind.

1530
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:35,053
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

1531
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:54,155
(Dramatic instrumental music)

1532
01:30:54,156 --> 01:31:00,829
The more you struggle
the more you strangle yourself.

1533
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:37,239
Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

1534
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,366
Now, Doctor...

1535
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:42,034
...we go to work.

1536
01:31:42,035 --> 01:31:45,579
Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please.

1537
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,666
- This must be an artistic achievement.
- Please.

1538
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:53,045
After all, we're performing
before a very distinguished critic.

1539
01:31:53,046 --> 01:31:55,130
DR. EINSTEIN: Please!

1540
01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:59,509
All right. Let's get it over with.

1541
01:31:59,511 --> 01:32:03,722
But I cannot see this without the drink.

1542
01:32:03,723 --> 01:32:05,682
JONATHAN: Pull yourself together.

1543
01:32:05,683 --> 01:32:09,728
But I can't pull myself together
without a drink.

1544
01:32:09,729 --> 01:32:12,772
You remember when we came in,
there was some wine.

1545
01:32:12,773 --> 01:32:17,194
And then they took it.
Where did they put it?

1546
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:20,697
I found some wine.

1547
01:32:20,698 --> 01:32:22,865
Here, I'll split it with you.

1548
01:32:22,866 --> 01:32:25,826
We both have a drink before we operate.

1549
01:32:25,827 --> 01:32:35,586
I am so happy that we don't have
to operate without a drink.

1550
01:32:35,587 --> 01:32:37,213
JONATHAN: Doctor.

1551
01:32:37,214 --> 01:32:39,548
One moment, please.

1552
01:32:39,549 --> 01:32:44,178
Where are your manners?

1553
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:45,971
Yes, Mortimer.

1554
01:32:45,972 --> 01:32:50,100
I realize now that it was you
who brought me back to Brooklyn.

1555
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:52,936
We drink to you.

1556
01:32:52,937 --> 01:33:01,653
To my dear, dead brother.

1557
01:33:01,654 --> 01:33:09,785
(Bugle blows)

1558
01:33:09,787 --> 01:33:12,538
(Clock chimes)

1559
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:13,915
JONATHAN: That idiot!

1560
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:15,916
He goes next. That's all. He goes next!

1561
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:17,710
DR. EINSTEIN: Not Teddy! Please!

1562
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:20,504
- We'll get to him later.
- You won't at all!

1563
01:33:20,505 --> 01:33:22,548
We have to work fast. The quick way.

1564
01:33:22,549 --> 01:33:24,216
The quick way, yes!

1565
01:33:24,217 --> 01:33:27,928
If it has to be, then the quick way.
I'll help you.

1566
01:33:27,929 --> 01:33:42,358
(Doorbell rings)

1567
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:44,652
The colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

1568
01:33:44,653 --> 01:33:47,822
It's all right. We're taking
the bugle away from him.

1569
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:53,577
I'd better talk to him myself.
Where's the lights?

1570
01:33:53,578 --> 01:33:57,373
(Muffled shouts)

1571
01:33:57,374 --> 01:33:59,708
You stood me up!

1572
01:33:59,709 --> 01:34:03,754
PAT: I've been waiting for you
for over an hour at Kelly's.

1573
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:05,965
- What happened to him?
- Nothing.

1574
01:34:05,966 --> 01:34:11,886
He was explaining a play he saw and
that's what happened to a man in the play.

1575
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:13,388
I see.

1576
01:34:13,389 --> 01:34:15,932
Did that really happen in a play you saw?

1577
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:18,435
How do you like that?
You can't trust nobody.

1578
01:34:18,436 --> 01:34:21,312
They practically stole that from my play.

1579
01:34:21,313 --> 01:34:27,235
In the second act, just--
Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.

1580
01:34:27,236 --> 01:34:31,989
Yeah, sure.

1581
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:34,491
No.

1582
01:34:34,492 --> 01:34:40,331
You've got to hear the plot!

1583
01:34:40,332 --> 01:34:44,335
My mother's making up.
Like a flash, out of a clear sky...

1584
01:34:44,336 --> 01:34:47,129
...the door opens and a man
with a mustache comes in.

1585
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:51,800
He says, "Miss Peaches La Tour,
will you marry me?"

1586
01:34:51,801 --> 01:34:56,847
That's the first scene. My mother doesn't
say they're married. That's the surprise!

1587
01:34:56,848 --> 01:34:58,640
What a kick!

1588
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:02,435
Twenty-five years pass.
Well, in the meantime, there's me.

1589
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:06,022
Growing into a magnificent specimen.
So what do I do?

1590
01:35:06,023 --> 01:35:09,441
I join the police force and become
one of New York's finest.

1591
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:13,154
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see?
Little do I know it...

1592
01:35:13,155 --> 01:35:15,740
...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me.

1593
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:18,701
I'm in great danger.

1594
01:35:18,702 --> 01:35:23,330
It's getting you, ain't it?
I can see it in your eyes.

1595
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:25,332
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1596
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:28,626
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out.
What an effect!

1597
01:35:28,628 --> 01:35:31,297
Firemen rush in and who's leading them?

1598
01:35:31,298 --> 01:35:36,217
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia!

1599
01:35:36,218 --> 01:35:37,844
What's the matter with him?

1600
01:35:37,845 --> 01:35:40,638
- Probably your play put him to sleep.
- What?

1601
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:45,059
- I personally like it very much.
- It's probably over his head.

1602
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:50,272
- Where have I seen that face before?
- No, please.

1603
01:35:50,273 --> 01:35:53,401
The scene changes. It's an evolving stage.

1604
01:35:53,402 --> 01:35:55,778
I'm walking along my beat, casual-like...

1605
01:35:55,779 --> 01:35:59,157
...when a guy that I'm following,
it turns out he's following me!

1606
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:00,282
(Knock on door)

1607
01:36:00,284 --> 01:36:02,827
Don't let nobody in.
I figures I'll outsmart him.

1608
01:36:02,828 --> 01:36:04,745
PAT: There's a vacant house on the corner.

1609
01:36:04,746 --> 01:36:06,538
Johnny, the cops!

1610
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:09,457
PAT: I sees the door handle turn,
so I pulls out my gun...

1611
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:12,002
...braces myself against the wall and I says:

1612
01:36:12,003 --> 01:36:17,173
"Come in! "

1613
01:36:17,174 --> 01:36:19,092
Hello, boys.

1614
01:36:19,093 --> 01:36:22,929
- What the Sam Hill's going on?
- Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster.

1615
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:26,349
- He's going to help me write my play.
- Do you have to tie him up?

1616
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:28,392
BROPHY: Report in.
Why didn't you ring in?

1617
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:30,645
The whole force is out looking for you.

1618
01:36:30,646 --> 01:36:33,856
Right in the middle of the second act.
Did they send you here?

1619
01:36:33,857 --> 01:36:35,775
No, we came to warn the old ladies.

1620
01:36:35,776 --> 01:36:37,443
The colonel blew that bugle again.

1621
01:36:37,444 --> 01:36:38,736
PAT: I heard him.

1622
01:36:38,737 --> 01:36:41,989
BROPHY: Neighbors are phoning in.
The Lieutenant's on the warpath.

1623
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:44,492
He says we've got
to put him away someplace.

1624
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:46,118
Now, who the heck is this?

1625
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,996
Mr. Brewster's brother.
My play put him to sleep.

1626
01:36:48,997 --> 01:36:52,291
That's the one that ran away.
So he came back.

1627
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:54,001
Brophy. Get me Mac.

1628
01:36:54,002 --> 01:36:57,879
Have you got yourself in a mess!
You're two hours overdue at the station.

1629
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:00,257
I better let them know that I found you.

1630
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:03,384
PAT: It wasn't that bad, was it?

1631
01:37:03,385 --> 01:37:07,722
Tell the Lieutenant he can call off
the big manhunt. We found him.

1632
01:37:07,723 --> 01:37:10,308
At the Brewster house.

1633
01:37:10,309 --> 01:37:12,727
Shall we bring him in?

1634
01:37:12,728 --> 01:37:16,773
All right, we'll hold him right here.

1635
01:37:16,774 --> 01:37:19,775
The Lieutenant is on his way over.

1636
01:37:19,776 --> 01:37:22,987
So I've been turned in?

1637
01:37:22,988 --> 01:37:26,532
All right, you've got me.

1638
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:30,869
I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother
will split the reward.

1639
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:32,120
Yes, reward!

1640
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:34,164
JONATHAN: Now I'll do some turning in!

1641
01:37:34,165 --> 01:37:35,916
PAT: Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

1642
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:39,544
You think my aunts are sweet,
charming old ladies, don't you?

1643
01:37:39,545 --> 01:37:43,339
Well, there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar!

1644
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,424
Yes, 13.

1645
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:47,385
BROPHY: Careful what you say.
Your aunts are our friends.

1646
01:37:47,386 --> 01:37:50,514
JONATHAN: I'll show them to you.
BROPHY: Don't make trouble!

1647
01:37:50,515 --> 01:37:52,932
Never mind, Mr. Brewster.
Leave him to me.

1648
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:55,601
JONATHAN: Come down to the cellar.
PAT: Wait a minute.

1649
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:58,896
Thirteen bodies.
I'll show you where they're buried.

1650
01:37:58,897 --> 01:38:01,523
- Go to the cellar with him.
- Yes, come to the cellar.

1651
01:38:01,525 --> 01:38:04,402
PAT: Well, look, do I have to?

1652
01:38:04,403 --> 01:38:06,820
Maybe I don't want to go down
to the cellar.

1653
01:38:06,821 --> 01:38:09,031
Go on down the cellar with him!

1654
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:12,576
Now, please. I'll tell you
the rest of my play later.

1655
01:38:12,577 --> 01:38:14,619
BROPHY: Go on down the cellar with him.

1656
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,871
Do I have to?

1657
01:38:15,872 --> 01:38:18,540
Look at that puss.
He looks like Boris Karloff.

1658
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:26,673
PAT: Don't! Sarge!

1659
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:33,095
BROPHY: Look out, Pat!

1660
01:38:33,096 --> 01:38:35,974
BROPHY: Look out!
SAUNDERS: He's got a gun.

1661
01:38:35,975 --> 01:38:38,726
BROPHY: I got him, Pat. Look out!

1662
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:45,400
Fight. Go on and fight.

1663
01:38:45,401 --> 01:38:51,530
That's enough, that's enough.
Everybody off.

1664
01:38:51,531 --> 01:38:52,948
BROPHY: Pat, look out!

1665
01:38:52,949 --> 01:38:54,200
Amazing.

1666
01:38:54,201 --> 01:38:59,954
(Crashing and fighting)

1667
01:38:59,955 --> 01:39:02,457
Such a fine day, too.

1668
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:12,258
All I did was cross the bridge
and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.

1669
01:39:12,259 --> 01:39:13,718
Don't bother me now.

1670
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:15,845
You could use this in the third act.

1671
01:39:15,846 --> 01:39:19,098
PAT: I got something better.
Let me tell you--

1672
01:39:19,099 --> 01:39:24,228
I'll see you later.

1673
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:27,481
The papers are all signed. What do I care?

1674
01:39:27,482 --> 01:39:35,655
Go ahead, fight.

1675
01:39:35,656 --> 01:39:39,576
I'd better call and see
if Witherspoon has left.

1676
01:39:39,577 --> 01:39:41,828
Telephone.

1677
01:39:41,829 --> 01:39:43,538
I'll get every one of you!

1678
01:39:43,539 --> 01:39:46,750
I hate cops. I'll brain the first one
that comes near me!

1679
01:39:46,751 --> 01:39:50,587
A little higher, brother.
Thank you very much. That's fine.

1680
01:39:50,588 --> 01:39:52,088
Don't do that, please.

1681
01:39:52,089 --> 01:39:53,798
Get him, Pat.

1682
01:39:53,799 --> 01:39:56,634
That won't have any effect.
I've tried it before--

1683
01:39:56,635 --> 01:40:00,513
It did. Isn't that amazing?

1684
01:40:00,514 --> 01:40:03,515
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

1685
01:40:03,516 --> 01:40:05,142
(Doorbell rings)

1686
01:40:05,143 --> 01:40:21,283
MORTIMER: Witherspoon.
BROPHY: Come in.

1687
01:40:21,284 --> 01:40:23,076
What has occurred?

1688
01:40:23,077 --> 01:40:26,037
Never mind!
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this?

1689
01:40:26,038 --> 01:40:27,414
Well, Lieutenant!

1690
01:40:27,415 --> 01:40:31,250
- We were just acting in self-defense.
- What happened? He put up a fight?

1691
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:33,670
This isn't the one who blows the bugle.

1692
01:40:33,671 --> 01:40:38,382
- This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara.
- All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

1693
01:40:38,383 --> 01:40:44,180
Boris... Turn him over.

1694
01:40:44,181 --> 01:40:46,932
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

1695
01:40:46,933 --> 01:40:49,769
You "kind of think
he's wanted somewhere"?

1696
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:53,188
If you guys can't look
at the circulars we put up...

1697
01:40:53,189 --> 01:40:55,690
...you can at least read
short detective stories.

1698
01:40:55,692 --> 01:40:57,860
Certainly, he's wanted. In lndiana!

1699
01:40:57,861 --> 01:41:01,405
He escaped from the prison
for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

1700
01:41:01,406 --> 01:41:02,739
That's my brother.

1701
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:07,244
That's the way they described him.
"He looked like Karloff."

1702
01:41:07,245 --> 01:41:08,745
Why'd you knock him out?

1703
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:12,206
He tried to get us to go to the cellar.
He says 13 bodies are there.

1704
01:41:12,207 --> 01:41:13,791
Thirteen bodies in the cellar...

1705
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:17,003
...and that don't tip you off
the guy's from a nuthouse?

1706
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,337
Thanks, pal.

1707
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:20,506
PAT: About my not ringing in, I want to--

1708
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:22,926
Where have you been all night?
Don't tell me.

1709
01:41:22,927 --> 01:41:26,596
I was right here writing a play
with Mortimer Brewster.

1710
01:41:26,597 --> 01:41:29,598
You're going to have
a long time on that play.

1711
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:31,183
You're suspended.

1712
01:41:31,184 --> 01:41:32,976
Now go on. Report in.

1713
01:41:32,977 --> 01:41:36,188
Bring him to and find out
where his accomplice is.

1714
01:41:36,189 --> 01:41:38,774
The guy who helped him escape.
He's wanted, too.

1715
01:41:38,775 --> 01:41:39,900
Here.

1716
01:41:39,901 --> 01:41:43,987
ROONEY: I've been after these guys
for 48 hours. Nothing to eat. No sleep.

1717
01:41:43,988 --> 01:41:46,031
No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

1718
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:49,451
With flatheads like you on the force.
Falling for a story like that!

1719
01:41:49,452 --> 01:41:51,537
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.

1720
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:54,914
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar!

1721
01:41:54,915 --> 01:41:59,251
- Who are you?
- I'm President Roosevelt.

1722
01:41:59,252 --> 01:42:03,172
- (Whispers) What the blazes is this?
- He's the one that blows the bugle.

1723
01:42:03,173 --> 01:42:08,469
Howdy, Colonel.

1724
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:12,181
Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
Get this guy out of here.

1725
01:42:12,182 --> 01:42:15,016
Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim?

1726
01:42:15,017 --> 01:42:17,728
All the bodies in the cellar
are yellow-fever victims.

1727
01:42:17,729 --> 01:42:21,232
No, Colonel. This is a spy.
We caught him at the White House.

1728
01:42:21,233 --> 01:42:23,901
Take him out and bring him to.
I want to question him.

1729
01:42:23,902 --> 01:42:27,904
- Questioning of spies is my department.
- Hey, you, keep out of that.

1730
01:42:27,905 --> 01:42:40,082
You're forgetting that as President
I am also head of the Secret Service.

1731
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:42,168
MORTIMER: No, no, no.

1732
01:42:42,169 --> 01:42:44,087
ROONEY: Who are you?

1733
01:42:44,088 --> 01:42:45,379
What's your name?

1734
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:48,382
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster.
But I'm not myself today.

1735
01:42:48,383 --> 01:42:52,553
You're his brother. Look, no argument.
He's got to be put away.

1736
01:42:52,554 --> 01:42:57,349
No arguments, Captain. No arguments.
Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.

1737
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:59,392
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight.

1738
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:02,812
- I'm waiting for Mr. Witherspoon.
- As long as he's going someplace.

1739
01:43:02,813 --> 01:43:05,107
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle.

1740
01:43:05,108 --> 01:43:17,202
And that cockeyed story
about 13 bodies being--

1741
01:43:17,203 --> 01:43:20,705
I've been without sleep for 48 hours.
I'm liable to think anything.

1742
01:43:20,706 --> 01:43:22,873
I know just how you feel.

1743
01:43:22,874 --> 01:43:25,209
There's people dumb enough
to believe that.

1744
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:28,546
Last year there was a crazy guy,
started a murder rumor.

1745
01:43:28,547 --> 01:43:31,298
I had to dig up a half acre plot
before I could prove--

1746
01:43:31,299 --> 01:43:33,343
- What's this?
- What's the matter?

1747
01:43:33,344 --> 01:43:35,219
- These papers aren't any good.
- Why not?

1748
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:42,809
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt!

1749
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:46,312
- Is your taxi engaged?
- Losing dough every minute. Any offers?

1750
01:43:46,313 --> 01:43:50,567
I'm Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale
Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster.

1751
01:43:50,568 --> 01:43:55,029
I would like you to drive us back
to the sanitarium.

1752
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:59,242
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse!

1753
01:43:59,243 --> 01:44:05,832
We like to think of it as a rest home.

1754
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:13,338
(Overlapping background conversation)

1755
01:44:13,339 --> 01:44:18,218
MR. WITHERSPOON: Mr. Brewster?

1756
01:44:18,219 --> 01:44:23,849
MR. WITHERSPOON:
Mr. Witherspoon is here.

1757
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:27,936
Supposing the spy steals this document
and finds the name Roosevelt on it.

1758
01:44:27,937 --> 01:44:31,106
Think what that would mean
to the safety of the nation!

1759
01:44:31,107 --> 01:44:33,775
- No, it's chicanery.
- What is this? Come on!

1760
01:44:33,776 --> 01:44:37,112
- He's come to. He's ready to talk.
- Hold him till I get there.

1761
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:41,198
Let me explain. The name Brewster
is code for Roosevelt.

1762
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,576
- Code for Roosevelt?
- Take the name Brewster.

1763
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:45,828
Take away the "B" and what have you got?

1764
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:48,289
- Rooster.
- And what does a rooster do?

1765
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:51,918
- Crows.
- It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa?

1766
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:54,295
- On the veldt!
- There you are! "Crowsveldt."

1767
01:44:54,296 --> 01:44:57,714
Ingenious! My compliments
to the boys in the code department.

1768
01:44:57,715 --> 01:44:59,967
That's all right! Do that again for me.

1769
01:44:59,968 --> 01:45:03,387
Never mind! Give me that pen.

1770
01:45:03,388 --> 01:45:05,347
This is fun.

1771
01:45:05,348 --> 01:45:14,606
Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

1772
01:45:14,607 --> 01:45:16,566
I'm so glad to see you.

1773
01:45:16,567 --> 01:45:18,443
Mr. Witherspoon, before...

1774
01:45:18,444 --> 01:45:20,404
You will take good care of Teddy?

1775
01:45:20,405 --> 01:45:22,905
- Best of care of him.
- That's fine.

1776
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:24,824
And no wagon when he leaves.

1777
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:27,034
Why? To take him away? Never, never.

1778
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:29,996
Taxicabs. We always...
I have one waiting now.

1779
01:45:29,997 --> 01:45:31,663
It means a great deal to me.

1780
01:45:31,665 --> 01:45:34,834
You will personally see
that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale?

1781
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:37,378
- He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
- That's good.

1782
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:40,589
You know, I sometimes envy
some of our patients, secretly.

1783
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:43,926
You do? It must be a nice place.
I've never been there.

1784
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,303
You never can tell.

1785
01:45:46,304 --> 01:45:49,389
This is a particularly happy moment
for me tonight.

1786
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:53,434
- I've never met a dramatic critic before.
- The woods are full of them.

1787
01:45:53,435 --> 01:45:57,105
I have here something that will explain
what we're trying to do.

1788
01:45:57,106 --> 01:46:00,775
- A pamphlet about Happy Dale?
- No, it's a play.

1789
01:46:00,776 --> 01:46:02,610
Something I've been working on.

1790
01:46:02,611 --> 01:46:06,447
It's a dramatization of many incidents
that have happened at Happy Dale.

1791
01:46:06,448 --> 01:46:09,450
MORTIMER: Captain! Captain!

1792
01:46:09,451 --> 01:46:14,079
I want you to read this carefully.
I want you to be just as harsh as you like.

1793
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,581
I shan't mind, you know--

1794
01:46:15,582 --> 01:46:18,459
Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon.

1795
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,628
Oh, yes, yes.

1796
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:22,671
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

1797
01:46:22,672 --> 01:46:26,216
- Come, my boy.
- What is this?

1798
01:46:26,217 --> 01:46:29,803
No, you got it wrong.
This is Captain Rooney.

1799
01:46:29,804 --> 01:46:32,890
The police?

1800
01:46:32,891 --> 01:46:37,060
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed.
Now you can take him away.

1801
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:39,354
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

1802
01:46:39,355 --> 01:46:41,815
MORTIMER: Mr. President,
I have good news for you.

1803
01:46:41,816 --> 01:46:45,110
Your term of office is over.

1804
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:47,737
- Is this March 4?
- Practically.

1805
01:46:47,738 --> 01:46:51,365
Let's see...

1806
01:46:51,366 --> 01:46:53,826
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa!

1807
01:46:53,827 --> 01:47:02,710
Well, I must get started immediately.

1808
01:47:02,711 --> 01:47:06,046
Is he trying to move into the White House
before I've moved out?

1809
01:47:06,047 --> 01:47:07,965
Who, Mr. President?

1810
01:47:07,966 --> 01:47:12,094
Taft!

1811
01:47:12,095 --> 01:47:17,515
No, this isn't Mr. Taft.
It's Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa.

1812
01:47:17,516 --> 01:47:19,142
Bully! Bully!

1813
01:47:19,143 --> 01:47:21,853
Wait right here.
I'll bring down my equipment.

1814
01:47:21,854 --> 01:47:23,188
Happy man.

1815
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:25,356
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha.

1816
01:47:25,357 --> 01:47:28,234
I'm on my way to Africa.
Isn't it wonderful?

1817
01:47:28,235 --> 01:47:31,863
Charge!

1818
01:47:31,864 --> 01:47:35,074
MORTIMER: It's all right, I've got it.

1819
01:47:35,075 --> 01:47:36,534
Oh, dear.

1820
01:47:36,535 --> 01:47:44,625
And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

1821
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:47,461
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you?

1822
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:51,381
ROONEY: No, he's come to take him.
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.

1823
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:54,801
No, he can't go now! We won't permit it.

1824
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,387
We promise to take his bugle
away from him.

1825
01:47:57,388 --> 01:48:01,182
- We won't be separated from Teddy.
- I'm sorry.

1826
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:02,351
Mortimer...

1827
01:48:02,352 --> 01:48:04,644
How can you allow this? You promised.

1828
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:08,105
Brewster's got nothing to do with this.
The law is the law!

1829
01:48:08,107 --> 01:48:11,609
Teddy's committed himself
and he's got to go.

1830
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:17,740
ABBY: lf he's going, we're going, too!
MARTHA: You'll have to take us with him.

1831
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:20,660
Why not? Why not, indeed?

1832
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:23,621
MR. WITHERSPOON: It's sweet of them,
but impossible.

1833
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:27,124
We never take sane people at Happy Dale.

1834
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:30,169
Oh, no...no.

1835
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:34,590
These little sane people will get lost
in the shuffle. You could arrange that.

1836
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:37,842
Just put them in
and they'll get all mixed up.

1837
01:48:37,843 --> 01:48:43,431
Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

1838
01:48:43,432 --> 01:48:45,976
ROONEY: Now, let's be sensible, ladies.

1839
01:48:45,977 --> 01:48:49,437
Here I am wasting my time
when I could be doing some serious work.

1840
01:48:49,438 --> 01:48:52,023
There are still murders
to be solved in Brooklyn.

1841
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:55,402
It ain't only his bugle blowing.
Things are going to get worse.

1842
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:58,237
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

1843
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:00,823
Our cellar?

1844
01:49:00,824 --> 01:49:04,576
Teddy's been telling around
there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar.

1845
01:49:04,577 --> 01:49:12,960
There are 13 bodies in our cellar.

1846
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:13,877
What?

1847
01:49:13,878 --> 01:49:22,594
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

1848
01:49:22,595 --> 01:49:30,059
Charge!

1849
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,812
Isn't that amazing?

1850
01:49:32,813 --> 01:49:34,480
ABBY: You behave yourself.

1851
01:49:34,482 --> 01:49:37,775
You know very well there are
13 bodies down in our cellar.

1852
01:49:37,776 --> 01:49:40,111
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar.

1853
01:49:40,112 --> 01:49:48,368
And there are hundreds more
up in the attic, Captain!

1854
01:49:48,369 --> 01:49:50,787
- What is this?
- You mustn't mind Mortimer.

1855
01:49:50,788 --> 01:49:52,873
- How about it?
- I'll be right there.

1856
01:49:52,874 --> 01:49:54,875
He's been a little strange all day.

1857
01:49:54,876 --> 01:49:58,753
Right now I wouldn't know what is
and what ain't strange anymore.

1858
01:49:58,754 --> 01:50:01,840
- I'll look in that cellar.
- I'll tell you what we'll do.

1859
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:05,468
I'll bring my bodies from the attic
and you get yours from the cellar...

1860
01:50:05,469 --> 01:50:12,350
...and we'll get them all together,
and we'll send them to Happy Dale.

1861
01:50:12,351 --> 01:50:16,562
ABBY: No, you wouldn't have to dig.
The graves are all marked.

1862
01:50:16,563 --> 01:50:19,690
- We put flowers on them every Sunday.
- Flowers?

1863
01:50:19,691 --> 01:50:24,153
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

1864
01:50:24,154 --> 01:50:26,613
Humor them, humor them.

1865
01:50:26,614 --> 01:50:30,117
Smile.

1866
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:32,577
There's one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo...

1867
01:50:32,578 --> 01:50:33,871
Hasn't got it yet.

1868
01:50:33,872 --> 01:50:36,332
...who doesn't belong here
and has to leave.

1869
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:40,335
- But the other 12 are our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

1870
01:50:40,336 --> 01:50:44,547
You'd like mine better.
None of mine are gentlemen.

1871
01:50:44,549 --> 01:50:47,258
- You mustn't mind him at all.
- He got married today.

1872
01:50:47,259 --> 01:50:50,803
(Sings) "There is a Happy Dale far, far away

1873
01:50:50,804 --> 01:50:53,723
"There is a Happy"

1874
01:50:53,724 --> 01:50:57,185
Yeah, yeah.

1875
01:50:57,186 --> 01:50:59,854
He got it. It's amazing.

1876
01:50:59,855 --> 01:51:02,482
Don't you think you can find room
for the ladies?

1877
01:51:02,483 --> 01:51:05,526
Just the ladies?

1878
01:51:05,527 --> 01:51:08,278
Just the ladies!

1879
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:11,198
- How about it?
- They'd have to be committed.

1880
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:15,243
Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they?
All they have to do is sign the papers.

1881
01:51:15,244 --> 01:51:16,703
Certainly.

1882
01:51:16,704 --> 01:51:19,957
If we can go with Teddy,
we'll sign the papers.

1883
01:51:19,958 --> 01:51:21,083
Where are they?

1884
01:51:21,084 --> 01:51:23,585
MR. WITHERSPOON: I have them, ladies,
right here.

1885
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:26,838
Sign them up, will you?
I want this all cleaned up.

1886
01:51:26,839 --> 01:51:30,550
I'm going out to talk to that spy.
Maybe I can understand him.

1887
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:32,385
Thirteen bodies in the cellar.

1888
01:51:32,386 --> 01:51:45,856
MR. WITHERSPOON: Ladies,
if you'll sign right here.

1889
01:51:45,857 --> 01:51:47,399
ABBY: Here?
MR. WITHERSPOON: Yes.

1890
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,860
MR. WITHERSPOON:
It's on the right-hand side there.

1891
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:52,279
I'm really looking forward to going.

1892
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,823
The neighborhood here has changed so.

1893
01:51:54,825 --> 01:52:01,204
Yes. Especially since they won
that old pennant thing.

1894
01:52:01,205 --> 01:52:03,957
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
We've overlooked something.

1895
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:07,627
It's absolutely compulsory that we have
the signature of a physician.

1896
01:52:07,628 --> 01:52:08,920
MORTIMER: A doctor.

1897
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:11,673
Dr. Einstein! Come here
and sign some papers, please.

1898
01:52:11,674 --> 01:52:13,842
DR. EINSTEIN: Good night.
MORTIMER: Come here.

1899
01:52:13,843 --> 01:52:15,218
- A doctor?
- Yes.

1900
01:52:15,219 --> 01:52:21,099
Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier.
Come along, Doctor.

1901
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:23,726
Now, here. Just sign right here,
please, Doctor.

1902
01:52:23,727 --> 01:52:26,854
ABBY: Were you leaving, Doctor?
DR. EINSTEIN: Yes, please.

1903
01:52:26,855 --> 01:52:29,690
Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan?

1904
01:52:29,691 --> 01:52:32,818
I don't think we go to the same place.

1905
01:52:32,819 --> 01:52:36,530
ROONEY: Hello, Mac. We picked up
that guy that's wanted in lndiana.

1906
01:52:36,531 --> 01:52:39,741
His accomplice's description is
on the circular, on the desk.

1907
01:52:39,742 --> 01:52:43,412
Read it to me, will you?

1908
01:52:43,413 --> 01:52:45,164
About 40.

1909
01:52:45,165 --> 01:52:47,040
Five-foot-three.

1910
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:49,292
One hundred and forty pounds.

1911
01:52:49,293 --> 01:52:52,170
Pop eyes.

1912
01:52:52,171 --> 01:52:54,588
Talks with a German accent.

1913
01:52:54,590 --> 01:52:56,298
Poses as a doctor.

1914
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,967
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

1915
01:52:57,968 --> 01:53:01,387
It's all right. The doctor
has completed the signatures.

1916
01:53:01,388 --> 01:53:02,805
That's great!

1917
01:53:02,806 --> 01:53:11,522
Thanks, Doc.
You've done Brooklyn a great service.

1918
01:53:11,523 --> 01:53:16,860
ABBY: But Dr. Einstein!

1919
01:53:16,861 --> 01:53:20,447
- Now, Mr. Witherspoon--
- You're Witherspoon, I'm Brewster.

1920
01:53:20,448 --> 01:53:23,534
It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

1921
01:53:23,535 --> 01:53:25,785
- Don't play games--
- You sign.

1922
01:53:25,786 --> 01:53:28,288
You sign as next of kin.

1923
01:53:28,289 --> 01:53:33,751
Why didn't you say so?
I'm all confused. Don't mind me.

1924
01:53:33,752 --> 01:53:35,545
Mr. Witherport.

1925
01:53:35,546 --> 01:53:38,089
- Spoon.
- Here.

1926
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,843
Come up and pack my duffel.

1927
01:53:41,844 --> 01:53:43,135
Duffel?

1928
01:53:43,136 --> 01:53:46,180
Pack his duffel. He's President, you know?

1929
01:53:46,181 --> 01:53:50,017
TEDDY: And bring along my bugle.

1930
01:53:50,018 --> 01:54:00,485
President.

1931
01:54:00,486 --> 01:54:11,830
Don't charge!

1932
01:54:11,831 --> 01:54:15,083
Mortimer?

1933
01:54:15,084 --> 01:54:18,961
We're really very worried about something.

1934
01:54:18,962 --> 01:54:22,173
Now, darling, don't be worried.

1935
01:54:22,174 --> 01:54:26,260
- Me too, Mortimer.
- Well, of course, darling.

1936
01:54:26,261 --> 01:54:28,429
You'll both be very happy at Happy Dale.

1937
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:33,142
We're very happy about the whole thing,
but that's just it.

1938
01:54:33,143 --> 01:54:37,312
We don't want anything to go wrong.

1939
01:54:37,313 --> 01:54:41,150
Will they investigate those signatures?

1940
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:45,237
- They won't look up Dr. Einstein--
- But it's not his signature, dear.

1941
01:54:45,238 --> 01:54:47,239
- It's yours.
- Mine?

1942
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:50,784
You see, you signed as next of kin.

1943
01:54:50,785 --> 01:54:57,123
- What's wrong about that, darling?
- Martha, you tell him.

1944
01:54:57,124 --> 01:54:58,541
Well, dear.

1945
01:54:58,542 --> 01:55:03,838
- What, dear?
- You're not really a Brewster.

1946
01:55:03,839 --> 01:55:06,507
- What?
- Your mother came to us as a cook.

1947
01:55:06,508 --> 01:55:08,926
And you were born
about three months afterwards.

1948
01:55:08,927 --> 01:55:11,970
And she was such a sweet woman
and such a good cook...

1949
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:15,808
...we didn't want to lose her.
So brother married her.

1950
01:55:15,809 --> 01:55:18,018
Your real father was a cook, too.

1951
01:55:18,019 --> 01:55:23,356
He was a chef on a tramp steamer.

1952
01:55:23,357 --> 01:55:24,566
You mean...

1953
01:55:24,567 --> 01:55:29,863
You mean I'm not really a Brewster?

1954
01:55:29,864 --> 01:55:32,616
- Darling!
- Don't feel so badly about it.

1955
01:55:32,617 --> 01:55:37,120
I'm sure it won't make any difference
to Elaine.

1956
01:55:37,121 --> 01:55:43,375
(Mortimer squeals)

1957
01:55:43,377 --> 01:55:44,794
MORTIMER: (Shouts) Elaine!

1958
01:55:44,795 --> 01:55:47,964
Where are you? Can you hear me?
I'm not really a Brewster!

1959
01:55:47,965 --> 01:55:50,508
I'm the son of a sea cook!

1960
01:55:50,509 --> 01:55:53,802
(Elaine screams)

1961
01:55:53,803 --> 01:55:56,305
ELAINE: Mortimer!

1962
01:55:56,306 --> 01:55:58,641
It's true! I saw them. It's true.

1963
01:55:58,642 --> 01:56:01,435
It's true! There are 13 bodies down there!

1964
01:56:01,436 --> 01:56:04,771
But I saw them--

1965
01:56:04,772 --> 01:56:06,440
What's all this screaming about?

1966
01:56:06,441 --> 01:56:11,152
- But I saw them--
- It's way past her bedtime.

1967
01:56:11,153 --> 01:56:15,907
MORTIMER: Quiet!

1968
01:56:15,908 --> 01:56:18,201
ELAINE: But, Mortimer--
MORTIMER: Goodbye!

1969
01:56:18,202 --> 01:56:22,664
ABBY: 'Bye.
MARTHA: Goodbye, darling!

1970
01:56:22,665 --> 01:56:26,334
- What is all this?
- They're going on their honeymoon.

1971
01:56:26,335 --> 01:56:34,926
They're off to a flying start.

1972
01:56:34,927 --> 01:56:37,011
ELAINE: I really did see--

1973
01:56:37,012 --> 01:56:39,846
You'll own two cabs!

1974
01:56:39,847 --> 01:56:42,391
I mean the meter!

1975
01:56:42,392 --> 01:56:50,941
ELAINE: Oh, Mortimer.

1976
01:56:50,942 --> 01:56:54,945
(lmitates Elaine) Oh, Mortimer.

1977
01:56:54,946 --> 01:56:57,531
We're going to Niagara Falls.
Call me a cab, dear.

1978
01:56:57,532 --> 01:57:00,033
Yes, love.

1979
01:57:00,034 --> 01:57:01,785
But, Mr. Brewster!

1980
01:57:01,786 --> 01:57:06,080
I'm not a Brewster.
I'm a son of a sea cook.

1981
01:57:06,081 --> 01:57:09,167
MORTIMER: Charge!

1982
01:57:09,168 --> 01:57:13,705
CAB DRIVER: I'm not a cabdriver.
I'm a coffeepot!

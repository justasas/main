1
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,511
- Uh, Nick Di Santo.

2
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:33,138
I'm here to see my mom.

3
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,266
- Visiting.

4
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,184
Take the stairs to the second
floor, and someone

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,020
will meet you there.

6
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,397
- Second?

7
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:50,364
Can't we go out on
the grounds?

8
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:53,075
I mean, she wants to be private,
can't it be out in

9
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,910
the sunshine or under
a tree somewhere?

10
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:56,370
- Telling you, she
never goes out.

11
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:58,581
In all the years I've been here,
I've never even seen

12
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:00,207
here in the visitors' room.

13
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,375
- Look, she's my mom.

14
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,543
I...

15
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:04,044
I haven't talked to
her in years.

16
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:07,381
- Yeah, she did get made up
todayjust to see you.

17
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:17,516
Look, you get her to go out,
I'll be happy to take you.

18
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:20,144
Ms. Di Santo?

19
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,478
Your boy's here.

20
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:27,359
- What have you got her on?

21
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,236
She hasn't
been medicated today.

22
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,367
Bang on the door when
you're done.

23
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,591
- Hey.

24
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,472
You can look at me.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm
not sure I can.

26
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,016
Yes you can.

27
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,684
- Mm.

28
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,478
- Look at me.

29
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:21,497
Oh my.

30
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:33,425
You look like him.

31
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,762
- Why would you say that?

32
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:40,224
You said you didn't
remember him.

33
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,686
You said it was like trying
to remember a dream.

34
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:46,021
You said you didn't
know who he was.

35
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,196
Do you know who my father is?

36
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,619
What else do you know, Mom?

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:05,666
Mother!

38
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,008
- Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:14,633
Mom...

40
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,300
- No, no, no...

41
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,051
- I won't.

42
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:16,635
- Don't, don't.

43
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,177
- I won't.

44
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:17,678
Stop...

45
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:18,387
Mom...

46
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,388
look, I'm not...

47
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,014
I'm not gonna touch you, OK?

48
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,639
I won't.

49
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:21,849
- Then don't.

50
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,058
- Do you... do you want me
to get the orderly?

51
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,185
You want your medication
or something?

52
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:33,152
- I'm supposed to tell you
about your father.

53
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:41,201
And today is the day that
I promised I would.

54
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:48,542
- Wait, you prom... you
promised who?

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,669
- The things
in the wall.

56
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:03,390
They listen all the time, and
then they tell me what to do.

57
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:08,395
And Nicky, today is the day
that they told me I had to

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,563
tell you about him.

59
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,230
I'm...

60
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:11,148
I'm not...

61
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,191
I'm not...

62
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,192
I won't.

63
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:14,193
I'm warning you.

64
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,152
Oh, Nicky.

65
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,945
Hey!

66
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,155
- He's coming for you.

67
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:20,157
Hey!

68
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:21,283
- Please...

69
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:22,117
Open the
fucking door!

70
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,535
- Your father...

71
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:26,288
I only remember a nightmare!

72
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,290
- So what did she want to say?

73
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,711
- She wanted to let me know
that she's still crazy.

74
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,432
- So no birthday present, huh?

75
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,602
Let's go find one.

76
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:32,729
- Let's go drink one.

77
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:46,618
- Go, go, go.

78
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:47,786
Yeah, come on.

79
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,288
That's the guy, right
over there.

80
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:59,339
- Can I buy you guys a beer?

81
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:00,924
- Why?

82
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:05,971
- Is that Nick Di Santo?

83
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,639
What if it is?

84
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:09,099
You know him?

85
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,475
- What if I do?

86
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,813
- Can he do it?

87
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:15,772
You know what?

88
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,316
I don't care.

89
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,693
That is not what I said and
that is not what you said.

90
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,069
- Hey, uh, hit me again.

91
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:21,778
You know what?

92
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:22,613
I'm through.

93
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,363
Yeah.

94
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:24,156
No, I'm done.

95
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:25,449
I'm hanging up.

96
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,626
You got a number for a cab?

97
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,049
- Anything I can do?

98
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,437
Bet I got you beat.

99
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,234
For worst day ever.

100
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,405
- There's no way you could
beat this one.

101
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:15,123
What, did your dog
die or something?

102
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:27,177
Happy birthday!

103
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,553
Happy birthday!

104
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:36,436
- Yeah, 23's kind of a big one.

105
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,981
You don't know?

106
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:42,859
Um, it takes 23 seconds for
blood to circulate throughout

107
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:44,194
the human body.

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,447
In every person are 23
pairs of chromosomes.

109
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:53,954
And every 23rd wave that comes
to shore is twice as long and

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,165
twice as strong as the one
that came before it.

111
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:01,545
So 23 is kind of like this,
um, magic number.

112
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,926
I like 23.

113
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,055
How about
you do it, just one time?

114
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,310
I...

115
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,561
I just...

116
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:18,437
I want to know if you
can really do it.

117
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:22,107
- Hey, what'd I say?

118
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:22,816
- Do what?

119
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,359
- What are you doing?

120
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:25,319
Nick.

121
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,654
Don't...

122
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,572
no.

123
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:30,032
Relax.

124
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:31,325
Are you trying
to scare away the first

125
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,826
girl that doesn't think
you're Frankenstein?

126
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:35,162
- Well, if she's the one,
she won't run.

127
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:36,121
- Do not do this.

128
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:37,622
Please.

129
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,458
If you were sober, you
wouldn't do this.

130
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,501
- Hey, uh, Ronny says
he'll do it.

131
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,631
Just go up there.

132
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,383
Go put your hand on him.

133
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,259
Touch him.

134
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,385
- What?

135
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,305
- No, look, it doesn't
work that way.

136
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:54,056
I have to touch them.

137
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,432
That's rule one.

138
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,143
You can touch me all you want,
but it's not gonna work.

139
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,979
And rule two?

140
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:06,693
It has to be something bad,
something really bad, or I do

141
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,362
not see you.

142
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:09,863
There's no way to change it.

143
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:13,158
There's no information on
why or when or how...

144
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:14,201
I just see it.

145
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:15,243
- Could somebodyjust
tell me what

146
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,121
everybody's talking about?

147
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:21,375
- Sometimes he can touch somebody
and he can see how

148
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:22,918
they're going to die.

149
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,380
- Seriously?

150
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:31,551
- Hold up your hand.

151
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,469
- Nick, please.

152
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:33,553
Please, just sit down.

153
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,093
- Aaaahhhh!

154
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:13,635
Gotcha.

155
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:24,646
- Whoa!

156
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,356
- Whoa, man!

157
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,399
- What just happened?

158
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,358
- Come on, man, look at me.

159
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:29,234
Nicky!

160
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
- Are you kidding me?

161
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:31,069
Just get out of here!

162
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:31,695
- No, no, no.

163
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,863
What was that?

164
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:33,989
Did you see... did you
see something?

165
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:35,240
You just couldn't
leave it alone.

166
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:35,866
- No!

167
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:36,700
I want to know!

168
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:37,868
Did you see something?

169
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:38,702
Dude, come on.

170
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:39,453
Did you fucking...

171
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:42,497
- No, I want to know.

172
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:43,457
What happened?

173
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,082
- Shut the fuck up, Nicky.

174
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:44,708
- Ryo!

175
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:45,959
Shut up, Nicky.

176
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:46,710
I don't want to get my
ass kicked tonight.

177
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,044
- Ryo, look, man.

178
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,963
- What?

179
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,715
- I'm holding the lady's hand.

180
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,180
- And what?

181
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,316
- And everything's OK.

182
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:01,826
You didn't tell him?

183
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:02,619
- I...

184
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:07,874
I can't understand you.

185
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,459
What did you do?

186
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:14,714
- I did everything.

187
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,633
You were supposed to

188
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,760
tell him about me.

189
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:21,388
- I did everything you asked...

190
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,143
Excuse me?

191
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,353
- What?

192
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,271
I was just saying I should
pick up girls

193
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:30,397
at a bar more often.

194
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:31,273
- Uh, news flash...

195
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,358
I picked you up.

196
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,276
- Oh, no, no.

197
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,277
I do not think so.

198
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,280
- No, I know so.

199
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,322
- Really?

200
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,575
- "I'm holding the
lady's hand"?

201
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,118
That was your pick-up line?

202
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,417
Do you really see things when
you touch some people?

203
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,463
Bad things?

204
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,219
- You're gonna hear some
stuff about me.

205
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,559
You're gonna hear that I moved
from foster home to foster

206
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:11,146
home since I was nine.

207
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:16,818
And you're gonna hear that it
was because my mom committed

208
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,362
herself when I was eight.

209
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,539
That's
a long scar.

210
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,085
How'd you get it?

211
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:45,639
- When I was seven, I, um, I
thought if I, uh, hurt my

212
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:48,058
hands, they wouldn't hurt me.

213
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,855
- Nicky!

214
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:54,856
- What the fuck, man?

215
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,441
- Check out the "24 Hour News. "

216
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,859
Several area firefighters have

217
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,278
joined the right, and
more are expected.

218
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,573
Again, we have no confirmation
on what started the blaze, but

219
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,869
speculation aside, as this
dramatic footage shows, most

220
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,163
of the facilities residents
caught sleeping on the second

221
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,333
and third floors had little
chance of escape.

222
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,086
Though the number is still
rising, the body count is

223
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,880
already at 74, and the
firefighters expect to battle

224
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:21,508
the blaze through the night,
with fire departments from as

225
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:25,220
far west as Pomo and Wheaton
County expected to arrive on

226
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:26,971
the scene at any moment.

227
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:30,475
The building has a long and
colorful history and was one

228
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,477
of the oldest...

229
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:12,976
No, I...

230
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:15,311
I...

231
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:16,896
yes, of course.

232
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,484
Yes, I understand.

233
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,571
You can count on me.

234
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:27,949
You've always been able
to count on me.

235
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:30,285
Right.

236
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,661
Nick?

237
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:37,167
Come on in.

238
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,753
Just finishing up
a phone call.

239
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,628
I'm Judge Bing.

240
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,297
Have a seat.

241
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:54,559
Is it necessary to go
over the details of

242
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,895
your mother's death?

243
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:57,979
- Uh, no.

244
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,190
No, I know how my mother
died, Mr. Bing.

245
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:04,152
Respect Look, it's been
eight months.

246
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,529
I didn't even know
she had a will.

247
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,408
- And are you aware that there
is a lawsuit pending against

248
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,786
the institution?

249
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:15,288
- I have no interest
in suing anyone.

250
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:19,584
- Well, I thought you might be
particularly keen on that now.

251
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,587
Given recent unplanned
developments?

252
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,091
Life is full of surprises,
Nick.

253
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,303
This is the
reading of the will, right?

254
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,390
And there's no one else here?

255
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:38,061
- In accordance with your
mother's wishes, you alone are

256
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,065
to be here when I
give you this.

257
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,115
I'm sorry to say this
is all she left.

258
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:52,951
I mean,
well, what is all this?

259
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,335
- Per her instructions, I have
no knowledge of the content.

260
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,260
So if there's any way I can help
once you've been through

261
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:19,310
it all, anything you need,
don't hesitate to call.

262
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:41,124
- He has it.

263
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,547
And unless I miss my guess,
he's already found it.

264
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,104
How'd it go?

265
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,813
- Stay there.

266
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,648
I'm coming to you.

267
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:06,774
That file's from her attorney.

268
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,903
It's, uh, papers and
old pictures.

269
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,070
- And?

270
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,447
- What?

271
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:18,995
Come on, just sit down.

272
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:19,787
I want to show you something.

273
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:23,249
- Are you rich?

274
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,127
- Here.

275
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:29,005
You see it?

276
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,632
See what?

277
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:31,716
- The house.

278
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,176
Does that look familiar?

279
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:34,552
- Should it?

280
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,722
- Look, OK, guys, this house is
not some ordinary house.

281
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:39,265
This house and me go way back.

282
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,809
It's in all of my sketchbooks,
in every story I wrote as a

283
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:43,645
kid, and in just about every
class where they ever let me

284
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,229
draw something.

285
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,402
Look, I've been drawing
this house since I

286
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:54,155
could pick up a crayon.

287
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:55,531
Look at this.

288
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:56,699
Same house.

289
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,284
You see this circular
window at the top?

290
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,536
- Yeah.

291
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:03,039
I mean,
look at this.

292
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,123
Same house.

293
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:05,500
Age 12.

294
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:11,714
I mean, come on.

295
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,216
Look at all of these.

296
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,550
So you liked
to draw the same house when

297
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:15,468
you were a kid.

298
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:16,386
- Come on.

299
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:17,136
Come here, come here.

300
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:17,720
I need... get up.

301
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:18,388
Come here.

302
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:19,347
Come on, get up.

303
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:20,181
- I just want to sit down.

304
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,099
- Get up, come on.

305
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,392
I gotta show you
something, Eve.

306
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:23,393
You're gonna freak
out about this.

307
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,727
Ryo, come here, look at this.

308
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,020
This house has been in
my head all my life.

309
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,063
OK, so
you used to draw it.

310
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,648
Why are you acting all psycho?

311
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:32,276
- Look, Ryo, I'm still
drawing it.

312
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:40,118
Look, this house, maybe the
reason I started to think

313
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,953
about architecture in
the first place.

314
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,330
So you have
a tiny boner for old houses

315
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:45,540
with little round windows.

316
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:47,083
What the hell difference
does that make?

317
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:50,003
- Ryo, up until about an hour
ago, I didn't know this house

318
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:51,671
existed in the real world.

319
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:55,758
- So what?

320
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:56,968
You think this has something
to do with your dad?

321
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:57,927
Nicky,
even if it does

322
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,013
exist, what about it?

323
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,556
- I own it.

324
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,939
Yeah.

325
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,032
The directions
in the will had the

326
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,284
house in town on this road.

327
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,539
There's no sign a town
was ever here.

328
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,543
- This baby is sailing, man.

329
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:31,794
You did a lot of work on it.

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,379
- How are we supposed
to find a house

331
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:34,714
without a street address?

332
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,176
- Hey, babe, how you feeling?

333
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:43,765
Can we please just find a place
that has a bathroom?

334
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,225
- I can't find a town or
even a bowling alley

335
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,560
called River's End.

336
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:21,469
Oh my god, that

337
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:22,386
dog has three legs.

338
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,346
- So?

339
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,555
- So don't order any meat.

340
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,641
- That's quite a set ofwheels.

341
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,517
- Thank you.

342
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:28,643
It was my granddad's.

343
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:29,894
- Bathroom?

344
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,938
- Down the hall, past the
cigarette machine.

345
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,779
- Hey.

346
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:41,489
River's End, this...

347
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:42,365
this is it.

348
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,699
Ryo, look.

349
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,159
- Holy shit.

350
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,911
Look!

351
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,496
Look at this!

352
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:56,003
This house, we're
looking for it.

353
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,881
- Are you all those folks that
came through this morning?

354
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:01,592
- That van had a state
logo on it, Knoxie.

355
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,136
- This place?

356
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,096
I own it.

357
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:08,141
- You own Wormwood?

358
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:09,517
- Wormwood?

359
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,562
That's the name of the house?

360
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,231
- Yeah, after the flood
washed it away.

361
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:22,196
You know, food for the worms?

362
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:25,366
- You've never heard of
the Blackwater flood?

363
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:27,118
20-something years ago?

364
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:28,619
- It was the end, all right.

365
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:31,289
There is no River's End.

366
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,749
Washed away, all of it.

367
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,169
Town doesn't exist anymore...

368
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:37,628
same as your house.

369
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,922
- Unless you like old
wives' tales.

370
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,300
- Well, yeah, I might
like them.

371
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:44,927
- Don't shovel that shit
to these kids, Lucky.

372
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:48,681
- There's one story that says
that house is still standing.

373
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:57,273
Story says the flood hit
that house hard, but it

374
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:58,566
didn't take it down.

375
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,234
- Couldn't take it down.

376
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,529
- Just washed it from
here all the way

377
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:06,949
down to here somewhere.

378
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:10,244
- If you believe stories
for idiots and morons.

379
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,914
You got
some kind of deed?

380
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,499
'Cause you're about
23 years too late.

381
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,345
- What?

382
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,276
Nicky.

383
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:45,363
That house isn't the only way to
find out about your father

384
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,239
or anyone else.

385
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:47,615
- Hey.

386
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,202
That's weird.

387
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:54,288
Yeah, like
"Texas Chainsaw" weird.

388
00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:54,830
- Aughhh!

389
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:55,623
Look out!

390
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:00,336
- Hey.

391
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:01,170
- You all right?

392
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:01,671
- Hey.

393
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:02,922
- Yeah.

394
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:06,133
- You guys all right?

395
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,802
- You came out of nowhere, man.

396
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:08,970
Sorry.

397
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,513
You OK?

398
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,226
You OK?

399
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:17,979
That was close.

400
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:18,562
Is everybody all right?

401
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,689
- Yeah.

402
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,148
I am so sorry.

403
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:24,110
We haven't seen any other
cars out here all day.

404
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:24,735
I'm Chris.

405
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:25,820
- I'm Sam.

406
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:27,363
- That's Lillith.

407
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,075
- Hello.

408
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:31,784
- That your van?

409
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,996
- Yeah, PLS.

410
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,372
Public Land and Survey?

411
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,207
We're out here mapping the
valley for the state.

412
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,001
- Yeah, what are you
doing out here?

413
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,753
- Well, we were looking for a
house, till we found out that

414
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:44,422
it got washed down a ridge.

415
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:45,840
- Wormwood?

416
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:48,050
House that washed into the
valley during the flood?

417
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:49,302
- Yeah.

418
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:52,888
You guys think you know
something about that?

419
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:55,182
- Yeah, if you believe
in urban myths.

420
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:04,025
This
is Wormwood, huh?

421
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:12,742
Sam?

422
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:14,785
- Yeah, boss?

423
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:16,120
What she said.

424
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,122
We should just keep one
foot in reality here.

425
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,916
Any house, even if it survived
being ripped off its

426
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:23,461
foundation, would break into
kindling, crashing through

427
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:24,920
trees.

428
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,297
- Well, look, if there's any part
of it around here, like

429
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:29,133
a... a floorboard or a roof
shingle... anything...

430
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,384
I'd like to see it.

431
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,054
- Um, I'm telling you,
it's an urban myth.

432
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:36,682
- Get in your car.

433
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:38,267
Follow me.

434
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:40,978
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

435
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:42,313
- Aagghh!

436
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,314
- Mmph!

437
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,234
- Nicky, Nicky.

438
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:48,444
- Is he OK?

439
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,195
- Yes, he's OK.

440
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:50,529
He's OK.

441
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:51,572
He just... he gets dizzy spells
when he thinks too fast.

442
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:53,366
Nick?

443
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:54,867
Look at me.

444
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:59,246
How about you get back in the
car and sit down, OK?

445
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:01,207
- What do you mean?

446
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:05,044
- It's a long shot, but we mapped
something a few days

447
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,006
ago that I think you
need to see.

448
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,537
This is the old highway where
the flood took it out.

449
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:42,081
See this path through
the forest?

450
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:44,041
Something big definitely
came through here.

451
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,043
Yeah,
it's called a flood.

452
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:46,961
- No.

453
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:48,504
Look at the sway
of these trees.

454
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,756
It's way above the flood line.

455
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,591
- Come on, Chris, there's ravines
like this throughout

456
00:26:52,717 --> 00:26:53,551
the county.

457
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:54,885
- Thanks, Sam.

458
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:56,929
But on this team, I'm the
arboriculturalist.

459
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,431
- God, not that word again.

460
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,057
- He likes to say that 'cause
he thinks it sounds dirty.

461
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:03,811
- No, wait, so you're
a tree guy, right?

462
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:05,813
- Nicky, Nicky.

463
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,356
Baby, come back up
here with me, OK?

464
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:09,984
Yeah, come on,
Nick, why don't you, huh?

465
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,901
Baby, now.

466
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:11,527
Please?

467
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,112
- What?

468
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,544
- At least one house
came through here.

469
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:35,593
It's, uh, it's a long shot.

470
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,471
But we could all go for
a quick little hike.

471
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:44,727
- He said it was a long
shot, Nicky.

472
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:48,355
- A shot's still a shot, Evie.

473
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:49,899
Come on.

474
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,776
You gonna be OK here if I...
if I take a quick look?

475
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,612
- I'm not hiking, if that's
what you mean.

476
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:55,779
- It's only gonna be
a few minutes.

477
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:56,947
Ryo, can you stay
here with her?

478
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:57,531
Please?

479
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:58,949
All right?

480
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:00,493
Come on, Sam,
I know you want to come.

481
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,994
- Yeah, I'm only going to see
your face when all you find is

482
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,163
poison ivy and a couple
of humping beavers.

483
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,083
- Lil?

484
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,211
- Ooh, thanks, but uh, I think
I'll stay with Eve.

485
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:11,587
- That's a great idea.

486
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:18,344
I'm leaving
in the van if you guys

487
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,304
aren't back here
in 10 minutes.

488
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,181
And I'm taking Eve with me.

489
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:23,140
- Eve.

490
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:24,642
I love you.

491
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:31,190
- See how the slip plane
moves across?

492
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,692
This isn't just from
the water.

493
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:34,985
It is...

494
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,279
- So I just follow where
the trees are clear?

495
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,656
- Yeah, exactly.

496
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:43,911
Nick!

497
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:45,371
Nicky, slow down!

498
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,583
Nicky!

499
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:54,213
Nicky!

500
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,548
Come on!

501
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:02,680
We're gonna
get lost out here.

502
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,307
You gonna be OK?

503
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:07,059
We gotta get back.

504
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:13,440
Little window.

505
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:14,942
Right, Nicky?

506
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,114
Little round window
at the top?

507
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,990
- What the hell are
we looking at?

508
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:17,921
This is wrong.

509
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,048
Come on, this is wrong.

510
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:21,050
It should have been
pulverized.

511
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,593
This can't be the same house.

512
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,136
- Oh, yeah?

513
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:25,512
Then what is it?

514
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,121
That's not
even from this house.

515
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:52,623
You gonna tell
me this whole place just

516
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,708
crashed here, perfectly level?

517
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:58,921
- Well, maybe someone
leveled it.

518
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:01,590
I think a lot of big stuff must
have washed through here.

519
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:10,265
And when the house did, I think
that's the tree that

520
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:11,934
finally stopped it.

521
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,603
- I just got this
really weird feeling, Ryan.

522
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:21,694
I drew this.

523
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,904
I dreamed this.

524
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,324
And now I'm standing in
front of it, like I'm

525
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,868
the reason it's here.

526
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:32,079
Like it's holding
on, just for me.

527
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,664
Stop right there.

528
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:48,011
Now turn around and walk away.

529
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,725
- Look, don't get
the wrong idea.

530
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:55,686
We're, uh, Public
Land and Survey.

531
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:13,954
I'm Sam.

532
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:17,499
- I know who you are, Sammael.

533
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,252
- Heh.

534
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:21,628
It... it's Sam.

535
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,355
- You with the state, too?

536
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:41,106
- No.

537
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,983
I'm with...

538
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,985
- Look, if we ended up somewhere
we shouldn't be, we

539
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:46,862
apologize, Mister...?

540
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,115
- My name's Seth.

541
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:52,826
That's all you need to know.

542
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:55,162
And let me tell you something
else, Sammael.

543
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:56,580
- It's Sam.

544
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:57,998
- I don't know what you think
you're doing here, or what

545
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,959
claim you think you have
to this house...

546
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:02,544
- We're just mapping
the valley.

547
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,671
- But if this is about eminent
domain or any of that state

548
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:05,631
bullshit...

549
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:06,757
- It's a geodesic survey.

550
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:07,716
We don't care about
this house.

551
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,343
- Make no mistake.

552
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:15,557
I've been swinging a hammer in
it since before you were born.

553
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,392
I've been working this
place forever.

554
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,774
And I'm here to stay.

555
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:25,859
- We don't want any trouble.

556
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:29,196
- Then you best be on your way.

557
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:30,489
- I th...

558
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:32,074
I think you're probably right.

559
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,124
- Wait.

560
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,501
The people that lived here.

561
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:46,380
Do you know anything
about them?

562
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,966
- No, Nicky.

563
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,635
- The man who used to live
here 20 years ago.

564
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,178
- What about him?

565
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,474
- I just want to know his name.

566
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,729
- No.

567
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:04,231
No you don't.

568
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:09,820
- Look, this house is in
my mother's will.

569
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,446
These people might
be my family.

570
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,869
I have the deed.

571
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:18,203
- I don't care what you have.

572
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,205
What you came looking
for isn't here.

573
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:23,250
- You do not know what
I came looking for.

574
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:42,561
- Just you.

575
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,564
Not your buddy.

576
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,274
And no one from the state.

577
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:56,491
You want to see this house
you think is yours?

578
00:34:56,618 --> 00:34:59,745
Come on.

579
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:01,747
- What, do you think he's
a fucking realtor?

580
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,248
Look at him.

581
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:06,293
Nick!

582
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,503
Your old man's not in there!

583
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,027
I drew this
house when I was a kid.

584
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,451
God, it had all of this in it.

585
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:42,037
Every room, upstairs.

586
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:47,542
Downstairs.

587
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:53,632
- What is that?

588
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:02,307
What's in the walls?

589
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:04,810
- Rats?

590
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:13,610
- That's abhorrent.

591
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,625
That's the
tree at the side of the house.

592
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:31,420
- They lynched people
from that tree.

593
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,633
You ever see a hanging
tree, boy?

594
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,304
- Who lives here?

595
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:43,515
- Look around.

596
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,225
Nobody lives here.

597
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:47,310
- Who used to live here?

598
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,443
- What the hell is that?

599
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,113
What's that in the chimney?

600
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,658
The deed
you have to this house is

601
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:06,038
worthless, just like
the house.

602
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:10,250
- Look, I just want to know
if people from my

603
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,252
family lived here.

604
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:13,628
Nick!

605
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,135
Hey.

606
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:21,094
Time's up.

607
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,012
Let's go, buddy.

608
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,889
Let's get back to the car, OK?

609
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:26,224
Sam and Chris say
they have help '

610
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:28,393
How do you
like your house, Nick?

611
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,148
You seen enough?

612
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:37,027
Are you not understanding
something, Nick?

613
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:41,406
When the flood came and wiped
out this town, people blamed...

614
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,949
this house!

615
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:48,246
Did you know that?

616
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,959
Survivors called it the Second
Flood of Noah because they

617
00:37:53,086 --> 00:38:01,718
thought it came from God to wash
away this house and all

618
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:04,179
the horrors that came with it.

619
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,306
This place was ripped
from the earth and

620
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:09,142
slammed into that tree.

621
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,937
Instead of a pile of broken
sticks, it's all still here.

622
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:14,356
Chairs, tables, chandeliers...

623
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:16,191
they shouldn't be here, Nick.

624
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:17,901
- I thought you said
that was you.

625
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:21,696
You said you'd been swinging
a hammer in here for years.

626
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:23,949
- I have.

627
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:27,744
I've been trying to
tear it down.

628
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,371
Nick, let's go!

629
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:53,520
You tell you
friend to run as fast and as

630
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:55,730
far away as he can.

631
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,274
Nicky?

632
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:04,197
- And you run with him,
and never come back.

633
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:05,657
Nick!

634
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,450
There's some guys out here!

635
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:12,038
- You come back here, it'll be
the last thing you'll ever

636
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:13,415
remember doing.

637
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:20,172
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

638
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:54,915
- They're trying to cut us off!

639
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,541
- Who the hell are these guys?

640
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,293
- What the hell are these guys?

641
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:24,110
- Go, go, go.

642
00:40:24,195 --> 00:40:24,861
Ryan?

643
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:27,072
Yeah, I think...

644
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,448
- Yeah.

645
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:34,454
- Whoa!

646
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,122
- What the fuck happened?

647
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:36,873
- What?

648
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:37,874
- What did he say to you?

649
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,833
- He didn't say anything!

650
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,377
- What did you say to him?

651
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:41,670
- Get the fuck off of him.

652
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:43,797
- Look, I do not know what's
going on, OK?

653
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,257
- Did he say something
to you or not?

654
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:01,523
- Uughh!

655
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:05,068
Aaah!

656
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:16,079
Nnnnghh!

657
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:17,455
Unngh!

658
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,460
Hahhh!

659
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,006
Aaaghh!

660
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,011
Auurrrghhh!

661
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:40,353
Aah!

662
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,952
- Ooh!

663
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:58,788
There was a kick.

664
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:00,540
- How far along are you?

665
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,168
- Yeah, just far enough along to
wonder what the hell we're

666
00:42:03,294 --> 00:42:06,463
doing out here.

667
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:09,591
- Can I?

668
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:12,135
- Sure.

669
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:12,844
Ooh!

670
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,262
Did you feel that?

671
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:22,062
- You know, they say that they
can feel things in there.

672
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:28,568
Joy, fear...

673
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:30,362
whatever the mother's feeling.

674
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:32,072
- God!

675
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:36,034
He's really worked up
about something.

676
00:42:36,202 --> 00:42:39,788
- Well, maybe he just doesn't
like strangers?

677
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:40,747
Evie!

678
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:42,707
- What?

679
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,751
What are they saying?

680
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,378
Evie!

681
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,504
- What?

682
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,254
Evie!

683
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:49,464
Get in the car!

684
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,548
Get in the car!

685
00:42:50,716 --> 00:42:51,549
Get in the car!

686
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:52,550
Get in the car!

687
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:55,637
- What the fuck is going on?

688
00:42:55,763 --> 00:42:57,138
Get in the van!

689
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:01,476
Get in the van!

690
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:03,269
Get in the car!

691
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:06,439
Get in the van!

692
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:07,482
- Fuck the car!

693
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:08,900
Get in the van!

694
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:10,485
Get in the van!

695
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:11,486
- Go, go, go, go.

696
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:12,070
- Go!

697
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:12,821
Go!

698
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:14,406
Go!

699
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:17,033
- Go!

700
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:17,784
Go!

701
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,576
Move this fucking thing!

702
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:41,307
- Oh, fuck!

703
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:42,434
- Who the fuck are they?

704
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,102
- How'd they get in
front of us?

705
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,276
- Aauughhh!

706
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,584
Get him off!

707
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,960
- Get him off!

708
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:09,961
Get him off!

709
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:11,171
- Get him off, get him off!

710
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:12,547
- I'm trying!

711
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,058
What the fuck?

712
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,643
What the fuck?

713
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:44,537
- Where's Sam?

714
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,184
- Where is everybody?

715
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:09,479
Diner
looks closed.

716
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:12,524
- Lillith?

717
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,362
Lillith?

718
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:23,034
Hello?

719
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,204
- Anyone back there?

720
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,673
Hello?

721
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,677
Anybody?

722
00:45:56,235 --> 00:45:57,986
- What are you looking at?

723
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:22,385
- I'll make sure Nick gets
back to the house.

724
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:23,720
You have my word.

725
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:25,972
I'll bring your followers
together to fight.

726
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,057
Yes, Lucky.

727
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:29,309
Don't worry.

728
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:31,811
We'll get the 23.

729
00:46:31,895 --> 00:46:34,147
You will rise.

730
00:46:34,273 --> 00:46:36,190
We will all rise.

731
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:49,954
- No, I just told you.

732
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,873
On a state highway off
an old flood road.

733
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,833
Look, we just passed
Worthington, OK?

734
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:54,667
It's the county seat.

735
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:56,669
And where are you?

736
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:57,545
Hello?

737
00:46:57,713 --> 00:46:59,047
God!

738
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:00,298
I cannot stay connected long
enough to talk to anybody.

739
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:00,965
- Forget it.

740
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,175
I tried.

741
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:03,301
- None of the phones have
been working today.

742
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:04,719
- Nick, what happened in there?

743
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:05,470
What happened?

744
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:06,179
- What was said?

745
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:07,430
- Yeah, man.

746
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:08,848
- I told you, he tried
to scare me, OK?

747
00:47:08,974 --> 00:47:10,058
He must have been hiding
something.

748
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,560
- Yes, my first guess is drugs.

749
00:47:12,686 --> 00:47:13,853
I mean, look at the guy.

750
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:15,480
Look at his gang of inbreds.

751
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:16,898
They don't even fucking
walk upright.

752
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:18,316
- Yeah, well, they know how
to throw a fucking axe.

753
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:20,109
- He's running something illegal
out of that house.

754
00:47:20,277 --> 00:47:21,611
Bet on it.

755
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:22,779
- Or he's just some hillbilly
lunatic who thinks the state's

756
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:23,738
gonna take his house.

757
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:24,530
- Oh my god!

758
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:27,367
- Oh, shit!

759
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:32,830
- Stop!

760
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:34,957
- I'm standing on the brake!

761
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,642
- Sorry about that.

762
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:03,695
Are you OK?

763
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,863
Are you OK?

764
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:06,739
OK.

765
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:49,031
- What the fuck did you do?

766
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:51,033
You drove us in a
fucking circle?

767
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,951
- What are you talking about?

768
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:53,244
That can't be the house.

769
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,287
- Then I hell is it?

770
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:56,330
- We left the house
30 miles back in

771
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:57,749
the opposite direction.

772
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:58,666
You drove
us in a circle and

773
00:48:58,792 --> 00:48:59,667
you didn't know it?

774
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:00,668
How?

775
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:02,128
We all saw the signs.

776
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:03,463
We were heading south.

777
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,964
The house was north.

778
00:49:07,468 --> 00:49:08,885
Nick?

779
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:12,305
Nicky?

780
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,977
I smell gasoline.

781
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:18,644
- What?

782
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:21,147
- I smell gasoline.

783
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:21,647
- Oh, Jesus.

784
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:22,982
- OK, OK.

785
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:23,983
Come
on, come on.

786
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:25,359
Let me get you out of here.

787
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:26,068
To where?

788
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:26,652
Where?

789
00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:27,487
- Anywhere.

790
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:28,362
Just away from this van.

791
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:29,197
- I have to sit down.

792
00:49:29,364 --> 00:49:29,989
I have to sit down.

793
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:35,328
- Hey, wasn't that guy the guy
from the diner we almost hit

794
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:36,037
up there?

795
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:37,163
- Up where?

796
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:38,414
What the hell are you
talking about?

797
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,041
I don't even see the ridge
that we came from.

798
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:41,626
- No, look, he's got to be
getting help though, right?

799
00:49:41,752 --> 00:49:43,252
- Well, shouldn't one of us at
least try to get back to the

800
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:45,421
road to let them know
where to find us?

801
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:48,716
He kicked.

802
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:52,762
- But... but that's good,
though, right?

803
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,305
Nick, feel.

804
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:03,898
There's
nobody in the surrounding

805
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:04,941
forest that I can see.

806
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,944
And, uh, the house is empty.

807
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:08,778
- What?

808
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:10,112
You went inside?

809
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,156
- I didn't think it could
be the same house.

810
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:13,074
- And?

811
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,284
- Same porch.

812
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:16,035
Same tree.

813
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,287
Same lion out front.

814
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:22,333
I swear, I did not drive us in
a circle, but unless that

815
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:25,294
house is following us, that
must be what I did.

816
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:26,337
I'm sorry.

817
00:50:26,463 --> 00:50:27,964
- This is fucking great,
you guys.

818
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,800
- Evie, Evie, it's gonna
be OK, all right?

819
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,301
I'm gonna fix this.

820
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:33,845
- How?

821
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:36,138
It's gonna be cold and
dark soon, and I'm really

822
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:37,473
not feeling well.

823
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,141
We need
to keep her warm, Nick.

824
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:42,019
We need shelter where she can
rest while we get help.

825
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:54,699
- Nick?

826
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,209
- You sure the house is empty?

827
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,306
If that's some
kind of drug lab, then

828
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:19,223
what are we doing?

829
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,932
- It's nothing like that.

830
00:51:20,058 --> 00:51:21,183
I told you, it's empty.

831
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,436
Then why was Seth there
with those axemen?

832
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,271
- No one lives here, Evie, OK?

833
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:26,564
Trust me, no one.

834
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,608
- Is anybody else thinking
what I'm thinking?

835
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:30,151
Forest, ravine, car?

836
00:51:30,277 --> 00:51:31,944
So the car
could still be sitting there?

837
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:34,447
- Unless those maniacs
chopped it up.

838
00:51:34,573 --> 00:51:35,615
- Well, should we try and see?

839
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:36,949
- Come on, we'd never
make it by dark.

840
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:38,492
And Evie can't make it
anywhere right now.

841
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:40,202
- Well, I would rather go into
the woods than stay inside

842
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,495
that place.

843
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:42,455
- Oh, in the same woods where
they murdered Sam?

844
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:43,205
Sshh!

845
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,041
Please, shut up!

846
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:46,667
We don't need to broadcast
ourselves.

847
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:53,299
Nick, it's
like you're all ganging up

848
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,717
against me.

849
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:56,552
How am I the only one that
thinks this is a bad idea?

850
00:52:04,728 --> 00:52:05,978
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

851
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:07,229
- There is no way that I'm
staying in there.

852
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:08,147
- Stop it.

853
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:09,190
Look at me, OK?

854
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:09,941
Listen.

855
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:11,192
We find one room.

856
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,361
We wait until the
sun comes up.

857
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:14,236
That's it.

858
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:15,154
That's all we do, OK?

859
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,282
- What if those men come back?

860
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,618
- Hey.

861
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:22,203
Look at this.

862
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,538
You see that window?

863
00:52:24,665 --> 00:52:29,210
That overlooks the
entire yard.

864
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:29,794
OK?

865
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,128
Hey, come here.

866
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:33,381
Come here.

867
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:34,507
Come on, look at this window.

868
00:52:34,633 --> 00:52:36,133
We can see the side
yard too, OK?

869
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:38,511
We'll... we'll put one man on
the back porch, one in the

870
00:52:38,637 --> 00:52:40,721
front, and we'll see
anyone coming.

871
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:42,306
- Not after dark, we won't.

872
00:52:42,432 --> 00:52:43,641
- Come on, Evie, OK?

873
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,559
We cannot drag you through
the woods tonight.

874
00:52:45,686 --> 00:52:47,812
We have to keep you and the
baby warm and safe until...

875
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:49,355
- Don't make this just about me.

876
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:50,648
- I'm not.

877
00:52:50,732 --> 00:52:51,983
This is best for everybody.

878
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:53,651
- Is it?

879
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:55,569
There's not a part of this,
Nick, that's you

880
00:52:55,696 --> 00:52:57,071
wanting to be here?

881
00:53:01,368 --> 00:53:04,578
It's not a part of it?

882
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:05,997
What is it, exactly?

883
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:07,957
What is it that you think that's
here that's going to

884
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,333
solve any puzzles for you?

885
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,610
- Evie.

886
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:47,079
Do you see those?

887
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,211
- Do I see what?

888
00:54:00,552 --> 00:54:02,845
- Nnnnghhhh!

889
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:03,679
Nicky!

890
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:04,388
What's happening!

891
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:05,639
- Nnnnnghhhhh!

892
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:06,557
What's
happening, Nicky?

893
00:54:06,683 --> 00:54:08,017
What's happening, Nicky?

894
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:11,020
Nicky!

895
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:14,148
No!

896
00:54:14,232 --> 00:54:15,816
Get off me!

897
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:17,026
Help!

898
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:18,027
Nicky!

899
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:18,819
- Get back!

900
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,404
- Nnnggghhh!

901
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:21,947
- Nicky!

902
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:28,704
- Ah!

903
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:31,957
Nick!

904
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:32,583
- Nicky!

905
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:33,292
Nicky, Nicky!

906
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:34,043
Nicky, wake up.

907
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:34,877
Nicky, please wake up.

908
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:35,503
Nick.

909
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:36,337
Nick.

910
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:37,129
Nicky, look at me.

911
00:54:37,255 --> 00:54:37,630
Nicky, wake up.

912
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:38,464
Nicky?

913
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:39,548
Ryan.

914
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:40,674
Ryan, wake him up,
wake him up.

915
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:41,467
Nicky,
look at me.

916
00:54:41,593 --> 00:54:42,468
Nicky, wake up.

917
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:43,594
Baby, baby.

918
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,553
Wake up, Nicky.

919
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:45,888
Nicky, you gotta wake up.

920
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:47,098
Wake up, Nicky.

921
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:48,641
Baby, wake up.

922
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:07,034
So the good
news is he's still breathing

923
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,537
and he's got a regular pulse.

924
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:12,498
- Then why isn't he waking up?

925
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:14,834
- I don't know.

926
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,711
But look at his eyelids.

927
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,422
That's REM sleep.

928
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:22,007
He's dreaming.

929
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:27,179
Lillith says there's some stuff
that we should go back

930
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:28,889
and get in the van.

931
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:32,434
You watch him, OK?

932
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,019
Hey.

933
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:37,731
Since you decided not to have
the baby tonight, maybe you

934
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,525
could find some more candles.

935
00:56:34,581 --> 00:56:36,207
- How quiet
can you be?

936
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:48,010
Mmm.

937
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:48,469
- Mmm.

938
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:49,970
- Mm!

939
00:57:01,066 --> 00:57:03,692
- No.

940
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:06,737
Get back to the house.

941
00:57:06,863 --> 00:57:08,948
You'll know when to go in.

942
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:25,417
- Hey.

943
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:30,964
It's so good to see you
with your eyes open.

944
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:39,807
- How long was I out?

945
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:40,557
30 minutes?

946
00:59:40,683 --> 00:59:42,559
- Where's Ryo?

947
00:59:42,727 --> 00:59:44,937
- Uh, he and Lillith
went to the van.

948
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,317
What happened out there?

949
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:56,281
You were touching the tree.

950
00:59:56,366 --> 01:00:00,828
- That tree's a hanging
tree, Evie.

951
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:04,123
Just like Seth said.

952
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,042
One of the bodies is
from the Civil War.

953
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,424
How would I see someone
who's already died?

954
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,302
How would I see anyone?

955
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:20,472
I wasn't touching a person.

956
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,057
I was touching a tree.

957
01:00:29,899 --> 01:00:31,358
- Do you remember touching
the baby?

958
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:40,117
You said you never wanted to
touch him 'cause you never

959
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:41,493
wanted to know.

960
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:56,049
What did you see?

961
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:01,054
Is it something bad?

962
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:03,056
Is that what gave
you the seizure?

963
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,482
- All I saw was our baby.

964
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:16,612
- Yeah?

965
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:21,450
- And he wants out.

966
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:32,628
Oh.

967
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:34,213
Took you long enough.

968
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,549
All
right, Nicky.

969
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:39,468
Alive and kicking, huh?

970
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,030
This ain't.

971
01:02:00,156 --> 01:02:01,365
I can surf, but I can't
make a phone call.

972
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:02,699
- What happened?

973
01:02:07,372 --> 01:02:08,455
Tell me.

974
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:09,414
Tell you what?

975
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:10,207
- Why you smell like that.

976
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:10,791
- Smell like what?

977
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:12,167
- Like sex.

978
01:02:14,546 --> 01:02:16,421
- What are you, some kind of a
bloodhound all of a sudden?

979
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:17,714
- Lillith?

980
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:19,341
You've got to
be kidding me, Ryo!

981
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,217
- It was her, OK?

982
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:20,968
It wasn't me.

983
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:22,469
She was all over me.

984
01:02:22,595 --> 01:02:24,137
- We're out here worried about
getting our fucking heads

985
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:25,681
chopped off by these
lunatics...

986
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:26,557
- What are you?

987
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:27,724
Pissed off orjealous?

988
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,726
- They could have snuck
up on you!

989
01:02:29,894 --> 01:02:31,728
- Don't you ever grab me!

990
01:02:31,854 --> 01:02:33,313
- I grabbed your fucking
jacket.

991
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:35,774
- That's the only thing I have
ever asked you, in all of the

992
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:38,986
years that we've been friends.

993
01:02:46,536 --> 01:02:47,953
What happened under that tree?

994
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:53,917
- I don't know.

995
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:56,128
I know
you saw something.

996
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:57,504
What did you see?

997
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:07,556
What did you see?

998
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,642
- Hey, get in here.

999
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,227
Hurry up!

1000
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:22,946
There's
something big in this wall.

1001
01:03:23,072 --> 01:03:26,074
- I just think that tree lets
critters inside the framework.

1002
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:26,950
I mean...

1003
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:31,371
- What the hell is that?

1004
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:48,180
- We need that flashlight.

1005
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:49,556
- OK.

1006
01:03:54,604 --> 01:03:56,396
- Ready?

1007
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:57,397
- Aahh!

1008
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:05,697
Ready?

1009
01:04:05,823 --> 01:04:08,033
- Hey, you're not
gonna kill it.

1010
01:04:18,878 --> 01:04:20,087
- I can't see anything.

1011
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:22,255
- Come on, you're torturing it.

1012
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:33,141
Nick, stop it.

1013
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:34,142
This is cruel.

1014
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:35,018
- I... what?

1015
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:36,144
I just want to see what it is.

1016
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,521
- Well, you don't know
what it is.

1017
01:04:37,647 --> 01:04:38,689
It could be... it could
be dangerous.

1018
01:04:54,038 --> 01:04:55,497
- Back up, back up, back up.

1019
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:01,378
- What
are you gonna do?

1020
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:02,379
Ryan!

1021
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:13,724
- What the...

1022
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:15,308
the fuck?

1023
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:31,950
What
did we do to it?

1024
01:05:32,076 --> 01:05:34,202
- We popped it like a zit.

1025
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:35,245
Jeez.

1026
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:39,583
There's nothing in
there but goop.

1027
01:05:39,709 --> 01:05:41,960
Holy, holy shit.

1028
01:05:42,128 --> 01:05:44,546
- Guys, shouldn't someone be
outside watching the house?

1029
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:45,297
- Yeah.

1030
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:46,965
She's right.

1031
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:47,924
I'll take the back.

1032
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,468
- I'll take the front.

1033
01:05:56,142 --> 01:05:58,477
- Nick, I don't want
to be here.

1034
01:05:58,644 --> 01:05:59,770
I'm serious.

1035
01:05:59,896 --> 01:06:01,813
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

1036
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:04,691
Come on.

1037
01:06:04,817 --> 01:06:06,026
We should stay where
it's warm.

1038
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:07,861
We shouldn't
stay here at all.

1039
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:31,593
Nicky.

1040
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:47,400
Peekaboo, I see you.

1041
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:53,782
I'm down here.

1042
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,575
My little Nicky.

1043
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,457
I remember when I used
to call you that.

1044
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:10,841
- Mom?

1045
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,801
What are you doing in there?

1046
01:07:12,927 --> 01:07:14,719
- We're all trapped in here.

1047
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:17,556
Your father, Nicky.

1048
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:19,224
He's trapped in here, too.

1049
01:07:23,396 --> 01:07:24,688
The door to the cellar...

1050
01:07:24,814 --> 01:07:27,023
you need to open it.

1051
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:33,363
- Are you really my mother?

1052
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:34,948
Look at me.

1053
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:39,828
- I can't.

1054
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:42,664
I'm not beautiful anymore.

1055
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,708
- Why?

1056
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,209
What do you mean?

1057
01:07:46,335 --> 01:07:48,378
- I mean, tell your
friend to stop swinging that

1058
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:49,921
goddamn bat!

1059
01:08:52,276 --> 01:08:53,610
I think
you're looking at a door

1060
01:08:53,736 --> 01:08:55,487
that's never gonna open again.

1061
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:58,573
Not with those roots
jamming it shut.

1062
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:01,034
Wanna give this a try?

1063
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:03,536
Yeah, no telling what's
down there.

1064
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:04,746
- I know.

1065
01:09:04,872 --> 01:09:06,247
It's the only room
I've never drawn.

1066
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:07,540
Never could.

1067
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,043
- On three.

1068
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:12,462
One, two, three.

1069
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,394
- What are you guys doing?

1070
01:09:31,107 --> 01:09:32,732
- The things in the walls
are down there.

1071
01:09:35,653 --> 01:09:36,736
- What?

1072
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:37,779
I just want to see
what's down here.

1073
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:39,531
- Close it, now.

1074
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:54,170
Guys!

1075
01:09:56,298 --> 01:09:57,549
Guys!

1076
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:03,471
Now, goddamn it!

1077
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:04,597
- Jesus Christ, calm down!

1078
01:10:04,724 --> 01:10:05,223
Hey!

1079
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:06,391
Axemen!

1080
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:08,476
Axemen everywhere!

1081
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:09,894
They're
everywhere.

1082
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:13,064
They're all over the place.

1083
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:28,139
It's crazy.

1084
01:11:28,307 --> 01:11:29,974
They're all over out
there, just looking

1085
01:11:30,101 --> 01:11:31,392
like they're asleep.

1086
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:34,938
They're all over the backyard,
like statues.

1087
01:11:35,064 --> 01:11:35,897
- Where the fuck do we go?

1088
01:11:36,023 --> 01:11:36,856
- Where do you think?

1089
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:40,151
- We only have the cellar.

1090
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:49,869
Go, go, go, go!

1091
01:12:22,361 --> 01:12:23,570
- It's the door.

1092
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:25,405
The door triggers them.

1093
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:31,369
- What the fuck do we do?

1094
01:12:31,495 --> 01:12:33,496
- For starters, we stay away
from that fucking door.

1095
01:12:33,622 --> 01:12:35,081
Come on.

1096
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:40,128
- Where the hell are
we gonna go?

1097
01:12:40,254 --> 01:12:41,671
- Where the hell are we going?

1098
01:12:41,797 --> 01:12:43,089
- I guess we're going
back to the car.

1099
01:12:43,215 --> 01:12:45,300
- You mean, if you hope
it's still there.

1100
01:12:50,598 --> 01:12:52,348
- Do not let go of my hand.

1101
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:53,785
- Run!

1102
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:09,092
- They're gaining!

1103
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:24,190
Come on!

1104
01:14:24,358 --> 01:14:25,191
- Nicky!

1105
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:26,192
- Evie, go!

1106
01:14:26,318 --> 01:14:27,694
- Nicky!

1107
01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:28,403
- Go now!

1108
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:29,028
- Come on!

1109
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:30,238
- Nicky!

1110
01:14:34,743 --> 01:14:35,493
- Hey!

1111
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,578
Over here, asshole!

1112
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:38,371
Hey!

1113
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:39,330
Right here!

1114
01:14:39,456 --> 01:14:40,707
Hey.

1115
01:14:51,218 --> 01:14:54,304
Oh my god!

1116
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:02,145
Get in, get in!

1117
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:23,124
- Did you see Evie or Lillith?

1118
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:25,168
Oh, god, they had one of them
right on their tail.

1119
01:15:25,294 --> 01:15:29,047
I tried to stop him, but he
wouldn't even look at me.

1120
01:15:29,173 --> 01:15:30,631
I don't what happened to them.

1121
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:10,296
- Oh, it's Sam.

1122
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:12,673
They just
left him there like that.

1123
01:16:22,851 --> 01:16:24,268
What is that?

1124
01:16:27,856 --> 01:16:30,108
Oh, what's
wrong with his hands?

1125
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:35,113
What in the holy fuck is that?

1126
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,037
What is that?

1127
01:16:45,374 --> 01:16:49,127
That's not skin, Ryo.

1128
01:16:49,294 --> 01:16:51,421
That's not skin.

1129
01:16:51,547 --> 01:16:53,339
What's that shiny stuff?

1130
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:54,715
Hold on.

1131
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:29,167
- What the
hell is that, Ryo?

1132
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:30,209
- That's not Sam.

1133
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:31,210
- It...

1134
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:32,378
it's Sam's clothes.

1135
01:17:32,546 --> 01:17:33,713
That's the same tree where
Seth killed him.

1136
01:17:33,839 --> 01:17:34,589
- Then what the hell's
wrong with him?

1137
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:39,969
Sammael.

1138
01:17:40,095 --> 01:17:43,097
That's what Seth called
him, remember?

1139
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:44,307
- Yeah.

1140
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:46,767
And Sam, he kept correcting
him, like...

1141
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:48,394
like Seth knew his real name.

1142
01:17:53,025 --> 01:17:55,151
- Or he knew what he was.

1143
01:18:00,532 --> 01:18:01,324
- We gotta find the girls.

1144
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,200
- No, but...

1145
01:18:02,326 --> 01:18:03,367
- What are you doing?

1146
01:18:03,494 --> 01:18:05,953
- I'm doing a search for
the word Sammael.

1147
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,079
- Come on, we gotta
find the girls.

1148
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:07,538
- Sammael.

1149
01:18:07,664 --> 01:18:08,789
Sammael.

1150
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:10,333
S- A-M-M-A-E-L. It's a
name from the Bible.

1151
01:18:10,459 --> 01:18:12,835
It's a combination of the Hebrew
word "sam," for poison,

1152
01:18:12,961 --> 01:18:15,338
and "ael," A-E-L, for angel.

1153
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:17,840
It's a poison angel.

1154
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:21,677
"Sammael is one of the original
angels of hell.

1155
01:18:21,803 --> 01:18:25,806
He is the devil of death,
Satan's assassin.

1156
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:30,520
Sammael can come in many forms,
but traditionally a

1157
01:18:30,646 --> 01:18:34,815
red-headed young man"

1158
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:36,609
Now we
gotta find the girls.

1159
01:18:36,735 --> 01:18:38,152
Come on.

1160
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:39,320
We gotta split up.

1161
01:18:39,446 --> 01:18:40,488
We can find... we can
cover more ground.

1162
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:42,031
- Lillith.

1163
01:18:44,535 --> 01:18:47,370
There's a glossary of demons.

1164
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:49,705
The name Lillith is on here.

1165
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:56,462
"Lillith is the daughter
of the night.

1166
01:18:56,588 --> 01:18:59,298
She is the queen of hell.

1167
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:02,134
Driven by insatiable hunger,
Lillith stalks the Earth,

1168
01:19:02,261 --> 01:19:06,389
seducing men, often raping
them in their sleep and

1169
01:19:06,515 --> 01:19:07,223
drinking their

1170
01:19:07,349 --> 01:19:08,641
blood. " -Come on.

1171
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:10,184
Ryo, this has got to... this
has got to be bullshit.

1172
01:19:10,394 --> 01:19:14,522
- "By night she is the original
unholy terror, stealing...

1173
01:19:14,648 --> 01:19:21,904
stealing newborns and even the
unborn from pregnant mothers

1174
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:34,375
and feasting on them. "

1175
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,335
- You OK back there?

1176
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:38,129
- Mm-hm.

1177
01:19:38,297 --> 01:19:39,755
- Who has the keys?

1178
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:41,257
Ryan or Nick?

1179
01:19:41,383 --> 01:19:42,091
Whew!

1180
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:44,093
Whew, that was a big one.

1181
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:45,261
- Are you OK?

1182
01:19:45,387 --> 01:19:46,470
Ah!

1183
01:19:46,597 --> 01:19:48,306
Wow, he's, uh... he's really
moving in there.

1184
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:54,562
- Maybe he's just
funny about me.

1185
01:19:54,688 --> 01:19:55,813
- Yeah.

1186
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:56,689
You get close, he starts
doing cartwheels.

1187
01:20:00,485 --> 01:20:02,111
No, no, no, no, I didn't...

1188
01:20:02,237 --> 01:20:05,323
I didn't mean that
in a bad way.

1189
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:06,866
- No.

1190
01:20:06,992 --> 01:20:09,744
You're right.

1191
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,705
I think I upset him.

1192
01:20:12,831 --> 01:20:14,624
- Oh, come on.

1193
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,209
- I don't know what
it is about me.

1194
01:20:17,336 --> 01:20:18,044
I just...

1195
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:21,047
I think I freak kids out.

1196
01:20:21,214 --> 01:20:23,132
Even in the womb, apparently.

1197
01:20:23,258 --> 01:20:25,801
- They can feel stress,
remember?

1198
01:20:25,927 --> 01:20:27,428
He feels everything I feel.

1199
01:20:27,554 --> 01:20:28,220
That's all it is.

1200
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:29,263
He's...

1201
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:32,975
he's just freaking
out 'cause I am.

1202
01:20:33,101 --> 01:20:34,727
Lillith, turn around.

1203
01:20:37,648 --> 01:20:39,440
Hey, I mean it.

1204
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,333
Give me your hand.

1205
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:04,674
Come on, do it.

1206
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,437
See?

1207
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:21,190
He's not kicking.

1208
01:21:21,358 --> 01:21:22,566
It's not you.

1209
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:26,987
Easy.

1210
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,158
Ow.

1211
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,288
Ow!

1212
01:21:36,415 --> 01:21:39,291
Stop!

1213
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:40,668
Lillith!

1214
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,631
What are you doing?

1215
01:21:45,757 --> 01:21:47,383
What the fuck are you doing?

1216
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:21,041
- You all right?

1217
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:26,338
She's a demon called Lillith.

1218
01:22:29,384 --> 01:22:33,554
She was sent to murder
your child.

1219
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,599
You can't wait for Nick.

1220
01:22:36,725 --> 01:22:38,768
By now he's found
the house again.

1221
01:22:38,894 --> 01:22:41,645
- What are you talking about?

1222
01:22:41,772 --> 01:22:43,939
Hey, I don't understand.

1223
01:22:44,107 --> 01:22:46,984
- Lillith, Christophe,
and Sammael.

1224
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:49,361
Three demons of hell.

1225
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:53,365
Their purpose was to destroy
the baby and make sure Nick

1226
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,868
found his way into the
cellar of that house.

1227
01:22:55,994 --> 01:22:57,703
- Destroy the baby?

1228
01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:00,206
- Lillith's the eater
of the young.

1229
01:23:00,332 --> 01:23:05,085
The one you call Chris, he
creates illusions, like

1230
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:08,631
roadsides you see but aren't
there, or towns that look

1231
01:23:08,757 --> 01:23:10,424
empty when they're not.

1232
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:15,346
Now I don't know where you
should go, but if you want

1233
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:19,934
your child to live, you leave
Nick behind and you make it

1234
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,560
far away from here.

1235
01:23:21,645 --> 01:23:23,562
- No, wait!

1236
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,899
I'm not leaving Nick behind.

1237
01:23:27,025 --> 01:23:28,359
Why would Nick go back
to the house?

1238
01:23:28,485 --> 01:23:29,819
He wouldn't leave me.

1239
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:33,489
- The beast is forbidden to
enter the human world.

1240
01:23:33,615 --> 01:23:36,534
Only his human son can invite
him, and only during

1241
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:39,453
the boy's 23rd year.

1242
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:45,292
Why do you think he can
touch someone and see

1243
01:23:45,418 --> 01:23:48,712
their terrible deaths?

1244
01:23:48,839 --> 01:23:54,552
Because Nick is the son
of terrible deaths.

1245
01:23:57,222 --> 01:24:05,729
And he can never be
allowed to invite his father

1246
01:24:05,856 --> 01:24:07,690
out of that cellar.

1247
01:24:07,774 --> 01:24:09,233
- You're wrong.

1248
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:12,653
You don't know Nick.

1249
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:21,203
- You won't know him when he
finds out who he is, or who

1250
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:30,796
his father his, or that he was
conceived so that he could

1251
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:34,508
invite hell on Earth.

1252
01:24:51,276 --> 01:24:52,693
She found
her way to the car.

1253
01:24:57,866 --> 01:25:00,451
Sun'll be up in an hour,
and even Ryan

1254
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:02,620
will find the highway.

1255
01:25:02,704 --> 01:25:04,580
But you...

1256
01:25:04,706 --> 01:25:07,291
come on, you gotta stop
running, Nick.

1257
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:12,296
'Cause you're always gonna
end up right back here.

1258
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,362
You don't have to be
afraid of him.

1259
01:25:36,446 --> 01:25:38,530
- What the hell are you?

1260
01:25:38,657 --> 01:25:40,032
- Come on, Nick.

1261
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:42,368
That's kind of a big question.

1262
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:44,536
- The same as Sam?

1263
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:47,039
- We come from the same place.

1264
01:25:49,334 --> 01:25:53,045
We had a job to do, Nick, and
that was to see that you found

1265
01:25:53,213 --> 01:25:57,883
your way to that cellar, just
like your mother did on the

1266
01:25:58,009 --> 01:25:59,426
day you were conceived.

1267
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:04,848
- Is it really here in there?

1268
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:07,142
Or is that just a dream?

1269
01:26:07,268 --> 01:26:10,521
- With what your house is sitting
on, you're gonna have

1270
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:13,607
a few lost souls in the walls.

1271
01:26:13,775 --> 01:26:17,778
- And the things with the
axes, who are they?

1272
01:26:17,904 --> 01:26:22,032
The,
uh, opposition.

1273
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:24,118
- So they're the angels,
and you're...

1274
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:28,122
- God's gargoyles, is
what we call them.

1275
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:31,333
Created to scare away
evil spirits.

1276
01:26:31,459 --> 01:26:37,256
Seth brought them to frighten
you, to keep you away.

1277
01:26:37,382 --> 01:26:38,632
- Am I an evil spirit?

1278
01:26:43,972 --> 01:26:49,476
- You're an abandoned child
who for 23 years has been

1279
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:55,649
brutalized by the ignorant swine
of this world who are

1280
01:26:55,775 --> 01:27:00,487
afraid of anyone different.

1281
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:07,619
And there's a very special man
trapped under that house who

1282
01:27:07,746 --> 01:27:13,250
understands what your
life has been.

1283
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:15,711
Talk to him.

1284
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:19,006
That's all he wants.

1285
01:27:19,132 --> 01:27:23,802
That's all you want, isn't it?

1286
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:34,063
- They can't hurt you.

1287
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:39,276
They would have killed you a
long time ago if they could.

1288
01:27:39,444 --> 01:27:41,403
We'll take care of them.

1289
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:49,995
- This fight has been a long
time coming, Nick.

1290
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:54,625
- Go.

1291
01:27:54,751 --> 01:27:56,293
Talk to your father.

1292
01:28:01,299 --> 01:28:04,259
Do it!

1293
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,603
- Aaaah!

1294
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,189
- Nnngh!

1295
01:28:17,315 --> 01:28:18,607
- Aaaugghh!

1296
01:28:22,362 --> 01:28:23,195
- Hey.

1297
01:28:23,321 --> 01:28:24,530
Hey!

1298
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,159
Hey!

1299
01:28:36,668 --> 01:28:38,085
- Aaaaghhhhhh!

1300
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,730
- It's me, Evie.

1301
01:28:58,898 --> 01:28:59,731
Don't scream.

1302
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:01,525
Don't make any noise, OK?

1303
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,239
You been wandering
around all night?

1304
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:08,448
- We have to go to the house.

1305
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:09,992
We have to find Nick.

1306
01:29:12,954 --> 01:29:15,414
- Nick's not at the
house, Evie.

1307
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,584
- He's there, Ryo.

1308
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:21,086
And he needs us.

1309
01:29:21,212 --> 01:29:23,088
- Why would Nick be
at the house?

1310
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:33,265
- Oh my god!

1311
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:40,647
- We have to go back, Eve.

1312
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:45,068
Evie!

1313
01:29:49,616 --> 01:29:50,866
Let's go back.

1314
01:29:51,034 --> 01:29:52,284
We have
to go in there.

1315
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:54,244
Nick's
not gonna be here.

1316
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,500
They cut out their hearts.

1317
01:30:00,627 --> 01:30:02,169
Come on, let's go!

1318
01:30:06,257 --> 01:30:06,757
No!

1319
01:30:06,883 --> 01:30:07,466
Hey, hey, hey!

1320
01:30:07,592 --> 01:30:08,383
Come on!

1321
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:09,801
Who are we kidding, Eve?

1322
01:30:09,928 --> 01:30:12,554
Do we even want to see Nick
if he's in there?

1323
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,181
- Ryan, he might be hurt.

1324
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:45,796
It's OK.

1325
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:47,464
It's just us.

1326
01:30:47,632 --> 01:30:49,466
Nicky, it's me and Evie.

1327
01:30:49,592 --> 01:30:52,427
Look at us, Nicky.

1328
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:54,554
What did they do to you?

1329
01:30:54,681 --> 01:30:57,432
- What did they do
to you, Nicky?

1330
01:30:57,558 --> 01:30:58,433
You're
hurt, man.

1331
01:30:58,559 --> 01:30:59,268
We gotta get...

1332
01:30:59,394 --> 01:31:00,560
- Don't touch me!

1333
01:31:00,687 --> 01:31:01,645
- Nicky, you are bleeding.

1334
01:31:01,813 --> 01:31:02,896
- You stay away from me.

1335
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:04,439
Let me breathe, OK?

1336
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:05,440
OK.

1337
01:31:09,028 --> 01:31:11,738
- What did they do to you?

1338
01:31:11,906 --> 01:31:16,201
- I asked if it was my
father, and he...

1339
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:18,203
he said yes.

1340
01:31:18,329 --> 01:31:19,955
Don't, Nicky...

1341
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,336
- And I said yes.

1342
01:31:26,462 --> 01:31:28,714
And it came in.

1343
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,883
And Seth and all of those
things out there

1344
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:34,261
tried to stop him.

1345
01:31:34,387 --> 01:31:36,430
They tried to stop me!

1346
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:41,351
- Holy God.

1347
01:31:49,444 --> 01:31:50,652
Nick.

1348
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:02,039
Our baby.

1349
01:32:04,584 --> 01:32:09,254
I saw our baby.

1350
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:10,630
- What did you see?

1351
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:18,013
I saw
that we had 20.

1352
01:32:21,267 --> 01:32:24,061
- What did you see?

1353
01:32:24,187 --> 01:32:25,312
Tell me.

1354
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,857
- I'm trapped within until
I get three more.

1355
01:32:29,025 --> 01:32:30,442
- Oh my god, Evie.

1356
01:32:33,654 --> 01:32:37,366
Oh my god.

1357
01:32:37,533 --> 01:32:39,326
- What?

1358
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:41,828
- Walk away.

1359
01:32:41,954 --> 01:32:44,206
Evie, don't run.

1360
01:32:44,332 --> 01:32:45,499
- Get away from...

1361
01:33:09,565 --> 01:33:13,110
Two to go.

1362
01:33:38,845 --> 01:33:40,303
- There she is.

1363
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:48,979
You're full of painkillers,
honey.

1364
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:50,522
Don't try and move.

1365
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:57,696
You went into labor
and had your baby.

1366
01:34:01,868 --> 01:34:03,285
You don't remember?

1367
01:34:08,416 --> 01:34:10,041
Well, he's in good shape.

1368
01:34:32,982 --> 01:34:34,441
Let's go see your mama.

1369
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,987
- There's Mama.

1370
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:57,047
- How did I get here?

1371
01:34:59,425 --> 01:35:01,968
- You don't remember the man
that brought you in?

1372
01:35:10,853 --> 01:35:12,479
She's awake now.

1373
01:35:47,056 --> 01:35:48,515
Yeah, you saw the picture?

1374
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:49,641
You like it?

1375
01:35:49,767 --> 01:35:51,893
Yeah, that's part
of the change.

1376
01:35:52,019 --> 01:35:53,228
Yeah, we're doing good.

1377
01:35:53,354 --> 01:35:55,647
A lot safer now.

1378
01:35:55,773 --> 01:35:56,898
No, no, no, no.

1379
01:35:57,066 --> 01:35:59,901
No, they're being guarded
at all times.

1380
01:36:00,027 --> 01:36:02,445
They're never getting
out of there.

1381
01:36:02,613 --> 01:36:03,780
They're never gonna
find the house.

1382
01:36:03,906 --> 01:36:06,116
I destroyed the will
and the deed.

1383
01:36:08,536 --> 01:36:13,456
Now
above the door, make a window.

1384
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:15,584
Draw that window round.

1385
01:36:22,133 --> 01:36:23,341
Good boy.

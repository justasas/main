1
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,761
You know I gotta bring you in.

2
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,298
You're gonna have to kill me first.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,733
Yeah, I know.

4
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,317
Do it.

5
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,504
I can't.

6
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:50,194
Do it.

7
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:25,534
<i>Careful how you look at me, now, stranger</i>

8
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:30,812
<i>You ain't rolled the trail
that I've been on</i>

9
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:36,812
<i>Until you taste the dirt
and smell the danger</i>

10
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:41,636
<i>You don't know the hell
that's made me strong</i>

11
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:47,656
<i>The devil stole my woman down in Tucson</i>

12
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:54,230
<i>And a biscuit down in Juarez
became my only friend</i>

13
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,202
<i>Spurred my horse before...
cut the noose off</i>

14
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:05,777
<i>And rode off in the sunset once again</i>

15
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:08,844
<i>And I ride high</i>

16
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:11,894
<i>In the saddle</i>

17
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:16,682
<i>But my heart has hit me
like the setting sun</i>

18
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:23,458
<i>I never had to run and hide
with my old friend here by my side</i>

19
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:27,760
<i>But you can't kill a memory with a gun</i>

20
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,985
Oh, crap!

21
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,998
<i>Oh, wake up, little darling</i>

22
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,967
<i>Open them eyes</i>

23
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,489
<i>All those birds out singin' outside</i>

24
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,495
<i>Get up, little darling</i>

25
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,144
<i>Throw on them shoes</i>

26
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,478
How are you, Edward?

27
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,611
Two S's in Mississippi, Amos.

28
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:28,707
- Mind your own business.
- I'm just trying to help.

29
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:32,310
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,746
You're looking fine
as cream gravy, Eleanor.

31
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:37,113
You're looking spiffy yourself, Jesse.

32
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,788
- Had a long night. Overslept.
- You didn't.

33
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,051
Haddie Randolph. She's a real bear-cat.

34
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:50,362
Haddie Randolph?
Jesse, how in the hell do you do this?

35
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:53,698
You know, sometimes I wonder myself.

36
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,195
You know what?

37
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:58,570
You're gonna have a lot more time
to wonder about that, because chief...

38
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,669
he's in a real mood today.
And when he finds you?

39
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,904
Helms!

40
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,553
Helms!

41
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:19,222
- Amos.
- Jesse.

42
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,731
Close the door behind you.

43
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,878
Please. Have a seat.

44
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,796
Sure.

45
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:45,683
Why are you here?

46
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:48,119
Well, you... called me in, remember?

47
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:51,389
- I'm not in the mood for this.
- So I was a little late.

48
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:55,427
Work starts at 7:00 a.m. sharp.
Do you have any idea what time it is?

49
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:58,263
- I understand, sir.
- This is a business, son.

50
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:02,934
A well-oiled machine. If one cog in the wheel
is not working, then it all falls apart.

51
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,871
Do you see what I'm trying to say to you?

52
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:08,306
That I'm a cog, sir?

53
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:12,711
I should've fired your ass long ago,
when I had the chance.

54
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,614
Trouble is, you do a bang-up job.

55
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:20,986
When you're here. Hence my dilemma.

56
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:25,796
How to let you go
without being the bad guy.

57
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:30,028
Or how to let you stay
without appearing weak.

58
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:34,799
- Come again, sir?
- I have this little pet project of mine.

59
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,968
More of a passion, really.

60
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:41,805
I stumbled on this about five years ago
when I took over the chief's job.

61
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:45,710
Arizona, 1892.

62
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,571
Bank robbery gone wrong. Six people dead.

63
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:55,153
They called it the mid-day massacre.
September 23rd, 1892.

64
00:05:55,253 --> 00:06:00,825
Four men, led by an ill-tempered outlaw
named Levi Hardin, walked into a bank.

65
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:05,029
In the small boom-town
of Young Country, Arizona.

66
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,100
When the smoke cleared, six people
were dead, including a five-year-old girl.

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,869
Traveling photographer happened
to be passing through town that day.

68
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,796
- Frank Sheldon.
- Sheldon?

69
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,980
- The one that started the Gazette.
- That's right.

70
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,248
And what was supposed to be
a series of rudimentary shots

71
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,912
to test a camera he'd invented
ended up capturing

72
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:30,054
one of the only live bank
robberies ever caught on film.

73
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:34,576
No, men, stand down! Stand down!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

74
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:38,363
Don't you... I'll fucking kill her!
Hey, I'll kill her, Duke!

75
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,266
- Hardin, don't you hurt her!
- I know you don't want that.

76
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,637
No!

77
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,660
No!

78
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,377
Come on!

79
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,690
It gained national attention,

80
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,999
what with the vicious nature
of the crime an the...

81
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,463
high-profiled individuals involved.

82
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:31,470
One in particular, a well-respected
U.S. marshal named Duke Donovan.

83
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,286
That him?

84
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,379
Some say he was the ringleader.

85
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,816
So the man people were supposed
to trust ended up betraying them.

86
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,484
Doesn't end there.

87
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:50,488
<i>Donovan and Hardin
escaped free and clear that day.</i>

88
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:53,623
<i>But a posse caught up to them later.</i>

89
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,174
This one's alive.

90
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:12,310
So Hardin double-crossed Donovan
and took the money.

91
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,930
On the contrary,
it's all right there with Donovan.

92
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,700
Donovan claimed that he
was trying to stop them,

93
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,820
but Hardin was holding a woman
hostage outside of town.

94
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,741
He said he was gonna kill her
if Donovan didn't aid in the robbery.

95
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,561
So Donovan said he went along with it,
until the last second.

96
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:35,008
- There was no sign of a mysterious woman.
- And Hardin?

97
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:39,104
Donovan claimed he shot him
in the head before he blacked out.

98
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:42,040
Never found the body.

99
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,674
Well, what happened next?

100
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,878
I don't know if it was his 20 years
of service to the law,

101
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:51,802
or the fact that Donovan claimed he never
fired a shot during the robbery, but...

102
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,359
something put doubts
in the minds of the jury.

103
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,854
That's a hangin' offense,

104
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,925
but they sentenced him to life
in the Yuma territorial prison.

105
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:05,496
He lasted there six weeks before escaping.

106
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:09,634
He was killed two days later
by a young deputy.

107
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,528
- Sounds like quite a story.
- Oh, it is.

108
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:15,440
I had to uncover a lot of rocks
to find this much.

109
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,624
- But what do you think?
- I'm not sure.

110
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,780
But I'm gonna let you
help me form that opinion.

111
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,916
- How's that?
- By getting an interview

112
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:28,252
with the last man alive
who knows what really happened.

113
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,555
His name is Seymour Redfield.

114
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:34,225
Some people think his real name
is Tom Sullivan.

115
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,128
The young deputy
that killed Donovan that day.

116
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:42,127
When Sullivan brought Donovan's body
back to town, he disappeared.

117
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:46,291
- Was never heard from again.
- Why don't you just talk to this man?

118
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:48,072
Well...

119
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,642
Let's just say we don't see eye to eye
and leave it at that.

120
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,712
Only interview I never got.

121
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,581
What makes you think
he'll wanna talk to me?

122
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:01,586
Because you have more motivation
than I do. Your job's on the line.

123
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,411
Get the story.

124
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,355
Or...

125
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,937
Hello?

126
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,775
Hello?

127
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,851
Hello? Mr. Redfield?

128
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,905
Jeez.

129
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,113
That's a .45 long Colt.

130
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:50,294
Its many admirers referred to it
as the peacemaker.

131
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:53,899
- Mr. Redfield?
- Depends on who's asking.

132
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,301
I'm Jesse Helms, from the Gazette.

133
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,526
I was hoping I could talk to you.

134
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,975
I'd've thought you people'd
take the hint by now.

135
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:15,853
I didn't mean to intrude, sir.
Knocked on the door, and it fell open.

136
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:19,206
You know, I could've blown
your goddamn head off.

137
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,374
And I'd've been well within my rights.

138
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,964
But, since I just saved your life,

139
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,884
why don't you have a drink with me?

140
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,338
No thank you, sir. I'm on the clock.

141
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:36,742
Whose clock? Not my clock.

142
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:42,103
Well, in that case, a small one, sir.

143
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:53,658
Why don't you rest your butt?
Make yourself comfortable.

144
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:55,801
Thank you, sir.

145
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,098
You know, my...

146
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,255
Chief said that you didn't
like to talk too much.

147
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:08,205
Your chief? You mean Morgan Heinz?

148
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:13,829
Well, pay no attention to Morgan Heinz.
He's nothing but a damned old blowhard.

149
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,881
Only thing he's interested in...

150
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:22,134
is a good scandal so as he can sell
more sheets of that rag he puts out.

151
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:29,894
Heinz said that if I didn't talk to you,
then I'd be out of a job.

152
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,930
Well, that's too bad.

153
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,290
However, I hear the pig farm
down the road is hiring.

154
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,911
You know, sir, I don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

155
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,978
I'll see myself out.

156
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,027
I inherited this gun...

157
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:06,479
from Duke Donovan the day he died.

158
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:10,302
Marshal Duke Donovan?

159
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,304
The very one.

160
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:16,208
Was that the gun he used in the robbery?

161
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:21,412
Is that why Heinz sent you here?
Talk about Duke Donovan?

162
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,315
Well, yes, sir. It is.

163
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:26,050
Well...

164
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,754
I suppose if you're looking
for the truth...

165
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:33,474
that's where it all began.

166
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:35,426
With Donovan.

167
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,395
<i>By 1892,</i>

168
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:41,865
<i>some say the legend of Duke Donovan
had begun to eclipse the man.</i>

169
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,181
<i>He never had any children.</i>

170
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,785
<i>On account of their getting married
later in life.</i>

171
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:04,338
<i>Just a wife he loved fiercely.</i>

172
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:12,829
<i>But their passion for each other
more than made up for it.</i>

173
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,063
<i>Their love was constant.</i>

174
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,531
<i>Through thick and thin, she stood by him.</i>

175
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,509
Has the jury reached their verdict?

176
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,352
We have, your honor.

177
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:41,708
We, the above entitled jury do hereby
find Duke Donovan guilty on all counts.

178
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,803
Order! Order in the court! Order!

179
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:50,835
Now, the punishment for such a crime
is to hang by the neck until dead.

180
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:55,573
However... in light of your many years
of community service,

181
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,142
and your impeccable service record,

182
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:01,982
the court has decided
to grant you a reprieve.

183
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,450
Therefore, you are hereby sentenced
to life imprisonment

184
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,519
at Yuma territorial prison.

185
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:12,156
Where you shall do hard labor
for the rest of your life,

186
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:13,991
without the possibility of parole.

187
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,696
This court's adjourned. Take him away.

188
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:33,439
<i>Duke came to Yuma prison
in the spring of 1893.</i>

189
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,525
<i>His arrival was the talk of the place.</i>

190
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,828
<i>He had as many enemies in Yuma
as he did admirers.</i>

191
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:44,687
<i>He'd put half of them in there.</i>

192
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,334
<i>He was a quiet, deliberate man.</i>

193
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,270
<i>And those eyes...</i>

194
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,205
<i>no one ever forgot those eyes.</i>

195
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,882
All hands at attention!

196
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:14,314
Warden's on the floor!

197
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:19,924
I'd like to take a moment to...

198
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:22,957
personally welcome you all to Yuma.

199
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,221
I believe...

200
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,520
you'll find your stay here to be a tough,

201
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,894
but a fair one.

202
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,780
We work a six-day week

203
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,516
and rest on Sundays.

204
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,650
That's reserved for the good Lord.

205
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:56,927
I don't care who you are or what you did.

206
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:59,394
But in here, you're mine.

207
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:05,502
The government of this great territory
has asked us to assist

208
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:09,073
in the construction
of a new section of prison.

209
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,942
You'll get two squares a day.

210
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,645
But you'll have to work
damn hard for them.

211
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,548
However, in the end,

212
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:22,086
you'll manage to do something
you failed to do in your previous lives.

213
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:26,454
Make a positive contribution to society.

214
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:34,098
I consider myself a fair man.

215
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,568
Should you have a need
that has not been addressed,

216
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,604
my door is always open.

217
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,214
Ace high.

218
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,107
Godspeed in your work.

219
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,516
You ladies heard the warden.

220
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,740
Back to work.

221
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:59,290
Not you, Donovan. Come with me.

222
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,456
Come on!

223
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,342
You'll be stayin' in here. Warden Logan
thought it might be a good idea

224
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,178
to keep you away
from the rest of the populace.

225
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:25,180
Get changed. We'll come by
to collect your clothes.

226
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:46,037
Remember, ladies.
There is no talkin' on the line.

227
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:49,941
Unless you wanna be eating
your dinner through a straw.

228
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:53,077
Keep it down! Stay quiet!

229
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:55,710
Put your backs into it!

230
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,720
Hey!

231
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,193
Are you talkin' to me?

232
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,058
Yeah.

233
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:11,293
I like that pickaxe you got right there.

234
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,639
Say...

235
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:25,739
ain't you that law dog
everybody's been talking about?

236
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,624
Yeah.

237
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:31,580
That's me.

238
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:46,394
That's right! These rocks
ain't gonna break themselves!

239
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:52,670
<i>Donovan began to settle in
to his newfound lot at life in Yuma.</i>

240
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,241
<i>Working by day and separated
from the other prisoners at night.</i>

241
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,444
<i>Many began to forget he was there.</i>

242
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:04,882
<i>As days turned to weeks,
the first month passed.</i>

243
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:08,980
<i>It looked like Donovan
was gonna be all right.</i>

244
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,124
<i>That is, until the day Will Penny...</i>

245
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:17,394
<i>and Cage Dalton arrived.</i>

246
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:22,599
<i>Dalton's ornery disposition
got him thrown in the hole immediately.</i>

247
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:25,402
Straight to the hole.

248
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,439
<i>As for Will Penny? Well...</i>

249
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,105
<i>He would have more to do
with the fate of Duke Donovan</i>

250
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:35,194
<i>than anyone could have ever realized.</i>

251
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,307
That's right! Keep diggin'!

252
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,450
You want some?

253
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:54,997
No messin' around!

254
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:01,071
Is it true? That if the warden's
in a bad mood,

255
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,001
he makes us prisoners dig
with just the handles?

256
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,466
No?

257
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:29,499
What're you doing, kid?

258
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:35,906
Keep workin'!

259
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:39,255
Hey! Hey!

260
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,980
Get a hold of yourself, goddamn it.

261
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,832
Bunch of criminals.

262
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:48,352
Kid, kid, look at me.
You want Cane to hear you?

263
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,622
Son of a bitch.

264
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:55,590
- Sorry about this, kid.
- No, no, no, no, no!

265
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,930
What's going on here?

266
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,334
I don't know.

267
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,351
I think he's scorpion-bit.

268
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,023
That true?

269
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,510
Yes. It's just like he said.

270
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:22,686
All right, all right.
Get him up on his feet.

271
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:27,622
Get him up on his feet, take him
to the wagon. Get him a drink of water.

272
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:34,563
Whole thing's gonna set us back today.
Warden's gonna blow up!

273
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:51,882
Take a little sip of water.

274
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,815
Thank you.

275
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,599
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

276
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,585
Warden's on the block!

277
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:13,003
What happened here?

278
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:16,407
He got scorpion-bit, sir.

279
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,940
Show me.

280
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:26,264
- What's that, sir?
- Show me your bite.

281
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,822
Well, you know,

282
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:34,675
I don't know... You know, I...

283
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,060
Show the bite now, or I'll shoot you dead.

284
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,662
Okay! Please.

285
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:43,033
There is no bite.
I don't got no bite, sir.

286
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,956
I thought so.

287
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,545
There, now. There, now.

288
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,881
It feels good to tell the truth,
doesn't it, boy?

289
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,074
Yes, it does, sir.

290
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,892
Well, that's still no excuse.

291
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:11,687
Oh, no! Please! Please!

292
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,632
Throw him in the hole.

293
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:18,423
I will not tolerate liars.

294
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,038
Get up! Come on!

295
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,709
You got a problem with that?

296
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,179
He's just a kid.

297
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:35,552
That kid cut a couple in El Paso
from ear to ear with a butcher's knife.

298
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:39,990
But then, you know all about
murdering women and children, don't you?

299
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,343
- Deputy Sullivan?
- Yes, sir?

300
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:45,545
Throw him in the hole as well.

301
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,664
Seein' as you're the sympathetic type,

302
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:51,368
you can spend some time there
with your new friend.

303
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,735
Let's go, Donovan.

304
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,374
Come on.

305
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,035
Next time, it won't be empty.

306
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:18,059
I'm sorry about this, Donovan.

307
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,675
All right.

308
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,647
Checking the locks.

309
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,695
Stop.

310
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:28,326
Cut your goddamn tongue out.

311
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,573
Get some sleep.

312
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,550
Still one more week to go.

313
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,329
Cocksucker.

314
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,663
Ladies. Lockdown.

315
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,688
Listen, Donovan.

316
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:33,256
Yeah, kid?

317
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:37,778
That... that thing in... Young Country?

318
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:43,398
Did it really go down
the way they say it did?

319
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:49,159
You know, in all my years
of working with the law...

320
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:52,810
- there's one thing I learn.
- And what's that?

321
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,881
Nothing ever went down
the way they say it did.

322
00:29:57,981 --> 00:29:59,783
Yeah.

323
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:02,984
I guess so.

324
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:08,959
What about you, kid?

325
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,426
Guessing they got your story wrong, too?

326
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,863
No, sir.

327
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,171
I...

328
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:22,772
I killed those people...

329
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:25,206
deader than hell.

330
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,361
After my parents died...

331
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:35,045
the state took my sister and me.

332
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:37,020
Put us in an institution.

333
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,723
Then one day, this...

334
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:42,058
this couple come, and...

335
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:44,261
they say I was gonna go live with them.

336
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,579
It was all right at first.

337
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,666
Made some new friends and...

338
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,725
had a roof over our head.

339
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,608
Then...

340
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:01,138
Then, one night...

341
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:04,775
the wife came into my room.

342
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,415
She wasn't wearin' nothing.

343
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,988
And she said, if I told anyone,

344
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:16,290
she was gonna send my sister away.

345
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,733
So...

346
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:23,834
I went along with it for a while.

347
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,536
To protect her.

348
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,972
Then I...

349
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:32,874
I caught the old man with her.

350
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,962
And I...

351
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:39,046
I knew I had to do something.

352
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,521
She was just...

353
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:47,188
just a little girl, you know?

354
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,726
Innocent.

355
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:59,603
That's a hell of a thing, kid.

356
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,671
That's a hell of a thing.

357
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:04,939
It's a real touching tale, ain't it?

358
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:12,195
What about you, Dalton?

359
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:14,184
What's your story?

360
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:16,219
Me?

361
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,954
Oh, I've done...

362
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:21,391
train-jumping and grave-robbing.

363
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:25,725
Card-playing. Lying, cheating,
stealing pretty much my whole life.

364
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:30,697
See, I was in... Clementina, New Mexico.

365
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:33,785
<i>A few weeks ago, in a jail,
waiting on my trial date,</i>

366
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,504
<i>and there was a man in this...
in the jail cell with me.</i>

367
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:40,540
He's limey, through and through.

368
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,549
Had a real nasty scar on the left side
of his face, result of getting shot.

369
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:48,882
- What was his name?
- We ain't in no hurry, is we?

370
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,885
- What was his name?
- I said, we ain't in no hurry.

371
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:57,926
Where was I?

372
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,860
Oh, yeah.

373
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,430
This fellow claimed that...

374
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,433
the gunshot to the head almost killed him.

375
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,302
Bank robbery gone wrong, says he.

376
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:11,606
Convinced this lawman...

377
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,675
to go along with him on account
of he had a fine piece of ass

378
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,211
held hostage, and he was gonna kill her.

379
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:20,610
If the lawman didn't go along with him.

380
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,082
I need your help, Duke.

381
00:33:22,182 --> 00:33:24,317
Put your gun down,
or I'm blowing her head right off!

382
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,319
- He's gonna kill me!
- Put your gun down!

383
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,388
Good. I need your help.

384
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:33,005
- Keep talking.
- Well...

385
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,398
Anyhow, they pulled off the robbery
and got back to the hideout.

386
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:41,810
And they thought this lawman
was gonna be easy pickings,

387
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,591
on account of he was
outnumbered and all, but...

388
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,890
They was wrong.

389
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:52,544
Come on! Let's go!

390
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:19,039
Dark irony, it was.

391
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,207
Seems that this lawman

392
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:23,945
and the woman he was trying to help was...

393
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,281
actually the very woman who betrayed him.

394
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:29,616
She was a painted lady.

395
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,953
<i>Lover of Levi Hardin.</i>

396
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:36,173
Nursed him back to health.

397
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,159
Was in on it all along.

398
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:40,961
What happened to him?

399
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:44,914
- Where is he?
- That's... that's the best part, see?

400
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:48,935
Hardin was caught stealing cattle
in that part of country.

401
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,587
That's a hangable offense.

402
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,889
Hallelujah...

403
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:12,091
- Sheriff?
- Levi Perry Hardin...

404
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:17,731
you have been sentenced by a jury
to hang for your crimes until dead.

405
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,432
Do you have any last words?

406
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:29,976
Yeah. Y'all can kiss my ass!

407
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,057
It's just funny how...

408
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:13,061
a man can kill innocent women
and children and...

409
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:15,286
get life in prison.

410
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,457
But you take a man's cow?

411
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:22,225
That's a whole 'nother
goddamn deal, ain't it?

412
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:27,046
Guard!

413
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:30,500
Guard!

414
00:36:35,307 --> 00:36:38,443
You tell the warden I'm ready to see him.

415
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,996
Well, prisoner Donovan.

416
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:59,797
This is a pleasant surprise.

417
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,975
Leave us.

418
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,744
I must commend you.

419
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:14,380
You and your friend lasted a good while.

420
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,717
Not as long as some, mind you, but...

421
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:20,653
then, they didn't have the choice you did.

422
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:24,890
I came here to tell you
that Levi Hardin is still alive.

423
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,127
And I think I know where he's headed next.

424
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:29,395
Excuse me?

425
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:31,748
That's what you came to say to me?

426
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,233
Did you hear what I said?

427
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,636
Hardin's still alive.

428
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:39,140
I think my wife's in danger.

429
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,143
Well, that is a predicament.

430
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:47,834
But I fail to see what that has to do
with our meeting here today.

431
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:51,885
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I don't care what you think of me.

432
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,053
My wife's in danger.

433
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:56,923
Hardin's not gonna stop till
he gets to me any way he knows how!

434
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,725
Now, you gotta do something!

435
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:03,053
I suggest you take your hands
off my collar.

436
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:08,201
One call from me, and you won't have
to worry about your precious wife.

437
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:10,920
Because you'll be dead.

438
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:23,349
Excellent.

439
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:25,794
Guard!

440
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:29,532
- Take him away.
- Back to the hole?

441
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,243
No, put him in with the main population.
I'm sure they'll make room for him.

442
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:37,831
I don't care what you think of me.
There's an innocent woman in danger.

443
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,814
It's your duty to help her! It's your duty!

444
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,904
I have a witness! Ask Dalton!

445
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,600
Ask Dalton!

446
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:51,778
They will crucify him, sir.

447
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,721
Do it.

448
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:00,620
Cy...

449
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,749
you do make the best ribs
this side of the Mississippi.

450
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,513
Look, Sullivan, as far as I can tell,
you're the only guy in here

451
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:17,803
that has some sense of right and wrong.

452
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:20,941
Now, if you won't help me, help her.

453
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:23,359
Unhook him.

454
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,514
She's all alone out there, Sullivan.

455
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,484
You gotta help her.
You gotta do something!

456
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,451
There ain't nothing I can do, goddamn it!

457
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,089
What the hell am I supposed to do?

458
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,639
Go on.

459
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:45,729
Go!

460
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:51,436
Go!

461
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:59,443
Go, please.

462
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,894
Son of a bitch.

463
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:18,798
Mr. Donovan. I got me a nice place
right over here for you.

464
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:22,201
You know, first thing
I did when I got out...

465
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:25,369
was make a trade for this.

466
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,758
Hey, Donovan.

467
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:32,391
What's going on?

468
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,297
You need to get out of here, kid.

469
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:39,819
No matter what happens, you stay away.

470
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:42,588
No, sir, I need to stay
right here with you.

471
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:44,657
Beat it.

472
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,543
Beat it!

473
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:50,130
What you gonna do?

474
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,784
I'm not sure.

475
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,819
You remember me?

476
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,456
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

477
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,859
Jarvison.

478
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,095
You and your rapist brother.

479
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:05,965
It ain't proper to insult the dead
since you done the killin'.

480
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,935
Kid, I want you to promise me something.

481
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,903
Yes, sir.

482
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:13,406
No matter what happens to me,

483
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:15,841
you hang in there.

484
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,778
You stick with the old-timers.
They know how to survive.

485
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:21,402
- Yeah.
- You hear me?

486
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:23,547
But you gonna be okay?

487
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,119
- Just promise me.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:34,979
Let it be.

489
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:42,803
Yeah! Go!

490
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,755
Come on, Mr. Donovan!

491
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:47,845
Watch out!

492
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,396
Come on. Come on.

493
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,663
- Yeah.
- Come on.

494
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,232
Take it... take it easy.

495
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,657
Come on. Come on, come on.

496
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,460
Hang in with me, now.

497
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,826
It's all right, kid.

498
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,906
You give him a decent burial.

499
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:51,022
Ladies! Lockdown. It's night-night time.

500
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,443
Checkin' the locks.

501
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:13,050
Checking locks.

502
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,954
Donovan.

503
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:27,733
You don't belong here.
Meet me at the new yard in one hour.

504
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:31,237
You get caught, you're on your own.

505
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,312
Checkin' locks.

506
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,832
Hey! Hey! Come on.

507
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:56,737
Get down! Get down. Now, look.

508
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:01,333
This... this tunnel will take you
into the cemetery,

509
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,236
under the wall, and come out
by the warden's stables.

510
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,439
There's a set of reins there
waiting for you.

511
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,808
The warden had this dug
in case there was ever a mutiny.

512
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:12,282
- What about you?
- Oh, no. My runnin' days...

513
00:45:12,382 --> 00:45:14,313
they behind me. You just get on.

514
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:16,549
Rescue your lady.

515
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:18,652
Hey, Donovan.

516
00:45:19,752 --> 00:45:23,656
I'm real sorry about that kid.
Now, go on, get to getting, 'cause...

517
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:27,243
them guards'll be starting
a new set of rounds soon.

518
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:29,628
Cyrus, you could get hung for this.

519
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,564
No, don't worry about me.
I'll be all right.

520
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,849
I thought you said
your running days were over.

521
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,119
I changed my mind.

522
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:06,218
<i>Well, I was shaken from my sleep</i>

523
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:11,190
<i>As they dragged me to my feet</i>

524
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:17,027
<i>I was mistaken by the long arm of the law</i>

525
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:22,101
<i>And the lesson I have learned</i>

526
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:25,971
<i>Is the innocent get burned</i>

527
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,941
<i>And the guilty set you up</i>

528
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:32,687
<i>To take the fall</i>

529
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,688
<i>Nobody's guilty in here</i>

530
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:47,259
<i>And the truth ain't always how it appears</i>

531
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,668
<i>Our story's all the same</i>

532
00:48:49,768 --> 00:48:53,098
<i>Lord knows we've all been framed</i>

533
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:57,397
<i>And the evidence is perfectly clear...</i>

534
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,301
Sorry to trouble you, ma'am.
Got a man hurt.

535
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:31,437
Can we use your well?

536
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:33,353
Please?

537
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,508
Bring him inside.

538
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:56,457
You know. We'd better water these horses.

539
00:49:57,129 --> 00:49:58,997
There's ain't no time.

540
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:02,852
Well, if we don't water them,
we're gonna be walking.

541
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:04,448
All right.

542
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:15,114
- Who was it?
- Donovan.

543
00:50:15,314 --> 00:50:18,490
- And Cy, too.
- Cy?

544
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:21,628
Goddamn nigger.

545
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,522
Bring them back. Dead.

546
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,647
Put him over there.

547
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,175
Get me some towels.

548
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,821
Well...

549
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:59,091
It's a real pretty place.

550
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:00,993
Yep.

551
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,399
Thank you.

552
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,432
Not much further, friend.

553
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,739
I'll tell you one thing, Cyrus.

554
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,359
- You sure don't ride like a cook.
- That's 'cause I ain't one.

555
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:19,473
Well, the warden sure liked your cooking.

556
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:22,579
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
of my special sauce.

557
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:27,749
- Oh, special sauce?
- You don't wanna know.

558
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:31,690
- So what happened, anyway?
- What happened to what?

559
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,226
To get you thrown in that rat-hole prison?

560
00:51:35,855 --> 00:51:38,163
Well, I was in the ninth.

561
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:41,073
- You're a sure-enough buffalo soldier.
- That's right.

562
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:44,720
- That's Colonel Hatch, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

563
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,239
You know, we had us
this old buck sergeant.

564
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:50,626
I mean, he wanted to ride me
all the way to Kansas City.

565
00:51:50,726 --> 00:51:53,579
Busting me down to a dog robber...

566
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,138
- Made you a cook, did he?
- Yeah, I don't like being a cook.

567
00:51:58,238 --> 00:51:59,885
Let me ask you something, Donny.

568
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:03,821
Now, really, do...
now, do I look like a damn cook?

569
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,491
Cook.

570
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:16,830
How's it look?

571
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:21,023
He's got a bullet in his stomach.

572
00:52:21,123 --> 00:52:22,956
Gut-shot.

573
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,914
How long ago was he shot?

574
00:52:29,014 --> 00:52:31,284
A few days ago.

575
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,685
Where did it happen?

576
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,871
Just across the border, in New Mexico.

577
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,934
You know, you ask a lot of questions.

578
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:02,715
Don't mean to.

579
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:06,051
My husband was also a marshal.

580
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:08,818
Donovan. You know him?

581
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,169
We're gonna need to get him into town.

582
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,016
I'll get the...

583
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:41,286
Yeah, I know him. I know him real well.

584
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,718
- What's wrong?
- Something ain't right.

585
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:14,920
What do you mean?

586
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,488
- Where are the horses?
- Well, they could be turned out.

587
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:26,747
Maddy!

588
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:35,774
Maddy! Maddy.

589
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:38,177
Maddy, Maddy, Madeleine.

590
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:40,160
Talk to me.

591
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:45,617
I gotta get help. I gotta get help.
I gotta get help. I gotta get help.

592
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,987
Oh, God...

593
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:53,525
Cyrus, get the horses.
We gotta get to town.

594
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,569
She's hurt! She's hurt bad.

595
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,528
Don't die on me. You hear me? Don't die.

596
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,351
I... Get the horses!

597
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:06,572
Don. Don, she's gone.

598
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,268
I'm real sorry, but she's gone.

599
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:40,205
- Another drink?
- No.

600
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,474
I lost my thirst.

601
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:47,413
Well, you wanted the truth, didn't you?
I just gave you what you asked for.

602
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:52,682
- Yeah, I did, didn't I?
- You sure as hell did.

603
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:58,675
I didn't ask you to come
snooping around here, you know?

604
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:03,428
Why are you telling me all this?
Why don't you just let me walk out of here?

605
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:09,191
Maybe I felt sorry for you. Being
in trouble with your chiefy and all.

606
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,438
Or maybe it's just because...

607
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:17,509
you remind me of myself
when I was your age.

608
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,844
I don't know.

609
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:23,782
I do know... you didn't come here
to talk about me.

610
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:26,902
You came here to talk about Donovan.

611
00:56:27,953 --> 00:56:29,768
All right.

612
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:34,248
Well, then let's see. Where was I?

613
00:56:34,593 --> 00:56:36,629
Oh, yeah.

614
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:41,033
Hardin and his men continued west.

615
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:45,003
To them, the events that had transpired
just a few hours earlier

616
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:48,140
<i>were nothing more than a passing amusement</i>

617
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,743
<i>to be boasted about.</i>

618
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:54,444
<i>Oh, my darlin' Madeleine</i>

619
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,532
Go on, Charlie, have fun with it.

620
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,056
Come on.

621
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:13,232
Wake up. I know you're not doing well,
but you're slowing us all up here.

622
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:15,331
You all right?

623
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,155
They've been here, all right.
That's their hoofprints in the watering hole.

624
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:12,424
All right, then.

625
00:58:12,524 --> 00:58:15,291
We'll set up camp here for the night.

626
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,152
You know I'm real sorry, Donovan.

627
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:42,853
Something like this, I...

628
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,490
I just don't got no words.

629
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,165
This ain't your fight, Cyrus.

630
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,263
Yeah, well.

631
00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:56,468
It seems to me... I've been fighting
other people's wars my whole life.

632
00:58:56,568 --> 00:58:59,671
And I expect this ain't no different, but...

633
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:01,940
sometimes there's wars

634
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,647
a man just got to fight.

635
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,614
Mind telling me what the plan is?

636
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,517
I'm gonna track him down.

637
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,870
All the way to the gates
of hell, if I have to.

638
00:59:21,293 --> 00:59:23,265
All right.

639
00:59:45,393 --> 00:59:46,574
Yeah.

640
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:52,957
I'll tell you what.
That is a fine fire right there.

641
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:55,694
Think we gonna catch 'em tomorrow?

642
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:59,798
If they're headed
where I expect they're headed.

643
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:02,901
- Where's that?
- Backside of the whetstones.

644
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:05,578
- Donovan's ranch.
- How far?

645
01:00:05,678 --> 01:00:10,706
Oh, I don't know.
Another day, or most of it, at least.

646
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,444
Damn.

647
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:20,810
You think he did it?

648
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,288
Did what?

649
01:00:23,388 --> 01:00:26,091
Robbed that bank? Killed those people?

650
01:00:26,191 --> 01:00:29,034
Hell yeah, he done it.

651
01:00:29,194 --> 01:00:31,272
I don't know.

652
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:35,233
I just don't know.

653
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,901
You'd better get to knowin'.

654
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:24,322
She done this for you, didn't she?

655
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:28,118
She did a lot of things for me.

656
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:51,609
<i>Thunder rolls up from the ground</i>

657
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:55,514
<i>Birds fly away from the sound</i>

658
01:01:55,614 --> 01:02:01,730
<i>A lone hero stands in the eye of the storm</i>

659
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:07,059
<i>And demons dance in the fire</i>

660
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:12,430
<i>Chasing desire like devil's companions</i>

661
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,950
<i>But one will stand when there's none</i>

662
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,652
<i>When black horses run</i>

663
01:02:20,587 --> 01:02:23,683
<i>Through the dark canyon</i>

664
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,026
That's not gonna do any good now.

665
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:45,145
I don't reckon it's gonna
do no harm, neither.

666
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,365
Ready?

667
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,565
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

668
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,556
- All right.
- <i>I'll be willing to go down</i>

669
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:04,025
<i>Where I've never been before</i>

670
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,821
<i>If you will hold the door</i>

671
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:09,521
<i>If you will hold the door</i>

672
01:03:09,621 --> 01:03:12,623
<i>I will run through the valley</i>

673
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:15,960
<i>Where the sun will never shine</i>

674
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,963
<i>If you will be my light</i>

675
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:21,866
<i>If you will be my light</i>

676
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:24,569
<i>And hard as I try</i>

677
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:27,972
<i>There's just no place to hide</i>

678
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:30,517
<i>Until this journey ends</i>

679
01:03:30,617 --> 01:03:33,878
<i>And there's no tears left to cry</i>

680
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:37,231
<i>And I'll keep you with me</i>

681
01:03:37,331 --> 01:03:40,051
<i>Safe in my memory</i>

682
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:45,223
<i>And I will see you on the other side</i>

683
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:47,907
<i>Of the ride</i>

684
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,475
<i>And I am bound to find the man</i>

685
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:57,702
<i>That I used to be back then</i>

686
01:03:57,802 --> 01:04:00,588
<i>And before we meet again</i>

687
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,458
<i>And before we meet again</i>

688
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:06,911
<i>When I put this anger down</i>

689
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:09,614
<i>Six feet in the ground</i>

690
01:04:09,714 --> 01:04:12,817
<i>I will never kill again</i>

691
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:15,920
<i>I will never kill again</i>

692
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,472
<i>And hard as I try</i>

693
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:21,893
<i>There's just no place to hide</i>

694
01:04:21,993 --> 01:04:24,528
<i>Until this journey ends</i>

695
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:28,066
<i>And there's no tears left to cry</i>

696
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:31,202
<i>And I'll keep you with me</i>

697
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:34,105
<i>Safe in my memory</i>

698
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:38,974
<i>And I will see you on the other side</i>

699
01:04:39,644 --> 01:04:42,743
<i>Of the ride</i>

700
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:05,034
Take the reins.

701
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:10,979
What in the hell is this?

702
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:14,112
That's sage.

703
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:16,114
That's an Indian sign.

704
01:05:16,214 --> 01:05:18,718
Indian sign? The hell you talkin' about?

705
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:23,287
Cy must still be with him.

706
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:26,190
Let's get down to the barn,
see if we can't find some grain.

707
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:29,260
Figure if they're going after Hardin
they'll be in Rio Verdes.

708
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,728
Indian sign, my ass.

709
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:36,634
Hey. Hey!

710
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,880
Show some goddamn respect!

711
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,792
I don't care who you are. If I catch you doing
something like that again, so help me God,

712
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:45,643
when we leave here, I'll bury you here.

713
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:48,210
That goes for both of you.

714
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:51,750
Bitch.

715
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,724
Yeah, you think the word's out
on our escape yet?

716
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,832
There ain't no railroad.

717
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:10,251
Probably no telegraph.

718
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:13,371
Shouldn't be no problem, then.

719
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:17,441
Yeah, unless Hurley's
still the marshal here.

720
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,644
He knows you?

721
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,513
He's an old acquaintance.

722
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:26,561
Hell, Donovan, everybody
in this country knows you.

723
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,171
Let's go.

724
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:41,702
Get me a bloody bottle of whiskey! Now!

725
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,308
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

726
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:04,219
It's a little early
in the morning, ain't it, boys?

727
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:24,108
Drink it up, boys!

728
01:08:15,076 --> 01:08:17,509
We don't see too many...

729
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,903
We don't see...

730
01:08:25,203 --> 01:08:28,337
- too many...
- What?

731
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,941
Strangers.

732
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:36,545
Around these parts.

733
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:41,337
So, what'll it be?

734
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:46,422
Whiskey. Two glasses.

735
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:01,170
Leave the bottle.

736
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:07,282
What're you looking at?

737
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:12,283
I said, what the hell...

738
01:09:12,383 --> 01:09:14,685
are you looking at?

739
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:17,155
You got any coffee?

740
01:09:17,355 --> 01:09:19,156
Coffee?

741
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:23,461
Yeah. Sure. Of course, I'll...

742
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:26,987
- I'll be right back.
- That'd be a good idea.

743
01:09:38,725 --> 01:09:42,313
I know you... I know you heard me.

744
01:09:42,713 --> 01:09:45,048
What're you looking at?

745
01:09:47,218 --> 01:09:49,588
Oh, and you, too?

746
01:09:50,588 --> 01:09:52,890
What're you looking at?

747
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:57,127
That is a mighty nice bandanna
you got there.

748
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:02,400
You like this? Thank you.

749
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,276
I know you, don't I?

750
01:10:05,376 --> 01:10:07,138
Maybe.

751
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:10,608
- Been around here before?
- No.

752
01:10:10,808 --> 01:10:15,147
I'm from Sonora. They call me Chale.

753
01:10:16,147 --> 01:10:18,780
Well, that is quite a name.

754
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:23,254
You're my friend, right?

755
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:27,245
But you gotta tell me something, friend.

756
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,792
Why the hell...

757
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:35,164
do you come in here with your
mulo slave who stares at people?

758
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,971
It's rude, no?

759
01:10:40,071 --> 01:10:42,606
No, he's not rude.

760
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:44,876
He just doesn't like scumbags.

761
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:47,023
No, that ain't it.

762
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:49,846
I just don't like you.

763
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,518
Come on, let's go.

764
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,243
I'll be needing that horse, governor.

765
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:35,926
I do know... who you are.

766
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,937
- Was he here? Was he here?
- Who?

767
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:28,413
Tell me what he looked like.

768
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:31,515
Tell me what he looked like!

769
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:34,418
He was a rough-lookin' man.

770
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:37,736
He had a bad scar
that run across his face.

771
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:43,127
We didn't mean no trouble.
We're just trying to make a living is all.

772
01:12:43,227 --> 01:12:45,663
You didn't mean any trouble?

773
01:12:45,763 --> 01:12:48,797
You didn't mean no trouble?

774
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,587
If you're gonna kill me, start shooting.

775
01:13:35,687 --> 01:13:37,882
Easy, Duke.

776
01:13:38,682 --> 01:13:40,684
Just need to talk.

777
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:43,019
There ain't no time.

778
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:58,402
They took off that way.
Best I can tell, on one horse.

779
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:01,918
Good. We can catch them then.

780
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:05,542
Can't lie, if they come looking for you.

781
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,971
I wouldn't expect you to.

782
01:14:08,412 --> 01:14:11,081
Come on. Let's go.

783
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,070
Greetings.

784
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,240
I'm Deputy Tom Sullivan. Yuma.

785
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,145
Marshal Hurley. What can I do for you?

786
01:14:57,895 --> 01:15:00,524
- We're looking for a couple of men.
- One of them's a nigger...

787
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:05,202
Duke Donovan. The other one's name is
Cyrus Parker, and he is a buffalo soldier.

788
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:07,304
They broke out of Yuma.

789
01:15:07,404 --> 01:15:10,608
Yeah, they came through town
a couple of hours ago.

790
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:12,977
Killed two men.

791
01:15:13,077 --> 01:15:16,894
- I ain't surprised.
- Me either.

792
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:21,953
Those were a couple men who needed
killing. Rolled with Levi Hardin's gang.

793
01:15:22,753 --> 01:15:26,501
We caught wind that Hardin's men
killed Donovan's wife.

794
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,595
- That they did.
- Son of a bitch.

795
01:15:32,245 --> 01:15:36,166
- Any idea where they're headed?
- Oh, my guess would be the border.

796
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:41,369
- The border?
- Yeah. They're hot on his trail.

797
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:46,075
- Whose?
- Hardin's.

798
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:50,984
Obliged.

799
01:15:51,484 --> 01:15:53,798
- Let's go.
- Thanks for the whiskey.

800
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:04,495
<i>Freedom is your prison
when you curse to keep on running</i>

801
01:16:04,595 --> 01:16:06,830
<i>Hard to tell the difference</i>

802
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,200
<i>From the hunter and the hunted</i>

803
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,772
<i>Looking for redemption
down the barrel of a gun</i>

804
01:16:14,872 --> 01:16:17,408
<i>Your finger on the trigger</i>

805
01:16:17,508 --> 01:16:22,513
<i>Your back against the sun going down</i>

806
01:16:22,613 --> 01:16:25,182
<i>Going down</i>

807
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:30,521
<i>Going down to the place
where no mercy can be found</i>

808
01:16:30,621 --> 01:16:34,293
<i>And you pay for what you've done
with your soul</i>

809
01:16:35,943 --> 01:16:41,131
<i>Going down where the darkest
of the angels circle round</i>

810
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:43,801
<i>He's just waiting 'cause he knows</i>

811
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:46,203
<i>Yes, he knows</i>

812
01:16:46,303 --> 01:16:48,640
<i>It's going down</i>

813
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,582
<i>Going down</i>

814
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:10,859
Come on, Walker! Go!

815
01:17:25,576 --> 01:17:27,342
Easy.

816
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:41,390
- He ain't been dead long.
- Yeah.

817
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:49,831
Come on. Come on. Get up, Cy.

818
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,178
How bad is it?

819
01:18:01,478 --> 01:18:05,482
Well... didn't catch any bone,
but it's a good one.

820
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:09,551
What's going on over there?

821
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:15,559
That's three of the warden's deputies.

822
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,327
They're gonna be sitting ducks for Hardin.

823
01:18:21,097 --> 01:18:23,198
Foster, check it out.

824
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,107
What're you doing?

825
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:36,060
I can't let innocent men get killed.
Even if they are trying to kill me.

826
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:39,767
- Think they lost us?
- Listen.

827
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:44,052
- What is it?
- It's too quiet.

828
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:48,292
Sullivan, get down!

829
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,747
Goddamn it! Jesus!

830
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,327
- Do something! Do something!
- Goddamn it!

831
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:16,396
Son of a bitch!

832
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:26,161
He's already dead! Already dead!

833
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:32,701
Got one!

834
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:47,838
We gotta get back to Cyrus.
Ready? Let's go.

835
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:59,260
Damn, my leg!

836
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,266
How you doing, Cy?

837
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:06,470
How the hell's it look like I'm doing?

838
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:09,640
Donovan, trying to get yourself shot?

839
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,547
Yeah, it appears so.

840
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,217
Come on.

841
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,325
We are dead men down here.

842
01:20:28,425 --> 01:20:31,462
Sullivan, we gotta get to higher ground.

843
01:20:31,562 --> 01:20:33,854
Now you're making sense.

844
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,166
Cy, I'm gonna need that mare's leg.

845
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,846
Yep.

846
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,350
When I give the signal...

847
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:56,195
- you give it all you got, all right?
- All right.

848
01:20:56,295 --> 01:20:59,574
All right, Tom. You break when I do.

849
01:21:00,524 --> 01:21:01,801
Let's go!

850
01:21:09,251 --> 01:21:11,065
Shit!

851
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,172
Come on, Walker, let's go!

852
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,644
Fuck!

853
01:21:20,944 --> 01:21:23,297
How many bullets you got left?

854
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:25,851
Four. Five, maybe.

855
01:22:42,892 --> 01:22:46,403
So I guess we're finally gonna
get to finish what we started.

856
01:22:47,064 --> 01:22:49,299
Finish what you started.

857
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:54,037
It doesn't matter.
The way I see it, we both lose.

858
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:58,476
You took my money. And I took your life.

859
01:22:59,776 --> 01:23:02,412
You know what,
I'm gonna let God sort that out.

860
01:23:02,512 --> 01:23:04,245
Fuck you!

861
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:13,290
So this is it.
This is the best you can do.

862
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:15,225
The great...

863
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:18,168
Duke Donovan!

864
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:26,042
Get up. Get up, Duke. Get up.

865
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,780
Fucking...

866
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:45,820
Duke! Duke!

867
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:52,480
She cried out for you, you know!

868
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:55,296
For you to save her.

869
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,535
Oh, she was a live one!

870
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,807
She wiggled like a little fish, she did!

871
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,987
She was all wet and slimy.

872
01:24:17,087 --> 01:24:19,935
I slid right up, right in.

873
01:25:17,913 --> 01:25:19,901
You know I gotta bring you in.

874
01:25:21,685 --> 01:25:24,122
You're gonna have to kill me first.

875
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:27,724
Yeah, I know.

876
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,843
I ain't got no choice.

877
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,996
We all got choices.

878
01:25:33,096 --> 01:25:35,654
I made mine a long time ago.

879
01:25:39,235 --> 01:25:40,623
Do it.

880
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,676
Do it.

881
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,881
I can't.

882
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:52,901
Do it.

883
01:25:54,651 --> 01:25:56,702
I can't.

884
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:57,814
You're getting pretty good
on that thing, Cy.

885
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,517
Hey, Donovan.

886
01:27:00,617 --> 01:27:03,954
You ever wonder why
I helped you escape out that prison?

887
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:06,930
It's 'cause you help me remember...

888
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,459
how I used to walk.

889
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:12,413
And I'm mighty beholden to you.

890
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:19,033
Here. This'll keep you company
on your travels.

891
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:23,907
You know, you might even learn
how to play the damn thing.

892
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:25,876
Thanks.

893
01:27:26,276 --> 01:27:29,746
<i>Donovan never told Sullivan
where he was going.</i>

894
01:27:29,846 --> 01:27:34,417
<i>Both men wanted it that way
so as not to put the other at risk.</i>

895
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:38,488
<i>Cyrus rode east. Some say to Louisiana.</i>

896
01:27:38,688 --> 01:27:43,093
<i>Where it was rumored
he'd prospered in dry goods.</i>

897
01:27:43,893 --> 01:27:46,730
<i>Sullivan returned to Yuma with a bounty.</i>

898
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:51,367
<i>Of course, it was so charred,
no one could really tell who it was.</i>

899
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:56,537
<i>So the warden had to take
Sullivan's word that it was Donovan.</i>

900
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,878
<i>That day, Sullivan left Yuma for good.</i>

901
01:28:02,288 --> 01:28:04,982
<i>Changed his name to Duncan.</i>

902
01:28:05,782 --> 01:28:09,119
And a month later became
the sheriff of Wickenburg.

903
01:28:09,219 --> 01:28:12,011
Where he lives to this day.

904
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:17,726
So Sullivan never up and disappeared
like everyone thought.

905
01:28:18,082 --> 01:28:20,651
He just changed his name.

906
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:23,266
Now you're catching on.

907
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:30,138
Wait, if... if you aren't Sullivan...

908
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,744
and only those three survived that day...

909
01:28:34,844 --> 01:28:37,014
then you're...

910
01:28:38,663 --> 01:28:42,450
- That makes you...
- 82 years old.

911
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:51,458
I thought you said you got that gun
the day Duke Donovan died.

912
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:53,496
I did.

913
01:28:53,596 --> 01:28:59,598
I inherited this gun from Duke Donovan
the day he became Seymour Redfield.

914
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:03,206
He didn't need it anymore.

915
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:05,109
He was a dead man.

916
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,446
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

917
01:29:09,546 --> 01:29:11,506
Is there?

918
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:15,041
No, son, I'm afraid not.

919
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:18,320
Just got one more question.

920
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:22,660
- What is it?
- The robbery.

921
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,529
Were you tricked into it?

922
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:30,564
- Or behind it?
- What do you think?

923
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,472
I think I need another drink.

924
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:03,638
Can I ask you one more thing?

925
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:08,638
Why'd you tell me everything?

926
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:12,442
Well, I figure the sand in my hourglass
is running a little low,

927
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:16,197
and somebody ought to know the truth
about what really happened.

928
01:30:17,047 --> 01:30:20,950
Just keep it under your sombrero,
will you? Until after I'm gone?

929
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:28,089
Thank you.

930
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:16,756
<i>Thunder rolls up from the ground</i>

931
01:31:16,856 --> 01:31:20,844

932
01:31:20,944 --> 01:31:26,847
<i>A lone hero stands in the eye of the storm</i>

933
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:34,023

937

938
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:54,928

<i>Gunshots tear open the air</i>

945
01:32:26,476 --> 01:32:30,647
<i>Trembling hearts send up a prayer</i>

946
01:32:30,747 --> 01:32:33,483
<i>Hoping someone will come</i>

947
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:37,357
<i>To earn their salvation</i>

948
01:32:39,454 --> 01:32:43,726
<i>When rocks of faith crumble to dust</i>

949
01:32:43,826 --> 01:32:48,198
<i>You search your heart for someone to trust</i>

950
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:50,667

951
01:32:50,767 --> 01:32:54,501
<i>You've always been chasing</i>

952
01:32:56,054 --> 01:32:59,559

953
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,761

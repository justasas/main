he never fired a shot
during the robbery,

Well...

we don't see eye to eye

Well, what makes you think
he'll wanna talk to me?

191
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,745
Because you have
more motivation than I do.

I was hoping
I could talk to you.

I'd've thought you people'd
take the hint by now.

You mean Morgan heinz?

Well, pay no attention
to Morgan heinz.

He's nothing but
a damned old blowhard.

is a good scandal

if I didn't talk to you,

Was that the gun
he used in the robbery?

Is that why heinz
sent you here?

1282
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:23,637
how I used to walk.

1283
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,773
And I'm mighty
beholden to you.

1284
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:30,677
Here.

1285
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,513
This'll keep you company
on your travels.

1286
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,316
You know,
you might even learn

1287
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,585
how to play the damn thing.

1288
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,554
Thanks.

1289
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,723
[Redfield]
Donovan never told Sullivan

1290
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:44,324
where he was going.

1291
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,759
Both men wandered...

1292
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,795
So as not to put
the other at risk.

1293
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:51,298
Cyrus rode east.

1294
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,666
Some say to Louisiana.

1295
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:55,602
Where it was rumored
he'd prospered

1296
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,871
in dry goods.

1297
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:01,008
Sullivan returned
to yuma with a bounty.

1298
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,709
Of course,
it was so charred,

1299
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:05,545
no one could really
tell who it was.

1300
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:08,415
So the warden had
to take Sullivan's word

1301
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,817
that it was Donovan.

1302
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:16,056
That day, Sullivan
left yuma for good.

1303
01:28:16,058 --> 01:28:19,960
Changed his name to Duncan,

1304
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:21,495
and a month later became

1305
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:23,497
the sheriff of wickenburg.

1306
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:25,899
Where he lives to this day.

1307
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,771
So Sullivan never
up and disappeared

1308
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:34,574
like everyone thought.
He just changed his name.

1309
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:37,744
Now you're catching on.

1310
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:40,480
[Redfield laughs]

1311
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:44,518
Wait, if--
if you aren't Sullivan...

1312
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:49,022
And only those three
survived that day,

1313
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:51,992
then you're...

1314
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,894
That makes you--

1315
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:56,830
82 years old.

1316
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,569
[Harmonica note]

1317
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:04,338
I thought you said
you got that gun

1318
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,806
the day Duke Donovan died.

1319
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:07,774
I did.

1320
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:10,110
I inherited this gun
from Duke Donovan

1321
01:29:10,112 --> 01:29:11,745
the day he became

1322
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:14,881
Seymour redfield.

1323
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:17,484
He didn't need it anymore.

1324
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:20,687
He was a dead man.

1325
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,724
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

1326
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:26,426
Is there?

1327
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:29,963
No, son, I'm afraid not.

1328
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:33,367
Just got one more question.

1329
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:34,768
What is it?

1330
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,438
The robbery.

1331
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,807
Were you tricked into it?

1332
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:42,843
Or behind it?

1333
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:44,644
What do you think?

1334
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:02,729
I think I need
another drink.

1335
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:18,678
Can I ask you
one more thing?

1336
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,816
Why'd you
tell me everything?

1337
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:25,552
Well, I figure
the sand in my hourglass

1338
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:26,820
is running a little low,

1339
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:28,488
and somebody
ought to know the truth

1340
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,425
about what really happened.

1341
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:33,627
Just keep it under
your sombrero, will you?

1342
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:36,530
Until after I'm gone?

1343
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,669

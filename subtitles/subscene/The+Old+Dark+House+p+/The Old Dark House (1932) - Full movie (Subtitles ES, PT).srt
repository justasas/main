1
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,800
THE Old Dark House

2
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,730
Damn!

3
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,230
Why did you stop?

4
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,690
Stop for a break.

5
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:51,360
Philip, can not stop here. God, continues or reverses.

6
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:55,070
You do not expect overnight like a rat in a sewer.

7
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,490
For best stop we drive through the gorge under these conditions, right?

8
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,740
Well, losing your temper is not going to help.

9
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,830
I've never been so calm in my life.

10
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:06,910
I love driving one hundred miles in the dark with little light.

11
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,540
I love to feel the icy water dripping on my neck.

12
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:13,390
It is one of the happiest moments of my life.

13
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,600
Want me to drive for a while?

14
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:17,970
Yes, it is exactly what I was expecting.

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,770
Oh, I will not be quiet until we come to Shrewsbury.

16
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:33,610
That if we Shrewsbury.

17
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:38,050
Any idea where we are? I have not the faintest idea.

18
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,290
That relieves me.

19
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:42,150
All right, Penderel?

20
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,560
All right. Where are we?

21
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:48,760
We do not know. We got lost. We are somewhere in the Welsh mountains ...

22
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:52,090
Are ... half past nine, and I'm sorry. Do not say that

23
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,350
Ten to one that did not get to Shrewsbury tonight.

24
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,960
You never know.

25
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,970
& Quot; Oh, Mister Waverton, what will become of me? & Quot;

26
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,590
& Quot; wanted to go to Shrewsbury but I was brought here. & Quot;

27
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,220
In reality, given the choice ...

28
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:08,700
I'm ... not sure he wanted to go to Shrewsbury.

29
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,100
Moreover, I do not really want to go anywhere.

30
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:16,270
Here something interesting could happen, nothing ever happens in Shrewsbury.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,530
Of course we could pass something.

32
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,070
I could tell you something we might happen.

33
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:23,980
I would not want to scare Miss. Waverton Go ahead, Mr. Penderel ...

34
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,340
I do not scare me ... -¿Ud easily. no? Well, I have.

35
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,450
Well, just wanted to say ...

36
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,760
... We'll have a little care ...

37
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,810
Do not stop!

38
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:49,220
How do you want to avoid to stop? Think you're going by boat?

39
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,440
& Quot; Trapped in the night! Trapped in the night! Caught ...

40
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:55,110
-¡Sr. Penderel, please! Excuse me.

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,700
Do you think we will get? I do not know.

42
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
Bon Voyage.

43
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,260
God, for a moment! Look at the map.

44
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,920
From what I can see, we are not in the map.

45
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,830
Look, Philip, you can not see anything. It's all a stupid puddle.

46
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,180
This place seems staged to perfection. Everything is flooded.

47
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,410
You keep driving. Arrive somewhere some time.

48
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,050
I guess that's all we can do.

49
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,150
& Quot; Singing in the bathtub, singing in the rain & quot; ...

50
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,470
Look, Phil! Lights! Lights! Let us go there.

51
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,490
It would be more reasonable to move forward. Well I vote for staying here.

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,780
Thus far we have come. Probably has come off the top of the hill.

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,890
& Quot; Anybody there ?, the traveler said. & Quot;

54
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,470
Called again, louder.

55
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,020
I would have thought that was enough to wake the dead.

56
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,720
What a idea. Which one?

57
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:03,570
Would not that be awesome? Imagine that the inhabitants were dead ...

58
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,610
Rigid ... under the penumbra of the lamps.

59
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,660
It sure would be very exciting.

60
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,290
What would be more a drink.

61
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:14,330
If we have to be soaked, pregnant better inside than outside.

62
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,460
'Listen. -¿El What?

63
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,060
I thought I heard something.

64
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,380
Good night. We have come to ask for shelter. We got lost.

65
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,400
We are completely cut off.

66
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,450
Do you understand? We can not continue or return.

67
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,730
The road was closed in both directions. Landslides.

68
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,060
Neither sounds like Welsh.

69
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,690
My name is Femm. Horace Femm.

70
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,520
How are you? Sorry to break into your home in this way.

71
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,230
My name Waverton. I present to my wife.

72
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,530
How are you?

73
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,740
Penderel!

74
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,110
-lovely Sure. How are you?

75
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,560
Why do not you sit down?

76
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,740
Thank you.

77
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,530
My sister was arranging these flowers.

78
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,260
I do not know if your servant has explained our situation.

79
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:58,110
He did the best he could, but I'm afraid I could not understand.

80
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,090
Morgan is dumb.

81
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:02,810
Oh, sorry. I had not noticed.

82
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,900
We saw the lights in your house and wonder if they would be kind enough to stay tonight.

83
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:11,280
As you see it is impossible to continue. I understand. Embarrassing. Very embarrassing.

84
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,240
What is it? What do they want?

85
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,240
Let me introduce you to my sister, Rebecca Femm.

86
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,530
How are you?

87
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,050
Why are you here?

88
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,080
What do they want?

89
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,500
How are you?

90
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
What do they say? What do they want?

91
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,020
Why are you here? What will this fuss? What the ...?

92
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:39,310
Excuse my sister. It's a little deaf. Well, sometimes quite deaf.

93
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,890
They want to know if they can stay the night. Shelter. Les has caught the storm.

94
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,450
Of course it can not be! They can not be here!

95
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,070
Forward ...

96
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,920
There has been an evolution. It seems that mid-mountain has collapsed.

97
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,380
This has forced us to stop.

98
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,580
The road is blocked behind us and maybe it will be later.

99
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,830
We do not want to intrude, but what else can we do?

100
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,600
There is nowhere else to go. The road is flooded,

101
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:07,230
and for this reason this place can be flooded or buried.

102
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,090
What happens?

103
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,260
Did you hear what he said?

104
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:17,760
There are landslides and floods. The lake has overflowed.

105
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:23,020
We are trapped. We are trapped. We must go. Do you hear? We have to go.

106
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,800
Afraid, Horace. You're scared, right?

107
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,320
Do not believe in God and now you are afraid to die.

108
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:33,190
You've seen his anger in the sky and you've heard in the night. And now you're afraid.

109
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:38,800
Fear. Fear. Where are your jokes now? Now you can be afraid. Your time will come.

110
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:44,640
But not now. This home is safe. I know better than you. Morgan!

111
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,550
Do you remember the years of the great storms when we were cut off?

112
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:55,490
There were landslides and floods. And no roads disappeared?

113
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,390
Morgan remembers. She says this house is safe. Because it is built on rock.

114
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,780
They will have to stay. Adversity is His, not ours.

115
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,860
No beds! They can not have beds!

116
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:21,570
As my sister insinuates, I am afraid there are no beds.

117
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:25,830
Enough. If we can sit by the fire will suffice.

118
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:31,080
Course. I'm not sure I want to sleep tonight.

119
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,040
Morgan will keep the fire alive.

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,380
Is there somewhere you can protect the car from the rain?

121
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:41,930
There are stables behind the house. Morgan chaperone.

122
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,920
Thank you very much.

123
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:46,870
I'm going to go out and bring the suitcases. Well.

124
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,480
No beds! They can not have beds!

125
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,540
-¡Vaya Storm! -Of Good we got rid.

126
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:13,420
Hope you're right, this house gives me the creeps, not to mention its inhabitants.

127
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,670
It's still better than driving by invisible roads.

128
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
At least there is a roof and a bonfire.

129
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,270
And now, Mr. Penderel, will accompany me with a drink?

130
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:36,610
Mr. Femm obviously I'll join you.

131
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,120
Is gin alone, you know? Only gin. I like gin.

132
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,460
Miss. Waverton?

133
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:56,670
Thank you very much.

134
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:01,260
Mr. Penderel, drink to something that does not appreciate you. Still so young.

135
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,260
I drink to the illusion!

136
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:07,560
Illusion? Oh! I'm at the best age to drink to that, Mr. Femm.

137
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:12,850
I guess you are one of those gentlemen, shall we say, hardened by war?

138
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:19,370
Right, Mr. Femm. War generation, dirty, bitter, forgotten,

139
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,090
and this, Mr. Femm, is an excellent gin.

140
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,410
A horrible night. Looks set to worsen.

141
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,290
Yes, it is fascinating and bad. But certainly not in any danger here.

142
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,960
His sister left him quite clear.

143
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:35,630
But assuming that we stay in solitary confinement, locked up here ...

144
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:39,550
Well, it would be a hassle for you. Having stayed.

145
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:43,590
But it's terrible. How can you be so calm? Seems not to understand.

146
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,220
We may be incommunicado. Enclosed in this house!

147
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,290
I'm afraid I'm a little nervous. I am a very nervous man.

148
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:59,070
But the fact is that Morgan is an animal. Sometimes he drinks too much.

149
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:01,610
A night like this could induce him to drink,

150
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:04,110
and once you're drunk, it's really dangerous.

151
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:08,320
I do not want to alarm you, Miss. Waverton, but do not know what we should do.

152
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,000
Well I know what I'll do. That if Mrs. Femm let me.

153
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:12,700
What?

154
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:16,080
I am very wet and would be very grateful if you could change clothes.

155
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:16,960
What?

156
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,960
I was wondering if I could change.

157
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,750
Appears wet. You better go. To change.

158
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:24,840
Thank you. Good idea. Is there any room or something?

159
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,820
A dreadful night.

160
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,280
What?

161
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,040
I mean making a dreadful night.

162
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,820
Yes, an old house. Very old.

163
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,740
Very kind of you to let us stay. 'What?

164
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,280
I say it's you. Really friendly!

165
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,580
Yes, it makes a dreadful night. I'm a little deaf.

166
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,000
I understand.

167
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,790
Yes. No beds!

168
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,450
Not have these electric lights. Neither have.

169
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,990
Thank you very much. Now I can fix myself.

170
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,140
My sister Rachel had once this room. He died at age 21.

171
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,941
She was a naughty.

172
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:29,450
Graceful and wild as a hawk. All young people were after him.

173
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:35,200
With her red lips, her eyes wide and her white neck. But that did not save her.

174
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:39,220
He fell from his horse during a hunt. Spine was damaged.

175
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,420
He remained in this bed ... month after month.

176
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:45,380
I spent a lot of time sitting here and listening to screaming.

177
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,670
What horror.

178
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:51,140
I used to beg ... to kill her. He had said that out to the Lord.

179
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:53,730
But he did not. It was wicked through.

180
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:56,190
Well, I better change.

181
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,130
Here are all wicked. They used to bring their women.

182
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:04,730
Brazen, lolling creatures in silks and satins.

183
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:08,280
They filled the house with laughter and sin, laughter and sin.

184
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,210
If I ever was present,

185
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:15,110
my own father and brothers told me to go to pray.

186
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:21,370
They would not tell Rachel to leave to pray. And I prayed!

187
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:27,590
I left them with their lustful women pale and rosy. My father still lives.

188
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,550
He's upstairs. It is very old.

189
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:31,840
Yeah?

190
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,760
It has 102 years.

191
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:35,390
That's a lot, right?

192
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,930
It's an old infamous and blasphemous.

193
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,070
You are also immoral. Young and graceful. Foolish and immoral.

194
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:53,330
Do not think about anything except your long slim legs

195
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,330
your white body and how to please your husband.

196
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:59,580
You will rejoice in the pleasures of carnal love, right?

197
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,380
That's fine, but will rot.

198
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,420
That is still great. But over time, it will also rot.

199
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,800
No! How dare you?

200
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,120
Sassy ..., lolling creatures silk and satin ...

201
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:56,720
laughter and laughter and sin ... sin ... lustful women and pale rosy ...

202
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,340
Philip!

203
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,380
Two thumbs up for you., Miss. Waverton. Makes feel like a party.

204
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,140
Thank you.

205
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,770
They must have thought I have been slow.

206
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,200
In fact, I think you've been faster than usual.

207
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,130
I thought it took too long.

208
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,790
A dinner!

209
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,140
Philip.

210
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,680
Horace! What are you doing? We are not pagans.

211
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,690
I had forgotten the strange tribal habits my sister.

212
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,940
The beef will be more tender if bless.

213
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,980
Horace Femm. Although you can not hear, I can see. You are blaspheming.

214
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,900
On the contrary, dear Rebecca.

215
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:38,160
Just tell them your guests intrigued ...

216
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:41,160
You were ... about to thank your gods for their generosity ...

217
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:43,910
Sure. I know that false and mocking tone.

218
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:49,080
And ... give thanks for health, prosperity and happiness given to this family.

219
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,590
During these years of peace and plenty.

220
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:56,590
Giving thanks for bringing the world to Rebecca Femm. And Femm Roderick. And Saul.

221
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,300
Enough!

222
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,480
Lord bless this food ... amen.

223
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,180
Take a potato.

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,960
Thank you.

225
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,340
Well, this seems to be more than a storm.

226
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,390
Yes, is not it?

227
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:47,770
Take a potato.

228
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:50,010
Thank you. I love a potato.

229
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,900
¿Vinegar, Miss Femm?

230
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,930
He's just pouring.

231
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,720
Thank you, Mrs. Waverton. I've been looking for this phrase all night.

232
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,390
Onion no thanks.

233
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,760
Those lights. They are flashing. I guess it's the storm.

234
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:04,090
Contrary. We generate our own electricity but I think we are not very good.

235
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,640
I hope you all do not panic if the power goes out.

236
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,730
Is anybody out.

237
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,040
You can not go!

238
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,260
Should enter. Surely it is dangerous to be outside right now.

239
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,800
Must be half drowned. We should not make them wait long.

240
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:52,270
No, I'm afraid we must let them enter.

241
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,090
Morgan, opens the door.

242
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,040
Come on, Morgan. Let them pass.

243
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,810
What a night!

244
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,290
Never thought we would open the door.

245
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,640
They have cracked the dam or something.

246
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,660
Anyway, before I knew not where we were, something we have fallen ...

247
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:27,260
And ... has crushed the car.

248
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:31,590
Lucky has not crushed us.

249
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,640
And by the way, probably the current drag this house.

250
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,730
Look at this!

251
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,400
Go fire.

252
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,650
Sorry for barging in this way so rude,

253
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,250
but the force needs if you are in the hands of the devil.

254
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,630
Well, who is the owner?

255
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,460
My sister owns. Ms.. Femm.

256
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,950
How are you, Mrs.. Femm?

257
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:11,550
My name Porterhouse. Sir William Porterhouse

258
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,600
And this lady is Mrs.. Gladys Ducane, a friend of mine.

259
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,350
Nice to meet you. Great weather for ducks.

260
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,730
Let me introduce you. This is Miss. Waverton.

261
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,150
How are you?

262
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,650
'Mr Penderel. How are you, Sir William?

263
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:29,750
And Mr. Waverton. How are you?

264
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,870
Sir William Porterhouse.

265
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,090
How are you?

266
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,040
I have not seen a night like this in my life.

267
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:41,580
I'd say it's raining cats and dogs.

268
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:44,200
We were soaked, I do not mind telling you.

269
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:46,930
Would not surprise me that we were at the gates of death.

270
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,060
Better not come back to get wet shoes ...

271
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,560
or, as Sir William points, will surely be at the gates of death.

272
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,100
Here you go. They are not exactly measure but dry.

273
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:02,160
Thank you. It's okay.

274
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you. Fond of opera, Monsieur?

275
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:16,580
Let's eat.

276
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:18,580
Oh! Now I hear.

277
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,760
Morgan, brings chairs.

278
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,560
Oh, oh! Roast beef!

279
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:34,960
Nothing like a roast beef for a hungry man.

280
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:42,060
& Quot; Oh, the roast beef of Old England & quot; ... How was it?

281
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:45,060
Do not remember it, Mister Waverton, or is older than you.?

282
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:48,440
-Penderel Is our expert songs. Then he must be a musician, right?

283
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,600
Well, I have heard little.

284
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,030
Take a potato.

285
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,630
Morgan brings a glass of water to Sir William.

286
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,840
Thank you very much.

287
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,810
Us ... look, for example.

288
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,940
We here six people sitting together,

289
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:33,240
We spent nearly two hours talking ...

290
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:36,780
Something ... and we know each other? Nothing.

291
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:38,030
How comforting.

292
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:40,660
I agree Sir William. At best, only make assumptions.

293
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,410
If you were a woman, do not just assumptions.

294
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:46,420
Ah! The famous female intuition.

295
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:48,500
Have you ever been told which horse will win the race?

296
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:51,500
No. But tell me a lot about you.

297
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,760
I wonder, Miss. Waverton,

298
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,260
As much as to say that I'm wanted by the police?

299
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,960
Oh, no, Mr. Femm not say anything so romantic.

300
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:04,470
After all, it is conceivable that someone living in a house like this ...

301
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,170
If you had to ...?

302
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,690
Well, there's no accounting for taste.

303
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,150
No.

304
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,110
-¿Sra. DuCane? Yes?

305
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:16,280
What does your intuition tell you about me?

306
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:17,160
Pretty.

307
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:19,280
Hmm ... That scares me a lot.

308
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:20,780
What do you say?

309
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:24,040
I said ... well, either way is not very interesting.

310
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:28,750
Oh yes it is. We want to know. Well ... it sounds silly but ...

311
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:31,500
I think ... not suited to these times ...

312
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:35,010
You know ...? Factories, misleading advertising, underground economy ...

313
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:39,220
... Well, what I mean is that Bill is happy with this ...

314
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:42,510
Make you feel ... but Mr. Penderel like a fish out of water.

315
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:44,600
Should be flattered, Mr. Penderel.

316
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:45,980
No, I do not feel flattered.

317
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:50,980
Look, I have little sympathy for the fish out of water if only one of them.

318
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:53,860
My problem is I do not think much about the important things.

319
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:59,200
Now Sir William would put great effort into anything to earn a few pounds.

320
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,950
I do not think it worthwhile.

321
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,490
No doubt you must think I'm very ambitious, friend.

322
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,330
But maybe I can see things a bit further than assumed.

323
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:10,290
His good speech, but I know as well as everyone here ...

324
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,210
Just trying ... to provoke me.

325
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:14,420
Honestly, I was not doing anything.

326
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:16,380
I envy. I admire.

327
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:19,050
Oh, yes, envy me, fine. But not admire me.

328
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:26,140
Well, I ... I do not admire me. I know that not everyone is making money.

329
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:31,980
But let me tell you something. I am a young man, see? ...

330
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:35,320
Married ... with a girl from Manchester, beautiful as anyone,

331
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,820
the only thing in the world that matters me ...

332
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:44,910
... It dies. It was. My bosses give a party. We invite ...

333
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:49,460
... A very special day for us. I bought my first suit ...

334
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:54,840
Lucy ... and has a new dress. A cotton dress ...

335
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,980
Lucy ... it seems that was not very well at the party,

336
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:03,380
especially among women, despised. Nothing concrete, you know ...

337
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:08,850
Just ... thought the dress was not very good. Lucy is concerned ...

338
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:13,190
You ... into his head that his guilt will not be successful ...

339
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,830
... Well, you can not believe it but I know that's what killed her.

340
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,940
That's what I did to start making money.

341
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:22,080
I swore I would kill those guys and their wives,

342
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:24,280
they had neither a kind word for Lucy.

343
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:27,610
And I was crushed. At least the majority.

344
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,330
Once you've started making money, you can not stop ...

345
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:36,170
... Especially if you're like me, you're not good at anything else.

346
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,390
But we do not know what Gladys has to be better than us. Mrs.. Ducane ...

347
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,410
... Why not tell them your real name?

348
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,930
My real name ... is Perkins.

349
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,060
A pretty name.

350
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:58,180
I can be this or that, but I can not pretend to be what I'm not.

351
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,860
I think it's you. Still a little offensive.

352
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:04,070
Let Mr. Penderel. I can take care of myself.

353
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:06,960
If I do not do it now, I can not do it anymore.

354
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,290
I was not trying to say anything for you, Bill ...

355
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:14,500
Not pretend to be ... what I'm not. I'm not that stupid for that.

356
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:17,750
These people recognize one when they see a showgirl ...

357
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:21,370
... And, by the way, not very good.

358
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:25,520
If I were better at my job, I would not be spending the weekend with you.

359
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:29,120
No. I take it back. Also I would.

360
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:32,220
You are kind. We're good, but ...

361
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,110
Morgan is drinking. I knew this night would begin.

362
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:47,120
'Where's he get? -From me there. Can not you stop him?

363
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:49,710
It is now in the kitchen, drunk. Pretty drunk.

364
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,880
Who is Morgan? Is the guy who served us the table?

365
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:02,060
Yes. ... Morgan is the butler.

366
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:05,550
He looks at me as if I were to take hair.

367
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,200
Hello.

368
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,600
Hello.

369
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,600
Well? Have you come to help me see God's wrath?

370
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,060
No. I come to thank him on my side.

371
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,980
It has been an honor, Mrs.. Ducane.

372
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,530
Perkins for you.

373
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,400
Thank you, Perkins.

374
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,570
Pawn this old mansion for a drink.

375
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,150
Hmm ... and me.

376
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:33,951
And we will succeed! I have some whiskey in the car. I forgot.

377
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,950
Wait here and go for it. No, I'll go with you.

378
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,660
Better stay here under cover.

379
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,661
The car is in the stables and will soak.

380
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,530
Okay, but not late.

381
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,320
¿Mr. Penderel?

382
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:46,570
Hello. Why are you here? It was becoming.

383
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,940
I've come to find.

384
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,430
Hey, hey. What is it? What happened?

385
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,120
Nothing. In fact, nothing. I'm a little scared, that's all.

386
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,570
Someone closed the door in my face.

387
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:04,040
It must have been the wind. Not. I know what is the wind.

388
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:07,390
It is quiet, but he could lie down.

389
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,830
Yes, sure. Well, what you want is a drink of this.

390
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,450
Thank you.

391
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,420
I'm feeling a little more human.

392
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,810
This looks like a family reunion.

393
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,260
He's right.

394
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,650
Look at this.

395
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,030
Come on, take them out.

396
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,290
It seems I've spent most of the afternoon changing his shoes.

397
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,320
It should have been a nurse.

398
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:47,380
Yeah, only good nurses do not drink whiskey bottle.

399
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
The storm is worse than never, right?

400
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:56,760
Worst.

401
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,940
It had to happen. Gone is the light.

402
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:06,370
I think now it's gone completely. Overnight at twilight.

403
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,250
Okay, but surely there are some sailing somewhere.

404
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,200
Can I do something with lights, Mrs.. Femm?

405
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:17,330
No. Nobody understands our system except Morgan.

406
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:21,040
And as an electrician, Morgan moment is not qualified.

407
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,210
Why not you got a light?

408
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,910
No. We have no lamp.

409
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,090
What did he say? Nothing, nothing major.

410
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:33,090
No? Nothing important? It turns out that this time I heard.

411
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,720
They want a lamp.

412
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:38,210
Give them big. Has fuel. We used the last time the power went out.

413
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:40,890
Come on, Horace. You know what it is.

414
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:44,310
I do not know where he is. You could go you, Rebecca.

415
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:48,570
It's too big for me. If you do not know where I'll tell you.

416
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:53,030
You know as well as I do. It is on the small table on the top floor.

417
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,100
Do you know where the top floor, Horace?

418
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:01,400
At least you will know that there is a top floor. Oh, but you're so incredulous.

419
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:05,540
He's up, Horace. Top. Below the roof.

420
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:10,210
Yes, of course. I remember now. But I think it is a bit heavy for me.

421
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:13,260
I do not think the can down the stairs.

422
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:17,340
Why not say what happens, Horace? It happens that you're afraid to ride alone.

423
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,890
Go with it. Tenga. I do not know why I bother ...

424
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,190
Well ... we'd be sitting in the dark.

425
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,650
Better to go up, right? Yes. I guess so.

426
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:37,740
It will not take.

427
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,360
Very well. Miss. Waverton should not worry about me nervous.

428
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,770
You. Would be a better guide.

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,070
This is my room.

430
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,070
Yeah?

431
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:23,490
There are a couple of things that I think would like to see.

432
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:26,420
I sure would like a lot. But it taught me another time.

433
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:29,320
We have to find the lamp. Yes.

434
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,720
Hey, why should we bother to fetch the lamp?

435
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:44,260
We could wait here a few minutes, and say that we have found. Or it's broken.

436
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:45,850
I find no reason.

437
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:49,390
Yes, but why should we care so much about the lamp if you do not want?

438
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,590
We have said that the head down, why we were not going to do?

439
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:54,610
Yes, but why should we do if we want? I do not want.

440
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:55,980
This is absurd.

441
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,730
Did you hear that?

442
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,431
I heard something.

443
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:02,880
What was it?

444
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:10,650
Was it Morgan. It is drunk. You will be making a fuss down the kitchen.

445
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:16,130
I thought the noise came from above. Anyway, are we on the lamp?

446
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:21,550
I wonder if I excuse not to come with you. I'm not very strong.

447
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:27,630
There are many steps. I should have said before, but you know, love itself ...

448
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:35,000
You will find it above the small table at the end of the landing two floor up.

449
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,760
I guess it's not too heavy to lower myself.

450
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh, not at all. In fact it is fairly light.

451
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,470
I see.

452
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,700
Thank you, thank you very much.

453
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,710
You. Has opened, right? Well now you go and close it. We will close it. I can not.

454
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:15,000
Going to close what?

455
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,360
The rain is coming. The flood is rising.

456
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,460
We will all get wet if it is not fast.

457
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:22,340
It refers to the window of his room. I think I've opened.

458
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,550
Come on. You've opened. You can shut.

459
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,390
Okay, Ms.. Femm. I'm going to close it.

460
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,940
Mr. Penderel! Mrs.. DuCane!

461
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,690
Mr. Penderel! Mrs.. DuCane!

462
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,060
Is Morgan. It is there, at the foot of the stairs.

463
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,380
Take the candle. Stay there.

464
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,190
Go away! Get out of here!

465
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,380
Is he dead? No, I see him breathing from here.

466
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,850
It is only stunned.

467
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:26,110
You will be awake in a minute, but it sure will fall asleep. It is very drunk.

468
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:28,220
Oh, Philip, this house is horrible.

469
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:30,090
Is not it very nice, no?

470
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,330
Listen, Margaret, something is going up.

471
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,290
Oh, Philip. No more horrors.

472
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:44,620
No, this is not horror. It was a voice calling behind a door.

473
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:48,880
A faint voice, like a child. I think I should go and see what happens.

474
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:52,440
You'll have to come with me. I never want to leave you alone.

475
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:57,680
Morgan will be fine. Give me your hand, darling.

476
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,230
Oh, Philip. 'What is it? Sit a while dear.

477
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,640
Thank you.

478
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:22,210
It Well, what happened then? Then the war ended.

479
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,960
What happened to the girl? 'Oh, the girl I left forgotten?

480
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:29,380
'The girl I was in love. 'The reason is that she married, Gladys.

481
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:30,250
What a bitch.

482
00:42:30,285 --> 00:42:35,260
No, on the contrary, a girl of good reputation. Now, let's talk about you.

483
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:39,050
I know what I will say. I was going to ask Bill Porterhouse.

484
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:40,890
Very ready, Mrs.. Perkins.

485
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,940
I do not mind telling you. Rather I prefer. Bill is fine, really.

486
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:51,360
Obviously not love him. And of course, gives me money.

487
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:54,360
Not much, but enough to keep me.

488
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,120
You probably will not believe me, but no ... Bill does not expect anything from me.

489
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:05,350
Do you understand what I mean by & quot, & quot ;? nothing

490
00:43:05,385 --> 00:43:07,370
. Yeah I understand what you mean & quot, & quot ;. nothing

491
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:10,010
You like people to think it's effeminate.

492
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:13,130
With all the money you have, it is very lonely.

493
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:16,510
Yeah, I figured when I heard the story of the cotton coat.

494
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:19,720
I think that is still in love with his former wife.

495
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:25,980
I'm sure. I guess the only thing is that I want to keep him company.

496
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,330
He likes to sit at night in my bed and brag ...

497
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:30,440
Things ... he has done during the day.

498
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:35,230
Well, that's pretty harmless. Look, do not pretend to be better than I am.

499
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:38,280
You.'s A lovely creature, right?

500
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,200
I like it, terribly.

501
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,080
And you to me.

502
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,850
'What are you thinking? -ud. should not be too satisfied.

503
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,040
Dare.

504
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,220
I was thinking that I'd like to pretend I'm your lover ...

505
00:43:57,255 --> 00:44:00,220
and you.'s mine, Gladys, body and soul.

506
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:09,910
I would take her in my arms and hold strong.

507
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:11,650
I too would like.

508
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:16,990
Would he, Gladys Perkins? If so, then, leave it's pretend.

509
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:30,920
I heard. Gladys Perkins has an idea. I think he has gone mad.

510
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:39,540
She ... she ... she wants to live with you. Oh, I'm throwing her arms.

511
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:46,810
I had the crazy idea that should help you become a useful person.

512
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,010
Dear, Perkins ...

513
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,020
Do you think I'm crazy?

514
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:56,020
Pretty crazy, dear. And I thank God for it.

515
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:58,030
So what are you saying?

516
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,520
This is what I say, dear Perkins.

517
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,700
But I have better than his idea.

518
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:16,480
What is?

519
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,900
Is this ...

520
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:22,301
No, I will not tell here. Here is magic.

521
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:26,610
I'll tell you later at home, perhaps with the first rays of dawn.

522
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,090
Tell me now.

523
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,790
Come, let us return to the house. No! No, let's stay here.

524
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,690
It is cold.

525
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:39,730
No. It's the idea of ​​returning to the house which makes me shiver.

526
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:44,520
I have the feeling that something terrible might happen to us if we return to the house.

527
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:48,740
Perkins, Perkins. You have my iron arm, right?

528
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,500
It's okay. Come on.

529
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,290
No, these shoes are not so wet place. I'll try to carry her.

530
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,120
Weight as a demon.

531
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:05,590
Well, if you weigh too much for me, I'll throw the mud and go on alone.

532
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,350
Hello. Where were they?

533
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,100
I went to the car for something to drink.

534
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:56,340
And I went with him.

535
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,180
Is wet feet.

536
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:10,310
Oh, have you wet your feet? Yes, got wet feet.

537
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,500
Well, what the hell is going on here?

538
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:18,210
I do not know what the hell is happening here or anywhere.

539
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:22,530
I went to the room from the old to close a window and came across this again.

540
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:23,575
Where are the others?

541
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:28,550
I do not know more than you. Mr. Waverton up with Mr. Femm find a lamp.

542
00:47:28,585 --> 00:47:31,930
I guess his wife joined them. I've slept.

543
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,980
So you have wet feet?

544
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:38,750
Yes, Bill. But that's not all.

545
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:41,010
Yes, I thought so.

546
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:46,380
I do not know how you going to take, but ... well, I have to get it out from the inside.

547
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:48,050
Come on.

548
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:50,320
I fell in love, Bill.

549
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:52,280
Oh right, of course.

550
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:54,880
-¿De Him? Yes, him.

551
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,670
Damn stupid Maybe. But one does not choose these things.

552
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:01,880
Money does she have? 'Not a penny.

553
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:03,340
And you're going to go with it?

554
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,170
Yes, Bill. Are you mad?

555
00:48:06,205 --> 00:48:10,090
I think you're a lunatic. But I'm not angry.

556
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:14,330
Took'm pretty good, no, Perkins? 'I told you. To Bill all good.

557
00:48:14,965 --> 00:48:16,310
I can see that.

558
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,040
I wonder where the other may be.

559
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,160
Listen, Bill. She has not told her everything.

560
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,500
Oh, no? Why?

561
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:33,580
Because she does not know everything. We're getting married.

562
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,630
Oh yeah?

563
00:48:36,365 --> 00:48:41,460
At the end she will have me. I'll ask tomorrow, with the first rays of dawn.

564
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,930
Will you come to the wedding?

565
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:46,760
I think he's sick in the head.

566
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:47,830
Really?

567
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,470
No, not really.

568
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,060
I think today will have been probably the best working day of his life.

569
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:59,850
Ah, Bill, Bill ...

570
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:01,730
Who said you can call me Bill?

571
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:03,560
Well, try to avoid it.

572
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:06,780
Now, look at this, come here and do something useful by raising this table.

573
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,820
No way to find the roast beef.

574
00:49:10,855 --> 00:49:13,200
Mrs.. Perkins, filetée roast beef.

575
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:14,240
Filetéalo yourself.

576
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,250
Are you sure you feeling better?

577
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:23,790
Yes, I'm fine.

578
00:49:23,825 --> 00:49:25,190
Well, come on.

579
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,080
This is the door.

580
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,510
Who are you.?

581
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:16,010
I'm Miss. Waverton. He is my husband. Are you. Mr. Roderick Femm?

582
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,140
We came because we believed hearing him call.

583
00:50:21,175 --> 00:50:23,010
Can we do something for you?

584
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,200
Can you take it. Want it or give it?

585
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:40,000
I myself, thanks.

586
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,660
And now, what was that noise?

587
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,570
Was it ... Morgan? Yes.

588
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:06,100
Morgan is a savage. I ... I apologize.

589
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:12,230
But we must keep him here. They had it coming.

590
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:14,940
I'm sorry, really, but we could have helped.

591
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:21,660
Oh, I ... did not mean that. I was never inhospitable. Never.

592
00:51:22,895 --> 00:51:28,750
This house was always full of people, some time ago.

593
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,420
When they came, what they told?

594
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,380
We told you. Was invalid.

595
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:38,170
Is that all?

596
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:39,071
Yes.

597
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:44,520
Have you seen my son Horace? And his sister Rebecca?

598
00:51:44,555 --> 00:51:45,230
Yes.

599
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:55,090
And Morgan. I would tell you all about it ... but no time.

600
00:51:56,025 --> 00:52:02,170
Look, when you're as old as I, at any moment, you can die.

601
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,460
Oh, please, do not talk if that fatigue.

602
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:15,940
This house is cursed. Two of my sons died at age 20.

603
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:22,390
And then ... spent more. Wine madness.

604
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:33,150
You see, we're all a little crazy. Except for me. At least, I ... I think not.

605
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,280
Want to sleep?

606
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:46,410
No. Not now. Look, it could be ...

607
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,660
Could what?

608
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,620
Dangerous.

609
00:52:51,655 --> 00:52:53,220
Are you referring to Morgan?

610
00:52:53,455 --> 00:53:00,050
No. Morgan no. I refer to my oldest son.

611
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:01,880
Saul.

612
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:04,100
Is this the Saul?

613
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,460
Have not spoken to Saul?

614
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,020
No, they did not.

615
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:14,230
Saul is the worst, you know? We have to monitor.

616
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:25,170
Because look, he wants ... he just wants to ... destroy, kill. Poor Saul.

617
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:26,530
Where is?

618
00:53:26,565 --> 00:53:29,160
I know where it is. He's upstairs, behind the door chained, right?

619
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,750
Yes. Enclosed.

620
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:36,550
Saul is why we have to keep Morgan.

621
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:38,510
If there is no escape?

622
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:44,670
Saul probably set fire the house.

623
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,670
Already tried it once.

624
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:55,190
He said he wanted to make an offering of the house.

625
00:53:55,225 --> 00:53:57,020
But are you sure locked, no?

626
00:53:57,055 --> 00:54:03,110
Yes. But look, if Morgan is wrong, I ...

627
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:07,620
I think ... could ... open the door.

628
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,460
Philip. What if he comes back?

629
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:18,380
Wait here. I'll go down and will look on her.

630
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,190
It has risen above. I heard. You will drop to Saul.

631
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,780
Hope the foot of the stairs and kill him.

632
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,160
What should we do? Can we stay here?

633
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:52,160
No, what if would cause a fire? Come on.

634
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:53,540
And what about Sir Roderick?

635
00:54:53,575 --> 00:54:54,930
Will block the door.

636
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,940
Sir Roderick, I'll lock him in here.

637
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,490
Asleep.

638
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,190
What is it?

639
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:21,220
There's a crazy up. Morgan has missed and dangerous.

640
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,900
We have to do something. 'Where are they now?

641
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:25,740
Top. But they can get off at any time.

642
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:28,870
Everything's fine, dear. I knew something terrible was going to happen.

643
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,880
Would not it be better to take away the middle? No, we can not do that.

644
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:34,580
You could burn the house down. Already tried it once.

645
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:37,790
Well, let. Let this old corrupt house burn. I hope so.

646
00:55:37,825 --> 00:55:39,880
That's fine, but what about the Femm?

647
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,860
What is it?

648
00:55:41,995 --> 00:55:43,340
His brother has escaped from the room.

649
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,170
Who? Is this the Saul?

650
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,510
Look.

651
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,650
Stay back.

652
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,990
Do it backwards, Morgan! Do you hear me? Do it back!

653
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,220
Take him to the kitchen!

654
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:49,921
Do it in!

655
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,720
Lock him in the kitchen!

656
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,010
The sins of our fathers. The sins of our fathers.

657
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,350
Come on! Come into my room!

658
00:57:58,385 --> 00:58:00,180
No! I'm not moving from here.

659
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:01,640
Well here it is!

660
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,060
I think we will have problems.

661
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,830
Oh! Penderel!

662
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:21,400
Come on, come here.

663
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:24,230
No! I'm staying here.

664
00:58:24,465 --> 00:58:27,050
Gladys, do something difficult come here. Margaret.

665
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,210
Oh, no. All right

666
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,550
Wait a minute.

667
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,880
Here, start this.

668
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,870
Oh, I love you so much. Just what I want.

669
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,640
Please. Please do not touch me.

670
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:26,520
Good! What is it?

671
00:59:26,555 --> 00:59:30,570
Listen, I do not re-lock. Do not let me lock again.

672
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:33,610
I'm not crazy. I swear to God I'm not crazy.

673
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,490
And why would that shut him up?

674
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:45,290
I have fear. I know things about them. Years ago, killed his sister Rachel.

675
00:59:45,325 --> 00:59:47,670
But I do not think counting! I promised I would never tell.

676
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,880
And they have remained here all this time for that?

677
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:57,300
And Morgan ... I assure you, it's the devil. Morgan hits me.

678
00:59:57,835 --> 00:59:59,590
Do not leave me! Stay with me!

679
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:05,480
It's okay. Sit here and wait. Be right back.

680
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,280
The door is locked! Ms.. Femm must've closed.

681
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:22,570
It's locked, right? Yes.

682
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:26,160
That's better. Now, you can not stop me.

683
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:29,690
Listen, we have to go help the rest with Morgan.

684
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:31,380
Is there another way in?

685
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:32,910
No. There is no way ...

686
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:35,720
But there must be a back entrance to the house.

687
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,200
Freeze!

688
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,430
I want to tell a story.

689
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,900
Who's there? Nobody.

690
01:00:57,435 --> 01:00:58,910
Friends of yours?

691
01:00:59,145 --> 01:01:00,830
I tell you no one.

692
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:02,450
Do invite her out?

693
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:04,830
You ... You. Going to tell me something.

694
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,240
Yes, it is.

695
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,380
Do not ... I did not tell that story?

696
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:23,020
Yes. Shall we sit?

697
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:25,820
Yes, please.

698
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,820
Who is in that closet?

699
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:42,570
No one. Tell me what I was going to say.

700
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,920
Are you interested in the fire?

701
01:01:52,955 --> 01:01:56,850
Of course ... of course yes. Yes, quite.

702
01:01:57,285 --> 01:01:59,330
I have done a study on the fire.

703
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:02,480
Really? This seems very interesting.

704
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:07,360
Fire know things that no one else in the world knows.

705
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:12,190
And not me going to say? I would like to know.

706
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:15,730
Why's he going to say? You. Would not tell me who is inside that closet.

707
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:22,280
Yes I would say. Besides, you know, it would be unfair to arouse my curiosity ...

708
01:02:22,315 --> 01:02:23,780
And at the end ... not tell me anything.

709
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:26,730
Want me to tell you all about fire, right?

710
01:02:26,865 --> 01:02:28,390
Yes, I'm looking forward.

711
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:33,830
All right. First of all, I learned that llamas are like razors.

712
01:02:33,865 --> 01:02:41,760
They are cool, man. Sharp and cold as snow, and hot as ice.

713
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,470
Oh. Certainly that's very ... very interesting.

714
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:55,100
So, really they are like razors, right? Well, continue.

715
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:56,740
Tell me what else has discovered.

716
01:02:56,975 --> 01:03:01,280
Oh, lots of things. Dude, sit down.

717
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,030
So I thought I could fool me, right?

718
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:13,330
I thought I could leave me sitting here and not notice.

719
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:18,890
But as you can see, I am also ready. That's why we understand each other.

720
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:24,220
So he quickly realized that he wanted to kill.

721
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:31,720
We understand each other very well, eh, my friend?

722
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:35,790
Yes, yes, of course. From the start, for some reason ...

723
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:38,690
... You ... you. Pleased me and I ... I thought you liked me.

724
01:03:38,725 --> 01:03:46,200
¿Please me? Dude, I do. Did you know that my name is Saul?

725
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:50,120
Saul, friend. And Saul loved David.

726
01:03:50,155 --> 01:03:51,620
Yes, of course.

727
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:57,040
But Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul.

728
01:03:57,075 --> 01:04:01,540
And sooner or later it had to happen that the spirit of evil from taking over Saul.

729
01:04:01,575 --> 01:04:06,800
And he prophesied in the midst of the temple. And David played the harp with his hands.

730
01:04:06,835 --> 01:04:10,410
And Saul had a spear in his hands.

731
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:12,850
And Saul threw the spear.

732
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:20,310
And he said, & quot; atravesaré her to David and stab you in the wall & quot ;.

733
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:28,820
And David left his sight twice. Twice friend ...

734
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:37,210
And ... the third ... the third time ... be careful.

735
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:42,460
Hey. I am your friend. I'm on your side. It would be foolish to miss. If I lose ...

736
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,800
Look! Is Morgan! He's come for you.! Morgan!

737
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:46,510
Freeze! Do not move!

738
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,370
Philip! Philip!

739
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,140
Oh, leave! Do not see it? There's Penderel!

740
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:05,020
Let me go with him. Come on let me. Go, let me pass.

741
01:07:09,455 --> 01:07:15,530
Oh, you're a pig. But I'm not afraid. I go with him. Do you hear me?

742
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:17,730
Oh, how can?

743
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,420
Listen, I'm single, you hear me? I want to go with Penderel. It hurt.

744
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:29,740
Oh, how I can make you understand me? He was hurt.

745
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:33,530
I have to help him and the other man, Saul.

746
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,231
The two are injured.

747
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,700
Are you all right, Margaret? Yes, I'm fine, dear.

748
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,250
Gladys.

749
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,550
It's okay. Come on. Are you feeling better?

750
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,990
Yes, I'm not so bad.

751
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:47,160
What happened to them? It was Morgan. The hit.

752
01:08:47,195 --> 01:08:48,110
Come on.

753
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:54,420
I'm all right. Where is Penderel? I have to heal.

754
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,690
Better not go there.

755
01:08:58,891 --> 01:08:59,991
Come with me.

756
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,460
-¡Está Alive! 'What?

757
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:20,850
I tell them that is alive! He's alive!

758
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:47,950
Good Morning.

759
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,020
Good Morning.

760
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,480
Good morning, Mr. Waverton.

761
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,480
Good Morning.

762
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,990
The floods have come down considerably.

763
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,040
Thank the heavens for that.

764
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,130
I think they will now be possible to go by ambulance.

765
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:15,460
You mean we can go now?

766
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:18,130
Yes, sure we can go now. Come with me, dear.

767
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:23,680
-ud. are going to stay here with Gladys, right? Yes. Do not delay.

768
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:25,880
No, we'll go as fast as we can.

769
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,870
Goodbye. Goodbye.

770
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:48,950
Bye Bye. Nice to have met you.

771
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,100
So I'm dead and I have gone to heaven.

772
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:14,060
No, it's morning and we have just left behind hell.

773
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:17,100
-¿De Day? Yes. The rays of dawn.

774
01:11:17,935 --> 01:11:21,150
Do not tell me you had to something with the first rays of dawn?

775
01:11:21,385 --> 01:11:23,280
On second thought, there was something.

776
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,860
Perkins. Will you marry me?

777
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,961
End

1
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,359
What are you stopping for?

2
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:47,436
I'm stopping for a rest.

3
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,279
Really Philip, you
can't stop here.

4
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,360
For pity's sake rather go on
or go back.

5
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:54,897
You can't expect me to spend the night
like a half-drowned rat on a mountainside.

6
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:58,187
Better to stop than drive the car
gently over a cliff, isn't it?

7
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,220
Well, it won't help things
losing your temper.

8
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,830
I've never been in a better temper
in my life.

9
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:06,689
I love driving a hundred miles through
the dark practically without headlights.

10
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:09,961
I love the trickle of ice cold water
pouring down my neck.

11
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,954
This is one
of the happiest moments of my life.

12
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,970
- Would you like me to drive for a bit?
- Yes, I was expecting that.

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,405
Oh, I shall be glad
if we get to Shrewsbury.

14
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,234
If we get to Shrewsbury.

15
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:38,050
- You happen to have any idea where we are?
- I haven't the least idea in the world.

16
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,056
That's very comforting.

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,905
You all right, Penderel?

18
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,560
Fine. Where are we?

19
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:48,350
We don't know. We've lost our way.
We're somewhere in the Welsh mountains.

20
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,620
It's half past nine,
and I'm very sorry.

21
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:51,715
Don't mention it!

22
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,960
- Ten to one we don't see Shrewsbury tonight.
- Oh well, never mind.

23
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,970
<i>Oh, Mister Waverton, what shall I do?</i>

24
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,590
<i>I wanted to go to Shrewsbury
but they took me on to [Crew?]</i>

25
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:05,198
As a matter of fact,
taking one thing with another,

26
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:07,897
I'm not particularly sure
that I want to go to Shrewsbury.

27
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,803
Far as that goes, I don't particularly
want to go anywhere.

28
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,080
Something might happen here,
but nothing ever happens in Shrewsbury.

29
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,530
Something certainly might happen here.

30
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,070
I'll tell you something that might happen.

31
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:25,552
- I don't want to frighten Mrs. Waverton.
- Go on, Mr. Penderel, I'm not easily frightened.

32
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:31,198
- Aren't you? I am. Well, I was just going to say,
we'll have to be a bit careful...

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,810
Don't stop!

34
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:49,220
How can I help stopping?
You think we're in a motorboat?

35
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,440
<i>Stuck for the night!
Stuck for the night! Stuck...</i>

36
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:55,110
- Sr. Penderel, please!
- Sorry.

37
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:02,700
- Do you think we'll do it?
- I really don't know.

38
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,760
Bon Voyage.

39
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:16,260
Well, now, for heaven's sakes, stop!
Let's look at a map or something.

40
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,920
My own view is we're not on a map.

41
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,830
Oh, you look, Philip, I can't see anything.
It's all a stupid puddle.

42
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,180
Seems to represent this country very well.
Everything here is underwater.

43
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,410
Oh, just drive on.
We'll arrive somewhere, sometime.

44
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,050
I suppose that's all we can do.

45
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,150
<i>Singin' in the bathtub,
singin' in the rain....</i>

46
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,470
Oh, look, Phil! Lights! Lights!
Pull in there.

47
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:08,490
- Probably wiser to push on.
- Well, I'm for staying here.

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,780
There you are.
The whole hilltop has probably fallen off.

49
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,890
<i>'Is there anybody there?,
said the Traveller.'</i>

50
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,257
Knock again, louder.

51
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,796
I suppose that was loud enough
to wake the dead.

52
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,720
- That's an idea.
- What is?

53
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:03,570
Wouldn't it be dramatic?
Supposing the people inside were dead,

54
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,314
all stretched out with the lights
quietly burning about them.

55
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,441
I'm sure it would be very amusing.

56
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:11,142
I'm sure I could do with a drink.

57
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,201
If people have to be soaked,
they should be soaked inside, not out.

58
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,460
- Listen.
- What is it?

59
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,060
I thought I heard something.

60
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:29,493
Good evening, we've come to ask
for shelter, we've lost our way.

61
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:30,843
We're absolutely cut off.

62
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:34,313
Don't you understand? We can't go
forward and we can't go back.

63
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:37,730
The road's blocked on both sides,
landslide

64
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:47,783
Even Welsh ought not sound like that.

65
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,655
My name is Femm. Horace Femm.
How do you do?

66
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,530
I'm very sorry to break in
on you like this.

67
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,873
My name is Waverton.
May I introduce my wife?

68
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,162
How do you do?

69
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:29,563
Penderel!

70
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:31,671
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- How do you do?

71
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,110
Won't you sit down?

72
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,740
Thank you.

73
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:44,530
My sister was on the point
of arranging these flowers.

74
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,001
I don't know if your man
explained the situation to you.

75
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:58,135
He did his best but I'm afraid
I couldn't understand him.

76
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,247
You see, Morgan is dumb.

77
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,745
Oh, I see. Of course,
I didn't realize.

78
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:03,852
We saw your lights and wondered

79
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:05,986
if you'd be kind enough
to give us shelter for the night.

80
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,692
You see it's
quite impossible to go on.

81
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:11,160
I see. How awkward.
How very awkward.

82
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:13,058
What is it?
What do they want?

83
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:16,092
Allow me to introduce my sister,
Rebecca Femm.

84
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,371
How do you do?

85
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:25,951
What are they doing here?
What do they want?

86
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,500
How are you?
How do you do?

87
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,551
What do they say?
What do they want?

88
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:34,043
What are they doing here?
What's all the fuss about? What?

89
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,780
You must excuse my sister.
She's a little deaf.

90
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,825
In fact, sometimes quite deaf.

91
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,274
They want to know if they
can stay here for the night.

92
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,845
Shelter. They've been caught
in the storm.

93
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,232
Of course they can't stay!
We can't have them here!

94
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:50,871
...
Go on...

95
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,825
You see, there's a landslide.
Half the mountain seems to be crumbling.

96
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,380
It only just missed us.

97
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,580
The road's blocked behind us and I'm
pretty sure it's blocked in front as well.

98
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,596
We hate to intrude but what else can we do?

99
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,188
You see there isn't anywhere else
we can go.

100
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,259
And even the road below is underwater
and, for that matter,

101
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,974
this place itself may be underwater
pretty soon or even buried.

102
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:11,627
What's the matter?

103
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,588
Did you hear what he said?
There's a landslide and floods.

104
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:19,918
The lake has burst its banks.
We're trapped. We're trapped.

105
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:23,020
We've got to go. Do you hear?
We've got to go.

106
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,509
Hmmph. You're afraid, Horace.
You're afraid, aren't you?

107
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,923
You don't believe in God
and yet you're afraid to die.

108
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,487
You've seen His anger in the sky
and you've heard Him in the night.

109
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:35,973
And you're afraid. Afraid. Afraid.
Where's your mocking now?

110
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:39,203
You might well be afraid.
Your time will come.

111
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:44,784
But it hasn't come yet. This house is safe.
I know it better than you. Morgan!

112
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,825
You remember the great storm years ago
when we were cut off?

113
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,784
And there was a landslide. And floods.
And the roads were washed away?

114
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,390
Morgan remembers. He means this house
is safe. Because it's built on rock.

115
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:15,435
You will have to stay here.
The misfortune is yours, not ours.

116
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,693
No beds!
They cann't have beds!

117
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,445
As my sister hints, there are,
I'm afraid, no beds.

118
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:25,717
That's quite all right. If we can just sit
around the fire that will be fine.

119
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:30,922
By all means. I'm not very sure
that I want to go to bed myself tonight.

120
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,871
Morgan will tend to the fire.

121
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:37,380
Is there any place I can put
the car out of the rain?

122
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:40,257
There are some stables 'round the corner,
to the right.

123
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:44,600
- Morgan will show you.
- Thanks very much.

124
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,416
- I'll come along and get the bags.
- Right.

125
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,449
No beds! You can't have beds!

126
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,259
- Quite a storm!
- We're well out of it.

127
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,255
I hope you're right, though
this house gives me the creeps,

128
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,352
not to mention its inmates.

129
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,670
Well, it's better than driving along roads
that aren't there.

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
At least there's a roof and a fire here.

131
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:33,270
Now, Mister Penderel, do you think
that you could join me in a drink?

132
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:36,610
Mister Femm, I honestly believe
I could join you in a drink.

133
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:52,120
It's only gin, you know. Only gin.
I like gin.

134
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:54,901
Mrs. Waverton?

135
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,202
Thanks very much.

136
00:11:56,226 --> 00:12:01,063
Mister Penderel, I'll give you a toast
that you will not appreciate, being young.

137
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,011
I give you... illusion!

138
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:07,393
Illusion? Huh! I'm precisely the right age
for that toast, Mister Femm.

139
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,515
Oh. I presume you
are one of the gentlemen slightly,

140
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,741
shall we say,
battered by the war?

141
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,444
Correct, Mister Femm. War generation,
slightly soiled, a study in the bittersweet,

142
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:21,459
the man with the twisted smile, and this,
Mr. Femm, is exceedingly good gin.

143
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,978
Dreadful night.
Seems to be getting worse.

144
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,847
Yes, it is pretty bad.
But evidently there's no danger here.

145
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,696
Your sister was quite definite about that.

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,466
But supposing we're cut off,
shut up in here?

147
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,132
Well, it would be rather a nuisance for you
having us billeted on you like this

148
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:43,352
But it's awful. How can you be so calm?
You don't seem to understand.

149
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,971
We may be cut off.
Shut up in this house!

150
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:51,789
I'm afraid I'm rather nervous.
I am rather a nervous man.

151
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:58,681
The fact is... Morgan is an uncivilized brute.
Sometimes he drinks heavily.

152
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:03,586
A night like this would set him going
and once he's drunk, he's rather dangerous.

153
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,103
I don't wish to alarm you, Mrs. Waverton,
but I don't quite know what we should do.

154
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:11,750
Well, I know what I'm going to do.
That is, if Miss Femm will let me.

155
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:12,522
What?

156
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:16,012
I'm dreadfully wet and I would be so glad
if I could go and change my clothes.

157
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:16,649
What?

158
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:18,729
I wondered if I might change my things?

159
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:20,641
You look wet. You'd better go
and change your things.

160
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, thank you. A good idea.
Is there a bedroom or something?

161
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,909
- It's a dreadful night.
- What?

162
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,867
I say, it's a dreadful night.

163
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,774
Yes, it's a very old house.
Very old.

164
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,426
- Very kind of you to let us stay.
- What?

165
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,953
I say, you're very kind!

166
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,464
Yes, it's a dreadful night.
I'm a little deaf.

167
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:54,786
I understand.

168
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,565
Yes. No beds!

169
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:02,450
I'll have none of this electric light.
I won't have it.

170
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,840
Thanks very much.
I can manage quite well now.

171
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:22,944
My sister Rachel had this room once.
She died when she was twenty-one.

172
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:26,874
She was a wicked one.
Handsome and wild as a hawk.

173
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,089
All the young men
used to follow her about.

174
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:34,706
With her red lips and her big eyes
and her white neck. But that didn't save her.

175
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,494
She fell off her horse, hunting.
Hurt her spine.

176
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:42,161
On this bed she lay,
month after month.

177
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:45,294
Many the time I sat here
listening to her screaming.

178
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,223
How dreadful.

179
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,641
She used to cry out to me...
to kill her.

180
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:53,438
But I'd tell her to turn to the Lord.
But she didn't. She was godless to the last.

181
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,887
Well, I'd better change my wet things.

182
00:14:57,223 --> 00:15:00,922
They were all godless here.
They used to bring their women here.

183
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:04,316
Brazen, lolling creatures
in silks and satins.

184
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,942
They filled the house with
laughter and sin, laughter and sin.

185
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,723
If I ever went down among them...
my own father and brothers...

186
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,901
They would tell me
to go away and pray.

187
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:21,233
They wouldn't tell Rachel to go away
and pray. Ha ha ha ha ha! And I prayed!

188
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:27,509
I left them with their lustful red
and white women. My father's still alive.

189
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,458
He's upstairs. He's very old.

190
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:31,461
Oh, is he?

191
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,569
He's a hundred and two.

192
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,124
That's very old, isn't it?

193
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:37,653
He's a wicked, blasphemous old man.

194
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:49,632
You're wicked, too. Young
and handsome. Silly. And wicked.

195
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:54,050
You think of nothing but your long,
straight legs and your white body

196
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,921
and how to please your man.

197
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:59,160
You revel in the joys of fleshly love,
don't you?

198
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,631
That's fine stuff, but it'll rot.

199
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:07,192
That's finer stuff, still.
But it'll rot, too, in time.

200
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,800
Don't! How dare you?

201
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,120
...brazen, lolling creatures
in silks and satins...

202
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:56,720
laughter and sin... laughter and sin...
lustful red and white women...

203
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,340
Philip! Aaah!

204
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,380
Good for you, Mrs. Waverton.
You make it look like a party.

205
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,140
Thank you.

206
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:44,572
You must have thought I was a long time.

207
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,002
Matter of fact, I thought
you were quicker than usual.

208
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:50,932
Oh. I just thought I'd been rather long.

209
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:53,592
Supper!

210
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,942
Philip.

211
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:21,766
Horace! What are you doing?
We aren't all heathens.

212
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,322
Oh, I had forgotten
my sister's strange tribal habits.

213
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:29,605
The beef will seem less tough
when she has invoked a blessing upon it.

214
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:33,687
Horace Femm. If I can't hear, I can see.
You're blaspheming.

215
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:37,781
On the contrary, my dear Rebecca.
I was merely telling your wondering guests

216
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,703
that you were about to thank
your gods for their bounty....

217
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:43,615
That'll do. I know your mocking,
lying tongue.

218
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:48,617
... to thank them for the health and prosperity
and happiness granted to this family.

219
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:54,090
For its years of peace and plenty. To thank
them for having created Rebecca Femm.

220
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,281
And Roderick Femm. And Saul...

221
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:56,812
Stop!

222
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,282
Bless O Lord this... mankind. Amen.

223
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,982
Have a potato.

224
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:14,762
Thank you.

225
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,475
Well, this is a storm and a half.

226
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,922
Yes, isn't it?

227
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,426
Have a potato.

228
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,655
Thank you. I should love a potato.

229
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,702
Vinegar, Miss Femm?

230
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,732
It's simply coming down
in bucketfuls outside.

231
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:27,522
Thank you, Mrs. Waverton. That's the phrase
I've been searching for all evening.

232
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,192
No, no pickled onions, thank you.

233
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:58,562
Those lights. They gave me quite a start.
I suppose it's the storm.

234
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:01,595
On the contrary. We make
our own electric light here

235
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,018
and we're not really good at it.
Pray don't be alarmed if they go out altogether.

236
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,705
There's someone outside.

237
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,011
They can't come in!

238
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:42,921
But surely they must come in.
It's probably dangerous out there now.

239
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:49,630
They're probably half drowned. You know,
really, we oughtn't keep them waiting.

240
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:53,632
No, I'm afraid we shall have to let them in.
Morgan, open the door.

241
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,161
Come on then, Morgan.
Let them in.

242
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,691
Whoooo! What a night!

243
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:16,235
I thought you were never going
to open that door.

244
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,442
Why... hoo huh hah!... there must've been
a reservoir burst or something.

245
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:24,303
Ha ha ha! Anyhow, before
we knew where we were,

246
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:27,062
something had fallen down
and smashed the car in.

247
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:31,903
Ha ha ha! It's a wonder
it didn't smash us. Hah!

248
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:36,442
Incidentally, this house will probably
be washed away any minute.

249
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,532
Hey, whoa, ha!
Look at that! Ha!

250
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,202
Ohhh. That's a grand fire.

251
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,452
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but... ha!...

252
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:57,336
needs must when the devil drives. Ha ha ha!

253
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:00,684
Well? Who's the owner here?

254
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:04,262
My sister is the owner. Miss Femm.

255
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:06,752
How do you do, Miss Femm?

256
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:11,352
My name is Porterhouse.
Sir William Porterhouse

257
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:15,402
And this lady is Miss Gladys DuCane,
a friend of mine.

258
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,959
Glad to know you.
Nice weather for ducks.

259
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:22,532
Allow me to introduce you.
This is Mrs. Waverton.

260
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,792
How do you do?

261
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:26,452
- Mister Penderel.
- How do you do, Sir William?

262
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:29,552
- And, uh, Mister Waverton.
- How do you do?

263
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:31,672
Sir William Porterhouse.

264
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:32,892
Howdyedo?

265
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:38,659
I've never seen such a night
in all my born natural.

266
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:42,632
I tell you, it's coming down in bucketfuls.
Pretty well soaked we were,

267
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:46,987
I don't mind telling you. I shouldn't
be surprised if we caught our death.

268
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:49,602
Here, you'd better not put
those wet shoes on again,

269
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:53,811
or, as Sir William points out,
you'll probably catch your death.

270
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:59,902
Here you are. These may not be exactly your size
but at least they're dry.

271
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,962
Thanks. That'll do fine.
Whee! Ha ha!

272
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:13,962
Are you fond of opera, Monsieur?

273
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:16,382
Come and have something to eat.

274
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,382
Oh! Now, you're talkin'.

275
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:21,562
Morgan, bring out some chairs.

276
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:34,400
Oh ho! Roast beef! Hah! There's nothing
like roast beef when a man's hungry.

277
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:40,591
<i>Oh, the roast beef of old England...</i>

278
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:44,732
How does that go? Do you remember that,
Mister Waverton, or was that before your time?

279
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:48,242
- Penderel's our song expert.
- Oh, so you're musical, are you?

280
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,402
Well, I've got a bit of an ear myself...

281
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:52,832
Have a potato.

282
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:59,432
Morgan, bring a
glass of water for Sir William.

283
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:11,073
Ah, thanks very much.

284
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:26,656
... take ourselves, for instance.

285
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:29,581
Here we are, six people,
sitting around,

286
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:32,193
and we've been talking now
nearly two hours,

287
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:36,401
and what do we know about each other?
Not a thing.

288
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,720
How reassuring.

289
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,468
I agree with Sir William.
At best, we only make guesses.

290
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,394
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't talk about only guesses.

291
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,930
Ah! The famous old feminine intuition.

292
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:48,199
Does it ever tell you which horse
is going to win the Derby?

293
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:51,589
No. But it tells me
quite a lot about you.

294
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:53,526
I wonder, Mrs. Waverton,

295
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,956
whether it happens to tell you
that I am wanted by the police?

296
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,478
Why, no, Mister Femm,
it tells me nothing so romantic.

297
00:26:00,502 --> 00:26:05,534
After all, can you conceive of anybody
living in a house like this if they didn't have to?

298
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,053
Well, there's no accounting for tastes,
you know.

299
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:11,894
No.

300
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,068
- Miss DuCane?
- Yes?

301
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,238
What does your intuition tell you about me?

302
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:17,211
Quite a lot.

303
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,220
Hmm... that frightens me a good deal.

304
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,738
What does it tell you?

305
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:23,934
It tells me...
Well, it's not very interesting anyway.

306
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,778
Oh, yes, it is. Let's have it.

307
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:31,156
Well... heh heh, it sounds silly but...
I think he doesn't quite fit into these times.

308
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,937
You know, factories and cheap advertising
and money grubbing and...

309
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:39,136
well, what I mean is, Bill here's all right
with these things.

310
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:42,333
But they make Mister Penderel
a kind of fish out of water.

311
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:44,369
You should be flattered, Mister Penderel.

312
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:45,812
No, I'm not flattered.

313
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:50,577
You see, I've not much sympathy with fish
out of water although I happen to be one myself.

314
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,589
My trouble is, I don't think
enough things are worthwhile.

315
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:58,750
Now, Sir William here would put tremendous energy
into anything to make even a few pounds.

316
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:00,797
I don't think it's worth it.

317
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:03,262
No doubt you'll think I'm very fat-headed,
my young friend.

318
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,915
But maybe I can see through things
a bit further than you suppose.

319
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:10,090
That was a very fine speech of yours
but I know as well as everybody else here

320
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:12,096
that you're really
only getting at me.

321
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,038
But, honestly, I wasn't doing
anything of the kind.

322
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:16,138
I envy you. I admire you.

323
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:19,644
Oh, yes, you envy me, all right.
But you don't admire me.

324
00:27:19,668 --> 00:27:26,435
Heh! Well, I... I don't admire myself so much.
I know that money-making isn't everything.

325
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:31,315
But let me tell you something.
I'm a young man, see?

326
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:34,743
Married to a Manchester girl,
pretty as paint,

327
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:40,126
the only thing in the world I care about.
Well... she dies.

328
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,796
It's this way. My directors give a party.
They ask us. Red letter day for us, I can tell you.

329
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,844
Heh! I buy my first dress suit.
And Lucy had a new frock. A cotton frock.

330
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:59,575
It seems that Lucy didn't go too well
at that party. Especially with the women.

331
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,081
They snubbed her.
Nothing definite, you know.

332
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:06,336
Just didn't think the cotton frock
was good enough.

333
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,589
Well, Lucy worries about it.
Gets into her head that she's gonna hold me back.

334
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:17,333
Well, you may not believe it,
but I know that's what killed her.

335
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:19,510
That's what started me making money.

336
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:23,597
I swore I'd smash those fellows and their wives
who wouldn't give my Lucy a kind word.

337
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:27,022
Ha! And I have smashed 'em.
At least, most of 'em.

338
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:32,459
Once you've started making money,
it's hard to stop.

339
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:35,965
Especially if you're like me,
there isn't much else you're good at.

340
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:42,978
Ha! But what Gladys here
has to be superior about, I don't know.

341
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:46,638
Miss DuCane.
Why don't you tell 'em your real name?

342
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:50,548
My real name... is Perkins.

343
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:53,038
And a very nice name, too.

344
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,288
I may not be this
and I may not be that

345
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,057
but you don't catch me
pretending to be what I'm not.

346
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,694
I think I'm finding you
a little bit offensive.

347
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:03,915
That's all right, Mister Penderel.
I can take care of myself.

348
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:07,279
Least, if I can't by now,
I never will be able to.

349
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,758
I wasn't trying to put
anything across you, Bill.

350
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:14,010
I don't pretend to be what I'm not either.
I'm not as dumb as that.

351
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:17,171
These people here know a chorus girl
when they see one.

352
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:20,925
And, incidentally,
not a very good chorus girl at that.

353
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:25,102
If I were better at my job,
I probably wouldn't be weekending with you.

354
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:32,186
No. I take that back. I probably would.
You're nice enough. We get on, but...

355
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,798
Morgan's at the bottle again.
I knew he'd begin tonight.

356
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,721
Where did he get it from?

357
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:46,893
He didn't get it from me.
Can't you stop him?

358
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,472
He's in the kitchen now, drunk.
Quite drunk.

359
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:57,685
Who's Morgan? Is he the fellow
who waited on us at table?

360
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,865
Yes. Morgan is the...
the butler.

361
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,355
Looks to me as if he could do with a shave.
Ha ha!

362
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,562
Oh, hello.

363
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,246
Hello.

364
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,581
Well? Have you come over to help me
gaze upon the wrath of God?

365
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:18,479
No. I came to say thank you for trying
to take my part just now.

366
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:21,461
Charmed, I'm sure, Miss DuCane.

367
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:24,000
Perkins to you.

368
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:25,319
Thanks, Perkins.

369
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:28,360
I say, I'd mortgage
the old homestead for a drink.

370
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:30,440
Hmm... so would I.

371
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:33,664
And we'll have one!
I've got some whiskey in the car.

372
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,003
I'd forgotten all about it.
You stay here and I'll go and get it.

373
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:36,779
No, I'll come with you.

374
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,780
Wheeee!

375
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,465
You'd better stay here under cover.

376
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:54,356
The car's in the stables
and you'll get soaked.

377
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,215
All right. But don't be long.

378
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,125
Mister Penderel?

379
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,375
Hello. What are you doing here?
I was just coming.

380
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,745
I thought I'd come
and fetch you.

381
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,235
Hey, hey. What's the matter?
What's happened?

382
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:54,925
Nothing. Nothing, really.
I'm a bit scared, that's all.

383
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,375
Somebody slammed
the door in my face.

384
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,249
- Probably the wind.
- No, it wasn't.

385
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:05,368
I know wind when I see it.
It doesn't sound much, but,

386
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:07,224
you know, it gave
me a bit of a turn.

387
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:10,653
Yes, I bet it did.
Here, what you want is a drink of this.

388
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:12,255
Thanks.

389
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,225
I feel a bit more human now.

390
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,615
This certainly is a benighted household.

391
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,065
You're right. It is.

392
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:26,455
Look at those.

393
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:31,835
Come on, take 'em off.

394
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,095
I seem to've spent most of the evening
changing your shoes.

395
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,939
You ought to be a nursery maid.

396
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:47,223
Yes, except that the best nursery maids
don't drink whiskey out of the bottle.

397
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:55,425
The storm's just as bad as ever,
isn't it?

398
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,565
Worse.

399
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:01,745
That's done it. The light's gone out.

400
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,175
I suppose they'll stay out this time.
Now, we shall be miserable all the evening.

401
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:10,055
That's all right. Surely, there's
some candles somewhere, aren't there?

402
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:14,005
Can I do anything about the lights,
Miss Femm?

403
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,135
No. Nobody understands
our lights except Morgan.

404
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,845
And, as an electrician,
Morgan is temporary disqualified.

405
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,015
You haven't got a lamp by any chance,
have you?

406
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:25,715
No. No. We haven't got a lamp.

407
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:28,895
- What did they say?
- Nothing. Nothing important.

408
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,895
Oh? Not important? Ha!
It happens I heard that time.

409
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,191
They want a lamp. Give them the large one.
There's oil in it.

410
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:40,575
We used it the last time the lights went
wrong. Go on, Horace. You know the one.

411
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,263
I don't remember where it is.
Suppose you get it, Rebecca?

412
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:48,312
It's too big for me. If you don't know
where it is, I'll tell you.

413
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,835
Now, you know as well as I do.
It's on the top landing on the little table.

414
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,905
You know where the top landing is, Horace?

415
00:33:57,106 --> 00:34:01,205
At least you might believe there is a top landing.
Oh, but you do believe in so little.

416
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,345
It's up there, Horace.
Up there. Next to the roof.

417
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,015
Yes, of course. I remember.
But I think it's a little too heavy for me.

418
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,065
I don't think I could carry it down
all those stairs.

419
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,016
Why don't you say
what you mean, Horace? Ha!

420
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,145
You mean that you're afraid
to go up there alone.

421
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,695
You go with him. Here take this.
I don't know why I bother myself.

422
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,995
Do you all good to sit in the dark.

423
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:36,455
- We'd better go up, hadn't we?
- Yes. I suppose we had.

424
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,545
We won't be long.

425
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:41,165
That's all right. Mrs. Waverton will see
that I don't get nervy.

426
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,575
You'd better lead the way.

427
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,875
This is my room.

428
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,875
Oh?

429
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,295
There are one or two things
that I should very much like for you to see.

430
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,848
I should like to very much.
But you must show me some other time.

431
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:27,595
We've got to get that lamp.

432
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,243
Yes.

433
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,339
Listen, why should we bother
about the lamp?

434
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:40,313
Let us wait here for a few minutes
and then go back

435
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:43,801
and say that we couldn't find it.
Or that it's broken.

436
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,448
I can't see the point.

437
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:48,987
Yes, but why should we trouble
about the lamp if we don't want to?

438
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:51,130
But we said we'd get it,
so why shouldn't we get it?

439
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,248
Yes, but why should we if we don't want to?
And I don't want to.

440
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:55,607
But this is absurd...

441
00:35:58,214 --> 00:35:59,550
Did you hear that?

442
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,076
I did hear something.

443
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,415
What was it?

444
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,492
It must have been Morgan.
He's drunk, you know.

445
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:10,535
He's probably making a disturbance
downstairs in the kitchen.

446
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,678
I thought that noise came from upstairs.
Anyway, what about this lamp?

447
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:18,990
I wonder whether you would excuse me
from coming with you?

448
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:23,262
I'm not very strong.
There are rather a lot of stairs.

449
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:28,364
I really should have told you before
but the, the vanity of age, you know...

450
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:34,827
You'll find it on the little table
at the end of the landing, two floors above.

451
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,176
I suppose it's not too heavy
for me to carry.

452
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,165
Oh, no, not at all.
It's quite light really.

453
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,275
I see.

454
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,505
Thank you, thank you very much.

455
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,011
You opened it, didn't you?
Well, now you can go and shut it.

456
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,525
Go on, shut it. I can't.

457
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,671
Go and shut what?

458
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,960
The rain's pouring in.
The flood's rising.

459
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:19,042
We all'll be drenched
if you don't come quickly.

460
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:22,016
She means the window in her room.
I'm afraid I opened it.

461
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,217
Go on. You opened it.
You can shut it.

462
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:27,603
That's all right, Miss Femm.
I'll come and shut it.

463
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,745
Mister Penderel! Miss DuCane!

464
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:31,495
Mister Penderel! Miss DuCane!

465
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:27,865
It's Morgan. He's there at the bottom
of the stairs.

466
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,185
Take the candle.
Get back there.

467
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:39,995
Get back!
Go on, get back!

468
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,435
- Is he dead?
- No, you can see him breathing from here.

469
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,668
He's only stunned.

470
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:25,915
He'll be conscious in a minute but he'll probably
fall asleep again. He's very drunk.

471
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,721
Oh, Philip, this is an awful house.

472
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:29,580
It isn't very nice, is it?

473
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:37,969
Listen, Margaret, something happened
upstairs just now.

474
00:41:37,993 --> 00:41:39,968
Oh, Philip. Not something else horrible.

475
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:44,119
No, this was nothing horrible.
It was a voice calling from behind a door.

476
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:48,692
A tiny voice, rather like a child's.
I think I ought to go and see what it is.

477
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:52,241
You'll have to come with me.
I'm not going to leave you alone again.

478
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:57,485
He'll be all right.
Take my hand, darling.

479
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:07,612
- Oh, Philip.
- What is it?

480
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:10,573
Sit down here a minute, darling.

481
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:19,455
Thanks.

482
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,489
- Well, what happened then?
- Well, then the war ended.

483
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:25,545
- What about the girl?
- Oh, the girl I left behind me?

484
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:28,778
- The girl you were in love with.
- Why, she got married, Gladys.

485
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:29,955
What a beast.

486
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,876
No, on the contrary, a lady
of rather good judgment.

487
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,796
Now, let's talk about
you for a bit.

488
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,699
I know what you're going to say.
You're going to ask me about Bill Porterhouse.

489
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,661
Clever, Miss Perkins.

490
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:44,654
I don't mind telling you.
I'd rather like to.

491
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:48,924
Bill's all right, really.
Of course, I don't love him.

492
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:52,547
Of course, he gives me money.
Oh, not very much.

493
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,379
Just enough to keep me going.

494
00:42:56,284 --> 00:43:00,221
You probably won't believe me,
but Bill doesn't...

495
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,357
he doesn't expect anything.

496
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:04,971
Do you know
what I mean by anything?

497
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:07,185
Yes. I know what you mean by anything.

498
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,643
He likes people to think he's ever so gay.

499
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,709
You see, for all his money,
he's a bit lonely.

500
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes, I spotted that when he told us
the story of the cotton dress.

501
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:19,181
I think he's in love with
that little dead wife still.

502
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:25,430
I'm sure he is. I suppose that's why
he only wants me, well, for company.

503
00:43:25,454 --> 00:43:27,218
He likes to sit on my bed at night

504
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:30,013
and boast to me about the things
he's done during the day.

505
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:31,860
Well, that's harmless enough.

506
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:34,599
Mind you, I'm not pretending to be
any better than I am.

507
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:37,918
You're a nice creature, aren't you?

508
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:41,600
I like you, awfully.

509
00:43:43,258 --> 00:43:44,863
And I you.

510
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:47,778
What are you thinking of?

511
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:50,701
- You may not be very pleased.
- Risk it.

512
00:43:53,193 --> 00:43:56,800
I was thinking that I would like to pretend
that I was your lover

513
00:43:56,825 --> 00:43:59,948
and that you were mine,
Gladys, body and soul.

514
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:09,762
I'd like to take you in my arms and hold you
and press you to me very gently, very tight.

515
00:44:09,787 --> 00:44:11,119
I'd like it, too.

516
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:16,719
Would you, Gladys Perkins?
Why, then, let's pretend.

517
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:31,142
Listen. Gladys Perkins has an idea.
I think she must have gone mad.

518
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:35,916
She... she...
She wants to live with you.

519
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,643
Oh, I'm just flinging myself
at your head.

520
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:45,647
I've got a crazy idea that I might help you
to be a useful person.

521
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:47,778
Darling, Perkins...

522
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,204
Do you think I'm mad?

523
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:55,276
Quite mad, my darling.
And thank God for it.

524
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,275
Well, what do you say?

525
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,234
That's what I say, Perkins darling.

526
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:15,060
But I've got a better idea than yours.
An improvement on it.

527
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:16,477
What is it?

528
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:21,897
Why, it's just this... No, I won't tell you here.
There's magic here.

529
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:27,157
I'll tell you later on in the house,
perhaps even in the cold light of morning.

530
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,883
Tell me now.

531
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:33,063
- Come on, let's go back to the house.
- No! No, let's stay here.

532
00:45:34,057 --> 00:45:36,079
- You're cold.

533
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,377
No. It's just the idea of going back
to that house that made me shiver.

534
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:44,805
I've got a funny feeling something dreadful
might happen to us if we go back to that house.

535
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,839
Perkins, Perkins.
You've my strong right arm, haven't you?

536
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:52,860
All right. Come on.

537
00:45:56,015 --> 00:46:00,093
No, you can't put on those wet shoes.
I'm going to try to carry you.

538
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:01,713
I'm a devil of a weight.

539
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:05,715
Well, if you're too heavy for me,
I shall drop you in the mud and go on alone.

540
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:51,422
Hello. Where have you been?

541
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:54,905
I went out to the car to get a drink.

542
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:56,134
And I went with him.

543
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:06,955
She got her feet wet.

544
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,075
- Oh, she got her feet wet?
- Yes, she got her feet wet.

545
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:13,179
Well, what the devil's been happening here?

546
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:16,486
I don't know what the devil's
been happening here or anywhere else.

547
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,312
I don't know what's been happening
anywhere.

548
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:22,075
I went into the old girl's room to close
a window and came back and found this.

549
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:23,144
Where are all the others?

550
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:24,510
I don't know any more than you.

551
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:28,080
Mister Waverton went upstairs
with Horace Femm to fetch a lamp.

552
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:31,449
I suppose his wife joined him.
I've been asleep.

553
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:35,842
So, you got your feet wet?

554
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:38,631
Yes, Bill. And that wasn't all, either.

555
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,681
Yes, I didn't suppose it was.

556
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:46,537
I don't quite know how you'll take this but...
well, I've got to get it off my chest.

557
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:47,853
Come on, let's have it.

558
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:50,226
I've fallen in love, Bill.

559
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,008
Oh, you have, have you?
With him?

560
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:57,006
- Yes, with him.
- Darned fool.

561
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:59,485
Probably. But we don't choose these things.

562
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,685
- Has he got any money?
- Not a penny.

563
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,145
But you're going out with him?

564
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,975
Yes, Bill. Are you angry?

565
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,895
I think you're a lunatic.
But I'm not angry.

566
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,732
He took it pretty well, didn't he, Perkins?

567
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:16,119
- I told you. Bill's all right.
- He is indeed.

568
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:18,733
Wonder where the others can be?

569
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,880
Listen, Bill. She hasn't told
you everything.

570
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,408
Hasn't she? Why not?

571
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:31,001
Because she doesn't know
everything herself.

572
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,817
- We're going to be married.
- Oh, are you?

573
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:39,591
At least, if she'll have me.
I'm going to ask her tomorrow.

574
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,575
In the cold light of morning.

575
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:46,775
- Will you come to the wedding?
- I think you're off your head.

576
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,635
Do you?

577
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,275
No. I don't.

578
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:56,865
I think it's probably the best day's work
you've ever done in your life.

579
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,655
Ah, Bill, Bill...

580
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,535
Who told you that you could call me Bill?

581
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,365
Ha, ha. Well, you try and stop me.

582
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,585
Now, look here, come and make yourself
useful and put this table on its feet.

583
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:10,625
Huh! That's no way to treat roast beef.

584
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,005
Miss Perkins, tin the roast beef.

585
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,045
Tin it yourself.

586
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:22,224
Sure you feel better?

587
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:23,595
Yes, I'm all right.

588
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,995
Well, let's go on.

589
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:38,885
This is the door.

590
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:10,315
Who are you?

591
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:15,815
I'm Mrs. Waverton. This is my husband.
Are you Sir Roderick Femm?

592
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:20,945
We came in because we thought
we heard you calling.

593
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,815
Can we get you anything?

594
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,005
Can you take it yourself
or shall I give it to you?

595
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,805
I can take it myself, thank you.

596
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,831
Now, what was that noise?

597
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:58,364
- Was it... Morgan?
- Yes.

598
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:05,905
Morgan is a savage.
I, er, I must apologize.

599
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:12,035
But we have to keep him here.
You shouldn't have come here.

600
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,745
I'm very sorry but, really,
we couldn't help it.

601
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:21,465
Oh, I... I don't mean that.
I was never inhospitable. Never.

602
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,555
This house was always filled with guests,
once upon a time.

603
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:33,225
When you came, what did they tell you?

604
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,185
Why, they told us you were an invalid.

605
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,876
- Was that all?
- Yes.

606
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,325
You've seen my son, Horace?
And his sister, Rebecca?

607
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,035
Yes.

608
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:55,459
And Morgan. I would like to tell you all
about it but... but there may not be time.

609
00:51:55,484 --> 00:52:02,051
You see, when you're as old as I am,
at any minute, you may just die.

610
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:07,265
Oh, please don't talk if it tires you.

611
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:16,021
This is an unlucky house. Two of my
children died when they were twenty.

612
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:22,397
And then... other things happened.
Madness came.

613
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:31,946
We are all touched with it a little, you see.
Except me. At least, I-I don't think I am.

614
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:37,288
Would you like to go to sleep now?

615
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:46,215
No. Not just yet. You see, it may be...

616
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,465
It may be what?

617
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:50,965
Dangerous.

618
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,025
You mean Morgan?

619
00:52:53,461 --> 00:53:02,502
No. Not Morgan.
I mean from my eldest son, Saul.

620
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,175
Saul?

621
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,589
They didn't tell you about Saul?

622
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:08,835
No, they didn't.

623
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:14,035
Saul is the worst, you know.
We have to watch him.

624
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:24,975
Because you see, he wants... he just
wants... to destroy, to kill. Poor Saul.

625
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,335
Where is he?

626
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,965
I know where he is. He's upstairs
behind that bolted door, isn't he?

627
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,816
Yes. Locked in.
Saul is why we have to keep Morgan.

628
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,315
But if he did get out?

629
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:44,475
Saul quite certainly would
set fire to the house.

630
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,475
He tried to once before.

631
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:54,995
He wanted, he said,
to make this house a burnt offering.

632
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,825
But isn't he safely locked in?

633
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:07,767
Yes. But you see, if Morgan is bad, I, er,
I think he might, er, open the door.

634
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,265
Philip. What if he's come to?

635
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,185
Wait here. I'll go down and look at him.

636
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:38,237
He's gone upstairs. I heard him.
He's gone to let Saul out.

637
00:54:38,262 --> 00:54:40,585
Wait for him downstairs and kill him.

638
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,965
What are we to do?
Can't we stay in here?

639
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,965
No, supposing he set fire to the place?
Come on.

640
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,345
But what about Sir Roderick?

641
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,735
We must lock the door.

642
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,745
Sir Roderick, I'm going to lock you in.

643
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:03,295
He's asleep.

644
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:17,831
What is it?

645
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:21,390
Listen, there's a madman upstairs.
Morgan's let him out and he's dangerous.

646
00:55:21,414 --> 00:55:23,643
- We've got to do something.
- Good gosh. Where are they?

647
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,524
Upstairs.
But they may come down any minute.

648
00:55:25,548 --> 00:55:26,107
That's all right, my dear.

649
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:28,709
I knew I felt something dreadful
was going to happen.

650
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,685
- Hadn't we better get out of the way?
- No, we can't do that.

651
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,385
He might set fire to the place.
He's tried it once before.

652
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,595
Well, let him. Let the rotten old
place burn. I wish it would.

653
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,685
That's all right but what
about the Femms?

654
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:41,665
What is it?

655
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,145
Your brother's out of his room.

656
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,332
What? Saul?

657
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:47,315
Look.

658
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:00,455
Here. Get back.

659
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:05,795
Take him back, Morgan! You hear me?
Take him back!

660
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:44,751
Take him in the kitchen!

661
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,451
Take him inside!

662
00:57:10,321 --> 00:57:12,480
Lock him in the kitchen!

663
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:53,815
The sins of the fathers.
The sins of the fathers.

664
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:58,155
Come on, you!
Come into my room!

665
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,985
No! I'm going to stay here.

666
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,445
Then, stay here!

667
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:15,865
There's going to be trouble.

668
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:19,655
Oh! Penderel!

669
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:21,014
Come on. Come in here.

670
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,180
No! I don't want to be shut up.
I'd rather stay.

671
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:27,079
Gladys, for heaven's sake,
come in here. Margaret.

672
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,813
No. Oh, all right.

673
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,355
Wait a minute.

674
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:34,669
Here, light this.

675
00:58:56,778 --> 00:59:00,675
Oh, I love him so.
I just love him.

676
00:59:21,866 --> 00:59:24,445
Please.
Please don't touch me.

677
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,325
Well! What is it?

678
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,375
Listen, don't put me back.
Don't let them put me back.

679
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,415
I'm not mad.
I swear before heaven I'm not mad.

680
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:37,264
It's just that they've locked me up here.
They're all wicked.

681
00:59:37,288 --> 00:59:38,977
Why should they lock you up?

682
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:42,037
They're frightened of me.
I know something about them.

683
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:47,962
Years ago, they killed their sister Rachel.
But I wouldn't tell! I promised I'd never tell.

684
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:52,014
And they've kept you here
all that time for that?

685
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:57,369
And Morgan... I tell you, he's the devil...
Morgan beats me.

686
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:00,050
Don't leave me!
Stay with me!

687
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:05,029
That's all right. You sit here and wait.
I'll be back.

688
01:00:16,718 --> 01:00:19,995
The door's locked!
Miss Femm must have locked it.

689
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:22,241
- It's locked, is it?
- Yes, it is.

690
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:26,282
I'm glad.
Then, you can't leave me.

691
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:29,275
Listen, we've got to help
the others with Morgan.

692
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:30,992
Isn't there some way
of getting through?

693
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:32,648
No. No way...

694
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:35,447
But there must be
a back entrance into the house.

695
01:00:38,773 --> 01:00:40,005
Stop!

696
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:45,235
I want to tell you a story.

697
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:56,705
- Who's in there?
- Nobody.

698
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,715
Friends of yours?

699
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,635
I tell you, nobody.

700
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,255
Shall we invite them out?

701
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,334
You... you were going to tell me something.

702
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:06,124
Yes. So I was.

703
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,928
Don't you...
won't you tell me that story?

704
01:01:19,952 --> 01:01:22,557
Yes. Shall we sit down?

705
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:25,625
Yes. Let's.

706
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,625
Who is in that cupboard?

707
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,375
Nobody. Tell me what
you were going to say to me.

708
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:52,725
Are you interested in flame?

709
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,924
Why... why, yes. Yes, I am, rather.

710
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:59,099
I've made a study of flame.

711
01:01:59,123 --> 01:02:02,332
Have you? That happens
to be very interesting.

712
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:06,801
I know things about flames
that nobody else in the world knows.

713
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,995
Won't you tell me?
I'd like very much to know.

714
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,535
Why should I tell you? You wouldn't
tell me who is in that cupboard.

715
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:22,085
Well, I did tell you. Besides, you know,
it isn't fair to make me curious

716
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,585
and then just not say anything.

717
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,535
You'd like me to tell you
all about fire, would you?

718
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,195
Yes, I wish you would.

719
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:33,635
Well, first of all, I learned
that flames are really knives.

720
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:41,565
They're cold, my friend.
Sharp and cold as snow. They burn like ice.

721
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:50,386
Oh. That certainly is very...
very interesting.

722
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,595
So, they're really like knives, are they?
Well, do go on.

723
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,504
Tell me what else you found out.

724
01:02:56,528 --> 01:03:01,616
Oh, a lot of things.
My friend, sit down.

725
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:08,835
So, you thought
you could cheat me, did you?

726
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,902
You thought you could leave me sitting here
and I wouldn't notice.

727
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:18,451
But, you see, I am a clever man also.
That is why we understand one another.

728
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:24,025
That is why you understood so quickly
that I wanted to kill you.

729
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:31,525
We understand each other so well,
don't we, my friend?

730
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,658
Yes. Yes, indeed we do. From the start,
somehow I... I liked you

731
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,382
and I... I thought you liked me.

732
01:03:38,406 --> 01:03:45,730
Like you? My friend, I love you.
Did you know my name is Saul?

733
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:49,639
Saul, my friend.
And Saul loved David.

734
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,425
Yes, indeed he did.

735
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,655
But Saul was afraid of David because the Lord
was with him and was departed from Saul.

736
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:00,948
And it came to pass on the morrow
that the evil spirit came upon Saul

737
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:06,322
and he prophesied in the midst of the house.
And David played upon the harp with his hand.

738
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,950
And there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

739
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:12,765
And Saul cast the javelin.

740
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:21,095
And he said, I will smite David
even to the wall with it.

741
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:30,213
And David appointed out of his presence
twice. Twice, my friend.

742
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:37,025
And the third time... the third time...
you must be careful.

743
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:42,029
Listen. I'm your friend. I'm on your side.
It's silly to lose me. If you lose me...

744
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:44,615
Look! There's Morgan!
He's come for you! Morgan!

745
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,315
Stop! Don't move!

746
01:06:39,073 --> 01:06:41,175
Philip! Philip!

747
01:06:54,203 --> 01:06:56,945
Oh, let go! Can't you see?
There's Penderel!

748
01:06:58,478 --> 01:07:04,825
Let me go to him. Go on, let me go by.
Go on, let me pass.

749
01:07:08,497 --> 01:07:15,335
Ooh, you swine. But I'm not afraid of you.
I'm going to him. Do you hear?

750
01:07:15,813 --> 01:07:17,535
Oh, how could you?

751
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:26,199
Listen, you've got to let me alone, do you hear?
I've got to go to Penderel. He's hurt.

752
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:29,460
Oh, how can I make you understand?
He's hurt.

753
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:33,066
I've got to look after him
and the other man, too, Saul.

754
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,790
They're both hurt.

755
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:33,505
- Are you all right, Margaret?
- Yes, I'm all right, darling.

756
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,055
Gladys.

757
01:08:36,581 --> 01:08:41,568
It's all right. Come on now.
You feeling better?

758
01:08:41,592 --> 01:08:43,824
Yes, I'm not so bad.

759
01:08:43,848 --> 01:08:46,829
- What happened to you?
- That was Morgan. He hit her.

760
01:08:46,853 --> 01:08:47,768
Come on.

761
01:08:49,465 --> 01:08:54,225
I'm all right now. Where's Penderel?
I've got to look after him.

762
01:08:55,682 --> 01:08:57,495
You'd better not go over there.

763
01:08:58,696 --> 01:08:59,796
Come with me.

764
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:17,617
- He's alive!
- What?

765
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:20,496
He's alive, I tell you!
He's alive!

766
01:09:46,389 --> 01:09:47,755
Good Morning.

767
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,825
Good Morning.

768
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:54,285
Good morning, Mr. Waverton.

769
01:09:57,415 --> 01:09:58,285
Good Morning.

770
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:04,795
The floods have subsided considerably.

771
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,845
Thank heaven for that.

772
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:13,935
I think it will be possible for you
to send for an ambulance now.

773
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,265
You mean we can go?

774
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,935
Yes, I'm sure we can go now.
Come along, darling.

775
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:21,016
You're going to stay here with Gladys,
aren't you?

776
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,206
I am. Don't be long.

777
01:10:23,662 --> 01:10:25,662
We won't.
We'll be as quick as we can.

778
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:45,675
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

779
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,545
Goodbye.
So happy to have met you.

780
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:10,638
So, I'm really dead
and gone to Heaven?

781
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:13,500
No, it's morning and
we've only just left hell behind.

782
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:14,668
Morning?

783
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:21,105
Yes. Cold light of day. Wasn't there something
you were going to tell me in the cold light of day?

784
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:23,025
Come to think of it, there was.

785
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:27,665
Perkins. Will you marry me?

786
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:43,280

1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,571
Uh, Nick Di Santo.

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,063
I'm here to see my mom.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,191
Visiting.

4
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,113
Take the stairs to the second
floor, and someone

5
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,953
will meet you there.

6
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,322
Second?

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,296
Can't we go out on the grounds?

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,004
I mean, she wants to be private,
can't it be out in

9
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,842
the sunshine or under
a tree somewhere?

10
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,303
Telling you, she never goes out.

11
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,513
In all the years I've been here,
I've never even seen

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,132
here in the visitors' room.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
Look, she's my mom.

14
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,471
I...

15
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,969
I haven't talked to
her in years.

16
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,310
Yeah, she did get made up
today just to see you.

17
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:17,442
Look, you get her to go out,
I'll be happy to take you.

18
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,069
Ms. Di Santo?

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,403
Your boy's here.

20
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,284
What have you got her on?

21
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,161
She hasn't been medicated today.

22
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,292
Bang on the door when
you're done.

23
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,516
Hey.

24
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,400
You can look at me.

25
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,065
I'm not sure I can.

26
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,076
Yes you can.

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,613
Mm.

28
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,407
Look at me.

29
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,422
Oh my.

30
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:31,394
You look like him.

31
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,695
Why would you say that?

32
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,156
You said you didn't
remember him.

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,618
You said it was like trying
to remember a dream.

34
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,954
You said you didn't
know who he was.

35
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,129
Do you know who my father is?

36
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,548
What else do you know, Mom?

37
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,726
Mother!

38
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,936
Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:14,735
Mom...

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,361
No, no, no...

41
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,112
I won't.

42
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:16,696
Don't, don't.

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,238
I won't.

44
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,738
Stop...

45
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,447
Mom...

46
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,448
look, I'm not...

47
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,074
I'm not gonna touch you, OK?

48
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:20,700
I won't.

49
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,781
Then don't.

50
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,990
Do you... do you want me
to get the orderly?

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,111
You want your medication
or something?

52
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm supposed to tell you
about your father.

53
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,127
And today is the day that
I promised I would.

54
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:48,471
Wait, you prom... you
promised who?

55
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,601
The things in the wall.

56
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:03,317
They listen all the time, and
then they tell me what to do.

57
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,328
And Nicky, today is the day
that they told me I had to

58
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,495
tell you about him.

59
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,332
I'm...

60
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,119
I'm not...

61
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,252
I won't.

62
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,253
I'm warning you.

63
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,254
Oh, Nicky.

64
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,006
Hey!

65
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,087
He's coming for you.

66
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,217
Hey!

67
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,218
Please...

68
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,219
Open the fucking door!

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,460
Your father...

70
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,213
I only remember a nightmare!

71
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,219
So what did she want to say?

72
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,636
She wanted to let me know
that she's still crazy.

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,357
So no birthday present, huh?

74
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,531
Let's go find one.

75
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,655
Let's go drink one.

76
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,679
Go, go, go.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,715
Yeah, come on.

78
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,216
That's the guy, right
over there.

79
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,271
Can I buy you guys a beer?

80
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,857
Why?

81
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,904
Is that Nick Di Santo?

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,564
What if it is?

83
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,027
You know him?

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,400
What if I do?

85
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,742
Can he do it?

86
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
You know what?

87
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,244
I don't care.

88
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,618
That is not what I said and
that is not what you said.

89
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,002
Hey, uh, hit me again.

90
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:21,839
You know what?

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,673
I'm through.

92
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,465
Yeah.

93
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,216
No, I'm done.

94
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,377
I'm hanging up.

95
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,554
You got a number for a cab?

96
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,981
Anything I can do?

97
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,365
Bet I got you beat.

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,158
For worst day ever.

99
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,338
There's no way you could
beat this one.

100
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,048
What, did your dog
die or something?

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,109
Happy birthday!

102
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,478
Happy birthday!

103
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,366
Yeah, 23's kind of a big one.

104
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,910
You don't know?

105
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,793
Um, it takes 23 seconds for
blood to circulate throughout

106
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,127
the human body.

107
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,372
In every person are 23
pairs of chromosomes.

108
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,880
And every 23rd wave that comes
to shore is twice as long and

109
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,098
twice as strong as the one
that came before it.

110
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,470
So 23 is kind of like this,
um, magic number.

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,859
I like 23.

112
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,980
How about
you do it, just one time?

113
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,370
I...

114
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,486
I just...

115
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,497
I want to know if you
can really do it.

116
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,036
Hey, what'd I say?

117
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:22,876
Do what?

118
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,287
What are you doing?

119
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,379
Nick.

120
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,587
Don't...

121
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,632
no.

122
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,964
Relax.

123
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,253
Are you trying
to scare away the first

124
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,751
girl that doesn't think
you're Frankenstein?

125
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,094
Well, if she's the one,
she won't run.

126
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,181
Do not do this.

127
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,547
Please.

128
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,390
If you were sober, you
wouldn't do this.

129
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,426
Hey, uh, Ronny says he'll do it.

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,560
Just go up there.

131
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,308
Go put your hand on him.

132
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,319
Touch him.

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
What?

134
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,234
No, look, it doesn't
work that way.

135
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:54,116
I have to touch them.

136
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,357
That's rule one.

137
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,075
You can touch me all you want,
but it's not gonna work.

138
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,911
And rule two?

139
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:06,627
It has to be something bad,
something really bad, or I do

140
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,286
not see you.

141
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,788
There's no way to change it.

142
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,091
There's no information on
why or when or how...

143
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,219
I just see it.

144
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,304
Could somebody just tell me what

145
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,047
everybody's talking about?

146
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,300
Sometimes he can touch somebody
and he can see how

147
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,846
they're going to die.

148
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,305
Seriously?

149
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,653
Hold up your hand.

150
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,529
Nick, please.

151
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,530
Please, just sit down.

152
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,018
Aaaahhhh!

153
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,019
Gotcha.

154
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,706
Whoa!

155
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,288
Whoa, man!

156
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,459
What just happened?

157
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
Come on, man, look at me.

158
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,294
Nicky!

159
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,295
Are you kidding me?

160
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,130
Just get out of here!

161
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,797
No, no, no.

162
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,798
What was that?

163
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,924
Did you see... did you
see something?

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,165
You just couldn't
leave it alone.

165
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:35,926
No!

166
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,802
I want to know!

167
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,803
Did you see something?

168
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,762
Dude, come on.

169
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,763
Did you fucking...

170
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,558
No, I want to know.

171
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,517
What happened?

172
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,143
Shut the fuck up, Nicky.

173
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:44,768
Ryo!

174
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,884
Shut up, Nicky.

175
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:46,812
I don't want to get my
ass kicked tonight.

176
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,973
Ryo, look, man.

177
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,888
What?

178
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,644
I'm holding the lady's hand.

179
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,112
And what?

180
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,245
And everything's OK.

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,759
You didn't tell him?

182
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,679
I...

183
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,800
I can't understand you.

184
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,387
What did you do?

185
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,647
I did everything.

186
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,557
You were supposed to

187
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,685
tell him about me.

188
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,312
I did everything you asked...

189
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,076
Excuse me?

190
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,285
What?

191
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,331
I was just saying I should
pick up girls

192
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,332
at a bar more often.

193
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,333
Uh, news flash...

194
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,290
I picked you up.

195
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,378
Oh, no, no.

196
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,379
I do not think so.

197
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,213
No, I know so.

198
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,341
Really?

199
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,500
"I'm holding the lady's hand"?

200
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,046
That was your pick-up line?

201
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,345
Do you really see things when
you touch some people?

202
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,396
Bad things?

203
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,151
You're gonna hear some
stuff about me.

204
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,487
You're gonna hear that I moved
from foster home to foster

205
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,078
home since I was nine.

206
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,747
And you're gonna hear that it
was because my mom committed

207
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,291
herself when I was eight.

208
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,472
That's a long scar.

209
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,018
How'd you get it?

210
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:44,567
When I was seven, I, um, I
thought if I, uh, hurt my

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,986
hands, they wouldn't hurt me.

212
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,915
Nicky!

213
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,916
What the fuck, man?

214
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,373
Check out the "24 Hour News."

215
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,787
Several area firefighters have

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,206
joined the right, and
more are expected.

217
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,503
Again, we have no confirmation
on what started the blaze, but

218
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,798
speculation aside, as this
dramatic footage shows, most

219
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,091
of the facilities residents
caught sleeping on the second

220
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,261
and third floors had little
chance of escape.

221
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,010
Though the number is still
rising, the body count is

222
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,809
already at 74, and the
firefighters expect to battle

223
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,432
the blaze through the night,
with fire departments from as

224
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,153
far west as Pomo and Wheaton
County expected to arrive on

225
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,896
the scene at any moment.

226
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,400
The building has a long and
colorful history and was one

227
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,401
of the oldest...

228
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,904
No, I...

229
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,244
I...

230
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,829
yes, of course.

231
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,417
Yes, I understand.

232
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,503
You can count on me.

233
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,874
You've always been able
to count on me.

234
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,217
Right.

235
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,594
Nick?

236
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,092
Come on in.

237
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,685
Just finishing up a phone call.

238
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
I'm Judge Bing.

239
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,221
Have a seat.

240
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,491
Is it necessary to go
over the details of

241
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,827
your mother's death?

242
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,956
Uh, no.

243
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,122
No, I know how my mother
died, Mr. Bing.

244
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,077
Respect Look, it's been
eight months.

245
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,454
I didn't even know
she had a will.

246
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,334
And are you aware that there
is a lawsuit pending against

247
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,711
the institution?

248
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,213
I have no interest
in suing anyone.

249
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,513
Well, I thought you might be
particularly keen on that now.

250
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,512
Given recent unplanned
developments?

251
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,023
Life is full of surprises, Nick.

252
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,236
This is the
reading of the will, right?

253
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,323
And there's no one else here?

254
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,990
In accordance with your
mother's wishes, you alone are

255
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,990
to be here when I give you this.

256
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,048
I'm sorry to say this
is all she left.

257
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,880
I mean, well, what is all this?

258
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,268
Per her instructions, I have
no knowledge of the content.

259
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,185
So if there's any way I can help
once you've been through

260
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:17,321
it all, anything you need,
don't hesitate to call.

261
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,056
He has it.

262
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:47,476
And unless I miss my guess,
he's already found it.

263
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,029
How'd it go?

264
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,873
Stay there.

265
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,580
I'm coming to you.

266
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,710
That file's from her attorney.

267
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,828
It's, uh, papers and
old pictures.

268
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,999
And?

269
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,372
What?

270
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:18,972
Come on, just sit down.

271
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:19,889
I want to show you something.

272
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,178
Are you rich?

273
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,053
Here.

274
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,930
You see it?

275
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,556
See what?

276
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,693
The house.

277
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,108
Does that look familiar?

278
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,477
Should it?

279
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,651
Look, OK, guys, this house is
not some ordinary house.

280
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,198
This house and me go way back.

281
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,739
It's in all of my sketchbooks,
in every story I wrote as a

282
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,577
kid, and in just about every
class where they ever let me

283
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,158
draw something.

284
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,335
Look, I've been drawing
this house since I

285
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,080
could pick up a crayon.

286
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,456
Look at this.

287
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,628
Same house.

288
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,212
You see this circular
window at the top?

289
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,462
Yeah.

290
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,964
I mean, look at this.

291
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,142
Same house.

292
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,425
Age 12.

293
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,643
I mean, come on.

294
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,144
Look at all of these.

295
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,479
So you liked
to draw the same house when

296
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,528
you were a kid.

297
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,446
Come on.

298
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,197
Come here, come here.

299
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:17,781
I need... get up.

300
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,448
Come here.

301
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,407
Come on, get up.

302
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,241
I just want to sit down.

303
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,159
Get up, come on.

304
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,320
I gotta show you something, Eve.

305
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,453
You're gonna freak
out about this.

306
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,656
Ryo, come here, look at this.

307
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,949
This house has been in
my head all my life.

308
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,082
OK, so you used to draw it.

309
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,580
Why are you acting all psycho?

310
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,209
Look, Ryo, I'm still drawing it.

311
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,042
Look, this house, maybe the
reason I started to think

312
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,885
about architecture in
the first place.

313
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,263
So you have
a tiny boner for old houses

314
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,472
with little round windows.

315
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,015
What the hell difference
does that make?

316
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,931
Ryo, up until about an hour
ago, I didn't know this house

317
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,600
existed in the real world.

318
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,687
So what?

319
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,900
You think this has something
to do with your dad?

320
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,987
Nicky, even if it does

321
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,944
exist, what about it?

322
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,484
I own it.

323
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,872
Yeah.

324
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,964
The directions
in the will had the

325
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,209
house in town on this road.

326
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,468
There's no sign a town
was ever here.

327
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,471
This baby is sailing, man.

328
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,719
You did a lot of work on it.

329
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,312
How are we supposed
to find a house

330
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,642
without a street address?

331
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,104
Hey, babe, how you feeling?

332
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,690
Can we please just find a place
that has a bathroom?

333
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,158
I can't find a town or
even a bowling alley

334
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,493
called River's End.

335
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,404
Oh my god, that

336
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,447
dog has three legs.

337
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,406
So?

338
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,487
So don't order any meat.

339
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,573
That's quite a set of wheels.

340
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,577
Thank you.

341
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,578
It was my granddad's.

342
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,819
Bathroom?

343
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,866
Down the hall, past the
cigarette machine.

344
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,712
Hey.

345
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,421
River's End, this...

346
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,467
this is it.

347
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,628
Ryo, look.

348
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,088
Holy shit.

349
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,836
Look!

350
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,428
Look at this!

351
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,932
This house, we're
looking for it.

352
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,807
Are you all those folks that
came through this morning?

353
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,525
That van had a state
logo on it, Knoxie.

354
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,064
This place?

355
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,028
I own it.

356
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,069
You own Wormwood?

357
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,442
Wormwood?

358
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,490
That's the name of the house?

359
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,156
Yeah, after the flood
washed it away.

360
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,129
You know, food for the worms?

361
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,295
You've never heard of
the Blackwater flood?

362
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,042
20-something years ago?

363
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,544
It was the end, all right.

364
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,218
There is no River's End.

365
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,678
Washed away, all of it.

366
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,101
Town doesn't exist anymore...

367
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,561
same as your house.

368
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,847
Unless you like old
wives' tales.

369
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,225
Well, yeah, I might like them.

370
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,852
Don't shovel that shit
to these kids, Lucky.

371
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,607
There's one story that says
that house is still standing.

372
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,206
Story says the flood hit
that house hard, but it

373
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,491
didn't take it down.

374
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,163
Couldn't take it down.

375
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,459
Just washed it from
here all the way

376
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,882
down to here somewhere.

377
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,177
If you believe stories
for idiots and morons.

378
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,843
You got some kind of deed?

379
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,432
'Cause you're about
23 years too late.

380
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,270
What?

381
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,205
Nicky.

382
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,296
That house isn't the only way to
find out about your father

383
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,299
or anyone else.

384
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,540
Hey.

385
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,130
That's weird.

386
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,221
Yeah, like
"Texas Chainsaw" weird.

387
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:54,891
Aughhh!

388
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:55,892
Look out!

389
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,396
Hey.

390
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,230
You all right?

391
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:01,731
Hey.

392
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,847
Yeah.

393
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,235
You guys all right?

394
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,726
You came out of nowhere, man.

395
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,898
Sorry.

396
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,441
You OK?

397
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,154
You OK?

398
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,039
That was close.

399
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,623
Is everybody all right?

400
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,624
Yeah.

401
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,081
I am so sorry.

402
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,043
We haven't seen any other
cars out here all day.

403
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:24,796
I'm Chris.

404
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,797
I'm Sam.

405
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,291
That's Lillith.

406
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello.

407
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:31,844
That your van?

408
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,928
Yeah, PLS.

409
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,297
Public Land and Survey?

410
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,136
We're out here mapping the
valley for the state.

411
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,925
Yeah, what are you
doing out here?

412
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,678
Well, we were looking for a
house, till we found out that

413
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,351
it got washed down a ridge.

414
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,768
Wormwood?

415
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,975
House that washed into the
valley during the flood?

416
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,233
Yeah.

417
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,821
You guys think you know
something about that?

418
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,111
Yeah, if you believe
in urban myths.

419
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,950
This is Wormwood, huh?

420
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,673
Sam?

421
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,714
Yeah, boss?

422
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,053
What she said.

423
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,046
We should just keep one
foot in reality here.

424
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,841
Any house, even if it survived
being ripped off its

425
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,393
foundation, would break into
kindling, crashing through

426
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,853
trees.

427
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,222
Well, look, if there's any part
of it around here, like

428
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,065
a... a floorboard or a roof
shingle... anything...

429
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,316
I'd like to see it.

430
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,983
Um, I'm telling you,
it's an urban myth.

431
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,743
Get in your car.

432
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,200
Follow me.

433
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,907
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

434
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,246
Aagghh!

435
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,374
Mmph!

436
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,295
Nicky, Nicky.

437
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,376
Is he OK?

438
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:49,255
Yes, he's OK.

439
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,462
He's OK.

440
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,632
He just... he gets dizzy spells
when he thinks too fast.

441
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,294
Nick?

442
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,792
Look at me.

443
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,179
How about you get back in the
car and sit down, OK?

444
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,139
What do you mean?

445
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,977
It's a long shot, but we mapped
something a few days

446
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,939
ago that I think you
need to see.

447
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,462
This is the old highway where
the flood took it out.

448
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,010
See this path through
the forest?

449
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,973
Something big definitely
came through here.

450
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,968
Yeah, it's called a flood.

451
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,063
No.

452
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,429
Look at the sway of these trees.

453
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,681
It's way above the flood line.

454
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,524
Come on, Chris, there's ravines
like this throughout

455
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,611
the county.

456
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,818
Thanks, Sam.

457
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,858
But on this team, I'm the
arboriculturalist.

458
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,355
God, not that word again.

459
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,982
He likes to say that 'cause
he thinks it sounds dirty.

460
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,740
No, wait, so you're
a tree guy, right?

461
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,741
Nicky, Nicky.

462
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,281
Baby, come back up
here with me, OK?

463
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,916
Yeah, come on,
Nick, why don't you, huh?

464
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,962
Baby, now.

465
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,629
Please?

466
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,040
What?

467
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,472
At least one house
came through here.

468
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,522
It's, uh, it's a long shot.

469
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,396
But we could all go for
a quick little hike.

470
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,652
He said it was a long
shot, Nicky.

471
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,280
A shot's still a shot, Evie.

472
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,827
Come on.

473
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,702
You gonna be OK here if I...
if I take a quick look?

474
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,544
I'm not hiking, if that's
what you mean.

475
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,715
It's only gonna be
a few minutes.

476
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,876
Ryo, can you stay here with her?

477
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:57,592
Please?

478
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,878
All right?

479
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,421
Come on, Sam,
I know you want to come.

480
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,919
Yeah, I'm only going to see
your face when all you find is

481
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,091
poison ivy and a couple
of humping beavers.

482
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,012
Lil?

483
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,136
Ooh, thanks, but uh, I think
I'll stay with Eve.

484
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,512
That's a great idea.

485
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,269
I'm leaving
in the van if you guys

486
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,236
aren't back here in 10 minutes.

487
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,105
And I'm taking Eve with me.

488
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,242
Eve.

489
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,574
I love you.

490
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,115
See how the slip plane
moves across?

491
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,617
This isn't just from the water.

492
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,914
It is...

493
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,208
So I just follow where
the trees are clear?

494
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,581
Yeah, exactly.

495
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,971
Nick!

496
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,303
Nicky, slow down!

497
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,516
Nicky!

498
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,273
Nicky!

499
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,480
Come on!

500
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,605
We're gonna get lost out here.

501
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,232
You gonna be OK?

502
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,984
We gotta get back.

503
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,542
Little window.

504
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,874
Right, Nicky?

505
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,046
Little round window at the top?

506
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,919
What the hell are we looking at?

507
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,846
This is wrong.

508
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,983
Come on, this is wrong.

509
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,974
It should have been pulverized.

510
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,521
This can't be the same house.

511
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,064
Oh, yeah?

512
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,437
Then what is it?

513
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,054
That's not even from this house.

514
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,555
You gonna tell
me this whole place just

515
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,637
crashed here, perfectly level?

516
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:58,846
Well, maybe someone leveled it.

517
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,519
I think a lot of big stuff must
have washed through here.

518
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:10,195
And when the house did, I think
that's the tree that

519
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,863
finally stopped it.

520
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,532
I just got this
really weird feeling, Ryan.

521
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,627
I drew this.

522
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,837
I dreamed this.

523
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,253
And now I'm standing in
front of it, like I'm

524
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,798
the reason it's here.

525
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,004
Like it's holding
on, just for me.

526
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,596
Stop right there.

527
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,941
Now turn around and walk away.

528
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,653
Look, don't get the wrong idea.

529
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,619
We're, uh, Public
Land and Survey.

530
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,879
I'm Sam.

531
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,424
I know who you are, Sammael.

532
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,177
Heh.

533
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,553
It... it's Sam.

534
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,288
You with the state, too?

535
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,125
No.

536
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,912
I'm with...

537
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,909
Look, if we ended up somewhere
we shouldn't be, we

538
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,786
apologize, Mister...?

539
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,048
My name's Seth.

540
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,759
That's all you need to know.

541
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,095
And let me tell you something
else, Sammael.

542
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,508
It's Sam.

543
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,926
I don't know what you think
you're doing here, or what

544
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,892
claim you think you have
to this house...

545
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,477
We're just mapping the valley.

546
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,597
But if this is about eminent
domain or any of that state

547
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,691
bullshit...

548
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,692
It's a geodesic survey.

549
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,818
We don't care about this house.

550
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,275
Make no mistake.

551
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:15,483
I've been swinging a hammer in
it since before you were born.

552
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,325
I've been working this
place forever.

553
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,706
And I'm here to stay.

554
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,788
We don't want any trouble.

555
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,129
Then you best be on your way.

556
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,417
I th...

557
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,006
I think you're probably right.

558
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,185
Wait.

559
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,426
The people that lived here.

560
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,308
Do you know anything about them?

561
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,898
No, Nicky.

562
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,560
The man who used to live
here 20 years ago.

563
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,106
What about him?

564
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,399
I just want to know his name.

565
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,661
No.

566
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,156
No you don't.

567
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,749
Look, this house is in
my mother's will.

568
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,371
These people might be my family.

569
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,797
I have the deed.

570
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,136
I don't care what you have.

571
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,130
What you came looking
for isn't here.

572
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,175
You do not know what
I came looking for.

573
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,494
Just you.

574
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,497
Not your buddy.

575
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,206
And no one from the state.

576
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:56,421
You want to see this house
you think is yours?

577
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,670
Come on.

578
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,671
What, do you think he's
a fucking realtor?

579
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,173
Look at him.

580
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,353
Nick!

581
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,436
Your old man's not in there!

582
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,952
I drew this
house when I was a kid.

583
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:39,384
God, it had all of this in it.

584
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,969
Every room, upstairs.

585
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,603
Downstairs.

586
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,557
What is that?

587
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,239
What's in the walls?

588
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,738
Rats?

589
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,543
That's abhorrent.

590
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,553
That's the
tree at the side of the house.

591
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,344
They lynched people
from that tree.

592
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,562
You ever see a hanging
tree, boy?

593
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,229
Who lives here?

594
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,444
Look around.

595
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,157
Nobody lives here.

596
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,242
Who used to live here?

597
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,372
What the hell is that?

598
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,046
What's that in the chimney?

599
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,587
The deed
you have to this house is

600
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,963
worthless, just like the house.

601
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,175
Look, I just want to know
if people from my

602
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,176
family lived here.

603
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,553
Nick!

604
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,195
Hey.

605
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,155
Time's up.

606
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,072
Let's go, buddy.

607
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,813
Let's get back to the car, OK?

608
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,157
Sam and Chris say
they have help '

609
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,318
How do you
like your house, Nick?

610
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,073
You seen enough?

611
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,960
Are you not understanding
something, Nick?

612
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:41,335
When the flood came and wiped
out this town, people blamed...

613
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,878
this house!

614
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,179
Did you know that?

615
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,892
Survivors called it the Second
Flood of Noah because they

616
00:37:53,021 --> 00:38:00,021
thought it came from God to wash
away this house and all

617
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,112
the horrors that came with it.

618
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,231
This place was ripped
from the earth and

619
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,071
slammed into that tree.

620
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,866
Instead of a pile of broken
sticks, it's all still here.

621
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,288
Chairs, tables, chandeliers...

622
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,123
they shouldn't be here, Nick.

623
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,833
I thought you said that was you.

624
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,625
You said you'd been swinging
a hammer in here for years.

625
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,874
I have.

626
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,673
I've been trying to
tear it down.

627
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,296
Nick, let's go!

628
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:52,657
You tell you
friend to run as fast and as

629
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,663
far away as he can.

630
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,202
Nicky?

631
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,126
And you run with him,
and never come back.

632
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,590
Nick!

633
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,379
There's some guys out here!

634
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:11,968
You come back here, it'll be
the last thing you'll ever

635
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,340
remember doing.

636
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,101
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

637
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,840
They're trying to cut us off!

638
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,466
Who the hell are these guys?

639
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,218
What the hell are these guys?

640
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,129
Go, go, go.

641
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,922
Ryan?

642
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,005
Yeah, I think...

643
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,373
Yeah.

644
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,514
Whoa!

645
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,051
What the fuck happened?

646
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:36,934
What?

647
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,935
What did he say to you?

648
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,894
He didn't say anything!

649
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,305
What did you say to him?

650
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,598
Get the fuck off of him.

651
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,722
Look, I do not know what's
going on, OK?

652
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,189
Did he say something
to you or not?

653
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,455
Uughh!

654
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,996
Aaah!

655
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,011
Nnnnghh!

656
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,380
Unngh!

657
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,385
Hahhh!

658
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,938
Aaaghh!

659
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,943
Auurrrghhh!

660
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,286
Aah!

661
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,880
Ooh!

662
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,721
There was a kick.

663
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,472
How far along are you?

664
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,092
Yeah, just far enough along to
wonder what the hell we're

665
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,392
doing out here.

666
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,516
Can I?

667
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,064
Sure.

668
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:12,904
Ooh!

669
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,190
Did you feel that?

670
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,986
You know, they say that they
can feel things in there.

671
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,493
Joy, fear...

672
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,290
whatever the mother's feeling.

673
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,001
God!

674
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,967
He's really worked up
about something.

675
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,721
Well, maybe he just doesn't
like strangers?

676
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,807
Evie!

677
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,809
What?

678
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,675
What are they saying?

679
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,302
Evie!

680
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,439
What?

681
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,315
Evie!

682
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,396
Get in the car!

683
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,525
Get in the car!

684
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,482
Get in the car!

685
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,565
What the fuck is going on?

686
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,063
Get in the van!

687
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,401
Get in the van!

688
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,198
Get in the car!

689
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,368
Get in the van!

690
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,501
Fuck the car!

691
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,828
Get in the van!

692
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,417
Get in the van!

693
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,546
Go, go, go, go.

694
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,338
Go!

695
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,844
Go!

696
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,845
Move this fucking thing!

697
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,409
Oh, fuck!

698
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,410
Who the fuck are they?

699
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,031
How'd they get in front of us?

700
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,204
Aauughhh!

701
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,512
Get him off!

702
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,885
Get him off!

703
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,021
Get him off!

704
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,102
Get him off, get him off!

705
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,472
I'm trying!

706
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,572
What the fuck?

707
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,462
Where's Sam?

708
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,112
Where is everybody?

709
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,539
Diner looks closed.

710
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,449
Lillith?

711
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,287
Lillith?

712
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,959
Hello?

713
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,136
Anyone back there?

714
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,605
Hello?

715
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,601
Anybody?

716
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,910
What are you looking at?

717
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,310
I'll make sure Nick gets
back to the house.

718
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,652
You have my word.

719
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,897
I'll bring your followers
together to fight.

720
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,986
Yes, Lucky.

721
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,234
Don't worry.

722
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,744
We'll get the 23.

723
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,072
You will rise.

724
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,119
We will all rise.

725
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,879
No, I just told you.

726
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,802
On a state highway off
an old flood road.

727
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,762
Look, we just passed
Worthington, OK?

728
00:46:53,763 --> 00:46:54,728
It's the county seat.

729
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,594
And where are you?

730
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,647
Hello?

731
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,979
God!

732
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,230
I cannot stay connected long
enough to talk to anybody.

733
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:01,026
Forget it.

734
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,107
I tried.

735
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,236
None of the phones have
been working today.

736
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,647
Nick, what happened in there?

737
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:05,488
What happened?

738
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,239
What was said?

739
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,355
Yeah, man.

740
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,776
I told you, he tried
to scare me, OK?

741
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,989
He must have been hiding
something.

742
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,485
Yes, my first guess is drugs.

743
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,781
I mean, look at the guy.

744
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,404
Look at his gang of inbreds.

745
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,826
They don't even fucking
walk upright.

746
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,241
Yeah, well, they know how
to throw a fucking axe.

747
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,038
He's running something illegal
out of that house.

748
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,543
Bet on it.

749
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:22,714
Or he's just some hillbilly
lunatic who thinks the state's

750
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,798
gonna take his house.

751
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,799
Oh my god!

752
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,292
Oh, shit!

753
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:32,891
Stop!

754
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,883
I'm standing on the brake!

755
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,575
Sorry about that.

756
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,792
Are you OK?

757
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,800
OK.

758
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,957
What the fuck did you do?

759
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,958
You drove us in a
fucking circle?

760
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,011
What are you talking about?

761
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,172
That can't be the house.

762
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,305
Then I hell is it?

763
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,259
We left the house
30 miles back in

764
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,677
the opposite direction.

765
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,726
You drove us in a circle and

766
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,727
you didn't know it?

767
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,728
How?

768
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,060
We all saw the signs.

769
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,391
We were heading south.

770
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:04,897
The house was north.

771
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,813
Nick?

772
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,230
Nicky?

773
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,905
I smell gasoline.

774
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:18,746
What?

775
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,079
I smell gasoline.

776
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,708
Oh, Jesus.

777
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,915
OK, OK.

778
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,043
Come on, come on.

779
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,284
Let me get you out of here.

780
00:49:25,285 --> 00:49:26,129
To where?

781
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:26,713
Where?

782
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,547
Anywhere.

783
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,423
Just away from this van.

784
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,300
I have to sit down.

785
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,261
Hey, wasn't that guy the guy
from the diner we almost hit

786
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:36,097
up there?

787
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,098
Up where?

788
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,339
What the hell are you
talking about?

789
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,966
I don't even see the ridge
that we came from.

790
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,554
No, look, he's got to be
getting help though, right?

791
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,177
Well, shouldn't one of us at
least try to get back to the

792
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,350
road to let them know
where to find us?

793
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,649
He kicked.

794
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,690
But... but that's good,
though, right?

795
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,233
Nick, feel.

796
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,958
There's
nobody in the surrounding

797
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,001
forest that I can see.

798
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,869
And, uh, the house is empty.

799
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,838
What?

800
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,045
You went inside?

801
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,081
I didn't think it could
be the same house.

802
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,134
And?

803
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,217
Same porch.

804
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:16,095
Same tree.

805
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,212
Same lion out front.

806
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,258
I swear, I did not drive us in
a circle, but unless that

807
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,227
house is following us, that
must be what I did.

808
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,397
I'm sorry.

809
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,888
This is fucking great, you guys.

810
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,732
Evie, Evie, it's gonna
be OK, all right?

811
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,226
I'm gonna fix this.

812
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,769
How?

813
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,067
It's gonna be cold and
dark soon, and I'm really

814
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,402
not feeling well.

815
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,066
We need to keep her warm, Nick.

816
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,945
We need shelter where she can
rest while we get help.

817
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,759
Nick?

818
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,134
You sure the house is empty?

819
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,238
If that's some
kind of drug lab, then

820
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,284
what are we doing?

821
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:19,993
It's nothing like that.

822
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,109
I told you, it's empty.

823
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,361
Then why was Seth there
with those axemen?

824
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,203
No one lives here, Evie, OK?

825
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,492
Trust me, no one.

826
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,536
Is anybody else thinking
what I'm thinking?

827
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,079
Forest, ravine, car?

828
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,873
So the car
could still be sitting there?

829
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,379
Unless those maniacs
chopped it up.

830
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,543
Well, should we try and see?

831
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,882
Come on, we'd never
make it by dark.

832
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,417
And Evie can't make it
anywhere right now.

833
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,135
Well, I would rather go into
the woods than stay inside

834
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,424
that place.

835
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:42,557
Oh, in the same woods where
they murdered Sam?

836
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,266
Sshh!

837
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,973
Please, shut up!

838
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,592
We don't need to broadcast
ourselves.

839
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,227
Nick, it's
like you're all ganging up

840
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,642
against me.

841
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,484
How am I the only one that
thinks this is a bad idea?

842
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,903
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

843
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,155
There is no way that I'm
staying in there.

844
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,249
Stop it.

845
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
Look at me, OK?

846
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,001
Listen.

847
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,117
We find one room.

848
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,286
We wait until the sun comes up.

849
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,297
That's it.

850
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,214
That's all we do, OK?

851
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,207
What if those men come back?

852
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,551
Hey.

853
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,135
Look at this.

854
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,471
You see that window?

855
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,139
That overlooks the entire yard.

856
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,854
OK?

857
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,061
Hey, come here.

858
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,306
Come here.

859
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,442
Come on, look at this window.

860
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,058
We can see the side
yard too, OK?

861
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,436
We'll... we'll put one man on
the back porch, one in the

862
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,654
front, and we'll see
anyone coming.

863
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,239
Not after dark, we won't.

864
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,574
Come on, Evie, OK?

865
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,488
We cannot drag you through
the woods tonight.

866
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,737
We have to keep you and the
baby warm and safe until...

867
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,283
Don't make this just about me.

868
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,576
I'm not.

869
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,908
This is best for everybody.

870
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,580
Is it?

871
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,498
There's not a part of this,
Nick, that's you

872
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:56,996
wanting to be here?

873
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,511
It's not a part of it?

874
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,925
What is it, exactly?

875
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,889
What is it that you think that's
here that's going to

876
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,258
solve any puzzles for you?

877
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,535
Evie.

878
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,007
Do you see those?

879
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,140
Do I see what?

880
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,773
Nnnnghhhh!

881
00:54:02,774 --> 00:54:03,740
Nicky!

882
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:04,449
What's happening!

883
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,565
Nnnnnghhhhh!

884
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,949
What's happening, Nicky?

885
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,945
Nicky!

886
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,167
No!

887
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,749
Get off me!

888
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:16,958
Help!

889
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,087
Nicky!

890
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,880
Get back!

891
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,337
Nnnggghhh!

892
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,880
Nicky!

893
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,629
Ah!

894
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,018
Nick!

895
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:32,643
Nicky!

896
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,352
Nicky, Nicky!

897
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,103
Nicky, wake up.

898
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:34,937
Nicky, please wake up.

899
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,397
Nick.

900
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,190
Nicky, look at me.

901
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:37,690
Nicky, wake up.

902
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,524
Nicky?

903
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,525
Ryan.

904
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,610
Ryan, wake him up, wake him up.

905
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,527
Nicky, look at me.

906
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,528
Nicky, wake up.

907
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,529
Baby, baby.

908
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,614
Wake up, Nicky.

909
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,821
Nicky, you gotta wake up.

910
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,029
Wake up, Nicky.

911
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,569
Baby, wake up.

912
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,959
So the good
news is he's still breathing

913
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,461
and he's got a regular pulse.

914
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,431
Then why isn't he waking up?

915
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,766
I don't know.

916
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,637
But look at his eyelids.

917
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,352
That's REM sleep.

918
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,940
He's dreaming.

919
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,104
Lillith says there's some stuff
that we should go back

920
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,814
and get in the van.

921
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,364
You watch him, OK?

922
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,952
Hey.

923
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,665
Since you decided not to have
the baby tonight, maybe you

924
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,450
could find some more candles.

925
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,131
How quiet can you be?

926
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,529
Mmm.

927
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,895
Mm!

928
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,617
No.

929
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,666
Get back to the house.

930
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,880
You'll know when to go in.

931
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,350
Hey.

932
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,889
It's so good to see you
with your eyes open.

933
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:39,784
How long was I out?

934
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,618
30 minutes?

935
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,484
Where's Ryo?

936
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,869
Uh, he and Lillith
went to the van.

937
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,245
What happened out there?

938
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,206
You were touching the tree.

939
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:00,761
That tree's a hanging
tree, Evie.

940
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:04,052
Just like Seth said.

941
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,968
One of the bodies is
from the Civil War.

942
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,353
How would I see someone
who's already died?

943
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:17,228
How would I see anyone?

944
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,397
I wasn't touching a person.

945
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,985
I was touching a tree.

946
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,291
Do you remember touching
the baby?

947
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,050
You said you never wanted to
touch him 'cause you never

948
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,418
wanted to know.

949
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,974
What did you see?

950
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,990
Is it something bad?

951
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,981
Is that what gave
you the seizure?

952
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,406
All I saw was our baby.

953
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,537
Yeah?

954
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,382
And he wants out.

955
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,556
Oh.

956
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,141
Took you long enough.

957
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,610
All right, Nicky.

958
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,397
Alive and kicking, huh?

959
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,958
This ain't.

960
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,297
I can surf, but I can't
make a phone call.

961
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,632
What happened?

962
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,387
Tell me.

963
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,475
Tell you what?

964
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,309
Why you smell like that.

965
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:10,851
Smell like what?

966
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,092
Like sex.

967
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,346
What are you, some kind of a
bloodhound all of a sudden?

968
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,643
Lillith?

969
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,273
You've got to
be kidding me, Ryo!

970
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,319
It was her, OK?

971
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,028
It wasn't me.

972
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,394
She was all over me.

973
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,066
We're out here worried about
getting our fucking heads

974
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,609
chopped off by these lunatics...

975
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,659
What are you?

976
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,660
Pissed off or jealous?

977
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,651
They could have snuck up on you!

978
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,660
Don't you ever grab me!

979
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,246
I grabbed your fucking jacket.

980
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,707
That's the only thing I have
ever asked you, in all of the

981
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,914
years that we've been friends.

982
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,881
What happened under that tree?

983
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,842
I don't know.

984
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,061
I know you saw something.

985
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,437
What did you see?

986
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,481
What did you see?

987
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,571
Hey, get in here.

988
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,155
Hurry up!

989
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,871
There's
something big in this wall.

990
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,000
I just think that tree lets
critters inside the framework.

991
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,011
I mean...

992
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,296
What the hell is that?

993
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,112
We need that flashlight.

994
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,481
OK.

995
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,325
Ready?

996
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,458
Aahh!

997
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,630
Ready?

998
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,966
Hey, you're not gonna kill it.

999
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,019
I can't see anything.

1000
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,184
Come on, you're torturing it.

1001
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,074
Nick, stop it.

1002
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,203
This is cruel.

1003
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,079
I... what?

1004
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,080
I just want to see what it is.

1005
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,446
Well, you don't know what it is.

1006
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,617
It could be... it could
be dangerous.

1007
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,429
Back up, back up, back up.

1008
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,310
What are you gonna do?

1009
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:02,481
Ryan!

1010
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:13,648
What the...

1011
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,237
the fuck?

1012
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,883
What did we do to it?

1013
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,127
We popped it like a zit.

1014
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,264
Jeez.

1015
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:39,515
There's nothing in
there but goop.

1016
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,885
Holy, holy shit.

1017
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,475
Guys, shouldn't someone be
outside watching the house?

1018
01:05:44,476 --> 01:05:45,357
Yeah.

1019
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,894
She's right.

1020
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:47,985
I'll take the back.

1021
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,396
I'll take the front.

1022
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,409
Nick, I don't want to be here.

1023
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,695
I'm serious.

1024
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,742
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

1025
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,623
Come on.

1026
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,958
We should stay where it's warm.

1027
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,790
We shouldn't stay here at all.

1028
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,518
Nicky.

1029
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,329
Peekaboo, I see you.

1030
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,707
I'm down here.

1031
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,500
My little Nicky.

1032
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,382
I remember when I used
to call you that.

1033
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,765
Mom?

1034
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,733
What are you doing in there?

1035
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,648
We're all trapped in here.

1036
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,488
Your father, Nicky.

1037
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,153
He's trapped in here, too.

1038
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,616
The door to the cellar...

1039
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,956
you need to open it.

1040
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,289
Are you really my mother?

1041
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,876
Look at me.

1042
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,753
I can't.

1043
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,596
I'm not beautiful anymore.

1044
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,636
Why?

1045
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,137
What do you mean?

1046
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,307
I mean, tell your
friend to stop swinging that

1047
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,849
goddamn bat!

1048
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,542
I think you're looking at a door

1049
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,411
that's never gonna open again.

1050
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,506
Not with those roots
jamming it shut.

1051
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,967
Wanna give this a try?

1052
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,469
Yeah, no telling what's
down there.

1053
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,675
I know.

1054
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,172
It's the only room
I've never drawn.

1055
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,469
Never could.

1056
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,976
On three.

1057
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,387
One, two, three.

1058
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,326
What are you guys doing?

1059
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,657
The things in the walls
are down there.

1060
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,668
What?

1061
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:37,798
I just want to see
what's down here.

1062
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,463
Close it, now.

1063
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,099
Guys!

1064
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,474
Guys!

1065
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,400
Now, goddamn it!

1066
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,533
Jesus Christ, calm down!

1067
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:05,283
Hey!

1068
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,319
Axemen!

1069
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,408
Axemen everywhere!

1070
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,819
They're everywhere.

1071
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,993
They're all over the place.

1072
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,064
It's crazy.

1073
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,903
They're all over out
there, just looking

1074
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,321
like they're asleep.

1075
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,867
They're all over the backyard,
like statues.

1076
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:35,957
Where the fuck do we go?

1077
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,958
Where do you think?

1078
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,076
We only have the cellar.

1079
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,930
Go, go, go, go!

1080
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,502
It's the door.

1081
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,337
The door triggers them.

1082
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:31,298
What the fuck do we do?

1083
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,421
For starters, we stay away
from that fucking door.

1084
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,014
Come on.

1085
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,061
Where the hell are we gonna go?

1086
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,599
Where the hell are we going?

1087
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,017
I guess we're going
back to the car.

1088
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,232
You mean, if you hope
it's still there.

1089
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,273
Do not let go of my hand.

1090
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:53,887
Run!

1091
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,152
They're gaining!

1092
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,122
Come on!

1093
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,293
Nicky!

1094
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,252
Evie, go!

1095
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,618
Nicky!

1096
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:28,463
Go now!

1097
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,130
Come on!

1098
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,166
Nicky!

1099
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,553
Hey!

1100
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,510
Over here, asshole!

1101
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:38,431
Hey!

1102
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,391
Right here!

1103
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,632
Hey.

1104
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,236
Oh my god!

1105
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,073
Get in, get in!

1106
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:23,053
Did you see Evie or Lillith?

1107
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,092
Oh, god, they had one of them
right on their tail.

1108
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,972
I tried to stop him, but he
wouldn't even look at me.

1109
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,564
I don't what happened to them.

1110
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,222
Oh, it's Sam.

1111
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,598
They just
left him there like that.

1112
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,197
What is that?

1113
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,033
Oh, what's wrong with his hands?

1114
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,038
What in the holy fuck is that?

1115
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:42,965
What is that?

1116
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:49,052
That's not skin, Ryo.

1117
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,346
That's not skin.

1118
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,268
What's that shiny stuff?

1119
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,640
Hold on.

1120
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,099
What the hell is that, Ryo?

1121
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,228
That's not Sam.

1122
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,271
It...

1123
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,313
it's Sam's clothes.

1124
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,641
That's the same tree where
Seth killed him.

1125
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:34,774
Then what the hell's
wrong with him?

1126
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,898
Sammael.

1127
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:43,022
That's what Seth called
him, remember?

1128
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,239
Yeah.

1129
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,700
And Sam, he kept correcting
him, like...

1130
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,319
like Seth knew his real name.

1131
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,076
Or he knew what he was.

1132
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:01,384
We gotta find the girls.

1133
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,260
No, but...

1134
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,296
What are you doing?

1135
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,886
I'm doing a search for
the word Sammael.

1136
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,015
Come on, we gotta
find the girls.

1137
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,715
Sammael.

1138
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,258
S-A-M-M-A-E-L. It's a
name from the Bible.

1139
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,760
It's a combination of the Hebrew
word "sam," for poison,

1140
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:15,263
and "ael," A-E-L, for angel.

1141
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,765
It's a poison angel.

1142
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:21,611
"Sammael is one of the original
angels of hell.

1143
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,732
He is the devil of death,
Satan's assassin.

1144
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:30,453
Sammael can come in many forms,
but traditionally a

1145
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:34,745
red-headed young man"

1146
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,538
Now we gotta find the girls.

1147
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,080
Come on.

1148
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,249
We gotta split up.

1149
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,416
We can find... we can
cover more ground.

1150
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,959
Lillith.

1151
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,303
There's a glossary of demons.

1152
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,634
The name Lillith is on here.

1153
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,388
"Lillith is the daughter
of the night.

1154
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:59,230
She is the queen of hell.

1155
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,067
Driven by insatiable hunger,
Lillith stalks the Earth,

1156
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:06,314
seducing men, often raping
them in their sleep and

1157
01:19:06,315 --> 01:19:07,283
drinking their

1158
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,569
blood." -Come on.

1159
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,112
Ryo, this has got to... this
has got to be bullshit.

1160
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:14,447
"By night she is the original
unholy terror, stealing...

1161
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:21,583
stealing newborns and even the
unborn from pregnant mothers

1162
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:28,966
and feasting on them."

1163
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,260
You OK back there?

1164
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,058
Mm-hm.

1165
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,688
Who has the keys?

1166
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,182
Ryan or Nick?

1167
01:19:41,183 --> 01:19:42,151
Whew!

1168
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,017
Whew, that was a big one.

1169
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,189
Are you OK?

1170
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,402
Ah!

1171
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,238
Wow, he's, uh... he's really
moving in there.

1172
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,487
Maybe he's just funny about me.

1173
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,738
Yeah.

1174
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,916
You get close, he starts
doing cartwheels.

1175
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,036
No, no, no, no, I didn't...

1176
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:05,255
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

1177
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,794
No.

1178
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,669
You're right.

1179
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,638
I think I upset him.

1180
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,552
Oh, come on.

1181
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,142
I don't know what
it is about me.

1182
01:20:17,143 --> 01:20:18,104
I just...

1183
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,972
I think I freak kids out.

1184
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,061
Even in the womb, apparently.

1185
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,730
They can feel stress, remember?

1186
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,353
He feels everything I feel.

1187
01:20:27,354 --> 01:20:28,323
That's all it is.

1188
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,324
He's...

1189
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,909
he's just freaking
out 'cause I am.

1190
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,652
Lillith, turn around.

1191
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,369
Hey, I mean it.

1192
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,262
Give me your hand.

1193
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,603
Come on, do it.

1194
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:18,363
See?

1195
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:21,115
He's not kicking.

1196
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,499
It's not you.

1197
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,920
Easy.

1198
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,091
Ow.

1199
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,221
Ow!

1200
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,217
Stop!

1201
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:40,593
Lillith!

1202
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,556
What are you doing?

1203
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,307
What the fuck are you doing?

1204
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,970
You all right?

1205
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,267
She's a demon called Lillith.

1206
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:33,483
She was sent to murder
your child.

1207
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,527
You can't wait for Nick.

1208
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,696
By now he's found
the house again.

1209
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:41,571
What are you talking about?

1210
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,868
Hey, I don't understand.

1211
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,909
Lillith, Christophe,
and Sammael.

1212
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,286
Three demons of hell.

1213
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:53,291
Their purpose was to destroy
the baby and make sure Nick

1214
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,801
found his way into the
cellar of that house.

1215
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,635
Destroy the baby?

1216
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,130
Lillith's the eater
of the young.

1217
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:05,011
The one you call Chris, he
creates illusions, like

1218
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,560
roadsides you see but aren't
there, or towns that look

1219
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,353
empty when they're not.

1220
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:15,276
Now I don't know where you
should go, but if you want

1221
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:19,867
your child to live, you leave
Nick behind and you make it

1222
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,485
far away from here.

1223
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,491
No, wait!

1224
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,828
I'm not leaving Nick behind.

1225
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,291
Why would Nick go back
to the house?

1226
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,751
He wouldn't leave me.

1227
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,418
The beast is forbidden to
enter the human world.

1228
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,462
Only his human son can invite
him, and only during

1229
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:39,382
the boy's 23rd year.

1230
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:45,226
Why do you think he can
touch someone and see

1231
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:48,642
their terrible deaths?

1232
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:54,485
Because Nick is the son
of terrible deaths.

1233
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:04,157
And he can never be
allowed to invite his father

1234
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,622
out of that cellar.

1235
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,165
You're wrong.

1236
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,586
You don't know Nick.

1237
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:19,714
You won't know him when he
finds out who he is, or who

1238
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:28,306
his father his, or that he was
conceived so that he could

1239
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:34,434
invite hell on Earth.

1240
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,621
She found her way to the car.

1241
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,383
Sun'll be up in an hour,
and even Ryan

1242
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,545
will find the highway.

1243
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,504
But you...

1244
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,223
come on, you gotta stop
running, Nick.

1245
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:12,229
'Cause you're always gonna
end up right back here.

1246
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:36,287
You don't have to be
afraid of him.

1247
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,463
What the hell are you?

1248
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:39,957
Come on, Nick.

1249
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,300
That's kind of a big question.

1250
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,462
The same as Sam?

1251
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,972
We come from the same place.

1252
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:52,978
We had a job to do, Nick, and
that was to see that you found

1253
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:57,812
your way to that cellar, just
like your mother did on the

1254
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,354
day you were conceived.

1255
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,777
Is it really here in there?

1256
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,071
Or is that just a dream?

1257
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:10,446
With what your house is sitting
on, you're gonna have

1258
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,532
a few lost souls in the walls.

1259
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,703
And the things with the
axes, who are they?

1260
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,957
The, uh, opposition.

1261
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,050
So they're the angels,
and you're...

1262
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:28,047
God's gargoyles, is
what we call them.

1263
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,266
Created to scare away
evil spirits.

1264
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:37,186
Seth brought them to frighten
you, to keep you away.

1265
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,557
Am I an evil spirit?

1266
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:49,402
You're an abandoned child
who for 23 years has been

1267
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:55,579
brutalized by the ignorant swine
of this world who are

1268
01:26:55,711 --> 01:27:00,421
afraid of anyone different.

1269
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:07,546
And there's a very special man
trapped under that house who

1270
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:13,176
understands what your
life has been.

1271
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,643
Talk to him.

1272
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,935
That's all he wants.

1273
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:23,731
That's all you want, isn't it?

1274
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,991
They can't hurt you.

1275
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:39,206
They would have killed you a
long time ago if they could.

1276
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,335
We'll take care of them.

1277
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:49,924
This fight has been a long
time coming, Nick.

1278
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,553
Go.

1279
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,222
Talk to your father.

1280
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:04,192
Do it!

1281
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:14,663
Aaaah!

1282
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:17,121
Nnngh!

1283
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,535
Aaaugghh!

1284
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,255
Hey.

1285
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:24,462
Hey!

1286
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,092
Hey!

1287
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,013
Aaaaghhhhhh!

1288
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,655
It's me, Evie.

1289
01:28:58,834 --> 01:28:59,834
Don't scream.

1290
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,457
Don't make any noise, OK?

1291
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:07,171
You been wandering
around all night?

1292
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,380
We have to go to the house.

1293
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,920
We have to find Nick.

1294
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,346
Nick's not at the house, Evie.

1295
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,512
He's there, Ryo.

1296
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:21,011
And he needs us.

1297
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,012
Why would Nick be at the house?

1298
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,190
Oh my god!

1299
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,576
We have to go back, Eve.

1300
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:44,997
Evie!

1301
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:50,791
Let's go back.

1302
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,209
We have to go in there.

1303
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,176
Nick's not gonna be here.

1304
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:00,425
They cut out their hearts.

1305
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,098
Come on, let's go!

1306
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:06,817
No!

1307
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:07,526
Hey, hey, hey!

1308
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,444
Come on!

1309
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,730
Who are we kidding, Eve?

1310
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,479
Do we even want to see Nick
if he's in there?

1311
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,106
Ryan, he might be hurt.

1312
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,724
It's OK.

1313
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,393
It's just us.

1314
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,398
Nicky, it's me and Evie.

1315
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,360
Look at us, Nicky.

1316
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,480
What did they do to you?

1317
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:57,358
What did they do to you, Nicky?

1318
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:58,494
You're hurt, man.

1319
01:30:58,495 --> 01:30:59,328
We gotta get...

1320
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,489
Don't touch me!

1321
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:01,622
Nicky, you are bleeding.

1322
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:02,828
You stay away from me.

1323
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,368
Let me breathe, OK?

1324
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,501
OK.

1325
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:11,671
What did they do to you?

1326
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:16,130
I asked if it was my
father, and he...

1327
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,135
he said yes.

1328
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:19,879
Don't, Nicky...

1329
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:26,269
And I said yes.

1330
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,639
And it came in.

1331
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,812
And Seth and all of those
things out there

1332
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,194
tried to stop him.

1333
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,358
They tried to stop me!

1334
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,284
Holy God.

1335
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,585
Nick.

1336
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:01,967
Our baby.

1337
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:09,183
I saw our baby.

1338
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:10,555
What did you see?

1339
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,938
I saw that we had 20.

1340
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,989
What did you see?

1341
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,237
Tell me.

1342
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:28,782
I'm trapped within until
I get three more.

1343
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,370
Oh my god, Evie.

1344
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:37,299
Oh my god.

1345
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,255
What?

1346
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,753
Walk away.

1347
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,131
Evie, don't run.

1348
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,427
Get away from...

1349
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:13,039
Two to go.

1350
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,236
There she is.

1351
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:48,904
You're full of painkillers,
honey.

1352
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,450
Don't try and move.

1353
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:57,620
You went into labor
and had your baby.

1354
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,213
You don't remember?

1355
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,966
Well, he's in good shape.

1356
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,373
Let's go see your mama.

1357
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,915
There's Mama.

1358
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,972
How did I get here?

1359
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,897
You don't remember the man
that brought you in?

1360
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,403
She's awake now.

1361
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,447
Yeah, you saw the picture?

1362
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,576
You like it?

1363
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:51,818
Yeah, that's part of the change.

1364
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,161
Yeah, we're doing good.

1365
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,575
A lot safer now.

1366
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,823
No, no, no, no.

1367
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,834
No, they're being guarded
at all times.

1368
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:02,375
They're never getting
out of there.

1369
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:03,708
They're never gonna
find the house.

1370
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,048
I destroyed the will
and the deed.

1371
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:13,386
Now
above the door, make a window.

1372
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,512
Draw that window round.

1373
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,274
Good boy.

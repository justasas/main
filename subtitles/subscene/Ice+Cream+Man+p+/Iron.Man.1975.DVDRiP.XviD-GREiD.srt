00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,694
Teacher

00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,585
Let's go have a look

3
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,269
We'll come some other day

4
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,036
You're welcome

5
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,801
Let's go

6
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:59,860
Please... inside please...

7
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:06,323
Sir, please come in

8
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:08,926
Please

00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,373
This way please

10
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,474
Please sit here. It is more comfortable

11
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:26,987
Can I get you something?

12
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:29,552
Bring me some Chinese food

13
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,289
Yes, Hsiao Wang, be quick

14
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,589
Yes

15
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,962
Hurry up there will you

16
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:37,725
Coming

17
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:51,576
Hsiao Hu, our restaurant's had
many new customers recently

18
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,540
Do you mean the Japanese?

19
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:58,513
Right, can't you see that your uncle
keeps smiling all days?

20
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,055
Will it be enough with five dishes
and a soup, sir?

21
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:04,050
That's okay, just make it more tasty

22
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:05,758
Alright...

23
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:07,016
Be quick

24
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,920
Yes...

25
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,436
Have some tea

26
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,972
How old are you?

27
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,872
Don't go, I want to talk with you

28
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:37,689
Let me go...

29
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:43,530
Sir, please show some respect

30
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,629
None of your business, I do what I like

31
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:57,003
You dare to beat me?

32
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,880
Sir, you are a gentleman

33
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:01,274
How come you bully a girl?

34
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:04,644
Mind your own business

35
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,284
or I'll kill you

36
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,920
Get out

37
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:10,190
What are you doing here?

38
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:13,022
Get out of here

39
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,385
You...

40
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:18,160
Hsiao Yu, go upstairs

41
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,690
Stop

42
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,337
Don't go too far

43
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,370
I am not an easy guy. Nakamura!

44
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:30,804
Beat him up

45
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,441
They're fighting outside

46
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,487
Stop it

47
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,794
Stop it, what's going on?

48
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:49,121
Damn it, get away

49
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,294
Dad

50
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,398
I'll see where you can go

51
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:55,200
Hsiao Yu, go upstairs

52
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,904
Out of my way

53
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,076
Sir, please stop. Can't we talk about it?

54
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,444
Alright...

55
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,851
She dares to hit me

56
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,126
Please excuse her. She is too young

57
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:24,653
Damn it

58
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,392
Dad...

59
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,026
Let's kill those Japanese

60
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,953
Damn it

61
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:53,415
Crawl

62
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:56,393
What? Crawl?

63
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,993
Crawl like a dog

64
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,064
Crawl

65
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:07,963
Hurry up

66
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,001
Be quick

67
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,144
I'll kick you until you crawl

68
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,677
Crawl

69
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,661
Right, crawl like a dog

70
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:36,235
Crawl...

71
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,778
Bark as a dog!

72
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,786
Bark? I don't know how

73
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:59,688
Shit, then I'll step on you

74
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,719
Hsiao Hu

75
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:05,631
Don't try to stir this matter up

76
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,926
Uncle, you better go inside

77
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,065
Don't get into this matter

78
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:11,238
Hey, you want to die?

79
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,838
Hsiao Hu... you...

80
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:15,673
I can't bear this

81
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,934
What? Damn it

82
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:28,749
Kill him

83
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:29,756
Yes

84
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:01,814
Hsiao Hu

85
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,781
Hsiao Hu, calm down

86
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,620
Listen to me, don't fight anymore

87
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,492
Go inside

88
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,326
Don't go

89
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,368
Hsiao Hu

90
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:20,697
Don't fight any more, get in

91
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:37,117
Hsiao Hu

92
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:42,360
Listen to me, don't fight anymore

93
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:43,928
Damn it

94
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:51,084
All of you Japanese get out of here now

95
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,588
Hold it

96
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,090
You, kneel down

97
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,969
Kneel... down?

98
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,136
Yes, kneel

99
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:10,905
And crawl out of here

100
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,973
Crawl?

101
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,819
All of you kneel down and crawl out

102
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,448
Crawl

103
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:24,884
Hurry up

104
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,297
You too, crawl out here

105
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,430
Me too?

106
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,968
Crawl out

107
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,773
Hold it

108
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,517
Bark while you're crawling

109
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:56,312
I don't know How to bark

110
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,820
Bark like a dog

111
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,926
Woof...

112
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:28,020
Listen, we're not so easily bullied

113
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:36,328
Your dare to come back with a failure?

114
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:39,027
You brought shame to all Japanese

115
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:44,704
You couldn't even defeat a kid

116
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,003
Look at your faces

117
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,577
Musashi club won't be bullied so easily

118
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:56,676
You're all stupid fools

119
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:59,912
Who is the one who beat you?

120
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,584
He's a cook

121
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:05,155
You're all stupid fools

122
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,727
How can you all be defeated by a cook?

123
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,264
Teacher, we'll never make you
ashamed of us again

124
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,662
We must deal with him

125
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:30,683
Please... Come in

126
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:36,082
Please... Sit down... please...

127
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,857
Please...

128
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:43,126
Please

129
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,935
Sir, please sit down

130
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:52,529
Are you Mr. Lee?

131
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,206
Yes I am, please sir, have a seat

132
00:14:57,444 --> 00:15:00,641
Who's that guy who came out

133
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:03,247
fighting yesterday?

134
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,509
Tell me

135
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,355
What's his name?

136
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:14,622
Lang Hsiao Hu

137
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,553
Lang Hsiao Hu?

138
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:19,626
Hsiao Hu...

139
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:21,562
Ask him to come out

140
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:25,666
He... has returned to his village

141
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,341
Don't fool me

142
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:31,976
He's really gone

143
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,675
For real

144
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,774
Go down there

145
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,344
Search around

146
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:40,918
Go

147
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,347
Get away

148
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,098
Where did he go, fatty?

149
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,328
I... I don't know

150
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:58,969
You don't know? Damn it

151
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:02,134
Sir, he's really not here

152
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:19,916
Tell me, did he really go back to
his village?

153
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,286
I wouldn't cheat you

154
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,196
Dad

155
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,164
Chief

156
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:35,774
We can't find him

157
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,082
I warn you...

158
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,546
If you want to run your business here

159
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,814
you better hand over Lang Hsiao Hu to me

160
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,922
or you'll be making a big mistake

161
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,388
Go

162
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,296
Be careful

163
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,068
Hurry up

164
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,779
Is it funny?

165
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,646
Yes...

166
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,252
Let's go and play

167
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,359
Hurry up

168
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,199
I want that one

169
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,335
Which one you want?

170
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:38,735
Alright

171
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,764
The swing

172
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:45,973
My father wants to close down
his business

173
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,178
Did you know that?

174
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:49,175
I've heard of it

175
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,918
I'm really sorry about that

176
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,447
it's my fault, I was causing all trouble

177
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,189
It's not all your fault

178
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,992
Since the Musashi club opened

179
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:04,230
those Japanese started to screw around here

180
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,792
They're too bad

181
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,360
You should be careful

182
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,605
Don't worry, I'm not afraid of them

183
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,773
Do you know that Chinese people
are not allowed to enter this park?

184
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,205
I know

185
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,913
The guards dare not interfere me

186
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,172
Why?

187
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,182
I've once fought with one of
the Japanese guards

188
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:31,157
You seem to like fighting very much

189
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:33,350
I only want to help the weak

190
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,719
What are you doing?

191
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:38,095
Get up

192
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:39,423
What do you want?

193
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,429
Get up, don't you hear me?

194
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,094
Hsiao Hu

195
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,095
Sister

196
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,199
Hsiao Hu

197
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,337
What's the matter?

198
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,598
That bastard pulled her down when
she was playing on the swing

199
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,369
What did you call me?
I'm gonna mess you up

200
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,137
Don't hit the child

201
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,407
You dare to stop me?

202
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,443
You're not a man

203
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,452
Okay, watch me bust you up

204
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:08,084
Tell you what. It would only hurt you

205
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:09,987
Who would dare to?

206
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,492
Me

207
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,501
Listen, I'm the chief of the Musashi club

208
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,499
You've got the guts?

209
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:25,706
Dad

210
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:29,907
Wen Lan, take the children home

211
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,543
Let's go in advance

212
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:48,565
Dad... Stop it... Dad

213
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:55,431
Look over there. The chief is
fighting with someone

214
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:59,939
It's Lang Hsiao Hu. Go...

215
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:20,061
Dad

216
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,007
Stop it...

217
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,016
Stop it...

218
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,154
You're not Japanese, who let you in here?

219
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:48,092
This is our land, why can't I come in?

220
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:51,295
We Chinese aren't easy to bully

221
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:52,156
Goodbye

222
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,858
Hold it

223
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:53,661
Chase him

224
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,496
Stop

225
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:55,262
Dad

226
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:56,265
Stand still

227
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,730
Chase him

228
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,411
Our club has existed for 73 years

229
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:10,342
There wasn't ever any trouble

230
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:13,079
But after the Japanese came here

231
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,652
A lot of trouble aroused

232
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:18,916
Teacher, the fight in Shanghai restaurant

233
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,524
that happened a few days ago

234
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:23,229
was also caused by the Japanese

235
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,959
So I've heard

236
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,168
But it's disgraceful to learn Kung Fu

237
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,634
for fighting

238
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:38,804
I think they will be back

239
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,376
We should be careful

240
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:45,979
Contemplate rather than take action

241
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,312
You have to calm yourself up

242
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:50,815
Don't try to stir the trouble up

243
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,284
Yes, teacher

244
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:12,470
Mr. Lee

245
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:15,637
Mr. Kuroki

246
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,819
I'm not here to cause trouble

247
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:24,917
Tell me if Lang has come back here

248
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,183
Mr. Kuroki, it's my fault that
there was a fight

249
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:31,591
please excuse me

250
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,559
I'm not here for you

251
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,830
I want Lang Hsiao Hu only

252
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,905
He's so young and don't know any better
please forgive him

253
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:48,136
Never

254
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:53,275
I'll pay the medical fee for your men

255
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,286
please don't start any trouble again

256
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:57,990
Shut up

257
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:04,324
I won't let him get away

258
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:05,828
Mr. Kuroki...

259
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:09,800
I warn you, if you are hiding him

260
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:15,539
you won't have your restaurant here anymore

261
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:23,509
Damn it

262
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:30,980
Hsiao Hu

263
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,816
Uncle, why did you ask mercy from them?

264
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:37,988
If you beg them, they will scare you even more

265
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:42,723
What would you know? You've caused us big trouble

266
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,969
Hsiao Hu, it seems they won't forgive you

267
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:48,968
What shall we do now?

268
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,471
I refuse to fear them

269
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:54,276
I'd rather bust them at once

270
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,516
and drive them back to Japan

271
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,297
Chief, look over there

272
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:26,772
Hsiao Hu, good bye

273
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,007
Good bye

274
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:29,846
I'm going to see Brother Liu

275
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,142
Fine, See you later

276
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:32,048
OK.

277
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:33,309
Let's go

278
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,851
It's the cook of that restaurant

279
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,625
The one who beat us up

280
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:46,594
Yes

281
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,559
Isn't teacher here?

282
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:48,968
He went to the village

283
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,568
How's the business lately?

284
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:56,798
Not so good

285
00:24:57,544 --> 00:24:59,876
Those Japanese come here often to cause trouble

286
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:02,809
Uncle wants to close the place down?

287
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,876
Didn't they come to look for you recently?

288
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,021
They've been here twice

289
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,485
You should be careful

290
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:14,187
Alright

291
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,423
Take care, I have to go now

292
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:20,794
Don't worry, I'll go by the side door

293
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:22,125
OK.

294
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,837
I'll come to see you tonight

295
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:36,041
What are you doing here?

296
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,286
Go

297
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:43,252
What are you doing?

298
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:49,018
Brother, the Japanese are here! Go quickly

299
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:50,389
Stop it

300
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:55,460
What do you want from me?

301
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:57,693
Where is Lang Hsiao Hu?

302
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,306
Ask him out at once

303
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,434
No one is called Lang Hsiao Hu here

304
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:07,212
Don't go too far

305
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,210
Shut up, get him out here now

306
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:14,119
He doesn't want to see you. Get out of here

307
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:18,389
Alright, you'll go out the same way he did

308
00:26:18,858 --> 00:26:21,019
I'll sort you out one by one

309
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,193
Charge

310
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:04,197
Hsiao Hu

311
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,371
Hsiao Hu, something bad is happening

312
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:10,301
Those Japanese came back

313
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:11,407
There came to fight?

314
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:15,477
Where are they at?

315
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:16,944
The Chung Hua club

316
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,263
Brother, look

317
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:33,688
Stop it

318
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:35,965
Are you looking for me?

319
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,535
Why didn't you come to the restaurant then?

320
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:45,275
You really know how to play tricks

321
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,072
First you're here, and then you're there

322
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:52,843
What is it that you want from me?

323
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,912
Nonsense, I'll fix you real good

324
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:02,725
You Japanese are all devils. Come on then

325
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:13,160
Brother

326
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:42,592
More of them are coming

327
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:43,989
Charge

328
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:48,434
Hold it

329
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:51,030
Brother Liu, don't fight with them

330
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,329
Let me bust up those Japanese dogs instead

331
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,636
Fine

332
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:55,767
Kill him

333
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:34,506
Charge

334
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,501
Go... Quickly...

335
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:34,036
Can you still shove off the duty

336
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:35,433
in your club?

337
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:38,871
It's quite serious

338
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:46,513
I wasn't there yesterday

339
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,578
Maybe this wouldn't be happened
if I am here

340
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:50,915
No matter how

341
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,283
you've to hand out the murderer

342
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:56,359
Where does the murderer Lang hide?

343
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,297
I don't know where he has gone

344
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,896
In fact he just want to

345
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:04,193
protect himself

346
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:06,598
Don't try to side with him

347
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:10,268
You should be responsible for this

348
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,740
as a chairman

349
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:20,284
Mr. Man, don't you think over

350
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,282
that we Japanese won't forgive

351
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,755
this matter easily

352
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:27,487
I feel very sorry for this

353
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:39,465
Let me tell you

354
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:42,201
An eye for an eye

355
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,012
They are all inside

356
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,755
You better have some food first

357
00:32:58,825 --> 00:32:59,951
I'm not hungry

358
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:01,523
You better eat some

359
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,626
I really can't take it

360
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,366
Up till now, it is no use of worrying

361
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:15,171
The most important is to
find a way out now

362
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,773
To escape, or go to surrender

363
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:19,100
I protected myself only

364
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,373
they can't say that I am a murderer

365
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:26,383
In fact, you're just protecting yourself

366
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,187
but they wouldn't be so reasonable

367
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,658
What did teacher say?

368
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:38,788
He was asked to the police station
this morning

369
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:41,432
He hasn't got back in afternoon

370
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:47,606
They're too harsh

371
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,406
I can't bear it no longer

372
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:56,279
Since the set up of Musashi Club

373
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,109
the Chung Hua Club opposite us

374
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:03,043
always try to defeat us

375
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:05,548
We're of the same society

376
00:34:05,825 --> 00:34:08,487
We can't let them going on

377
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:12,129
especially Susumu and Kojirou

378
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:15,664
were killed

379
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:18,067
We can't bear it any longer

380
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,199
We, Japanese Empire

381
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,007
can't be insulted

382
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:25,468
We've to think of some ways to
destroy the Chung Hua

383
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:29,169
We came to China as we
want to be the King

384
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,274
We should fight for our country

385
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:35,283
Teacher, shall we challenge to
Chung Hua Club?

386
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:38,014
They can't compare with us

387
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:41,591
Right, the best fighter among them

388
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:43,862
has escaped far away to the mountain

389
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:48,330
If I find him, I would like to have
a fight with him

390
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:55,802
You're...?

391
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,373
Ask your chairman to come out

392
00:34:58,778 --> 00:35:01,406
Tell him that I want to challenge him

393
00:35:02,048 --> 00:35:03,174
challenge?

394
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:07,750
You are not qualified

395
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:09,579
to fight with him

396
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,589
If you look down on me, I'll kill you

397
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:17,686
You dare not to do it

398
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,193
Teacher

399
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:25,568
Are you chairman Man?

400
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:28,133
Yes, what can I do for you?

401
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:33,242
I'm Kuroki Tetsuo

402
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:35,879
I want to learn from you

403
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:41,580
Teacher, it's not they really want to

404
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:43,981
They want to stir up troubles here

405
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,617
You kid, let me kill you

406
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:49,725
Chief

407
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:51,128
Let me try

408
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:54,185
Thanks for coming, brother Liu

409
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:58,126
Recently the police of local and Japanese

410
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:00,594
keep their eyes on Teacher

411
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,730
Teacher wants to come to see you too

412
00:37:04,737 --> 00:37:06,227
Don't worry

413
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:09,498
everything is going to be alright

414
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,209
It will be settled someday

415
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,605
I'm uncertain of my future

416
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:16,311
Then I better go somewhere far away

417
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:19,115
Hsiao Hu, you must be courageous

418
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:21,547
or turn yourself in

419
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,282
Don't be so hurry

420
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:26,049
What can we do now? Let our teacher
think about it

421
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:31,829
Hsiao Hu, take care, we've to go now

422
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:34,396
Fine, please ask about teacher

423
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:35,623
OK.

424
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:38,664
Goodbye

425
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:15,269
Where did you go to?

426
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:16,969
Why shall I tell you

427
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:20,675
I'm sure that you are going to see
the Murderer?

428
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:22,736
Brother, let's go

429
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,146
Stand still

430
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:29,583
You'll be killed for the revenge

431
00:38:58,417 --> 00:38:59,679
Pull up

432
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:10,054
You kid, where can you go now?

433
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:12,592
You are all the dirty bastard

434
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,129
If I get kill, my brothers

435
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,492
will take the revenge

436
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,965
Shut up, I'll let you die peacefully

437
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,442
Brother Liu, I must take revenge for you

438
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,053
Hsiao hu, you must be calm down

439
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:41,654
Your teacher suffered a lot as

440
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,391
he didn't want you to be imprisoned

441
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:48,663
the Japanese consulate keeps on
pressing us

442
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:53,397
There're rumors in the newspaper

443
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,139
Maybe they'll arrest him

444
00:39:57,076 --> 00:40:00,512
No, we won't let them do what they like

445
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,270
We've to oppose them

446
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:07,247
You shouldn't cause any trouble again

447
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:09,111
You better hide away for sometime

448
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:12,153
and don't go to stir trouble

449
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,352
Uncle, how long will you hide?

450
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,993
You...

451
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:22,632
I don't feel easy here

452
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,300
I can't even eat or sleep

453
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:26,899
In the night

454
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:31,040
it is only sounds of insects,
or keep on raining

455
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:35,080
I can bear any longer

456
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:39,414
You should overcome all hardships

457
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:42,553
It's not so hard to bear
for a young man

458
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,482
Of course I'm not afraid of

459
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,349
but I've to oppose to

460
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:48,855
their evil deeds

461
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:53,626
The ministry has a letter for Mr. Man

462
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:55,731
Say if he's offended again

463
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:57,526
the club must be closed

464
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,336
Hsiao Hu

465
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:06,409
I'll surrender after revenge

466
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:16,413
Cheers

467
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,652
No... I can't drink anymore

468
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:38,202
Don't try to run away

469
00:41:46,218 --> 00:41:48,812
Come on...

470
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:51,956
You can't get me

471
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:55,652
Let me go

472
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:59,186
Give me a kiss

473
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,733
No

474
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:05,770
You're disgusting

475
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:11,172
Come on... let me help you to take off
your clothes

476
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:12,933
No...

477
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,357
Don't look at me

478
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:31,786
OK, I won't see...

479
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:55,839
Who is there?

480
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,917
Who? Speak up

481
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,343
It's me

482
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:03,311
Who are you?

483
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:05,151
Lang Hsiao Hu

484
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,960
You want to be killed?

485
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:15,063
Are you Mr. Kuroki?

486
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:18,698
Yes, you want to die?

487
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:48,297
Why did you kill my brother Liu

488
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:52,228
Go away

489
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:21,794
Men, come here

490
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:52,459
You're coward, Kuroki

491
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,247
You kid, you...

492
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:06,947
You...

493
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,728
Teacher, you see that

494
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:28,605
Stop it

495
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:42,590
Are you the murderer in

496
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:44,853
Chung Hua Club?

497
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:48,430
No, I'm the cook in Shanghai restaurant

498
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:52,967
You dare to intrude here

499
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:57,599
and kill my chief

500
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,078
He deserved it

501
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:04,145
Let me wrap you up

502
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,341
Let me see how skillful you are, come on

503
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,814
Charge

504
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:10,315
Hold it

505
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:11,556
Let me try

506
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,216
OK.

507
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:18,291
Mr. Takahashi, come on

508
00:52:04,002 --> 00:52:07,369
Japanese are the puppies, isn't it?

509
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:09,635
You...

510
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:11,706
Right? Say it

511
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:20,043
Remember, Japanese are the puppies

512
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:47,474
I'll spare your life

513
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,745
Halt it, halt it...

514
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:51,209
Stop it

515
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:53,249
Don't fight any more

516
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:46,202
Teacher...

517
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:48,234
Teacher...

518
00:53:49,341 --> 00:54:01,446
Teacher...

519
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:19,093
Sir

520
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:27,008
Sir...

521
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:32,073
Sir, we must take revenge for you

522
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:34,983
Sir

523
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:39,857
Sir

524
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:43,854
Sir...

525
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:06,006
Things are getting more serious
you should know it

526
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:10,981
The police keep their eyes at upon them

527
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:14,981
They pressed on your teacher to
hand you up

528
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,087
he'd rather get into prison

529
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:19,830
If we keep on fighting with them

530
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:23,330
we'll be finished

531
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:26,102
I've made a decision

532
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:27,234
What?

533
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:29,569
I don't want teacher to be implicated

534
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:33,039
I'll surrender to them tomorrow morning

535
00:55:33,912 --> 00:55:34,970
What?

536
00:55:35,313 --> 00:55:36,712
Surrender?

537
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:38,843
Hsiao Hu

538
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:43,318
It was caused by me

539
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:46,417
I'll take it by myself

540
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:50,422
Look before you leap and

541
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:53,926
let teacher to decide it

542
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:07,034
Please sit down, please

543
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:10,279
Sit down please

544
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,245
This letter is for you from the ministry

545
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:34,470
You shouldn't be too lenient to him

546
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,264
the case is getting serious

547
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:40,609
you've never thought of the consequence

548
00:56:48,086 --> 00:56:50,714
It's impossible to move our club

549
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:53,185
and I can't restrain how

550
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:54,982
Lang Hsiao Hu acts

551
00:56:55,226 --> 00:56:57,592
Why you put the responsibility on me?

552
00:56:57,929 --> 00:57:01,729
Lang has been your student for ten years

553
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,691
You have great influence to his behavior

554
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:06,995
Although he was not at your club

555
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:09,900
he committed murder there

556
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:14,338
You can't say you've no responsibility
for that

557
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:17,305
Don't you know that the incident

558
00:57:17,982 --> 00:57:19,540
was caused by the Japanese

559
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:23,612
They used to make troubles in
my restaurant

560
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:26,847
You should try to stop them

561
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:32,385
As you're backing him up

562
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:34,461
Maybe you've ordered him to kill

563
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:37,132
the Japanese

564
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:42,899
You've to give full evidence

565
00:57:43,608 --> 00:57:46,441
Look clearly into the letter

566
00:57:46,644 --> 00:57:48,043
First

567
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:52,147
you better hang Lang to the police

568
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,409
Second, you better move the club away

569
00:57:55,787 --> 00:57:59,314
You must give me the answer
in these three days

570
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,361
It's here

571
00:58:28,586 --> 00:58:29,780
Someone's coming

572
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:31,947
Go away quickly

573
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,248
Be quick

574
00:58:53,578 --> 00:58:54,909
Where are they?

575
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:57,641
Wen Lan

576
00:58:58,383 --> 00:58:59,611
Hsiao Hu

577
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:01,442
I thought that you've gone

578
00:59:04,656 --> 00:59:06,590
Wen Lan, what have you brought

579
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:08,155
for him today?

580
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,088
I've brought a lot but none of your share

581
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:12,757
I can't take it

582
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:14,020
Brother

583
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:15,357
You guys take it

584
00:59:15,566 --> 00:59:17,329
Are you okay?

585
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:19,202
I am not hungry

586
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:23,769
You'd better go away now... be quick

587
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:25,266
I...

588
00:59:25,576 --> 00:59:28,568
Where can I go? I better fight with them

589
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,812
You...

590
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:31,548
Don't speak anymore, go quickly

591
00:59:31,883 --> 00:59:34,249
Halt it...

592
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,680
Halt it, don't move

593
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:41,324
Don't try to escape

594
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,563
Don't try to get away, murderer

595
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:53,270
Go to catch the murderer first

596
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:56,766
Be quick, Hsiao Hu

597
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:59,709
You're finished

598
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:05,238
It should be you hell

599
01:00:27,438 --> 01:00:29,338
Halt it...

600
01:00:31,009 --> 01:00:32,203
Hsiao Hu

601
01:00:32,477 --> 01:00:34,604
Halt it...

602
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:37,679
Hsiao Hu

603
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:39,075
Hsiao Hu

604
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,812
Hsiao Hu

605
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:44,846
Hsiao Hu

606
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:47,489
Hsiao Hu

607
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:51,360
Hsiao Hu

608
01:00:51,696 --> 01:00:53,061
Hsiao Hu

609
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:54,830
Hsiao Hu

610
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:58,500
Hsiao Hu

611
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:02,000
Hsiao Hu

612
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:05,939
Hsiao Hu

613
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:16,877
Hsiao Hu

614
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,648
Hsiao Hu

615
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,024
Where are you?

616
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:36,197
Hsiao Hu

617
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:39,737
Hsiao Hu

618
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,547
Hsiao Hu

619
01:01:58,129 --> 01:01:59,619
Where are you?

620
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:01,793
Wen Lan

621
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:07,168
Hsiao Hu

622
01:02:18,483 --> 01:02:19,950
Hsiao Hu

623
01:02:20,618 --> 01:02:21,880
Wen Lan

624
01:02:26,023 --> 01:02:29,254
I've found you for several days

625
01:02:29,894 --> 01:02:31,361
I am worrying of you

626
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:40,167
I am sorry, here is full of Japanese

627
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:43,201
I've to hide here

628
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:47,840
When can I stop hiding?

629
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,405
I decide to go north

630
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,749
I go with you

631
01:02:54,552 --> 01:02:58,420
No, you can't bear the hard life

632
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:00,288
Stay here

633
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:04,618
Hsiao Hu, I don't want to leave you

634
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:06,590
I'm sorry

635
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:08,462
Listen to me

636
01:03:08,966 --> 01:03:11,764
bring me some food tomorrow night

637
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:16,232
and also a quilted jacket, I wait for you

638
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:45,234
We lived happily in our childhood

639
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:49,295
I remembered, one night in the new year

640
01:03:50,308 --> 01:03:52,276
we played the fire-crackers together

641
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:56,303
I've burnt your clothes

642
01:03:57,582 --> 01:03:59,311
and I'd cried for that

643
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:03,085
my mother made three new clothes

644
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:04,582
for you

645
01:04:05,256 --> 01:04:08,623
I still keep them

646
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,020
Really?

647
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:17,627
the life was so beautiful and happy
in the past

648
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:24,406
It's all over

649
01:04:32,383 --> 01:04:34,749
What would it be in the future?

650
01:04:37,588 --> 01:04:39,453
Only God knows

651
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:31,667
Let's go to that way

652
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:59,025
You see, inspector

653
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:01,161
There's some smoke

654
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:02,897
Have a look

655
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,998
Yes

656
01:06:30,935 --> 01:06:33,836
Lang Hsiao Hu, wake up, it's dawn

657
01:06:34,872 --> 01:06:36,032
Wen Lan, wake up

658
01:06:39,977 --> 01:06:42,946
Excuse me, I'm a Japanese vice inspector

659
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,204
Yamaguchi Tstsuji

660
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:45,776
I come to bring you back

661
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,674
I won't go with you

662
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:49,684
Don't resort to violence

663
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,578
Come with me

664
01:06:51,822 --> 01:06:52,880
Daydreaming

665
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:56,450
I've promised the commissioner

666
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:59,389
I'll hand you out when I've found you

667
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:02,631
I won't trust you that, let's go

668
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:05,228
Halt it

669
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:11,734
You ought to take the punishment

670
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:13,674
I'll surrender by myself

671
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:17,146
You better go with me

672
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:19,882
otherwise you'll be in trouble

673
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:22,377
Let's go

674
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:44,203
Wan Lan, go

675
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:48,169
Chase them

676
01:07:51,282 --> 01:07:53,045
Quick

677
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:19,305
Hurry up...

678
01:08:22,246 --> 01:08:23,543
Hurry up

679
01:08:49,073 --> 01:08:52,167
I think you better come with me

680
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,171
I won't

681
01:08:54,845 --> 01:08:57,109
Don't you want to be tortured

682
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,645
I won't let you go

683
01:09:20,971 --> 01:09:21,528
Get back

684
01:09:21,572 --> 01:09:23,062
Yes...

685
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,077
Wan Lan, you stay away

686
01:12:04,935 --> 01:12:07,597
Do you think that I'll go with you?

687
01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:14,474
Let's go

688
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:39,298
As they want to challenge us

689
01:12:40,671 --> 01:12:43,333
we can't escape anymore

690
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:48,144
I'm afraid they play tricks

691
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:53,143
We have to win or we'll have to move

692
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:58,584
Losing our Chinese's face is
the most important thing

693
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:01,856
Teacher, seek help from Shandong uncle

694
01:13:02,092 --> 01:13:04,856
then we'll be sure win

695
01:13:05,162 --> 01:13:06,754
It's unnecessary

696
01:13:08,432 --> 01:13:10,900
If we cannot win those Japanese

697
01:13:11,168 --> 01:13:15,764
we should better shut down our club

698
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,703
you mean you agree to take challenge?

699
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:21,169
Self-strengthening?

700
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,608
We've no choice

701
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:32,745
We should be well-prepared

702
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:35,919
before the duel

703
01:13:36,593 --> 01:13:40,529
We should be succeeded this time

704
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,567
Mr. Sasaki, I'm confident

705
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:48,361
to win over them

706
01:13:50,174 --> 01:13:53,701
Mr. Yamamoto, do they accept the duel?

707
01:13:54,278 --> 01:13:55,540
Yes...

708
01:13:55,879 --> 01:13:57,847
What did they request for?

709
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:02,042
They want to make a stage in front

710
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:03,946
of the two clubs

711
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:07,680
and to fight in a openly and fairness way
without weapons

712
01:14:09,126 --> 01:14:11,526
We've to show them

713
01:14:11,762 --> 01:14:13,491
our strength this time

714
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:17,358
It'll be held five days later

715
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:20,228
Both invite three persons as the judges

716
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:24,907
Fine, we should grab the chance

717
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:27,101
to take revenge

718
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:30,178
for our chairman and first chief

719
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:35,513
and to destroy the Chung Hwa Club

720
01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:45,886
Cheer up, Chung Hwa Club

721
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,604
Brother...

722
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:46,107
Is there any good fighters in China?

723
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:47,747
Hold it

724
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:55,857
Chairman, I've heard of you for long

725
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:00,694
Heard that you're the kungfu expert
in China

726
01:17:02,299 --> 01:17:03,459
My pleasure

727
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,570
I want to learn from you

728
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:11,905
You're welcome, come on

729
01:17:21,418 --> 01:17:22,476
Come on

730
01:17:22,586 --> 01:17:31,290
Cheer up

731
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,007
How's going on?

732
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:28,581
Get away

733
01:18:32,155 --> 01:18:35,249
I, on behalf of Japanese Karate Club,
challenge you

734
01:18:35,459 --> 01:18:37,791
Fine, please

735
01:18:57,914 --> 01:19:02,977
Cheer up

736
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:42,340
No

737
01:20:47,224 --> 01:20:48,953
Don't play tricks

738
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,086
What do you want then?

739
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:54,459
I am the representative of
Chung Hwa Club

740
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:56,359
Who are you?

741
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,730
I'm Lang Hsiao Hu

742
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:05,230
Hsiao Hu

743
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,302
Teacher

744
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:10,206
You're the murderer

745
01:21:10,513 --> 01:21:12,037
Take him, he's the murderer

746
01:21:12,082 --> 01:21:16,849
Take him

747
01:21:20,924 --> 01:21:22,050
Hold it

748
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:25,158
I'm not the murderer

749
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:27,488
You're the murderer, I've seen it

750
01:21:27,998 --> 01:21:29,431
He is only self-defending

751
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:31,099
I've also seen it

752
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:34,963
Do you want to challenge me?

753
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:39,001
Right, I've heard that you're the
chief teacher of Karate

754
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:40,933
No matter how, let me try

755
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:42,906
Whatever win or lose

756
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:45,670
I'll go surrender

757
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:48,277
You think you'll still alive?

758
01:21:48,518 --> 01:21:49,951
You...

759
01:21:57,794 --> 01:22:00,627
Chairman, please accept my request

760
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:03,825
Alright

761
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:05,261
Thank you very much

762
01:22:05,502 --> 01:22:08,232
Hsiao Hu, take care

763
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,439
Cheer up...

764
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:56,507
Cheer up...

765
01:23:01,091 --> 01:23:06,188
Cheer up...

766
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:06,010
Cheer up...

767
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:43,588
Cheer up...

Teacher

01:28:12,035 --> 01:28:13,229
Hsiao Hu

770
01:28:15,304 --> 01:28:19,001
Tell you that our Chung Hua Club will
never fall down

771
01:28:20,043 --> 01:28:23,035
Although you win, you're still
the murderer

772
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,577
I go to surrender now, okay?

773
01:28:29,352 --> 01:28:30,182
Go

774
01:28:41,764 --> 01:28:42,890

Don't worry

777
01:28:48,337 --> 01:28:50,271
Take care, teacher

778
01:28:51,908 --> 01:28:53,239
You too

779
01:28:55,211 --> 01:28:58,044
I gotta go

780
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,948
Don't be sad, Wen Lan

781
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:07,953
Teacher, I've to go

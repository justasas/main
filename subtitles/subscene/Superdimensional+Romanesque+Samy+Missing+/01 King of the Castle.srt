1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,260
So this must be strange to you.

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,480
Not really.

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,910
Been awhile, but my dad taught me
to play when I was a kid.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,380
Actually, I was talking about
you being here, with us.

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,870
I got what I wanted.

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,440
It's been a long time
since I had anybody

7
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,130
with a little skill
to play against.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,765
I don't suppose
there's anything I could do

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,710
to convince you to stick around?

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,590
Relax Jack. Just an idle question.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,880
We have a deal, I fully intend
to honor it.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,770
Intend to, or you will?

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,430
Well, it's not entirely up to me.

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,770
If the island doesn't want you
to leave, it won't let you.

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,090
What, the...
The island's gonna sink the sub?

16
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,180
No. No.

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,870
I promise you, I won't do anything
to prevent you from getting home.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,570
But if you do leave this place, the
day may come when you want to return.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,620
Never.

20
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,180
I've learned never to say never.

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,040
And if that day comes, I hope
you remember this conversation.

22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,070
It was a nice try though.

1
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,680
- Think I need to come up?
- It's more comfortable up here.

2
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,070
How's it going on The
Danny Hayworth Show?

3
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,870
Giving up fags has done nothing
for my performance on the mic.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,460
- Or my waistline either.
- I'm pleased you took my advice.

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,300
- Did you call Craig?
- No, not yet. I will.

6
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,310
When?

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,330
What's with the inquisition?
What's with the procrastination?

8
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,660
The last time I saw him

9
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,130
he was smashing our wedding
china up the kitchen wall.

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,820
Just give him a ring.

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,450
What you got to lose?
All right. I'll call.

12
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,990
OK, so whose round is it then?

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,990
Well, the wife says if I have
another drink, she's gonna kill me.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,150
Large gin and tonic it is then.

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,770
You fancy a quick drink?

16
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,380
Yeah, all right,

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,420
but only a quick one because
I'm meeting a mate later.

18
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,850
Nice.

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,200
Are you keeping on top
of all those files, Jason?

20
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,400
- Yip.
- Good.

21
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,210
- Don't fall behind.
- Night.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,890
Doesn't look like you're going
to get out of here any time soon.

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,780
Do you want a hand with those?

24
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,900
Yeah. Thanks.

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,350
See you tomorrow.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,710
Missing Persons Unit. Jason Doyle.

27
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,700
Can't it wait? I've got a ton of files.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,950
OK. Give me the address.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,370
She's gone. She didn't come
home. I don't understand it.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All right.

31
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,040
Are you OK to answer some questions?

32
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,380
How can she just disappear like
that? It doesn't make sense.

33
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,500
When did you last see your wife?

34
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,510
- It's Irene, isn't it?
- This morning. Earlier

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,440
What took you so long to get
here? Doesn't anyone care?

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,480
We do care, sir, I just need
to ask some basic questions.

37
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,720
I don't know. I woke up this morning
as usual. Had a shower. She...

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,580
I went to the office, she stayed
at home to work, and, um...

39
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,560
- When was that?
- I can't remember.

40
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,660
- Roughly what time?
- Please...

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,400
Please. I don't see how this is helping.

42
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,930
It's just procedure.

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,820
Just procedure? My wife is missing!

44
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,950
I'd like a bit more than procedure.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,310
There are questions I need
to ask and it will help.

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,090
You need to get out there and
start searching for my wife.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,400
- Which we will.
- When?

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,850
Mr. Laird, please.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,020
All right, can we continue?

50
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,660
You're just wasting time.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
My wife's missing and all you're
doing is just wasting time.

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,040
Do you know if she might
be with anyone? Friends...

53
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,700
I would've checked. Would not I?

54
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,700
What's that?

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,200
Have you had an accident?

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,830
I cut my hand.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,440
There. See.

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,670
Have you been drinking, Mr. Laird?

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,500
- What if I have?
- Doyou mind stepping back?!

60
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,500
Would you mind helping me find my wife?

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,380
- I suggest you just calm down!
- I am calm!

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right.

63
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,500
I am arresting you for the
assault of a police officer.

64
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,300
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

65
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,400
if you do not mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court.

66
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,680
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

67
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,540
<i>This is Craig. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,790
Craig, it's MJ.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,670
Long time.

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm still looking for Ellen and

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,760
I need to talk to you.

72
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,990
Could you give me a call
when you get this, please?

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Thanks.

74
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,250
Done. Happy?

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,510
You do wanna find her, don't you?

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,600
It's not that straightforward.

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,520
I haven't seen him since we split up.

78
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,180
Talking to Craig's just going
to drag it all up. Everything.

79
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,950
It's never as bad as you think.

80
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
You fancy a full English?

81
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,330
Swapping one addiction for
another wasn't the plan.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,310
You worried you're going
to sound fat on the radio?

83
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,420
You should hear me
in horizontal stripes!

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Hey, Jason!

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,930
Have you read this Cadzo file?

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,340
No, I thought you were dealing with it.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
That's disgusting.

88
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,500
I missed breakfast. It was a long night.

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
You know it's an interesting case.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,920
Martin Cadzo testified against his
father in a fraud investigation.

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,460
His father got three years
and Martin went missing.

92
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,230
He testified against his own father?!

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,070
And his family cut him off, except
now his aunt's looking for him.

94
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,150
What does the aunt want?

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,840
Her husband died last month
and left Martin a load of money.

96
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,860
So his aunt's got all this money
and she wants us to find him.

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,300
Jason, he made a stand. He helped
the police prosecute his own dad!

98
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,530
Put an ad in the paper:

99
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,920
" Martin Cadzo, your uncle's
left you a ton of money."

100
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,690
He'll be there like a shot. Right...

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,150
I have to fill in this report
after making my arrest last night.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,460
So, DC Doyle,

103
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,010
a man calls in to MPU to
report his wife missing

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,300
and he ends up in a police cell.

105
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,370
- How does that happen?
- He assaulted me.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,150
Any injuries?

107
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,130
He pushed me onto the sofa.

108
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,280
- Did you provoke him in any way?
- He was drunk.

109
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,010
- There was blood on the carpet.
- He went out,

110
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,770
had a few beers, came back
and his wife was missing.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,980
- He was frantic.
- OK, well, maybe I over-reacted.

112
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,750
Right, I'll go and let Tom
Laird out of his cell, shall I?

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,960
DC Doyle won't be pressing charges.

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Thank you.

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
It was the drink.

116
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,150
The worry.

117
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,860
The thought of Irene hurt or...

118
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,580
Do you have any idea
where Irene might go?

119
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,850
I spoke to her friends.
No-one's heard from her.

120
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,970
What about family?

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,630
There's no-one. Her parents are gone
and there's no brothers or sisters.

122
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,220
I hope you don't mind me
asking you this, but...

123
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
... did Irene suffer from
depression or mood swings?

124
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
No.

125
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Never.

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,430
She's always so...

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,700
- It's all right.
- I'm so worried about her.

129
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,500
We do everything together.

130
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,490
Even the business.

131
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,050
And what about outside work?

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,290
Did you notice a change in her behaviour
or routine for the past week or so?

133
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,580
On Mondays, there's a book group.

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,450
The next night we
went out to the cinema.

135
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,510
Then Wednesday, she started work
on the garden. She's landscaping it.

136
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,980
She took a half day, and then we
met up and went out for a meal.

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,500
Apart from yesterday. I went out for a
drink with some colleagues, went back home.

138
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,410
That's when I realised. The
car was missing from the drive.

139
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,340
And all the photos of Irene.

140
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,130
They're gone.

141
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,420
There were none left behind?

142
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,150
There's one in my wallet at home.

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,700
Would it be possible to have it?

144
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,740
And her bank account details.

145
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,470
- We may be able to trace her that way.
- You will find her, won't you?

146
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,040
We'll do our best.

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,930
It was definitely Africa?

148
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,840
Thanks. You've been a great help.

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,710
University counsellor said
Cadzo was a brilliant student.

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,700
On course for a double first.

151
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,570
I don't think I'm
going to like this guy.

152
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,550
After the trial, he applied for
a sabbatical, which they OKed.

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,340
- Where did he go?
- Africa. Volunteer work.

154
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,860
He phoned the college to
confirm his place was open,

155
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,100
but he didn't show up when term started.

156
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,700
You could check passports and visas,

157
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,970
see whether he returned to the UK.

158
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Good idea.

159
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,200
- He's cute, isn't he?
- He's not my type.

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,880
If you could get the account
details and the photo.

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,300
DCI Ford.

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,660
Thanks for your department's lead.

163
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,210
DC Doyle tipped us off
about the restraining order.

164
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
What?

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,260
12 years ago Laird's ex had a
restraining order placed on him.

166
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,940
DC Doyle didn't mention it.

167
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,660
I was speaking with the neighbours.

168
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,120
They heard rowing the night
before she disappeared.

169
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,210
Did he say anything?

170
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,450
No, he...

171
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,090
We are still looking
for a missing person.

172
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Of course.

173
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,130
I just want to ask Mr.
Laird a few questions.

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,490
I'm not shutting your MPU
out of the investigation.

175
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,990
Let's keep this open, work together.

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Of course, ma'am.

177
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't worry, I'll keep you in the loop.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,290
Mr. Laird, DCI Ford, I'd like
to ask you some questions.

179
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,850
What?

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,640
It's standard procedure.

181
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,220
- She's just doing her job.
- And whose job is it to find Irene?

182
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,230
Mine.

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,050
DCI Ford mentioned a row...

184
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,080
- the night before.
- That was nothing.

185
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,420
I'd just had a bad day
at work, that's all.

186
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,260
What can we do now?

187
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,170
How about contacting local radio?

188
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,770
how do you feel about
doing a live appeal?

189
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,640
I'll do anything, if
it helps find Irene.

190
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Mr. Laird, can we go in?

191
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,220
Why didn't you tell me
you'd taken the case to CID?

192
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
I didn't.

193
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,340
Information about some restraining order
came out when I had Laird in custody.

194
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,220
A DS was down there and we
got chatting about the case.

195
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,370
And you didn't think it
would lead to anything?

196
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,130
Laird is now being investigated
as a possible murder suspect.

197
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,850
What?

198
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,870
- Sarge, I didn't...
- OK. Now, HE's under suspicion,

199
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,800
but we are still
investigating a missing person.

200
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,810
Is that clear?

201
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Sarge.

202
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,210
I've checked the hospital's psych
wards and morgues, there was nothing.

203
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,200
Traffic don't have any RTCs,
they're giving me regular updates.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,530
Ditto in PRS and PNC.

205
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,310
OK. See if there's any
activity on her account.

206
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,300
Amy, get this enlarged
and get it circulated, OK?

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,850
What about the missing photos?

208
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,970
Well, there's no break-ins, so
either Tom or Irene took them.

209
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,930
She's difficult to ID without a photo.

210
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,320
Maybe she took it,
doesn't wanna be found.

211
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,320
Or maybe it was him, he couldn't
bear looking at the woman he killed.

212
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,830
Why keep the one in the wallet?

213
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm gonna see Danny,

214
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,760
see if we can get Tom
on his show tonight.

215
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,390
That was DCI Ford. She wants
to see you in her office.

216
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,230
Tell her I'll call in later.

217
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,910
I got the impression
she meant right now.

218
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,260
How can I help?

219
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,530
You don't think you're
wasting resources on this one?

220
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Ma'am?

221
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,800
Did something come up
when you interviewed him?

222
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,170
Not him, no. We've spoken to the
ex-girlfriend about the restraining order.

223
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,170
- That was 12 years ago.
- She said he had mood swings,

224
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,110
a bit of a temper, as I'm
sure DC Doyle would agree.

225
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,820
He'd just discovered
his wife was missing.

226
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,950
His ex said he found it difficult to
accept that their relationship had ended.

227
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,990
Started drinking,
turning up at the flat.

228
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,310
She said it frightened
her to see him like that.

229
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,220
Anything from your end?

230
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,410
I'm thinking of getting
Tom to do a radio appeal.

231
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,430
Good idea. Is it sorted?

232
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,760
- I was just about to when you called.
- What time would I need to be there?

233
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,060
Well, it's an appeal for Irene. You
being there puts unfair pressure on him.

234
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,140
That's the point.

235
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,590
See how he reacts under pressure.

236
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,090
- He trusts me.
- I'm the senior investigating officer in this case.

237
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,550
Let me know when it's
organised and I'll be there,

238
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,980
DS Croft.

239
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,000
I found this from a search on the
internet. And passports and visas.

240
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,070
Cadzo re-entered the
UK 13th April 2003.

241
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,210
Hang on...

242
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,330
Paul Cadzo died without
meeting his first grandchild,

243
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,380
his estranged son Martin
did not attend the funeral.

244
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,480
When was that?

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,660
20th January, 2003.

246
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,880
So Cadzo returns from Africa
to find out his father's dead.

247
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,240
Came back too late.

248
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,500
That's gotta be why he
didn't go back to uni.

249
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,960
He must have guilt.

250
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,370
Guilt. And the money was his uncle's
way of acknowledging his sacrifice.

251
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
That's tough.

252
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,810
Choosing between your
family and your principles.

253
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,030
Exactly. And his uncle knew he'd
been out in the cold for too long.

254
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,060
And you get to be the one
to welcome him back in.

255
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,910
DCI Ford'll be here in five minutes.

256
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,630
I know what this is about.

257
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,330
She's waiting for me to crack.

258
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,910
- Confess to killing my wife.
- That's not...

259
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,690
She was asking me about my ex.

260
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,700
From 12 years ago. It was all lies.

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,560
Her and her new boyfriend
made it all up to get at me.

262
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,130
I wasn't a threat, not like that.

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,280
I turned up to talk to her and
he started on me. It was him.

264
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,970
Why don't they just come out with it?

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,650
Ask me what I've done with her body.

266
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Tom...

267
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,790
- I need you to focus.
- I can't do this.

268
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,000
You can't back out now. It'll look
like you've buckled under the pressure.

269
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,000
Forget DC Ford, this appeal
is about finding Irene.

270
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
OK?

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,700
Just like any other morning,
you got up, you went to work,

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,610
and that was the last
time that you saw Irene?

273
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,310
That's right.

274
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,320
Can you remember what she was wearing?

275
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,700
Jeans, I think. Erm...

276
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,290
And a green V-necked jumper.

277
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,050
- Does she have any distinguishing features?
- She has a scar,

278
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,510
just below her ear.
Runs down to her neck.

279
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,960
And what would you like to say
to Irene if she was listening?

280
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
If...

281
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,570
If she was out there.

282
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,330
Tom's written Irene a message.

283
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,600
"If you're in trouble, we
can work it out, like always.

284
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,250
"More than anything, I need to
know that you are safe and well."

285
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,210
If you're listening, Irene, or
someone knows where Irene is,

286
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,770
please call 960 953.

287
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,360
<i>There's some photos of
Irene on the website...</i>

288
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,210
<i>This is the Danny Hayworth Show.</i>

289
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,860
Is Tom OK?

290
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,720
It threw him, having CID there.

291
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,650
She'll be even more suspicious now.

292
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,500
Craig got in touch.

293
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,730
He's coming in tomorrow.

294
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,380
How do you feel about that?

295
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,020
Ever since I started
looking for Ellen again,

296
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,890
I've had this terrible feeling of...

297
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
failure.

298
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Why?

299
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,190
He blamed me for Ellen leaving.

300
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,600
Said it was my fault.

301
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,080
Said I wanted Ellen to leave.

302
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
And did you?

303
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,410
'Course I didn't.

304
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,320
Why did Ellen leave, MJ?

305
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,620
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

306
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,740
Come on, let's get out of here.

307
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,540
- Did you get anything from the appeal?
- Nothing new. Still going through 'em.

308
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,210
What about you with Cadzo?

309
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,320
This guy seems to be able to live without
legally owning or renting property,

310
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,920
without paying taxes, getting
sick, or having a bank account.

311
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,070
- Psychiatric clinics?
- Checked.

312
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,320
- What did he do in Africa?
- He worked with orphaned children.

313
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,310
Kids, orphans, volunteering.
Come on, it's a no-brainer.

314
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,350
Local charities, of course!

315
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
I should check with the ones
that specialise with children.

316
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,750
Morning. Any news on Irene Laird?

317
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,570
Nothing on her personal account, but
maybe something on the business side.

318
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,040
There was some restructuring
just last month.

319
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,680
Sounds creative.

320
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,590
Well, Tom is now the sole
signatory on all the cheques,

321
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,070
and if anything should happen to Irene,

322
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,620
he's the sole beneficiary
of the business.

323
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,590
Things are stacking up against him.

324
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,220
Let's not be too hasty.

325
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,800
I've got an email here from the
radio appeal, from a Sarah Banberry.

326
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,800
She claims to be Irene's daughter.

327
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,810
What?!

328
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,410
She said Irene went
missing 18 years ago.

329
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,780
- Shall I let DCI Ford know?
- No.

330
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,940
This is OUR lead. She responded
to an appeal from Missing Person,

331
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,410
I wanna talk to her first.

332
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,570
This is my mother.

333
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,890
She was called Helen Banberry then.

334
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,940
That's all I've had.

335
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,730
18 years.

336
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,900
- Did you have any other photos?
- She took them all.

337
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,420
A week after she disappeared,

338
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,950
a box of them was found in the woods,

339
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
burnt.

340
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,730
Was she stressed, for any reason?

341
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,730
No, she...she'd just started
working up at the sailing club,

342
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,110
so there was a bit more money.

343
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,180
Dad said they'd even talked
about having more children.

344
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,920
He died five years ago.

345
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,020
Right until the end, he never
stopped believing that we'd find her.

346
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,200
We found Cadzo.

347
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,100
He volunteers for a local charity,
works with disabled children.

348
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,180
- He lives nearby.
- Get a uniform to ID him.

349
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,140
I thought I could go.

350
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,350
No, you find out when Irene
changed her name by deed poll.

351
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,840
But they won't give me that information.

352
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,950
Tell them it's a murder enquiry.

353
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,430
Irene left Sarah in 1991.

354
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,750
She was with Tom eight years, I wanna
know where she was for the other ten.

355
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,490
I thought we agreed
to share information.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,880
I take it you're referring
to Sarah Banberry?

357
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,580
Why didn't you tell me you had a lead?

358
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,730
She responded to an appeal.

359
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,290
I thought she had
information about Irene.

360
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,770
Irene's gone missing before.

361
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,470
She left Sarah and her
dad, exactly the same MO,

362
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,290
took all the photographs...

363
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,190
I wonder what Tom would have
done if he'd found this out.

364
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,790
A wife with a secret past.

365
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,860
We know he has a temper.

366
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,140
Come on!

367
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,310
We've got no scene of crime,
no body, no forensics...

368
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,180
I have Irene Laird's burnt-out car
in a field half a mile from the A14.

369
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,950
My officers are there now,
searching the area for evidence.

370
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,260
So far, we've found the
remains of the photos,

371
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,700
and a pair of men's
gloves covered in paraffin.

372
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,350
And you're the one talking
about sharing information?

373
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,540
I called you in here to share
this latest development with you.

374
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,600
And as your senior officer, I'm reminding
you that I asked you for regular updates.

375
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,260
Any developments come straight to me.

376
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,920
I take it that works both ways?

377
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,850
Until I say otherwise.

378
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,660
- Would you like a drink, tea, coffee?
- No, I'm good.

379
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,470
Will she be long?

380
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,990
No, she's just in a
meeting. I'm sure she'll...

381
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,370
I'm sorry I'm late, I...

382
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,310
got caught up in a meeting.

383
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,490
You've got some news...about Ellen?

384
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,350
- We traced some money wires.
- Well, I sent her money.

385
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,030
How often?

386
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,030
She'd call a couple of times one week,

387
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,800
then I wouldn't hear
anything for six months.

388
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,590
Over what period of time?

389
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,590
I'm... I don't exactly... Six years.

390
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,780
- On and off.
- Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,180
We weren't in contact,

392
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,250
- remember?
- She's my sister, Craig.

393
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,540
I have a right to know.

394
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,890
What do you want me to
say? I'm not a mind reader.

395
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,480
You could have contacted me.

396
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,460
What was the money for?

397
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,150
It was always drugs-related,

398
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,760
getting away from people
who gave her drugs,

399
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,250
a deposit for a flat to
get her off the street,

400
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,660
- a fine for possession...
- Why didn't she come to me?

401
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,330
Well, look at it from her point of view.

402
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,800
God, you always took her side.

403
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,730
- You're still doing it now.
- No, MJ, I'm not.

404
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,470
I had to be a sister, a
parent, keep my career on track,

405
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,920
hold our marriage together, which wasn't
easy when Ellen wanted my attention

406
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,710
every second of every day.
You were jealous of Ellen?

407
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,720
Why did you stop sending her the money?

408
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,790
I suspected she was using it for drugs.

409
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,370
Did you tell her?

410
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,240
I said I'd send her food
and clothes, but no cash.

411
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,020
She gave me the address of
a halfway house in London.

412
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,030
London?

413
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Yes.

414
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,640
She's in England.

415
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,130
I don't believe this!

416
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,090
I was helping someone I cared about.

417
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,450
Give me a break, MJ.

418
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,350
- Have you got an address?
- I called the number she gave me.

419
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,950
It was a telephone box
in Waterloo station.

420
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,120
She screwed me.

421
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,760
Interesting choice of word.

422
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,620
I came here to help, not to
rake up all this crap again.

423
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,260
Craig... Craig!

424
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
Craig!

425
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,610
Listen to me.

426
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,820
Craig, I was out of order.

427
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,390
Is this how little you trusted me?

428
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,720
It's just... I helped Ellen out
cos someone had to and you weren't.

429
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,410
If things were that desperate,
why didn't you come to me?

430
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,230
She begged me not to.
She hadn't forgiven you.

431
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,580
15 years later

432
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,550
and you're still going
over the same bloody ground.

433
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,670
Move on, MJ. Move on.

434
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
- Craig...
- MJ?

435
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,120
- Not now, Amy.
- It's really urgent.

436
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,690
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.

437
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,770
- Who's that?
- It's George Partis.

438
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I did the checks you asked for and it turns
out that Irene, Helen Banberry at the time,

439
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,220
changed her name to Annette
Allan via deed poll in 1991.

440
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,680
I take it that was when this
George became her boyfriend?

441
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,240
I tracked Annette Allan

442
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,190
and found that she hooked
up with George Partis here.

443
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,870
I managed to contact him.

444
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,360
They used to travel a lot, keen sailors.

445
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,470
Then he wanted to settle down

446
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,070
and she gets a job running start-up
courses for up-and-coming businesses.

447
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,380
A year later, she's off
- takes nothing with her.

448
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,130
Apart from, let me
guess, all the photos?

449
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,380
You've got it. Exactly the same MO.

450
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,370
We're dealing with a
serial missing person.

451
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,630
There's a definite pattern.

452
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,950
Sarah Banberry said that her mum
got a job in the sailing club.

453
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,240
A couple of months later, she's off
on the high seas with George Partis.

454
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,530
While she's with him, she starts running
these business courses and meets Tom.

455
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,480
And bye-bye George.

456
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,630
I want you to check
out Irene's book club.

457
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,300
According to him, it was the
only time they were apart.

458
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,740
Are you gonna update the DCI?

459
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,350
- I'll let Jason do the honours.
- My pleasure.

460
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,810
I need to speak to Tom.

461
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,440
There might be something he thinks
of once I tell him about Irene's past.

462
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,690
MJ, patrol never made it
down to see Cadzo today,

463
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,340
so I thought I might follow it up.

464
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,430
I think I can accept
an ID off a non-uniform.

465
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,950
Good job, by the way.

466
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,290
Did I say that already?

467
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,340
I don't understand.

468
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,820
Earlier on...

469
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,890
the detective was asking
me about Irene's car.

470
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,170
They thought I'd burnt it.

471
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,550
I'm hoping that what
we've found out about Irene

472
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,420
will prove that you had nothing
to do with her disappearance.

473
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,090
I didn't. You do believe me, don't you?

474
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,300
Tom, I need you to try and think.

475
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,790
Is there anything you can tell me

476
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,370
that will help me find
out who Irene may have...

477
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
been with?

478
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,360
There's something I didn't tell you.

479
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,950
What you said about
Irene having affairs...

480
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,120
I started to get
suspicious a few weeks back.

481
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
Why?

482
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,290
There was a parking
fine, it came in the post.

483
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,700
She never mentioned it, which was odd.

484
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,140
So I started looking through her things.

485
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,340
I found a...dress.

486
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,330
It wasn't the sort she'd wear.

487
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,900
Can you describe it?

488
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,980
It was black and low-cut...

489
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,670
flimsy.

490
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,690
Is that what you and
Irene were rowing about?

491
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,040
No, I never mentioned that I'd
found it, or the parking fine,

492
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,790
just that...

493
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,040
I felt like she was losing
interest in me and...

494
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,640
when she denied it, I got angry.

495
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,900
I did something stupid.

496
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,580
What did you do, Tom?

497
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,920
I burned the dress and the letter
at the bottom of the garden.

498
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,600
I don't believe this.

499
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,920
What else aren't you telling me?

500
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,490
Well, nothing.

501
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,350
You do know how this is going to look?

502
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,400
- I thought you believed me.
- You withheld information.

503
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,410
I'm trying to help you
and you kept it from me.

504
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,260
- Please, I-I-I...
- I've got no choice, Tom.

505
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,740
I'm gonna have to call DCI Ford.

506
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Hello?

507
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Martin Cadzo?

508
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Who are you?

509
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,330
Oh... Amy Garnett.

510
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,090
- Missing Persons.
- Who's missing?

511
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You.

512
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,530
Is that me?

513
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,900
I look pretty good.

514
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,170
Well, I have some news from your family.

515
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,260
It's about your uncle, Steven Cadzo, and

516
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,860
and I'm afraid it's not good news.

517
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,210
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

518
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,180
He died on the 12th February.

519
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
He left you a considerable
sum of money in his will

520
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,690
and your aunt's been trying to find you.

521
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,660
Mr. Cadzo, what do I tell your aunt?

522
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,410
Do you want me to give her your details?

523
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,910
Yes, they're here. I'll do it now.

524
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,480
Please.. You know I didn't kill her.

525
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,450
Thomas Laird,

526
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,070
I am arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Irene Laird.

527
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,830
You do not have to say anything,

528
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,350
but it may harm your defence if
you do not mention when questioned

529
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,820
something which you
later rely on in court.

530
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,680
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

531
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,470
Listen, you've got to
find Irene. P-P-Please...

532
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,750
you've got to help me!

533
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,040
I appreciate it must have been
difficult, arresting Laird.

534
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,350
What's going to happen now?

535
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,710
We'll be presenting the case to the CPS in
a couple of hours, then it's over to them.

536
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,430
But there's a strong possibility that
he'll be looking at a murder charge.

537
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,570
Thank you for all your work.

538
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Come in.

539
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Sorry, Sarge.

540
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,050
It's fine.

541
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,930
The CPS are looking at
the evidence right now.

542
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,120
How long have we got?

543
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,320
- For what?
- I think you might be right,

544
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,710
you find out about the
affair, you find Irene.

545
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,600
You confirm a motive, you mean?

546
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,510
I still reckon it's
worth searching for her.

547
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,290
I just heard back from the book group. She
didn't turn up to the last three meetings.

548
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,490
Let me ring the DVLA,
check out her parking fine.

549
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,590
I bet it was one of the nights she was
supposed to be with her Jane Austen mates.

550
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,380
OK, but we've got to act fast.

551
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,270
We've only got a couple of hours before the
CPS get back to Ford with their decision.

552
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,040
I thought we'd have been
able to make a fresh start.

553
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,480
I'd like that.

554
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,220
I'm sorry about before.

555
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,730
You did the right thing,
looking out for Ellen.

556
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,660
- I do appreciate it.
- There's something else.

557
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,820
It might be useful. I remembered
the last time she called.

558
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,830
For drugs?

559
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,320
Well, she said it was
for a counselling course.

560
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,210
She mentioned a
college, Winbeck College.

561
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,150
- In London?
- I don't know.

562
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,380
To be honest, I'd lost
it with her by then.

563
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,310
- Thanks. You've been a great help.
- Take care, OK?

564
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,330
I-I-If you find her,
will you let me know?

565
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Of course.

566
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,040
Someone looks pretty
pleased with himself.

567
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,000
The DVLA...

568
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,920
Irene Laird's parking
fine from two Mondays ago.

569
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,890
But that's the night of her book group.

570
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,420
It must have been a page-turner
for her to forget about the car.

571
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,400
She hasn't been going. I knew it!

572
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:17,340
# I knew it, I knew it... # I'm assuming
that's because you've got a result?

573
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,370
The parking fine...

574
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,110
Ripley high street, 2046.

575
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,960
- The car parked at 1830.
- 1830 to 2046...

576
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,340
dinnertime!

577
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,240
Do you want us to get down
there and circulate her image,

578
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,010
- see if anyone remembers her?
- Yeah. That's what I was gonna suggest.

579
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,550
Great minds. Start with
the posh restaurants.

580
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,790
She was wearing the black
dress, going upmarket.

581
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,180
And we know Irene likes a man who
can provide a certain lifestyle.

582
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,420
Nothing, you? Yeah,

583
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,650
she came here on
Monday night with a man.

584
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,770
- Do they have the man's name?
- Paul Fallon.

585
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,450
I got his landline number,

586
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,480
so should be able to get the
address from the phone company.

587
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,210
Must have been a special occasion.
Maison du Pays, little black dress?

588
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,220
She left Tom a week later, so Paul
must have played his cards right.

589
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,590
What was the menu like?

590
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,620
Pig's trotter and
truffle. Not my cup of tea.

591
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,580
I'm a meat and two veg type of man.

592
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Want some?

593
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,380
- How was Craig?
- He was OK.

594
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,390
Anything on her?

595
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,570
She was back in the country.

596
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,770
She applied for a college
course in Guildford.

597
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,650
They faxed me her application.

598
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,160
Her contact details were a drug clinic.

599
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,040
Got Amy looking into it.

600
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,500
What did the college say?

601
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,830
She seemed nervous, jittery.

602
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,750
Bit fragile.

603
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,440
But extremely bright.

604
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,360
Sounds like she was trying
to get her life back on track.

605
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,200
She couldn't afford the fees.

606
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,600
Wish I'd known.

607
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,830
How did you leave things with Craig?

608
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,670
Got a lot to be angry about,
but we cleared the air.

609
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,940
Thing is, Danny, I, er...

610
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,080
I accused Ellen of sleeping
with Craig before she ran away.

611
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,120
- Was it true?
- No.

612
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,230
No, she didn't. They didn't...

613
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:36,000
It was just me, and my
paranoia, and my insecurity.

614
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,120
Was that why you split up?

615
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,950
Sounds like we've all
moved on since then.

616
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm trying to.

617
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,580
Oh, go on, let me have
one! Please. Please...!

618
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,650
No, look, have that. Go on.

619
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,860
Got it.

620
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,630
The phone number was registered
to Paul Fallon, Ripley Hill.

621
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
Got another one here.

622
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,400
Paul Fallon. Landscape gardening.

623
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,120
Irene must have met him when
he was doing work on her garden.

624
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,360
We've got a phone number and
address for Irene's new man.

625
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,570
Good work. Get over
there as soon as possible.

626
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,920
DS Croft. Missing Persons Unit.

627
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
You've been reported missing.

628
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,960
<i>I haven't done anything illegal.</i>

629
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,690
The problem is, Irene, I have
to officially identify you.

630
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,730
- You are still calling yourself Irene?
- I am Irene Laird.

631
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,020
Jason, call DCI Ford and tell
her we've found Irene Laird.

632
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,230
Your husband's being held
on suspicion of your murder.

633
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,780
But...Tom wouldn't hurt a fly.

634
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,350
I guess him being soft made
him easier to manipulate.

635
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
I'd like you to leave now.

636
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,680
- So what do I tell your daughter Sarah?
- I gave more than I took.

637
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,750
George was rich, but lazy!

638
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,790
He travelled the world with me.
Tom was terrified to take risks.

639
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,000
Today he owns a business
that employs 87 people.

640
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,760
And that makes it all right to
abandon him and ruin his reputation?

641
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,560
Must have been hard
remembering all those lies.

642
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,410
What about Sarah?

643
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,400
When I was young, my
parents moved around a lot...

644
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,380
Hardly the same!

645
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,730
It gives me a certain perspective!

646
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,220
You told Paul Farron
about your "perspective"?

647
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,250
He doesn't need to know.

648
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,350
I haven't broken any law. I have
the right not to be contacted.

649
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,990
Don't you think about the people
you left behind? A daughter...

650
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,770
she spent years wondering
what happened to you.

651
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,000
And Tom. He loves you. Don't
you think you owe him...

652
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,980
- some sort of explanation?
- What do you expect me to say

653
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,420
that wasn't made clear the moment
I walked out of their lives?

654
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,250
"I'm sorry"? No.

655
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,840
Certainly made it easier.

656
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Maybe.

657
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,670
You've found me.

658
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,200
You've done your jobs.

659
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
I think it's time for you to leave.

660
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,650
- Congratulations.
- Ma'am?

661
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,310
It's been a difficult couple of days.

662
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,890
- For Tom Laird, you mean.
- Yes.

663
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,300
Thank you...and your team.

664
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,290
- Real dedication.
- Or a real pain in the neck.

665
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,200
You got the result, DS Croft.

666
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,040
We found Irene.

667
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,630
I don't think Tom will
see it as a result.

668
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,300
- She didn't want to know?
- No.

669
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,400
It's not your responsibility.

670
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,080
Doesn't make it any easier, though.

671
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,450
I guess not.

672
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,130
- Has Tom been released?
- Of course.

673
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,330
You were never a pain.

674
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,470
A bit of a challenge... But
you were right to pursue it.

675
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,020
Look, I'm not gonna keep coming round.

676
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,480
Just let me do my job and I can
let you get on with your life.

677
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,590
Your aunt's details.

678
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I...

679
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,500
I can't imagine what it's like
sacrificing everything for your principles.

680
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,920
Personally, I think it was brave.

681
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,770
You stood up for what you believed in.

682
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,900
Your aunt and uncle knew it was
wrong for your family to cut you off,

683
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:09,660
and I know it's late. But this
is their way of apologising.

684
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,310
He controlled everyone by money.

685
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,690
Me... Mum...

686
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,340
Threatened to cut us
off if we crossed him.

687
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,400
Just got sick of it.

688
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,720
So I decided to play
him at his own game.

689
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,680
I threatened to call the police,
he just laughed in my face.

690
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,600
Thought I wouldn't
give up the easy life.

691
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,150
It wasn't about right
or wrong principles.

692
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,010
I did it out of spite.

693
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,540
Do you still wanna save me?

694
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,730
Well, I think you should stop hiding.

695
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,900
You could do a lot with that money.

696
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,900
Change lives.

697
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm really sorry, Sarah.

698
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,590
I couldn't convince your
mother to contact you.

699
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,920
But you know where she is.

700
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,110
I can't give you her address.
Not unless she tells me to.

701
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,140
She doesn't have anything to say to me?

702
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
I'm sorry.

703
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,080
When I saw the picture on the
poster and I knew it was here, it was...

704
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,530
an amazing feeling, like
if all those years of hoping

705
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,360
hadn't been for nothing. She was alive!

706
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,800
But she doesn't want to talk to me.

707
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,720
Why would I want to hear
what she's got to say anyway?

708
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,120
What would be the point?

709
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,120
Just to have her say she
doesn't care, she never did!

710
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,280
- Sorry, I'm keeping you.
- No, no.

711
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,690
Well, at least I know.

712
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Thanks.

713
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,110
- There you go...
- Thanks.

714
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,490
Brought you some sugar.

715
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,760
I'm all right.

716
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm sorry about what happened...

717
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,220
- the other night...
- No, I was, er, upset.

718
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,330
- How you doing, Tom?
- Bit tired.

719
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,390
- Did you sleep?
- At least it wasn't in a cell.

720
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,320
Look on the bright side.

721
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,880
I just lay awake all night.

722
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,970
Totally still.

723
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,890
And then it was light again.

724
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,370
Nothing had changed.

725
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,370
I don't know what I'm supposed
to be feeling right now.

726
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,270
What do I do?

727
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,320
You need to take things slowly.

728
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,870
What... What do people think of me?

729
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,770
The neighbours, they...
think I'm actually capable...

730
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,180
You've done nothing wrong.

731
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,200
Then why did she leave me?

732
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,470
Doesn't even want to see me.

733
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,670
You mustn't blame yourself.

734
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,100
I just wish things could go
back to the way they were.

735
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:31,430
When someone goes missing, the effects on
the loved ones left behind can be devastating.

736
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,490
It can leave people
feeling depressed and angry,

737
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,910
and grief-stricken at the
loss of their loved ones.

738
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,160
But imagine if you're accused
of murdering that missing person.

739
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,030
Dealing with your own feelings and
the suspicion of your neighbours.

740
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,340
My question is: should the people
who go missing be held accountable,

741
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,930
or is it everyone's right to
live their lives as they wish?

742
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,600
My name is Danny Hayworth,
and the lines are open.

743
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,290
- I'm looking for Amy Garnett.
- Oh, hi.

744
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,790
Look, I'm no good at speeches,
I just wanted to say...

745
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Thank you.

746
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,240
And I'd like to donate
some money to the MPU.

747
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,230
You do good work here.

748
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,280
My solicitors' details. Just let them
know who to make the cheque payable to.

749
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,680
Here's my...card. Just in case.

750
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,950
I'll keep it with the other one.

751
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,740
Good luck.

752
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Thanks.

753
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,530
- Goodlooking bloke!
- He's not my type.

754
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,750
What is your type?

755
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,140
I like a "meat and two veg" kind of guy.

756
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,720

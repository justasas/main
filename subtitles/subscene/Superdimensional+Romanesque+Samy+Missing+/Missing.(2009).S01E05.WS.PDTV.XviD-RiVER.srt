1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,670
You've not been returning my calls.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
I've been busy.

3
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,650
MJ, this is me you're talking to.

4
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,360
She's in Dover.

5
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I've seen her.

6
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,600
What, Ellen?

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
You've found her?

8
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,870
Got a list of her mobile calls.

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,630
Last number she rung was 999.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,080
Traced it to the hospital.

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,060
There she was.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,020
Are you sure it was her?

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,870
I called to her.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,710
She looked right through me.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,660
She wasn't expecting to see
you and she was in the hos...

16
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,430
It's all right.

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,890
I've seen her.

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,250
I can let it go now.

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
What, after all these years?

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,780
The case is closed.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,300
Case? This is your sister!

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,100
Didn't stop you digging
it up on your show, did it?

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,810
I'd better go.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,860
Back to the office?

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,890
No, home visit.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,130
New case just come in.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,760
Look, what I just said...

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,630
Did you say something?

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,010
I wasn't listening.

30
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,630
I went straight from work
on a girls' night out.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,300
My boyfriend, Sam, was meant
to be meeting up with his mates.

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,970
Some of his stuff's gone.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
This mate, can you give
us his number, Gemma?

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,900
Sam's not there. I checked.
He never even showed up.

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,910
- did you have a fight or anything?
- No.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,960
In fact, we were... close.

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,680
Just yesterday morning, you know.

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,220
Which was nice, cos he's
been a bit distant lately,

40
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,900
since we found out about the baby,
cos it wasn't planned.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,060
But he was as chuffed
as I was, er, at first.

42
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,120
At first?

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,330
Well, then he just clammed up
and whenever I mentioned it,

44
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,990
he just got quiet. Typical
bloke. Can't talk about feelings.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,950
- You were going to get us a photo.
- Er, yeah, of course. It's in here.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,380
Something wrong, Gemma?

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,580
My mum's bracelet. It should be in here.

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Are you sure?

49
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,630
- Can you describe it?
- Gold, white gold.

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,790
Er, about that thick, with
rubies and diamonds on it.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,620
It's the only good
piece I had. Erm, why?

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,090
Well, what does that mean, that look?

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,260
Well, he wouldn't steal it off me.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,030
Look, erm...

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,210
He's in trouble, I
know he is, so just...

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,900
Please, you've got to find him.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,040
What happened to the
trackie and trainers?

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,590
Too much like hard work.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,760
- If you want MJ, she's not here.
- I know, I've just seen her.

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,750
She told me she's just
closed Ellen's case.

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,730
She's in bits.

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,270
Look, I have to come up with
some way to put things right.

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,310
How?

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,200
She mentioned a list
of telephone numbers.

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,640
That is police business!

66
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,640
Well, won't you just let me see it?

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,330
For MJ's sake.

68
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Please.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,890
I don't know, Danny.

70
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,250
What if you were to leave the room and you
just happened to leave the file on your desk?

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,200
I won't go further than the car
park. I'll bring it back, I promise.

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,020
I'm just going to pop
to the canteen.

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,910
What are you doing here?

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Oh, you know me, just poking me nose in.

75
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,470
Your new case, I've got a
slot on the show tonight.

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,310
Danny, I'm busy.

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,410
If I need ya, I'll let you know.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,100
His mate said Sam had
real money worries.

79
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,130
Seems Gemma didn't want
to wait for anything.

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,190
See the house.

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,740
The house is like a shrine
to the Shopping Channel.

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Jason.

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,280
Sam tried to borrow money off him.

84
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,330
Said not to tell Gemma.

85
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,130
It's not the only
thing he kept from her.

86
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,190
I talked to his boss.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Sam was made redundant three weeks ago.

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,170
Even opted to work out his notice.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,310
So he wouldn't have to
tell his wife presumably?

90
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,870
I think we're talking
serious financial pressure.

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,320
Maybe marital problems?

92
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,060
Don't think so. She said they were
close yesterday morning.

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Well, it could've been
his way of saying goodbye.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,650
That how you say goodbye, is it?

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,990
The boss said he was edgy. He went
out for lunch, never came back.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,980
Do we know where he went?

97
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,050
Usually goes to a cafe on Farthing
Street. I'll get over there.

98
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,920
Get on to the council, see if there's
any CCTV coverage for that area.

99
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,750
Amy, call Gemma, see if we
can see the bank details.

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,790
And run a check on Sam's number plate.

101
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,640
Missing Persons Unit.

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,660
Yeah, let me get my coat
and I'll be right down.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
So?

104
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,110
I called the most
frequently used number.

105
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Turns out it belongs to
Ellen's boyfriend, Simon.

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,190
- And you know this because?
- Well, I spoke to him.

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,240
Look, don't worry! I just said that
I was a friend of Ellen's sister.

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
And?

109
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,190
Ellen did recognise MJ at
the hospital last night,

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,100
but won't talk about it, so he wouldn't say
where they live. Maybe that's your answer.

111
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,600
- Legenda não traduzida -

112
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,920
No, he wanted to, Amy, I
know he did. I could tell.

113
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,770
You're not going to
let this go, are you?

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,480
Look, here's the number.

115
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,380
Now you could find out the address
it's registered to, couldn't you?

116
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,980
If you do this for me,

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,630
I won't ask you for anything else.

118
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Ever.

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Yes, you will.

120
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Sarge!

121
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,940
I've got footage of the cafe
from yesterday lunchtime.

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,880
It was after one o'clock.

123
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,450
This is where he was last seen.

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,850
The manager said he
came in with another man.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,780
Apparently, they had an argument.

126
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,590
Sam shouted something
about owing him money.

127
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,250
That's Sam in front.

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,750
And the other guy slammed
his fist on the table.

129
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,740
Manager asked him to leave
or he'd call the police.

130
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,980
Let's see if we can get him coming out.

131
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,490
Sam was pretty shaken up after this.

132
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,440
Another customer went over to him,
but he pushed past and rushed out.

133
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,580
That's the man he went in with.

134
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,150
There he is.

135
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,790
That's the customer who followed him.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,020
A do-gooder according to the manager.

137
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,700
Amy, get some print-outs done.
See if Gemma knows the bloke.

138
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,410
A "please" would be nice.

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
- Are you sure?
- Well, who is he?

140
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
We don't know.

141
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,450
He was seen having an argument with
Sam in a cafe near where he works.

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,060
Well, what about?

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Money.

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,520
You didn't know he'd
been made redundant?

145
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,890
Well, he never told me.

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,660
This just keeps getting worse!

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,870
Shall I order a facial recognition?

148
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,740
When your office called,

149
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,720
I phoned the building society.

150
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,140
They say he was four months
behind on the mortgage payment,

151
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,980
but that he paid it off three weeks ago,

152
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,310
in cash.

153
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,710
Over two thousand pounds.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
I mean, where did he get
all that cash in one go?

155
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,660
Why didn't he tell me instead
of just taking the bracelet?

156
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,060
He's running away from something,
but I don't think it's you.

157
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,860
Look, I don't care what he's done.

158
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,680
I'll do anything to get him back.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,940
Anything?

160
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,070
Sam, if you're listening...

161
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
I love you so, so much and, erm,

162
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
whatever's wrong,

163
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,730
we'll get through it, right.
Just please, please come home.

164
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,200
So if anybody has any
information on Sam Winter,

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,470
please get in contact
on the usual number.

166
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:22,900
And just to remind you, Sam was last seen coming
out of the cafe on Farthing Street at 20 past one.

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,380
Perhaps you were there and saw him,
or perhaps you've seen him since.

168
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,070
If you've got any information,
then please call in.

169
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
- Ellen?
- Yeah?

170
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,130
I'm a friend of Mary Jane Croft.

171
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,680
Are you the guy that phoned Simon?

172
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,700
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Danny.

174
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,420
- Danny Hayworth.
- Look, I'm not interested.

175
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,120
I just want five minutes of your time.

176
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Please.

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,800
She's beautiful.

178
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,680
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

179
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,290
Is she all right now?

180
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,780
I mean, you took her to the hospital.

181
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,110
One of her asthma attacks.

182
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,750
I probably overreacted,
but it's best be safe.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,040
Look, I'm sure you're not
here to talk about Sarah.

184
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,030
No. I, erm...

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,970
I was hoping you'd
agree to meet up with MJ.

186
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Mary Jane.

187
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,040
Did she send you here to ask me that?

188
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,180
No, no. She doesn't even know I'm here.

189
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,620
Well, she's a really good friend

190
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,430
and I care about her.

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,670
Look, I'm sticking my neck out
here. She'll probably kill me.

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Please.

193
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Ellen...

194
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,590
she's your sister.

195
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,290
Whatever went on in the past...

196
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,800
If you could meet her
and talk things through...

197
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,120
It's complicated.

198
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,250
It might be easier than you think.

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,370
You see, MJ knows what
happened after you left.

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,360
She knows about the abortion?

201
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,480
I couldn't believe it,
cos I'd seen him in the cafe.

202
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,230
When I heard his name on
the radio, I knew it was him.

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,640
When I saw his picture on
the website, I had to come in.

204
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't usually listen
to that radio station.

205
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,820
This is...

206
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,920
Hi, Ryan Long, I'm here to
help with the Sam Winter case.

207
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,740
- Hi.
- He heard the appeal last night.

208
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,770
Yeah, that's right. I
was expecting DS Croft.

209
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,370
You're getting DC Doyle instead.
Would you like to come this way?

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,910
- Do you want to take a seat?
- Yeah, this is the guy. Sam, is it?

211
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
And that's me. Er, how did you, erm...?

212
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
CCTV.

213
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,180
Right. Well, it was the raised
voice that made me look over.

214
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,310
- Can you remember what he said?
- Yeah. "You'll get it."

215
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,230
Or, "I'll give it back to you."
Something like that.

216
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
- And then?
- Well, the manager

217
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,360
goes over to their table
and tells this guy to leave,

218
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,480
so I go to Sam to see if he's OK

219
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,770
and he just rushes past me.

220
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,560
- And then you followed him
outside? Yeah, that's right.

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why?

222
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,600
See if I could help.

223
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,710
A total stranger?

224
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,590
I'm a financial consultant. I
could have offered a way out.

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,400
What, give him a loan?
Consolidate his debts?

226
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,780
- Could work something out.
- Did he say anything to you?

227
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,180
No, he got in the car
and just drove off.

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,620
If there's anything you want me to do.
If you're organising a search party or...

229
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,500
No, it's fine.

230
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,680
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Long.

231
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,570
If you'd like to wait here, my
colleague will be in shortly.

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,530
Anything?

233
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,650
Nothing we didn't already know.

234
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
He's an ambulance chaser.

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,450
You couldn't do me a favour?
Could you take his details?

236
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Cheers.

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,900
Hey! You shouldn't be looking at that.

238
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,900
Sorry. I just find this
thing so fascinating.

239
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,340
I thought about joining the force once.

240
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,830
I watch police
documentaries all the time.

241
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,010
All right, Mr. Long,
can I have an address?

242
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,930
Er, yeah. 32 Greenford Road.

243
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,120
And a phone number?

244
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,880
07802 420 006.

245
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,300
So in a case like this, I suppose
you just check out all the hospitals?

246
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,420
That kind of stuff.

247
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,750
Standard procedures.

248
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,850
- Still no news?
- No, not yet.

249
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,580
Right. Thank you for taking
the trouble of coming in.

250
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,360
Oh, no, no trouble at all.
I'm on a training course.

251
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,040
My hotel's just a five-minute walk.

252
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,510
- We'd better let you get back.
- OK.

253
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,990
I'm taking the rest of the day off.

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
I've said to your colleague if you
need any help, just let me know.

255
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,070
You will call and let me know
if you find him, won't you?

256
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Yeah.

257
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Good.

258
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,570
I'm going for lunch with Danny.
He says it's important.

259
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,060
You know what he's like.
I bet he's after a favour.

260
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,960
You're a cheap date, I'll give you that.

261
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,590
What do you want, Danny? I'm on a case.

262
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,600
I saw Ellen last night.
I went to her house.

263
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
Didn't I make myself clear?

264
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,850
- I just thought...
- What?!

265
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
That I don't mean what I say?
That I don't know what I want?

266
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,620
MJ, please.

267
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,810
Please what? Say it's all right
for you to go behind my back?

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Someone had to get you
two together, all right?

269
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,150
She told me something you need to know.

270
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,330
Now, do you wanna hear it or not?

271
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,460
Facial recognition's come through.

272
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,640
And I've got another witness.

273
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,060
She phoned in to say she
saw Sam leave the cafe.

274
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,240
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,370
Go on. I'm riveted.

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,590
Well, she then mentioned Ryan Long.

277
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,100
That finance guy from earlier.

278
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,210
How could I forget?

279
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,100
So any way, Ryan follows Sam to
the car, tries to speak to him.

280
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,850
- But Sam just gets in.
- Trying to escape, no doubt.

281
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,380
Ryan holds the door open trying to talk to
him, but Sam drives off and leaves him there.

282
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,530
- I mean, doesn't that strike you as odd?
- No.

283
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,440
These finance guys are desperate.

284
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,960
Yaeh. But he never told
us they had a conversation.

285
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,750
I think it's worth talking to him again.

286
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,640
Well, can't you do it?

287
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,920
You're took the interview.
Don't think you should be...?

288
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,390
Amy, look!

289
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,060
I've just had a major breakthrough.
You see this guy. Lenny King.

290
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,760
He calls himself a businessman,
but he's a loan shark.

291
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,890
Yeah, maybe he is, but to
us, he's just a witness.

292
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,590
What with a criminal record for GBH?

293
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,920
He's coming in for a chat.

294
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,990
Jason, you're taking a statement,
remember? Not making an arrest.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes, Sarge.

296
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm sorry, MJ.

297
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,790
She didn't know she was
pregnant when she left.

298
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,470
It was just some boy she was seeing.

299
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,720
She phoned him to tell him,
but he didn't want to know.

300
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,130
I know it's a lot to take in.

301
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,510
It's the thought of her on her own.

302
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,470
Pregnant, frightened, no money.

303
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,320
Why couldn't she just come home?

304
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,160
Come on, don't blame yourself.

305
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,350
She couldn't, could she?

306
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,710
Not after I'd accused her of sleeping
with my husband. She couldn't come home.

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,600
She never mentioned any of that.

308
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,230
- I need to see her.
- You have to.

309
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
Do it. You know it's what you want.

310
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,420
- Wait in here.
- How long's this gonna take?

311
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,670
Till I'm satisfied with your answers.

312
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,590
Hi. You want to sit in?

313
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,990
I'll pass, thanks. Before you go in,

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,050
about this Ryan Long business.

315
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,670
His phone's switched off and the
address he gave us is nonexistent.

316
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,900
I tell you what,

317
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,750
you worry about little details,

318
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,210
I'll go deal with the bad guy.

319
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,410
All right, MJ?

320
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,690
What's up with her?

321
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah?

322
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,860
Is everything all right?

323
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,630
I agreed to you
investigating my sister

324
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,870
on condition that you would
call a halt when I said so.

325
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
- I'm sorry.
- For what it's worth,

326
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,090
Danny didn't shop you.

327
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,240
I figured out he could only have
got the address with your help.

328
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,510
I'm really disappointed in you, Amy.

329
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,250
You were one of the last people
to see him before he disappeared.

330
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
So?

331
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,580
So I wanna know everything
that was said at the meeting.

332
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,160
Could you remember everything
you said two days ago?

333
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,050
How do you know him?

334
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,830
- We had a business arrangement.
- What you've got a contract?

335
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,070
An understanding.

336
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,450
Don't try and be clever.

337
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,330
I've got witnesses in the cafe.

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,620
You were with Sam Winter
and you were leaning on him.

339
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,610
You've got no idea how
bad this is looking.

340
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,690
I don't give a toss how this looks.

341
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,590
So you've got no idea
what's happened to him?

342
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No.

343
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
I don't give a toss about that either.

344
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560
Even though he owes you money?

345
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,230
- He doesn't.
- What?

346
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,830
Owe me money.

347
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,390
- But you said...
- Yeah, he cleared it, didn't he?

348
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,150
What, all of it?

349
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I'll say.

350
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,360
Put that through me letterbox.

351
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,450
- When?
- Well, I dunno.

352
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,830
I wasn't at home, was I?

353
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,720
Well, where were you?

354
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,720
I left the cafe and I
went to a friend's house.

355
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,550
I've just been to have that valued.

356
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,770
That is the real deal.

357
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,970
- Can I go now?
- Hold on.

358
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,780
How do I know you didn't steal it
from his house or from Sam himself?

359
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,750
Where is it?
It's here somewhere.

360
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
There it is.

361
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,870
Well, don't you want it, then?

362
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,500
"This covers what I owe.

363
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,650
"Don't get in touch with
me again. Sam Winter."

364
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
I think that kinda changes
things a bit, dunnit?

365
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,880
It seems like Sam used the bracelet
to clear his debts with Lenny King.

366
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,310
Didn't want to leave
Gemma with too big a mess.

367
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,180
Which makes sense, I suppose.

368
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
We're off to Gemma's house.

369
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,650
See if we can get her
to ID this bracelet.

370
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,570
That witness, Ryan Long.

371
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,990
I found the hotel where his course was

372
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,180
and they're getting me his address.

373
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,600
- You still on about that?
- Well, you know what they say?

374
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,590
The devil is in the detail.
Even the little details.

375
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,090
Amy's right.

376
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,640
Everything's worth checking,
even the small things.

377
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,700
Just leave it on my desk
and I'll deal with it later.

378
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,370
You probably need to lie
down after all that hard work.

379
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Gemma?

380
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,760
Call an ambulance!

381
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Gemma!

382
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,570
Gemma, it's MJ. Can you hear me?

383
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,680
- Sarge. There's one here already.
- Blimey, that was quick.

384
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,490
I'll go with her. You
speak to the neighbours.

385
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,990
See if they saw anything.
Get on to the ambulance service.
See who called them in.

386
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,760
It's all right, Gemma. Ambulance
is here. You're gonna be OK.

387
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
You're a very difficult
man to get hold of.

388
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,070
Can I come inside?

389
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,780
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

390
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,300
They won't let me speak to her.

391
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,130
She's still sedated.

392
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,980
There's been some bleeding.

393
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,440
They're concerned for the baby.

394
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
How did you get on?

395
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,280
No witnesses, I'm afraid.

396
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,270
But I got the phone number
from the emergency services.

397
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Any lead?

398
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,260
The mobile was switched off. I
checked Sam's, but it wasn't him.

399
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,220
See if the phone's registered,
then go back to square one.

400
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,660
Re-examine everything, CCTV,
witness statements, everything.

401
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,560
Where's Amy? She
should be here for this.

402
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,950
- I don't know.
- Well, chase her up!

403
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,130
Well, where are you...

404
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
going?

405
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Hello.

406
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,750
Let me get this one settled.

407
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,690
How long have you been here?

408
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,380
About a year.

409
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,870
And you didn't think to call?

410
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
I didn't want to do this.

411
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,670
Danny told me what you'd been through.

412
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm sorry...

413
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,290
... for accusing you and Craig of...

414
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,270
So is that it?

415
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,770
You say sorry, then we hug?

416
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,460
You walked out on me, Ellen.

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,180
I didn't know where you were.

418
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,640
Didn't know if you was all
right, if you was alive even.

419
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,860
I was OK.

420
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,180
Don't you dare tell me you was OK!

421
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,230
Do you know how much you hurt me?

422
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,230
I said I'm sorry.

423
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,090
I'm not talking about Craig.

424
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,680
There's other stuff.

425
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Mum.

426
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,430
Do you remember you used to drive
me to school just after Mum died?

427
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Yeah.

428
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,050
I was sitting in the back
and I started to cry.

429
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,610
And I caught your eye
watching me in the mirror...

430
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,280
... but you looked away,
like you hadn't seen.

431
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Sarah.

433
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,940
Your witness has got it wrong. I've
told you everything that happened.

434
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,860
But, she said you tried to talk to him.

435
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,240
Then she made a mistake.

436
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,710
- If there's nothing else...
- There's one other thing.

437
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,780
Why did you give us the wrong address?

438
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,250
That's my brother's address.

439
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,410
I sent him a birthday card last week.

440
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,530
Well, if that's all?

441
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,820
I don't want to keep you
from anything.

442
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,530
What happened to your hand?

443
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,350
I had an accident.

444
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,860
- Accident?
- Yeah, why do you ask?

445
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,170
- I'm just concerned.
- Listen, what do you want?

446
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,690
I can't let you answer that.

447
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,450
It's OK. She's fine.

448
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,000
I thought it was the right thing.

449
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,810
I thought it best
just to try and get on.

450
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,880
- I was just trying to look after you.
- And you resented that, didn't ya?

451
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,910
I was worried about you.

452
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,690
I don't know you any more.

453
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,930
I'm fine now.

454
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,080
I've got Simon. I've got our baby.

455
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,020
Why would I need you?

456
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,490
- You're my sister.
- I'm really sorry, but

457
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,110
I don't know what that means any more.

458
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,910
I'd better go.

459
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,320
Oh, yes, I know why you're here.

460
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,340
Is his girlfriend all right?

461
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Gemma? You've done something to Gemma?

462
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,380
- It was an accident!
- I know nothing about it, I swear.

463
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,410
I went round to her house.
I had to speak with her.

464
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,160
I didn't expect her to
reacted way she did, just...

465
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,450
I just had to tell her the truth.

466
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,700
Just go in there!

467
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,440
Sit down. Sit!

468
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,460
This is a beautiful
picture. Is this your son?

469
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,660
Don't you touch that!

470
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,310
You can't leave here.

471
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,480
Look... that will be them.

472
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,480
They're looking for me.

473
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,030
They'll get suspicious if
I don't answer the phone.

474
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,600
Please, Ryan.

475
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,380
Why are you doing this?

476
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,360
He killed my son.

477
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,530
Amy, it's me again.
Where the hell are you?

478
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,910
Look, you wanna be getting back
here before the sarge gets in.

479
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,730
Just call me back.

480
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,440
She was getting an
address for Ryan Long.

481
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,130
My guess is, she went to see him.

482
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,570
There's no way.

483
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,750
I told her to leave it on my desk.

484
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,870
It's not here, so why
would she go on her own?

485
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,220
Maybe she thought she had
to prove something...to someone.

486
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,280
The phone that called the ambulance, it's
pay-as-you-go, so it's not registered.

487
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,920
Don't change the subject.

488
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,780
Phone Ryan Long.

489
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,960
You know, she probably needs saving.

490
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,890
Chances are he's trying to
sell her a top-up mortgage.

491
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Switched off.

492
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,290
Do I have to remind you that
Amy is not a police officer?

493
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
Hold on.

494
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Where is it?

495
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,680
Look at this.

496
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,000
That's the number that called 999.

497
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,560
And that's Ryan Long's.

498
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,890
They're exactly the same.

499
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,900
Run him through the databases.

500
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,040
Sam Winter's real name

501
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,050
is Alex Steel.

502
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,360
I recognised him straight off.

503
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,010
We were mates. We lived
on the same street.

504
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,270
Rory...

505
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,680
... he was four.

506
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,890
Saturday morning,

507
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,800
we go to the park to play.

508
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,480
I took my eye off him just for a second.

509
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,320
He just, um,

510
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,950
he just ran into the road.

511
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,610
I put Long's name into
the system and this came up.

512
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,940
He saw his son killed in an RTC.

513
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,550
Look who the driver was.

514
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,980
Sam's got a new identity.

515
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,800
He was convicted of causing death by dangerous
driving while under the influence of alcohol.

516
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,210
Been at a stag party the night
before. Pleaded guilty. Got four years.

517
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,770
This, a couple of years ago.

518
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,680
This is serious.

519
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,760
Amy's with Ryan. She
could be in trouble.

520
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,690
You get a trace on her phone.

521
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,280
Circulate the photos,
alert all units.

522
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,210
I'll speak to Gemma, see if she
knows anything about Ryan Long.

523
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,690
I'll call if I get a lead.

524
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,910
You've never heard of
Ryan Long before today?

525
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Not till...

526
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,110
... I told him I didn't
know where Sam was.

527
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,250
He wouldn't believe me and he
just kept on at me and then...

528
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,140
Then he starts ranting.

529
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,610
Calling him a murderer.

530
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,960
So I screamed
and he grabbed my arm

531
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,100
and he pushed me and I fell back.

532
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,890
We've got everyone out
looking for him.

533
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,100
You know, Sam was always nervous

534
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,800
about moving to Dover and, um,

535
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,220
now I know why.

536
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,820
Do you think he was
worried about our baby,

537
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,630
cos of what happened
to that poor little boy?

538
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,540
I think when he saw Ryan
in the cafe the other day,

539
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
he got scared.

540
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
He's scared!

541
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,370
I nearly lost my baby today.

542
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,350
Gemma, listen to me, please.

543
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,180
Sam needs you.

544
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,660
If he thinks you can forgive him,

545
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,170
I believe he'll come home.

546
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,620
You get some rest, yeah?

547
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,760
Sam, it's Detective Sergeant Croft.

548
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,920
Please, please get in touch.

549
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,750
Gemma knows your past and
she wants you to come home.

550
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,040
You're not in any
trouble with the police

551
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,650
and we promise we'll
protect you from Ryan Long.

552
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,490
- Have you heard anything from Amy?
- She'll be all right.

553
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Sorry.

554
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,480
- What about the phone trace?
- It'll be another 30 minutes.

555
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
I called Ryan on his old
address. His ex-wife lives there.

556
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
- Does she know where he is now?
- No idea.

557
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,900
She told me where he works.

558
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,400
I'm waiting for someone to call me.

559
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,840
You need to chase them up.

560
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
Could be them.

561
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,850
Missing Persons Unit.

562
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
It's Sam.

563
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,200
Sam, it's Detective Sergeant Croft.

564
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,470
<i>Tell Gemma I'm sorry.
</i>

565
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,200
<i>Tell her I'm coming home.</i>

566
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,730
- Sam, just tell us where you are and we'll...
- No!

567
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,540
<i>I'll come myself after...</i>

568
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,380
After what?

569
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,180
<i>'I'm being a coward. I've
always run away. I need to...'</i>

570
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,170
Sam. Sam, please.

571
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
<i>I need to face him.</i>

572
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Sam?

573
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Sam?

574
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,550
If he gets to Ryan before we do and
Amy gets caught in the crossfire...

575
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
Sam?

576
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,540
All right. Um...

577
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,250
It's Ryan's boss.

578
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
OK.

579
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,970
Open that drawer over there.

580
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,240
There's a letter in it. Go on.

581
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,750
I had a total breakdown.

582
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,090
- Lost my wife, my job...
- I'm really sorry...

583
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,540
I was just starting to
get my life back when...

584
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,760
He sends that letter. No!

585
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,340
Read it out.

586
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,680
"Dear, Ryan. This is Alex Steel.

587
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,990
"I hope it's OK me writing to you.

588
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,220
- "The thing is, I just got out of prison..."
- Out!

589
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,980
Should have got life!

590
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Go on.

591
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,890
"What I did to Rory, I'll never
be able to forgive myself for.

592
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,550
"He was a great little kid and I
just hope that you can understand..."

593
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
That day,

594
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,300
he's there in the cafe.

595
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,670
And I know he saw me because
he ran and I went after him.

596
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,770
And he's in his car
white as a sheet.

597
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,110
I told him that I would
find out where he was living

598
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,660
and I would hunt him down and I
would waste his life like he did mine.

599
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,380
And I would never ever stop!

600
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,670
I can't imagine
what you've been through.

601
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,670
It's exhausting.

602
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,150
You've already called them.

603
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,300
- You called the police!
- No! I didn't! Help!

604
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,620
Help! Let me go!

605
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,840
Please help! I'm in here.

606
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,020
<i>&lt; Ryan, it's me. It's Alex Steel.</i>

607
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,390
- What?
- Sorry. Sorry.

608
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,590
- Calm down.
- I'll calm down when I've got Amy out of there.

609
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,900
Oi, I said calm down!

610
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,910
The last thing I need
is some hot-headed,

611
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,290
macho cop throwing his
weight around, all right?

612
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
All right?

613
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,080
- Yes.
- Let's go.

614
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,870
All right, let me do the talking.

615
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,200
I don't want any of your macho stuff.

616
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Listen.

617
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Stand back.

618
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Amy!

619
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,620
All right?

620
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,180
Oh, MJ, thank God! Sam's
in there. Ryan's got him.

621
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,640
<i>You took everything away from me!</i>

622
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,470
<i>- Please, just listen.
- No, no!</i>

623
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
No!

624
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,180
You stay out of this. You stay back!

625
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,840
It's all right, Ryan. It's all right.

626
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,170
Listen to me. You can't do this. You can't.

627
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Stay back!

628
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,480
- Put it down.
- I can't.

629
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,050
Today, you left his wife on
the floor. She's pregnant, Ryan.

630
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,310
What?

631
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
You nearly killed an unborn child.

632
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,390
Is that what you are, Ryan?

633
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,180
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

634
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,110
He'd like to see you if
that's all right with you.

635
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,550
Yeah, of course.

636
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,530
Is the baby all right?

637
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,650
Strong heartbeat. No more bleeding.

638
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,460
I'm so sorry, Gemma, for everything.

639
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,470
Why couldn't you tell me?

640
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,030
I... I've made such a mess
of everything. All the debts.

641
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,240
Well, you should have told me.

642
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,500
I... I just wanted you to be happy.

643
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm so sorry.

644
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,630
Well, just promise me...

645
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,170
... you won't keep
anything from me again.

646
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I promise.

647
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
You OK?

648
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,240
I was pretty scared back there,
but I'm feeling better now.

649
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,420
What will happen to him?

650
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,340
He'll be facing charges.

651
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,660
Two for assault, one for
holding you against your will.

652
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,430
Poor man.

653
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,290
I feel sorry for him.

654
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,020
Well, at least he'll get
the support he needs.

655
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,910
If you want some time
off, then just ask.

656
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,360
You don't have to decide now,

657
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,220
but we will have to do
a debrief at some point.

658
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,130
I think today the devil
really was in the detail.

659
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Sorry.

660
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,550
Hey, we never got that drink.

661
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Are you free tonight?

662
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,380
Yeah, could be. But you're buying.

663
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,460
After today, I reckon you owe me one.

664
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,620
What, just the one?

665
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Don't push it.

666
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,190
MJ, fancy joining us?

667
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,630
No, you're all right. I promised
Danny I'd go on his show.

668
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,970
I'll see you in the morning.

669
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,880
- Good night.
- Night.

670
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,150
Oi, you two.

671
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,510
I don't want you in late tomorrow.

672
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,390
If you know what I mean.

673
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,510
No chance.

674
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,950
Things didn't work out.

675
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,240
- We won't be keeping in touch.
- I'm sorry.

676
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,420
No, I'm sorry.

677
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,290
I was a bit hard on you before.

678
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,100
You were just trying to do a nice thing.

679
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,520
So thank you.

680
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
We're on.

681
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,500
You're listening to Danny Hayworth.

682
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,700
Just to remind my listeners,

683
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,380
I'm here with DS Croft, who
is ready to take your calls.

684
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,340
Now, we have a caller.

685
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,780
I understand you would
prefer to remain anonymous.

686
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,490
<i>Yeah. But I would like
to speak to DS Croft.</i>

687
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,600
Hello, can I help you?

688
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,080
<i>I was recently reunited with
my sister after 12 years.</i>

689
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,160
And how did it go?

690
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
<i>Not well.</i>

691
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,780
That's often the way with first
meetings after long separations.

692
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,200
People have changed.

693
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,850
They can seem like strangers, becuase...

694
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,690
because they're not part of
each other's lives any more.

695
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,410
But if you give it time...

696
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,490
If you work at it,

697
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,480
it'll be worth it.

698
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,240
Does that make sense?

699
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,750
<i>It does. Yeah.</i>

700
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,420
I think you should give
your sister a second chance.

701
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,070
I hoped that's what you'd say.

702
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,430
Good luck, caller.

1
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,850
What's all this about moving from
the beaches, going to the caves?

2
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,770
Are you guys going to the caves?

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,400
They don't speak English, dude.

4
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,520
Oh. How about, are you going?

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,240
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm talking about the caves. Are
you gonna go to the caves?

7
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,540
Jack and that bald guy,
and, uh, what's-her-face,

8
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,330
they found some caves,
and they think

9
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,240
that actually we should move
from the beaches to the caves.

10
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,900
So, why shouldn't we?

11
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,500
Why sh...

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,470
Ok, A - number 1, moisture. Caves
are abounded with moisture.

13
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,580
Moisture breeds bacteria,
and attracts insects

14
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:18,020
that would lay eggs
in our mouths while we sleep.

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,850
I know that you don't understand me,

16
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,020
but if there is a vote
to go to the caves,

17
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,270
you two, you vote no!
Got it? No!

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Hey, shouting at them is not going
to make them understand any more.

19
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,315
Dude, if Jack says
it's a good idea,

20
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,800
maybe we should,
like, trust him.

21
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,000
Why? You tell me.
Because he's a doctor?

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,090
Is that what qualifies him
for a leadership here?

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,860
How do we know
he's not a mental case?

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,650
Let me tell you something.

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,590
The other day I'm in the jungle,
and I'm taking a leak,

26
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,630
and Jack runs through the jungle,
crying for his Daddy.

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,230
Ok, fine, fine, you morons, you want
to go to the caves, good riddance.

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm going to stay right here,
on the beach,

29
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,270
with all the people
who want to survive.

30
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,600
I'll, uh...

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,750
I'll see you guys at the caves.

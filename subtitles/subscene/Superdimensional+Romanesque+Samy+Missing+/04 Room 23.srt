1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,890
What's happening?

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,460
He did it again.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,500
Did what again?

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,800
You know.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,610
Well, you're gonna have to
tell him to stop doing it.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,590
I'm not going in there.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,080
Fine. Get Beatrice.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,320
She's not going in there either, Ben.
None of them will.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,840
They won't even bring him
food. They're all scared.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,900
Look, Ben, his father is
out there looking for him.

11
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,690
We could bring him back.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,540
No.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,280
This is your responsibility. You
were the one who wanted him here.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,080
Jacob wanted him here.
He's important. He's special.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,910
He's dangerous.

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,520
He's just a kid, Juliet. He's a child.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,330
He's just a child?

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,110
Come see.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,690
What kind of child does this?

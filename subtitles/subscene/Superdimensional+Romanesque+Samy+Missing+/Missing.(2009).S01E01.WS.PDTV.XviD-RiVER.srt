2011256258.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,040
2011256258.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,580
201125...

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,750
6258.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,740
2011256258.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Yep.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,200
Sorry, I'll have to call you back.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,780
Dover Missing Persons Unit.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,990
Sorry, DC Doyle's not
here at the moment.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,550
256258.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
2011256258.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,520
2011256258.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,750
Amy Garnett's phone.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
She should be in any minute.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,300
Yaeh, I will. Thank you.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,100
It's 20 past nine!

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,950
2011256258.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,980
2011256258.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,370
2011256258.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,410
2011256258.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,400
2011256258.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,490
- 2011...
- All right, son?

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,510
You OK there?

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,510
We'd better not go in
together. People might suspect.

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Wait a minute before you follow me.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Please tell me your name.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
Have you run away from home?

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Morning, Sarge.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,800
The officer will take
you to our interview room.

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,760
Would you like a drink?
Juice or something?

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Cheers.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,260
Where was he picked up?

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,780
Wandering along Kingsway.

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,760
He won't, or can't, tell
us his name and address.

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,770
Can't?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,820
Hasn't said anything apart
from a sequence of numbers.

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,160
Drugs? Shock?

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't know.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,360
Someone's looking for him.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,840
Let's find out who he
is and get him home.

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,720
- Sorry I'm late...
- I'm really not interested, Amy.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,440
You clock in on time
like the rest of us.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
That applies to you, too, DC Doyle.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,680
I want you to take MPU as
seriously as you did Vice.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
You never know.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
You might learn something.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Bring Amy up to speed. I want to
find out who that young man is.

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,880
We need to find out where you
live so we can take you home.

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Can we take a look in your bag?

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,400
Won't your family be worried?

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Is there someone we could contact?

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,840
There's nothing, apart
from this key ring.

53
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
AT, these your initials?

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
Alan?

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Andrew?

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,800
Alex?

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
Can I take a look at your book?

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,560
Wow. These are great.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
I checked the PNC. No-one matching
his description is missing.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Anthony Taylor.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Is that your name?

62
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll go through the electoral roll.

63
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
Have you run away from home?

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Don't worry. We'll soon
find out where you're from

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,480
and get you back safely.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Oh, MJ, I did some research on
the symptoms that Jason described.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Difficulty communicating,
verbal repetition.

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360
He could have a form of autism.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll make some calls,
get some expert advice.

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
- You contact the LEA and social services.
- Will do.

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,920
Jase, when you're finished here,
fire escape. Bit of privacy.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,880
No record at all of an Anthony Taylor?

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,000
Right.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,760
Would you expect to have details
of everyone in the area with autism?

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
OK.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
All right. Thank you. Bye bye.

77
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
Mary Jane!

78
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,410
How's my favourite detective
sergeant in the whole wide world?

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,220
How did you get past front desk?

80
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,990
With a friendly smile.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,470
It's meant to be authorised people only.

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,020
They all know me.

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,330
Dover Radio mug!

84
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,360
It's a freebie just for you, and
I've got mouse mats and pens as well.

85
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,870
What are you after, Danny?

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
Well, it suddenly struck me

87
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,500
that you would be the perfect
person for my show tonight.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,310
Your guest has dropped out.

89
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,320
Well, it's a blessing in disguise.

90
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,950
You'll be fantastic.

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,790
I'm not going on the radio.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,150
And I certainly can't be
bribed with a...free mug.

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,670
- But it's my first show.
- No!

94
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,910
I thought you were happy
being a crime journalist.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,200
What does Liz think about
you packing it all in?

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,190
She thinks it's a great idea.

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
She hopes I'll spend less
time drinking with coppers.

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,810
Probably just trying to humour
you through your mid-life crisis.

99
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,440
After the favours I've
done you over the years!

100
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,750
You've had your fair
share of exclusives.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm not going on your show.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,050
We've known each other a long time, MJ.

103
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,320
Yes, too long, Danny. Out you go.

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Out you go. Bye.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,040
Look, um... Last night.

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,700
Don't get me wrong, it was...nice.

107
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,970
- Yeah?
- Probably. I mean,

108
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,300
we were really, really drunk.

109
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,290
Anyway, it was just a one-off. Right?

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,270
Um... OK.

111
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,230
- From now on, we're just good colleagues.
- Yeah. It's no problem.

112
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,640
- No need for any awkwardness.
- No!

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,650
- Right, I'll see you...
- Inside.

114
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah.

115
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,920
- OK.
- Yeah, it's cool.

116
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
It's cool.

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
OK.

118
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Thanks.

119
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,760
Bye.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,590
Any luck?

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,430
Broughton High School had a
pupil called Anthony Taylor

122
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
up until four years ago.

123
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,510
He was withdrawn by his mother, a
Sandra Taylor, to be taught at home.

124
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,100
Kent Autistic Family Support don't
have an Anthony Taylor on their books.

125
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,890
You found anything?

126
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,730
I have an Anthony Taylor and a
Sandra Taylor at 45 Bankshire Road.

127
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,810
There's a phone number.

128
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,090
Bankshire Road?

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,840
That's only five minutes' walk
from where Anthony was picked up.

130
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,960
It's looking likely, then.

131
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,240
Answer machine.

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,150
She's probably out looking for him.

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,930
Hi, this is Amy Garnett at...

134
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,080
Want me to go over?

135
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,510
I'll see if the neighbours
have Sandra's mobile.

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,160
No. No, I'll take it.

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
Are you OK?

138
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,510
Something's happened to my fiance,
Etienne. I don't know where he is.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,170
- What's your name?
- Jan. Jan Morgan.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
OK, Jan.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,640
DC Doyle will take the
details. Through there, please.

142
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,360
Amy, I want you to sit
in on this interview.

143
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,320
Bit of female support?

144
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,840
No, I think Jason is fully in
touch with his feminine side.

145
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,230
Your fiance's full
name is Etienne George?

146
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,830
He's from St Lucia.

147
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,630
We should be on a flight
on our way over there now.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,630
He was to pick me up hours
ago, but he didn't.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,620
You've missed your flight?

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,350
I've tried calling him but
there's no answer on his mobile.

151
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,100
When did you last speak to him?

152
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,540
- Last night.
- How did he sound?

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,830
A bit stressed.

154
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,030
He still had things to sort out.

155
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,800
Have you checked at Etienne's place?

156
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,980
We've both given up our
flats to move to St Lucia.

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
So he's been staying with a
friend, but he's not there.

158
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,800
We're getting married next week.

159
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
Come on.

160
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,590
Look, I can't leave
you here on your own.

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Please?

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,520
This is your house, isn't it?

163
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,560
OK. You stay there, right?

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,520
We met at work. I'd
been there for ten years.

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,840
Spent nine of them
thinking about leaving.

166
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Boring office work.

167
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,360
Then Etienne started. He
was on the reception desk.

168
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,510
I didn't know what to
say to him at first,

169
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,480
but eventually he plucked up courage.

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,580
Never have much luck, you see.

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Tend to get a bit carried away,

172
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,820
thinking I've met the one, only

173
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,800
only to find they're not
really into me in the same way.

174
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,460
Etienne's different.

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,700
So lovely.

176
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,050
When I got made redundant,
we thought "Let's do it.

177
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,900
Let's move to St Lucia."

178
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,210
Everyone says it's so
beautiful out there.

179
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,450
Do you have any photos of him?

180
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,920
Yeah.

181
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,880
Here's one taken at my leaving party.

182
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
Hates his photo being taken.

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,920
He's very good looking.

184
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,200
Yes.

185
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,600
Hello?

186
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,000
Anyone at home?

187
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
Sandra?

188
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,380
Has he got any friends
or relatives over here?

189
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,560
I've spoken to all his friends,
but no-one's heard from him.

190
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,190
All of his family live in St Lucia.

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,920
We're staying with them
until our house is finished.

192
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,520
- You're having a new house built?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,360
Things are so much cheaper
out there, Etienne said.

194
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,930
We put a deposit down.

195
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
It should be ready after the wedding.

196
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Look.

197
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,470
Etienne's cousin's a property developer.

198
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,270
Can I borrow this,

199
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,340
to check if Etienne's
cousin has heard from him?

200
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Sure.

201
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,160
Got your flight number?

202
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah, somewhere.

203
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,080
Why?

204
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,810
We need to check Etienne
wasn't on the plane.

205
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,160
He wouldn't have left without me.

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,720
We need to check everything.

207
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Cheers.

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Please.

209
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,560
Help me find him.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,200
We'll do our best.

211
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,940
For goodness' sake, Anthony! You
nearly gave me a heart attack.

212
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,040
Do you know what happened here?

213
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,800
2011256258.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,520
2011...

215
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,750
Anthony, where's your mum?

216
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,980
Have the numbers got
something to do with your mum?

217
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,840
2011256258.

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Jason?

219
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,460
Sandra's left her mobile phone
and her keys in the house.

220
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,910
Either she left in a hurry,
or something's happened to her.

221
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,900
Our missing person isn't Anthony.

222
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,510
It's his mum, Sandra.

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,590
I called the airport.

224
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,100
Etienne wasn't on the flight.

225
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,240
See! I told you he
wouldn't go without me.

226
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,200
There were no flights
booked in your names.

227
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,440
You must have made a mistake.

228
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,790
We went to the travel agents together.

229
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,300
I called them too.

230
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,040
Etienne went and
cancelled. He got a refund.

231
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,300
They must have misunderstood.

232
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,480
We were meant to be leaving today.

233
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,130
His relatives are expecting us.

234
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,340
We were going to see the
new house for the first time.

235
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,230
How did you pay the house deposit?

236
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
That was me. I had my
redundancy, didn't I?

237
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,130
I gave the money to Etienne and
he sorted it with his cousin.

238
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,920
Do you mind me asking how much it was?

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,590
Four thousand pounds.

240
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,710
Can you give us a second?

241
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,350
You know the expression love is blind.

242
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,470
Seems he cleared her back account.

243
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,060
He cancelled the flights.
Why isn't she suspicious?

244
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,580
We need to check out his cousin.
He might shed some light on it.

245
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,800
Yeah, I'll look into it.

246
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,960
Good call asking about the
deposit. I was gonna do that.

247
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
Yeah, but I beat you to it.

248
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,070
We need to search the surrounding areas.

249
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,560
Go door to door, talk to neighbours,

250
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,490
see if they've seen or heard anything.

251
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,950
We're now treating Sandra
Taylor as a missing person.

252
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,720
I want her located urgently.

253
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
OK.

254
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,640
Cheers.

255
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,200
Is this your mum and dad, Anthony?

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you know where your dad lives?

257
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,500
Don't worry. We'll find him.

258
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,390
St Lucian Land Registry have
no record of the development.

259
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,870
The plot of land doesn't exist.

260
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
What about Etienne's cousin?

261
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,650
They've never heard
of him, or his company.

262
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,890
But you saw the brochure!

263
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,340
There'll be an explanation.

264
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,390
Apart from the money you
lent him for the deposit,

265
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
- was there anything else?
- Yeah.

266
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,690
I gave him 3,500 pounds to
get the rings and a suit,

267
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
something nice for the wedding day.

268
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,140
But I saw them!

269
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,320
He couldn't resist.

270
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,150
I told him I wanted it to be a surprise,

271
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,830
but Etienne was so excited
he showed them to me.

272
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,430
- Even put the suit on.
- Where did he buy them?

273
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,030
The suit came from that
department store in town.

274
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,110
He said he got the rings from
one of those jewellers nearby.

275
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,270
But it was all my idea. I
forced him to take the money.

276
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,870
He was embarrassed. We just
wanted to do things right.

277
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,770
I understand what you're thinking,
but Etienne wouldn't do that!

278
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,590
Don't worry.

279
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,260
We'll keep looking.

280
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Thank you.

281
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,200
How are you doing with Jan?

282
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,270
She's a bit calmer now.

283
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't think we'll get the
romantic ending she hopes for.

284
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,830
Sounds intriguing.

285
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
It's all in hand, MJ.

286
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,190
I'm assuming this is
Anthony's father and Sandra.

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,950
According to marriage
records, he's Edward Taylor.

288
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,790
They got married in 88, divorced
three years ago. Track him down.

289
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,430
And Anthony kept
repeating these numbers.

290
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,300
It's not a phone number.

291
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,370
Bank account or computer password?

292
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,700
Maybe he plays bingo!

293
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,290
Your jokes are as bad
as your timekeeping.

294
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,750
See what you can come up with.

295
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,150
We've got an Edward Taylor
in for assault four years ago.

296
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,150
He was fined and bound
over to keep the peace.

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,260
Same date of birth.

298
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,440
- Got an address?
- Yeah.

299
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,700
Go and see him.

300
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Morning.

301
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,600
DC Jason Doyle, Dover
Missing Persons Unit.

302
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,180
- I'm looking for an Edward Taylor.
- I didn't even know I was missing!

303
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,450
- Are you Edward Taylor?
- Yeah.

304
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,180
Sorry, couldn't resist. Eddie.

305
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,240
Are you related to Anthony
Taylor of 45 Bankshire Road?

306
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,700
Yeah, he's my son. Is everything OK?

307
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,620
He was found on his own
earlier this morning.

308
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,150
Can I ask if your son's
autistic, Mr. Taylor?

309
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,050
He is. Where was his mum?

310
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,630
We're trying to locate
her. We hoped you'd help.

311
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,520
It's over a year since I've seen them.

312
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,890
We'd like you to come to the station.

313
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,460
We need to find out what's happened.

314
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,390
Sorry, I've got a two-month-old
baby and a business to run.

315
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
Anthony's on his own there.

316
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,450
Look, Sandra made it clear

317
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,140
that she and Anthony wanted
nothing more to do with me.

318
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,150
Why's that?

319
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,540
I've got a baby to see to. Sorry
I couldn't be of any more help.

320
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,240
Your son needs you.

321
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,020
Sandra would never
leave Anthony on his own.

322
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,750
- He'll have wandered off. She'll be looking for him.
- I don't think so.

323
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,660
You really need to come with
me to the station, Mr Taylor.

324
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Now.

325
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,800
I have to make sure Karen
and Daisy are OK first.

326
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Not now, Danny.

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,170
If there is one thing I learned

328
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,390
in all my years of reporting
crime, it's persistence.

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,110
I think I said no.

330
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,580
<i>You'll regret it if you don't!</i>

331
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,550
Look, It's great PR for
the Missing Persons Unit.

332
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,440
- You sound desperate.
- No!

333
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,950
- Of course not.
- Get someone else, then. Bye.

334
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,520
No, don't go. Don't go.

335
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,710
OK. I'm desperate.

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,990
<i>You didn't ask me first.</i>

337
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,680
Now you ask me because you
want to get out of a hole.

338
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,300
- You'll make me suffer for this.
- Of course.

339
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Please?

340
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,990
I promised my producer I'd
get someone for the show,

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,490
and it's not looking good. Come on, MJ.

342
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,240
OK, what time?

343
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,660
Oh, fantastic!

344
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,580
Well, get there about 8 o'clock
and I'll show you the ropes.

345
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,650
Don't worry. You'll be
brilliant. The public'll love you.

346
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Hello?

347
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,630
How are you getting on with
Anthony and those numbers?

348
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,250
I've ruled out phone
numbers and bus numbers,

349
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,050
but to be honest,
they could be anything.

350
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,580
OK, well, stay on it.

351
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,000
According to the Inland Revenue,
Sandra was self-employed.

352
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,440
She sold jewellery online.

353
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,300
- That throw up any contacts?
- No.

354
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,930
The company that suppliers the material
haven't spoken to her in months.

355
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,750
Ok, get uniform at the house.

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,540
Get her bank and credit card statements.

357
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,380
Find out how the business is doing.

358
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
Any news on Etienne yet?

359
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,700
We're still chasing a few angles and

360
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,680
waiting for St Lucia police to reply.

361
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Excellent.

362
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Hello, son.

363
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,640
What's happening, eh?

364
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Where's your mum?

365
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Anthony!

366
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,500
Thanks for coming in, Mr Taylor.

367
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,890
Anthony, why don't you do your
colouring while we talk to your dad?

368
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,990
I've never seen him so withdrawn.

369
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,990
What do you think could have upset him?

370
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
Breaking his usual routine.

371
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Being apart from Sandra.

372
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,020
Has it been hard for you,

373
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,940
being excluded from his life?

374
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,460
- What's that got to do with anything?
- You must be bitter...

375
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,310
- and angry.
- Jason!

376
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,780
When was the last time you saw Sandra?

377
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,060
More than a year ago.

378
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,460
And you've no knowledge of
who would smash up her house?

379
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,470
What?

380
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,680
November 2004, you admitted a
charge of actual bodily harm.

381
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,160
I gave a loudmouth a slap for
taking the mickey out of Anthony, ok.

382
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,000
I've been at home with
Karen and Daisy all morning.

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,810
Instead of having a go at me,
you should look for Sandra!

384
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,500
If you could just wait a sec.

385
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,140
A word, please.

386
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,180
Jason, in this department,

387
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,310
we deal with people whose friends
and loved ones are missing.

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,860
They are not suspects.

389
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,200
He's her ex, and he's got
a previous for violence.

390
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,430
It was worth a go. No, it wasn't!

391
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,880
You need to brush up
on your people skills.

392
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,110
That's why you were transferred
here in the first place.

393
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Someone get their wrists slapped?

394
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,110
Don't worry about it. Get a
bite to eat. It'll be fine.

395
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,960
- I'm not really doing food.
- What?

396
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
You're not hungover?

397
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
Canteen cappuccino. Works every time.

398
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,880
DC Doyle gets a bit carried
away at times, but he means well.

399
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
We need all the help we
can get finding Sandra.

400
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,270
What can I do?

401
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,690
Tell me all about her.

402
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,740
How long were you together?

403
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
Since we were kids, really.

404
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,240
She was my first serious girlfriend.

405
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,200
What happened?

406
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,100
Grew apart, like lots of couples.

407
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,560
I'm sure you were both
under a lot of pressure,

408
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,190
bringing up Anthony.

409
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,080
She... We decided to treat his
autism as a manageable condition.

410
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,280
That's easy to say with
a young boy, isn't it?

411
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,970
Sandra was determined we could care

412
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,120
for Anthony without
outside help, but I disagreed.

413
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,420
Was it hard, leaving your son?

414
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,480
We decided it would be best
for me not to be involved.

415
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,740
You don't sound too sure.

416
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,560
I love my son.

417
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,110
Having a kid with a disability...

418
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,050
changes everything.

419
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,740
I don't see what any of this
has to do with finding Sandra.

420
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,080
Everything helps. Believe me.

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,030
The only thing that Anthony
has said since we found him

422
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,330
is a series of numbers
he keeps repeating.

423
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,880
Any idea what they could mean?

424
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,180
He's been obsessed with
numbers since he was a baby.

425
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,500
One year it would be train timetables,
the next year, flight numbers...

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,170
2011256258.

427
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Sorry.

428
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,650
What do these numbers mean, Anthony?

429
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Have they got anything
to do with your mum?

430
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,200
Have you hurt yourself, Anthony?

431
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,130
I just want to check that you're OK.

432
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,460
No! Anthony!

433
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,910
No one's going to hurt you, Anthony.

434
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,870
I just want to check you're OK.

435
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
Anthony! Look, no, leave.

436
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
There's nothing wrong, all
right? Everyone's going.

437
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,200
He...he just gets a little upset
if there's a lot of people around.

438
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,880
Leave him alone. He'll
calm down in a few minutes.

439
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,720
OK.

440
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,710
He's always had a temper.

441
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,940
Just got worse as he grew older.

442
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,920
Our GP said there was medication
we could give him to keep him calm.

443
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,970
Sandra was furious. Said I wanted
to turn him into a vegetable.

444
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,430
I think we've got to assume that
Anthony caused the damage at the house.

445
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,670
There's no sign of forced entry.

446
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,220
Anthony's bruised.

447
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,670
- Legenda não traduzida -

448
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,520
Is he capable of harming Sandra?

449
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,200
Doesn't know his own strength.

450
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,990
20...11...256258.

451
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,360
2011...256258.

452
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,590
2011256...25...8.

453
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,810
This is starting to look more
serious than just a missing person.

454
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,720
What'll happen to Anthony?

455
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,330
Let's just try and find Sandra first.

456
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,750
I might need to talk to CID,

457
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,910
but I don't want to
jump to any conclusions.

458
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,110
From the St Lucia police.

459
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,360
What do you reckon?

460
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,110
- Are you OK after Anthony?
- I'm fine.

461
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,450
What have you got there?

462
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,150
Two property scams. Slightly
different MO to our Etienne.

463
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,890
Two couples bought holiday homes
over there that didn't exist,

464
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,910
but the company involved
had exactly the same

465
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,010
PO box number as the
one in Jan's brochures.

466
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,400
Got any other leads?

467
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,450
Jan lent him money to buy wedding rings.

468
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,050
Amy's been looking into it.

469
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,210
Good teamwork.

470
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,350
Yeah. She's a fast learner.

471
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,300
And it normally takes me
so long to pick things up!

472
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Really good teamwork!

473
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm sorry. That came
out wrong. It was...

474
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,760
How's that hangover of yours?

475
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,300
Well, I thought it was getting better.

476
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,670
He's had about 15 minutes. He'll
probably be a bit calmer now.

477
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,030
He can take as long as he likes.

478
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,080
Might be good to check
in on him, serious.

479
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,560
Whatever you need to do.

480
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,880
Thank you. For being so understanding.

481
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,950
Sandra's bank card was used
in the chemists 20 minutes ago.

482
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,070
Medistores chemist.

483
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,800
It's at the very end of the High Street.

484
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,710
Get over there with a photo
of Sandra. Ask for witnesses,

485
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,480
any indication of her state of
mind or where she was heading.

486
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,130
I've been going through
Sandra's bank statements,

487
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,240
and business isn't exactly booming.

488
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,000
Credit crunch.

489
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,880
Her personal account's
not much better either.

490
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,400
Her overdraft is maxed.

491
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,630
So on top of everything else, the poor
woman's up to her eyeballs in debt.

492
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,790
Where's Anthony? He's
not in the interview room!

493
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,150
It's my fault. I told you to leave him.

494
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,080
- He can't have got far.
- He's not been out through reception.

495
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,120
Fire escape.

496
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,870
This is all we need.

497
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,480
We've got all units
out looking for Anthony.

498
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,220
We've circulated the description,
we should pick him up soon.

499
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,740
I shouldn't have left him.

500
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,240
Anthony is clearly distressed.
It wasn't your fault.

501
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,080
I never make the right decisions.

502
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,950
- Any idea where he may have gone?
- He'd normally be with his mum.

503
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,170
Look, can I...step out
and get some fresh air?

504
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,720
As soon as I hear anything...

505
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,130
Thanks.

506
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I had a call from Jason.
He's at the chemist.

507
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,450
Sandra bought a packet
of paracetamol and

508
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,900
then tried to buy three
more, but they refused her.

509
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,670
- She apparently looked distressed.
- That doesn't sound good.

510
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,350
I'll make some calls, see if
she's tried other chemists.

511
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,760
If she's that desperate,
she'll try and get more.

512
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
2011256258.

513
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,880
2011256258.

514
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,260
- Anthony.
- 2011256258.

515
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,110
- 201125...
- Anthony.

516
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,250
You need to come with me, Anthony.

517
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,350
- 2011256258.
- Come on.

518
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,580
Let me take you back to your dad.

519
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,980
You OK, son?

520
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,100
I was really worried about you.

521
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,090
Anything on Sandra?

522
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,710
Not yet.

523
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,990
I just left the chemist.

524
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,290
He wasn't that far from where
we picked him up this morning.

525
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,300
- I think he knows where she is.
- Why's that?

526
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
It can't be a coincidence.

527
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,300
We now know Sandra
was on the High Street,

528
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,440
and now Anthony was on the same route.

529
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,550
I think you're on to something.

530
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,010
And the numbers he's repeating
definitely means something.

531
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,930
I've got patrols on alert. I'll
check if she's bought more tablets.

532
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,050
I spoke to the jewellers. The assistant say that

533
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,800
Etienne returned the
wedding rings this morning.

534
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,230
Any idea where he went?

535
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,900
No, but we've the opportunity
to catch him red-handed.

536
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,510
Aparently he's got to go back there
at 5.30 to get the money off the owner.

537
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,920
The assistant can't give refunds.

538
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,840
Brilliant.

539
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,950
Do we tell Jan?

540
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,040
No, we need to be careful.

541
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,080
If he's a no-show at 5.30, we don't
want to have made any promises.

542
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,280
But she's downstairs.

543
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,780
We let her know we've
got a promising lead,

544
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,100
but the rest, we leave till after 5.30.

545
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,720
Someone matching Sandra's
description just bought

546
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,300
two packets of paracetamol
at a chemist's 20 minutes ago.

547
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,570
Where's the latest shop?

548
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,930
Vale Road, not far from town.

549
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,310
- What road was he found on this morning?
- Kingsway.

550
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,280
What number?

551
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,080
B2011.

552
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,640
Road numbers.

553
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,180
And I found him again on the A256.

554
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,260
Which leads to the A258.

555
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,350
She could be heading that
way. Route out of town.

556
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,180
The Heritage Coast
Trail runs along there.

557
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,790
Sandra was packing a picnic.

558
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,220
Make a list of all the
picnic spots around there.

559
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,870
Get patrols to check them
out. I'm gonna head over there.

560
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,610
She's on the Heritage Coastal
Trail, just past the visitor centre.

561
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,360
She looks OK. But send an
ambulance, just in case.

562
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,760
Sandra?

563
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
I'm DS Croft.

564
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,430
Dover Missing Persons Unit.

565
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,770
We've been looking for you.

566
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,710
Anthony's really worried.

567
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,840
- Is he OK?
- He's fine.

568
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,370
I've made such a mess of things.

569
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
It's OK.

570
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,680
I've really let him down.

571
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,930
What happened?

572
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,380
I got him the wrong colouring book.

573
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,230
He...he got into one of his tempers.

574
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,960
I told him to calm down,
or we wouldn't go out.

575
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
He slammed the bathroom door shut.

576
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,820
He didn't know I was right behind him.

577
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,150
We saw the blood.

578
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,240
He was so angry.

579
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,100
I was screaming at him,

580
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,640
threatening to go without
him just...just to punish him.

581
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,100
It was so silly.

582
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,130
Going on a picnic when...
when I've got all these debts.

583
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,210
You've had a really tough time.

584
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,410
Anthony doesn't mean
to be such a handful,

585
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
but...it's just so relentless.

586
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,250
Anthony's at the station with Eddie.

587
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,530
I genuinely think he wants
to help out, and financially.

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,880
Well, he's gonna have to now.

589
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Sandra?

590
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,580
Sandra, have you taken any tablets?

591
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Sandra!

592
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,100
Sandra, come on.

593
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,650
How many have you taken?
Sandra, tell me, please!

594
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,410
Yeah, that's him.

595
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Etienne?

596
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,370
I'm DC Jason Doyle. I'm with
the Dover Missing Persons Unit.

597
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,990
Jan Morgan asked us to find you.

598
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,880
The police?

599
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,310
It's my fault. Please, I'm so sorry.

600
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,840
Where's the money, Etienne?

601
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,060
That's all there is.

602
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,080
I told them to make it out to her.

603
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,220
I'm going to get the
money back on the suit.

604
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,240
The least I can do is get
her back her 3,500 pounds.

605
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,490
What about the 4,000 pounds?

606
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,850
My cousin took it.

607
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,590
He said trust him.

608
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,730
I persuaded Jan.

609
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
I love her.

610
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,770
- Am I going to be arrested?
- No.

611
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,850
But I think you need to
explain to Jan what happened.

612
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,430
You owe her that more than any money.

613
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,300
- Thanks, Doctor.
- No problem.

614
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,440
They managed to pump her stomach
in time, but it was close.

615
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,520
- They're keeping her in.
- How's Anthony?

616
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,170
He's calm now.

617
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,610
If Sandra agrees, he can
come home with us tonight.

618
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,480
Of course.

619
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,300
- How are you feeling?
- Not great.

620
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,080
I had no idea things had got so bad.

621
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,990
I tried too hard.

622
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,950
Thought it was for the best.

623
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,010
You were right.

624
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,550
I couldn't cope. You're not to
blame. I struggle with Anthony.

625
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,910
What else could you do?

626
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm sorry.

627
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,370
Please, I...I want to
make it up to you both.

628
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,320
She's in here.

629
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,780
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

630
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,000
- I trusted you.
- I know.

631
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,560
Why, Etienne?

632
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,650
I sent the money to my
cousin, but he lied to us both.

633
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,680
- He'd taken it all.
- Why didn't you tell me?

634
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,140
I wanted it to be perfect.

635
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,060
I never thought this would happen.

636
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,860
You agreeing to marry me,
move to St Lucia, everything.

637
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,100
I didn't even think you would go
for a drink with me, let alone...

638
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,380
I've messed it all up.

639
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,160
- No.
- I didn't know what to do.

640
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,450
I took the money for the
flight and hired a solicitor,

641
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,800
and he confirmed what I already knew.

642
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,660
He said I should go to the police.

643
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,070
It is my fault.

644
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,300
I let you down.

645
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,450
You shouldn't have run, Etienne.

646
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
I am so sorry.

647
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,440
You should have trusted me.

648
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,910
Not gonna take a punt on this one,
but I reckon the wedding's still on.

649
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,280
I knew there was a reason
you were a detective.

650
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,750
Very funny.

651
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,750
Certainly used to be.

652
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,450
It may not be Vice, but it still
feels like a good day's work.

653
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,260
- Thank you.
- Both of you.

654
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,020
It's our pleasure.

655
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,390
You fancy a drink? Just
good colleagues and all that?

656
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,800
Sorry, Jase.

657
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,910
It's probably best we give it a
miss, you know? Maybe another night.

658
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,510
Yeah. No problem. I understand.

659
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,110
I can't tonight anyway.

660
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,300
MJ's just called.

661
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,100
She's ordered me to take part
in this radio show she's doing.

662
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,260
She thinks they'll be interested
in all my techie palaver.

663
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,050
Sounds like she wants some support.

664
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,610
Probably. She's really nervous.

665
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,580
I've always wanted to go
on the radio. Can't wait!

666
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,290
So, after you've successfully reunited

667
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,000
a missing person with their loved ones,

668
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,080
does your department have any
more involvement with the family?

669
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,810
No. We're just charged with
locating the missing person.

670
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,360
However, there are support
groups and charities

671
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,760
we can refer people
to if they need help.

672
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,710
What if the person who you found

673
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,140
doesn't want any contact
with their friends and family?

674
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,780
If they're an adult,
there's nothing we can do.

675
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,480
We can let them know that they're
being looked for, and then we can

676
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,250
let the person who reported them
missing know that they're OK.

677
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,110
Thank you, DS Croft.

678
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,350
After the break, we'll be straight
back with your calls. So, tell us.

679
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,240
Have you got any questions on
what the Missing Persons Unit do?

680
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,460
Or perhaps you'd like to find out more about the
technical side of the investigations from Amy.

681
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,190
Or perhaps there's somebody you'd
like to find, and you need some advice.

682
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,520
We'll be right back with your calls.

683
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,310
How many callers have we got?

684
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,440
<i>None.</i>

685
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Great!

686
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,830
Well, hopefully they'll
start phoning in soon.

687
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,800
You were brilliant.

688
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,890
Maybe we should swap!

689
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,890
Going back on air.

690
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,950
It looks as though all you folks
are still watching the match!

691
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,410
So, Amy, how big a part do computers
play in these investigations?

692
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,480
Well, there's the ANPR,

693
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,800
which is the automatic
number plate reader.

694
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,350
And the AVLS,

695
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,430
which is the automatic
vehicle location system.

696
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,080
Er, and there's, um...

697
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,540
DS Croft, um...

698
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,430
..I know that you've got some personal
experience regarding a missing person yourself.

699
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm not sure the listeners
are interested in any of that.

700
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,020
Well, it's a fascinating story,

701
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,700
the head of the Missing Persons
Unit with a missing relative herself.

702
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,350
My sister ran away a few years ago.

703
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,490
She was missing for a while, yeah.

704
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,610
It must have given you a hidden insight

705
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,040
into the emotions of those left behind.

706
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,300
No, not really.

707
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,840
I like to keep my personal life

708
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,580
and my work life totally separate.

709
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,410
But surely you can empathise more,

710
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,150
having been through it yourself?

711
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,420
I suppose so.

712
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,600
- Your sister...
- Ellen.

713
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,880
She was very young
when she ran away, 17?

714
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,550
We lost our mother when she was
young and I looked after her.

715
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,230
So she just went missing
and she went abroad?

716
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,460
I didn't know that at the time.

717
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,550
I tracked her to France.

718
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,420
But you spent the better part
of a year searching for her.

719
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,330
All that uncertainty
must have been hard.

720
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Very.

721
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,080
Could you tell us why Ellen ran away?

722
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,750
I know it's hard.

723
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,110
Ellen was living in a
squat and it burnt down.

724
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,690
She was...presumed dead, is that right?

725
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,960
They told me she died in a fire, yes.

726
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,510
Thank you, DS Croft.

727
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,750
I know it couldn't have
been easy talking about it.

728
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,300
But hopefully, your honesty
will inspire my listeners

729
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,680
to be brave about their own experiences.

730
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,280
What the hell do you
think you're doing!?

731
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm sorry, MJ. I didn't know
what to ask. It just came out.

732
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,580
- It was emotional. It was brilliant.
- You had no right, Danny!

733
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,800
But it worked, MJ!

734
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,020
It could help somebody.

735
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,420
My personal life's not entertainment!

736
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Maybe I pushed it a bit too far,

737
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,010
but I think you're over-reacting.

738
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,670
You're out of order, Danny.

739
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,110
MJ, look, I'm sorry!

740
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
MJ!

1
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm fine, I'm really fine.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,590
I just... I need to clean up
before everyone gets here.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,240
Thank you.

4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,560
- It's him, isn't it?
- What? Who?

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,910
Ben. Did you invite him today?

6
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,700
Things have gotten awkward.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,990
Finally told you how he felt, huh?

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,490
He didn't... He didn't say anything,
it's just...

9
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,380
complicated.

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,540
Ok?

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,890
Complicated doesn't make you cry.

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,260
I burned my hand.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,320
That doesn't make you cry either.

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,430
What happened, Julie?

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,740
I think...

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,830
I think we're in big trouble.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,060
Are we?

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,600
I need to...

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,300
If I show you something,

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,600
do you promise not to tell anyone?

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,680
Do you swear?

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,500
Not anyone.

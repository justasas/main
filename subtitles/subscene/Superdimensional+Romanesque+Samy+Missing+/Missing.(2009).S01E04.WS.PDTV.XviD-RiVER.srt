1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,960
Mummy!

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Mummy!

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
Mummy!

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,980
Mummy! Mummy!

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,990
Mummy!

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,190
Yes? Where's Daddy?

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
- He's gone.
- What happened?

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,010
I don't know.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Danny!

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,820
I saw your car pulling in.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
Are you trying to give
yourself a heart attack, or me?

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,800
New regime...two miles a day.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,190
You need your head
examined and a cup of tea!

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,500
One of those I can do.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,630
OK, you're on!

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,260
I'll get the tea later.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,170
Good grief, it's Jimmy Saville!

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,260
- Tea, thank you, Jason.
- Herbal, or...?

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,880
Like builder's, two
sugars, as it 'appens!

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,410
There's nothing for you there.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,260
Reported this morning, a woman whose husband
disappeared from the park on Downs Way.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,380
One minute he's by the
swings with his daughter

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,830
- and the next minute, gone!
- Alien abduction!

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,730
I like it!

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,540
The daughter's eight years
old. She must be terrified.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Right, come on, Jason.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
MJ,

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,380
the clinic got back to me.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,020
This is the address they have for Ellen.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,100
- Right.
- It's not far from here.

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,140
- I could buzz round there, check it out.
- No.

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,540
It's a bit out of the blue.

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,140
It has been a few years, MJ. It's
more than certain she's moved on.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,120
All right. See if anyone can remember.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,830
Hey, are you free tonight,
dinner after the show, my shout?

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,540
Mmm... missus out, is she?

37
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,070
Well, you know what she's like...
she doesn't go for exotic cuisine.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,280
Exotic! You're on, mate!

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,110
An address for Ellen?!

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,720
You're getting close.

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,610
Too close. It's making MJ nervous.

42
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,760
Maybe I should have listened to
her and let the whole thing go.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
It's not easy for her.
It runs pretty deep.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,750
But she's relying on
you more than you think.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,210
Maybe just let her set the pace.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,670
Yeah, I will, thanks.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Right, last one down the
greasy spoon's a girl!

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,820
<i>It's totally out of character.</i>

49
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,340
He'd never leave Jess at
the park and just drive off.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,540
Did he take anything... money, passport?

51
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,570
No, I've checked our bank account
online. It hasn't been touched.

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,370
And he didn't say anything, give
any hints something was wrong?

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,180
Jess saw something when he disappeared.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
A man chasing Paul.

55
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,430
- No, Mum. Dad was chasing him!
- OK.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,990
So what did he look like?

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,620
- I don't know, just a man.
- You go and play.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
Thanks, Jess.

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,080
- Do you have any idea who it might be?
- Paul's a divorce solicitor.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,870
One of his clients lost custody
of his kids, and blamed Paul.

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,870
What did he do?

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,560
Rang the house a few times,
threatening and abusive.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
- He was drunk, of course.
- Was it just phone calls?

64
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,370
Paul saw someone a few
nights ago watching the house.

65
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,510
It was too dark to tell if it was him.

66
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,640
I'd like to check your phone accounts,

67
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,260
see where the calls are coming from.

68
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,970
- I need your permission to do that.
- Of course.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,830
Look, Paul and I, we're very happy.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,030
We've a holiday booked, in Mexico,
the three of us. He wouldn't...

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,000
Something's wrong, I know it.

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Welcome back.

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,180
Been anywhere nice?

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,750
No, unless your idea of
nice is a student kitchen!

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,590
Ellen's place?

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,860
Not been for years.

77
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm guessing the students
didn't have a forwarding address?

78
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,350
Better, much better.

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,530
Wonderful things, fridge magnets.

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,910
You found Ellen's mobile number?

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,790
- Have you ever thought of joining the police?
- I'm over-qualified!

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,600
Be careful with this.

83
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,100
- It's all right. I've written it down.
- No, I meant with MJ.

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
She can't make contact till
we've spoken to Ellen first.

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,110
Is that Cassie's phone list?

86
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,190
Yeah, I've been through it with her and this number
matches up with the times of the abusive calls.

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,070
It's registered to a Gary Nayland.

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,300
- Have you rung it?
- No answer.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,320
Try the ex-wife, see if you
can find out where he is.

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,390
Has she identified any other numbers?

91
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,510
Apart from this one. I'm
trying to get a location for it.

92
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,120
OK, let me know.

93
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,930
One for you, Amy.

94
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,150
A woman called Layla Gudka.

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm trying to find her father. She
hasn't seen him for over 20 years.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,980
OK, I'll give her a call.

97
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,820
How did you get on at the house?

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,430
It's like I thought...
Ellen has long gone.

99
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,350
OK.

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Oh, but...

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
she did leave this.

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,810
It's a phone number...her mobile.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,200
- Have you tried it?
- No.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,350
Thanks, Amy. Good work.

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,180
- What are you doing?
- What was I supposed to do?

106
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,760
She shouldn't have that number.

107
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,120
- It's Ellen decision whether she wants contact.
- Well, go on, then. Go and get it back.

108
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,370
Yes, you see it's not so easy, is it?

109
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,450
- She won't ring it.
- Of course she won't.

110
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,390
She knows the protocol but than anyone.

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,950
Hello, Mrs. Nayland?

112
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,240
My name is DC Doyle, I'm with
the Dover Missing Persons Unit.

113
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,180
We're trying to locate your ex-husband.

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,340
He seems to have gone off the radar.

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Right, I see.

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Did he?

117
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,970
OK. Well, thanks a lot.

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,590
Sorry to disturb you.

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,380
- Go on.
- Ibiza,

120
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,430
Ibiza, with his new tart, trying
to kid himself he's still 21!

121
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,850
Hello. Can I help at all?

122
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,770
I'm looking for Amy Garnett.

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Hi, you must be Layla? I'm Amy.
If you'd like to take a seat.

124
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
So, when did you last see your father?

125
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,560
I lost contact with my
parents when I was 17.

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,950
Did they move away?

127
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,910
No, I left home.

128
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,220
I wanted to go to university,
but my father opposed it.

129
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,570
Can I ask why?

130
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,960
He's very traditional.

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,410
Doesn't think us women
should use our brains.

132
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,550
And how did your mother feel about that?

133
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,690
- She was very traditional, too.
- Was?

134
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,490
She died ten years ago.

135
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,340
Please go on.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,470
I was offered a place at Edinburgh.

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,360
The day before term started I packed my
bags, told my dad I was going and left.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,780
That must have made him angry.

140
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,770
I've no idea.

141
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
I never spoke to him again.

142
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,580
So why now, Layla?

143
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,130
I work for a large charity,

144
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,160
been based in Geneva for years.

145
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,900
I've been posted back here again so I

146
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,710
thought now is the time to get in touch.

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,260
- So you've been trying to find him?
- For weeks.

148
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,210
I've tried everything you can think
of, but it's like he never existed.

149
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,520
Well, don't worry, we'll find him.

150
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,120
I hope so.

151
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,450
- Nayland's in Ibiza.
- Who?

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
Gary Nayland.

153
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,710
I just had a chat with his ex.

154
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,930
He's out the country, so it
can't have been him that Jess saw.

155
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,760
- Well, we've only got the ex's word for that.
- Believe me, she's not giving him an alibi!

156
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,830
What about that unidentified number?
Have you got a trace on that yet?

157
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,820
Yeah, it's a payphone at a
bail hostel in Medway Street.

158
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,560
- Bail hostel?
- It could be another ex-client.

159
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,070
The Probation Service are
sending me a list of residents.

160
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,150
Whoever it was only
spoke for 18 seconds.

161
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,640
- And Paul's car, has that shown up, yet?
- No, still no sign of it.

162
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,340
- Are you all right?
- Yes, fine, thank you.

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,290
I'll be in touch as soon as
I've done the basic searches.

164
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,230
If you would.

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,040
She's a right little
charmer, isn't she?!

166
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah. I bet her dad can't
wait to see her again!

167
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,950
Sarge, how many Garrisons do
you reckon there are in Dover?

168
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
Not many, why?

169
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,650
The bail hostel have just sent
me over a list of residents.

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,980
Room six, Jamie Garrison, released
from Strangeways last Wednesday.

171
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,900
Let's see if Cassie knows anything.

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,490
Jamie? Jamie is in Dover?

173
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,760
He's Paul's brother.

174
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,020
He called your house last
week. Paul didn't mention it?

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
No, no, he didn't.

176
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,520
And you don't think they'd been
in touch at all before that?

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,440
No way. They didn't get on.

178
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,790
Why now?

179
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,610
Jamie has just been
released from prison.

180
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,370
What? What for? What did he do?

181
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,260
Handling counterfeit goods.

182
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,890
When was the last time Paul saw him?

183
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,610
June the 8th, 2000... the
day Paul and I got married.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Right.

185
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,280
He had a problem with that, did he?

186
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,550
He was always jealous...

187
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,180
of Paul's career, success, happiness,

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,720
and then the big church wedding.

189
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,630
What did he do?

190
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,550
He turned up drunk, shouting at
Paul, sneering at his cosy life.

191
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,890
It was just so awful. Jamie always liked
to think of himself as a bit of rebel.

192
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,280
I suppose he was looking for a fight.

193
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,200
And he got one, did he?

194
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yes.

195
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,560
And that was the last
time they saw each other?

196
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Yes.

197
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,420
He's agreed to come in and talk to
us, so hopefully we'll know more soon.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Cheer up!

199
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,130
I've done all the basic
searches and drawn a blank.

200
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,730
No mention of Layla's father anywhere.

201
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,540
Have you tried the Register Of Deaths?

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,670
He's not there, either. The house was rented
and it's changed hands three times since.

203
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,830
The trail is nearly as cold as she is.

204
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,740
Jason seems to think she's nice!

205
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,920
Yeah, and did he have drool
dribbling down his chin at the time?

206
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,200
Mmm, can't help himself!

207
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,420
Did you find out where
Layla's father worked?

208
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,490
The Council, I think.

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,010
Bureaucrats! I love bureaucrats!
They keep records of everything.

210
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,670
I bet they've got a file as
thick as that with his name on.

211
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,950
It's worth a try.

212
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Sarge.

213
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Mr. Garrison.

214
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,100
Can I get you a coffee?

215
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah, nice one. Got any croissants?

216
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,080
- Handbags.
- Counterfeit were they?

217
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,170
Well, I didn't know they were dodgy
but you try telling a magistrate that.

218
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
They gave me a year.

219
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,400
- And what did you do, six months?
- Yeah, good behaviour.

220
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,620
And you came back to
Dover, when, last week?

221
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,610
They put me in that hostel.

222
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,430
I've got to get out of there.

223
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,770
It's worse than prison.

224
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,390
And that's why you phoned your brother?

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,430
I haven't seen him for years.

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
We've all grown up a bit now.

227
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,470
I thought it was time to...

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,690
you know, extend the hand of friendship.

229
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,280
- And how did that go down?
- Just like the phone.

230
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,670
You can't be surprised,
not after the wedding?

231
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,050
You been talking to Cassie?

232
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,120
Of course.

233
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
What else did she tell you?

234
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,300
She told us that she last saw
Paul on the Sunday afternoon

235
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,000
when he took Jess to the park.

236
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
- Did you see him that day?
- No.

237
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,960
If you want an alibi,
ask anyone at the hostel.

238
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,500
- Reliable witnesses, are they?
- They've done their time, like me.

239
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,630
Well, thanks for coming in, Jamie.

240
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,170
Sorry about the croissants.
I'll get someone to show you out.

241
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,170
If you see Cassie and Jess,

242
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,740
give them my best.

243
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,790
Now just say

244
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,780
if any of these men look
like the man you saw, OK?

245
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,790
Yeah.

246
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Mum...

247
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,430
I think, I think it was him.

248
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,260
Sweetheart, you go upstairs.

249
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,290
Do you want me to go?

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,410
What's going on?

251
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,390
What did Jamie say
when you spoke to him?

252
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,420
- Where's Paul?
- You can't stop me!

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,000
- Jamie!
- I came to see if you are OK.

254
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,250
Jamie, what the hell is
going on? Where's Paul?

255
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,910
Have you told them everything, Cass?

256
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,200
You haven't, have you?

257
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,350
My little girl saw you.

258
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,970
What have you done to him?

259
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,150
Do you know what's happened, Jamie, or do you
want to do this in front of your Probation Officer?

260
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,510
- Legenda não traduzida -

261
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,040
He attacked me, Cass. Do you know why?

262
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,740
- Because I told him about us.
- Stop it!

263
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,950
No...

264
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,480
I think we may want to hear this.

265
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,490
Yeah, Cassie.

266
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,540
These people need to know about
you seeing me behind Paul's back.

267
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,550
Cassie?

268
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,760
Eight years ago...

269
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
eight years.

270
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,510
Hang on. How old is Jess now?

271
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,400
- Jamie, come on...no.
- Don't worry.

272
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,210
Paul knows. I told him.

273
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Why don't we have another little
chat down at the station, Jamie?

274
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,700
Is it true?

275
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,680
You were sleeping with Paul's brother?

276
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,400
You should have told us.

277
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
He knows.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
Paul knows about Jess.

279
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,590
Sunday it was.

280
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,360
He was in the park, at the swings.

281
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,200
Sees me in the distance,
comes running up to me.

282
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,500
What happened?

283
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,740
He was livid.

284
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,470
Drags me away so Jess can't see.

285
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,770
Tells me he doesn't want me
anywhere near him or his family.

286
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,200
You did sleep with his fiancee, Jamie.

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,260
Yeah, that's what I told him.

288
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,070
- Why did you do that?
- Someone had to.

289
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,180
Cassie obviously wasn't going to.

290
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
Were you that jealous of his life?

291
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,520
His life was built on a lie.

292
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,080
That little girl that he
was trying to protect from me

293
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,170
- is my own daughter!
- Then what happened?

294
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,610
He went mad, lashed out at me.

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,650
You look all right to me.

296
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,900
I've been in prison, OK.

297
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,400
Someone is coming at you, you react.

298
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,100
What did you do?

299
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,570
- I hit him and he fell.
- Then what?

300
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,310
- Jamie!
- I ran!

301
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,580
Come on, I'm on probation.
It doesn't look good, does it?

302
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,290
So you've no idea where he went after?

303
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
None...

304
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I swear to God.

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,900
We'll contact the hostel if
we need to speak to you again.

306
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,350
Paul didn't just happen to see
you in the park did he, Jamie?

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
Why were you really there?

308
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,790
She's my daughter.

309
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I just...

310
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,900
I wanted to get a look
at her, that's all.

311
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,930
Find anything useful on Layla's father?

312
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,550
Layla's dad was the life
and soul of the office.

313
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,970
He organised the family party at work
and the annual summer outing for the kids.

314
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,660
Very sweet, but not very helpful.

315
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,370
No, but this is.

316
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,820
He names his wife Chandra as
beneficiary in his pension.

317
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,620
- Why wouldn't he?
- Because it's dated 2002.

318
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,340
Layla told me she died in 1999.

319
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,060
Do you think it might be fraud?

320
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,910
It might explain why he's
so hard to track down.

321
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,630
Run it past Layla.

322
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,770
Maybe she hasn't told you
everything about her father.

323
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,900
- Right, see you in the morning.
- Night.

324
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,540
- Sarge?
- Before you ask, I'm already spoken for.

325
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,040
Danny's buying me dinner.

326
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,260
No...it wasn't that.

327
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,390
The phone number for Ellen.

328
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,560
- What about it?
- You called it, didn't you?

329
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,130
It was off. I didn't leave a message.

330
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,490
If she'd answered it...

331
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,720
Imagine if it was me.

332
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,280
You wouldn't have let it go.

333
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,660
Thank you for your concern, DC Doyle.

334
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,880
Ellen, it's...

335
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,630
Hurry up! I'm starving!

336
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,350
I'm sure it is good for me,

337
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,140
but macrobiotic vegan is not my idea
of an exotic cuisine, that's all.

338
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,930
Does amazing things for
your digestive tract.

339
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
Too much information!

340
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,630
So Amy actually found
Ellen's mobile number?

341
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,920
- I wish she hadn't!
- Well, why not?

342
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,800
You've come this far.

343
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
Maybe I've come far enough.

344
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,650
From now on it gets complicated.

345
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,000
It's already complicated, MJ.

346
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,800
Once you realised there
was a chance of finding her,

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,760
you knew you'd have to see it through.

348
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,250
Jason's right.

349
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,350
I can't use the number, anyway.

350
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,430
It's against everything I believe in.

351
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,680
That's just an excuse.

352
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,570
Your team deal with this
stuff every day. Use them.

353
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,560
Let them treat you the
same as every other case.

354
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,600
But I'm not the same
as every other case.

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,940
I know you'll do the right thing.

356
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,320
Macrobiotic vegan!

357
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm sorry... I shouldn't have
taken Ellen's phone number.

358
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,970
It's OK.

359
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,750
It's just hard to stand back.

360
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,870
Why don't you just carry on and

361
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,480
let me know what turns up?

362
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,530
- Are you sure?
- Sim.

363
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,470
It's just that I'm
running out of options, MJ.

364
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,100
All I can do is get onto
Ellen's phone service provider

365
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,700
and find out who she
has been in contact with.

366
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,880
If that's what you'd normally do next.

367
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,380
It isn't... not without the person's
consent, unless it was life or death.

368
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,770
- Legenda não traduzida -

369
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,460
Ellen has a history of
drug abuse. She could...

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Sorry.

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,620
Just do what you think is best, OK?

372
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,140
It's Paul Garrison. He's been
to the school and taken Jess.

373
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,610
Get straight over there. Get
times, witnesses, the lot.

374
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,680
Amy, try and get number plate
recognition for Paul's car in that area.

375
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,050
- Are you all right?
- Yeah...just discussing the case.

376
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,880
Traffic, please. This
is Missing Persons.

377
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm sorry, is this a bad moment?

378
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,940
So my mum was named as
beneficiary in Dad's pension plan?

379
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,950
- OK.
- In 2002...

380
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,630
seven years ago. She had to
have been alive at the time.

381
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,650
Yes.

382
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,070
Layla, you told me your
mother died ten years ago.

383
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,240
Did I say that?

384
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,690
Well, I've been out of the country.

385
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,670
I mean, I suppose if it says
it here it must have been.

386
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,160
So how did you know
she had passed away...

387
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,930
if you'd had no contact?

388
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,820
I'm sorry. I have to go.

389
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Layla!

390
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,060
Layla, wait!

391
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,100
Cassie... He took her!

392
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,850
He just walked into
the school and took her.

393
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,010
It's all right. We've got people at the school and
every available officer is out looking for the car.

394
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,200
It was an hour ago. They
could be anywhere by now.

395
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,950
I'm sorry, I've got to ask you this.

396
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,250
Has Paul ever harmed Jess?

397
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
No.

398
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,080
But now that he knows she's not his,

399
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,930
what's he going to do?

400
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,280
Maybe he thinks he's going to lose her.

401
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,720
- But he's not!
- It's Jason,

402
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,110
he's at the school. Jess has returned.

403
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,950
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, she's fine.

404
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Jason...

405
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,640
any sign of Paul?

406
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,270
OK. Bring Jess here.

407
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,290
We went to the cafe and had ice cream. It
was brilliant. And was your dad all right?

408
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,310
I think so. What did he say, sweetheart?

409
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,930
Just he was really sorry
for leaving me at the park.

410
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,660
He took masses of photos on his phone.

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,260
He said he loves me loads and
loads and gave me a big hug.

412
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,540
MOBILE RINGS

413
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I'd better...

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,230
Did your dad say anything
about where he was going, Jess?

415
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,130
Going? Is he going somewhere?

416
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,970
That was Paul's law firm.

417
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
He's just resigned.

418
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,570
Layla shed any light on
her dad's pension scam?

419
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,490
It's not a scam. Layla's lying.

420
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
Are you sure?

421
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,910
She told me her mother
died ten years ago.

422
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,020
I checked, and her death
is not registered...

423
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,360
but guess where I did find her?

424
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,480
Surprise me.

425
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,140
Right here on our system.

426
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,500
She reported a missing
person back in 1992...

427
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,600
her daughter, Layla.

428
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,090
You're kidding me!

429
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,820
Two missing persons
looking for each other.

430
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,120
- That's a first.
- I don't know what to do,

431
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,150
cos Layla has been lying
to us about her mother.

432
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,050
Is she on the run for some reason?

433
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,440
If she was, we're the
last place she'd come to.

434
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Don't say anything to her. Try
and locate the mother first.

435
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,280
She's got a right to know her
daughter is alive and well.

436
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,980
Cassie has agreed to go on Danny's show.

437
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,140
- What's Paul up to?
- Clearing the decks...

438
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,410
one thing at a time.

439
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,290
Leaving his job, saying goodbye to Jess.

440
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,790
And what's his last move, suicide?

441
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
It's possible,

442
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,200
that's why we've got to
try and find him first,

443
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,870
before he does anything stupid.

444
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,270
I still reckon he's high risk.

445
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,260
Let's hope he doesn't
involve the kid again!

446
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,010
He's a missing person, Jason.

447
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
It's our job to find him.

448
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,870
We don't judge, ever.

449
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,440
You rang, m'lady?

450
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,590
All right...maybe sometimes we do.

451
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Come on.

452
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
Hypothetical question...

453
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
My favourite kind.

454
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,260
You've hit a dead end and all
you've got is a phone number.

455
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,080
- Is this?
- Hypothetical, I said.

456
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,090
OK.

457
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,540
Ok, get onto the phone company.
Get the numbers they called.

458
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,950
But they're not in any immediate
danger that you know of.

459
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,650
That kind of hypothetical question...

460
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,460
should I tell the phone
company a little white lie?

461
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,570
What would you do?

462
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,250
An amoral pig like me?

463
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,050
I'd do it in a flash, but
you're not me, are you, Amy,

464
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,280
and I don't think you want to be.

465
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,210
Hello, Customer Relations?

466
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm ringing from Dover Police

467
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,620
regarding a mobile number
of a missing person.

468
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,750
Her name is Ellen Croft.

469
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,860
That's a great story...

470
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,270
adultery, violence, child abduction.

471
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,220
It ticks all my listeners' boxes!

472
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,610
You can't go into any of
that... just the live appeal.

473
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,450
- Is she up for it?
- Yeah.

474
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,800
Thinks it's a great idea.

475
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,560
- Apparently Paul listens to your show.
- Fantastic!

476
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,480
My first missing listener!

477
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,870
She says he throws things at the radio.

478
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,300
Well, at least it's a reaction.

479
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,380
No trace on Layla's mother.

480
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,540
Her last registered address
is the one Layla gave us,

481
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,440
but those cuttings might help.

482
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,870
A journalist on the local
paper took up the story,

483
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,610
ran a series of articles
over the yars, you know,

484
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,650
mother still searching for the
daughter she'll never see grow up,

485
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,550
that sort of thing.

486
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,800
Let's have a look.

487
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,690
Oh, yeah, Stella Stiles.

488
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,270
Do you know her?

489
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,980
She was a bit of a
legend on The Courier.

490
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,910
She had a steamy affair
with a junior reporter.

491
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,990
And would this junior reporter still
happen to have her phone number?

492
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,970
I'll see what I can do.

493
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,590
I've been joined in the
studio by Cassie Garrison

494
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,440
whose husband, Paul, has
been reported missing...

495
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,560
- How's Jess?
- Asleep at my sister's.

496
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,250
She thinks all of this
is a great adventure.

497
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,360
He was punishing me for
what happened with Jamie.

498
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,950
Cass, if Paul is listening, what
would you like to say to him?

499
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,800
Paul, please, please come back to us.

500
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,310
I know some terrible
things have happened,

501
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,540
but if we could just talk.

502
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,160
We love you, Paul.

503
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,700
We miss you.

504
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,170
Stay safe, keep warm,

505
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,250
come home.

506
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,100
Paul Garrison.

507
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,440
If anybody thinks they
know where Paul is tonight,

508
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,130
get in contact on the usual number.

509
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,340
I appreciate that you
are trying to help,

510
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,280
but I do not want police
resources to be wasted on me.

511
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,670
All I ask is that you make sure

512
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,520
Cassie gets my wedding ring.

513
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,360
With thanks, Paul Garrison.

514
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Well, at least he's polite!

515
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,290
- Is that it?
- Yep.

516
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,140
Dropped it off at the radio station
last night. Danny gave me this for you.

517
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,560
Apparently he had to buy Stella Stiles a
couple of pints of Chardonnay to get that!

518
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,430
I'm sure he coped!

519
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,050
"Confined to a nursing home and
suffering from Parkinson's Disease,

520
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,290
"Chandra Gudka fears she may never
see her long-lost daughter again."

521
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,120
Any mention of her father?

522
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,770
None that I can see.

523
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,190
Oh, but they do have an
address for the home, here.

524
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,280
OK, get onto them.

525
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,540
See if she is still there.

526
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,240
I'd better get this back to Cassie.

527
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
This is really going to make her day!

528
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Morning!

529
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,970
- OK, it's not what it seems.
- No?

530
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,940
Why should it be? Nothing
else is around here.

531
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,910
Listen, I've just checked
our bank account online.

532
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,320
Paul has taken some money
out, ten minutes ago.

533
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,640
He's in Westbourne.

534
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,780
Westbourne, it's only a few
minutes from here. On my way.

535
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,500
What do you expect me to think, Cassie?

536
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,740
He came round last night
to talk, to explain.

537
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm not a fool, DS Croft.

538
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,930
- And where's Jess?
- She's still at my sister's.

539
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,270
And did he say anything worth hearing?

540
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,690
He told me he got in
touch with Paul last year

541
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,310
when he needed a solicitor.

542
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,750
Paul has friends,

543
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,300
contacts that could have helped him,

544
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,210
kept him out of prison,
but Paul refused.

545
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,760
- And Paul didn't tell you any of that?
- Of course not.

546
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,420
Come on, he must have
felt pretty guilty.

547
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Jason?

548
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,190
I've found his car.

549
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,940
No sign of Paul.

550
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,250
OK, stay close, keep out of
sight, don't scare him off.

551
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,640
Might be too late for
that... Paul Garrison?

552
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,150
DC Doyle, Dover Missing
Persons Unit... Paul!

553
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,300
I just wanna talk, mate.

554
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,370
He ran off.

555
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,550
Sarge, I've got his satnav.

556
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,660
The last two journeys were to
and from a place called Sandford.

557
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,920
- Sandford...does that mean anything to you?
- St Mary's Church, it's where we got married.

558
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,400
Jason, get straight over there.
You want St Mary's Church.

559
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,510
Your mother's alive.
She's in a nursing home.

560
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,890
I spoke to them this morning.

561
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,250
Do they have any
information on my father?

562
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,390
No, but they...

563
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,940
I'm sorry, but you
thought your mum was dead!

564
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,210
- Don't you care that she isn't?
- This isn't about her.

565
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,960
She reported you missing.

566
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,030
She spent years searching
for you, so did this unit.

567
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,570
I just want to know where
my father is. That's all.

568
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, fine. The best thing
I can do is talk to her.

569
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,150
No! Don't.

570
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,350
Layla, I have to! This
is still an open file.

571
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,230
I have a duty to inform
her that you've been found.

572
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,140
I don't want her to know where I am.

573
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,130
Fine. Then I won't breathe a word.

574
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,780
He's in the church.

575
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,530
All right. Wait here.

576
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Paul?

577
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,910
Paul, I am DS Croft,

578
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,100
Missing Persons Unit.

579
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,320
I told you not to waste your time.

580
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,540
I'm only doing my job.

581
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,540
Cassie, no!

582
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,270
- Let me talk to him!
- No!

583
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,610
It has to be his decision.

584
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,700
<i>Lovely, isn't it?</i>

585
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,380
So peaceful.

586
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,450
I know what you're doing, Paul.

587
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,010
Quitting your job,

588
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,400
giving your wedding ring back.

589
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,540
It's easy...

590
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,580
getting everything
sorted out like that...

591
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,280
but taking that last step...

592
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,540
that's the hard bit.

593
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,200
I've made my decision.

594
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,890
I don't want to see Cassie again.

595
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Cassie, no!

596
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Paul!

597
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,410
- Cassie, outside.
- Paul, please...

598
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,940
Is it true about Jess?

599
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,750
Is she Jamie's?

600
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Yes.

601
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,110
It was right here, do you remember?

602
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,980
You made your vows.

603
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,310
What was going through
your mind, Cassie?

604
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,480
That I loved you. That
I'd made the right choice.

605
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,650
I didn't even know there
was a choice to make.

606
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,160
I was young, Paul.

607
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,930
All that angry rebel stuff,

608
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,710
it was sexy

609
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,420
and you were always
working, always studying.

610
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Qualifying, it's called.

611
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,410
I was getting married. I wanted
to give my family a stable future.

612
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,650
I've only got myself to blame, then.

613
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,860
I chose you.

614
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
You won.

615
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
I won?

616
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,010
I won? Jess isn't even my
daughter and you think I won!

617
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,300
Why do you think I didn't tell you?

618
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,840
Oh, gee, let me think.

619
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,260
- Because you were ashamed?
- I was...

620
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,220
I still am.

621
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,820
- I wanted to tell you.
- So why didn't you?

622
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,120
Because it would have destroyed us.

623
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,620
It's destroying us now.

624
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,310
But we love each other more than that.

625
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Do we?

626
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,960
You were sleeping with him,
what, right up to the wedding?

627
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Was it?

628
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,140
- Yes.
- No wonder he turned up

629
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,520
drunk, shooting his mouth off.

630
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,160
It was our wedding! That's
how much you loved me!

631
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,120
Jamie wasn't love, Paul.

632
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,060
I was a stupid, young girl wanting
everything in the sweet shop,

633
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,300
but I never loved him.

634
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
I only ever felt like that about you.

635
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,670
Maybe you should give
him a second chance.

636
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,260
You might be able to love him this time.

637
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,300
He might even be a brilliant dad.

638
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,860
Oh, please don't.

639
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,460
Let Jess have a
relationship with her real

640
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,570
- father.
- No!

641
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm sorry, Cass, I can't do it.

642
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,670
I love you...

643
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,980
but I can't.

644
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Paul!

645
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,560
You're ready are you, Paul?

646
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,100
To take that last step?

647
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,110
To never see your daughter again?

648
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,420
She's not my daughter.

649
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
No?

650
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,510
Who does she think her father is?

651
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
Have you asked yourself that?

652
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,080
You walk out that door
now, you'll feel great.

653
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,800
Everyone betrayed you but you've
walked away with your head held high.

654
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
But tomorrow,

655
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,440
when the doubts creep in...

656
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,990
it's hell, Paul.

657
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,540
Trust me, I know.

658
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,750
I didn't have a chance to give her this.

659
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Jason.

660
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,400
I saw your mother, Layla.

661
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,000
She's very sick.

662
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,930
She'd really love to see you.

663
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,450
Does she have any news about my father?

664
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,870
Yes, she did.

665
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
He...

666
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,640
He died.

667
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,410
Four years ago, in India.

668
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm really, really sorry.

669
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,030
He's really dead? Are you sure?

670
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Yes.

671
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,060
What do you think is going on in there?

672
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,360
Well, I can't hear the tinkling
of stained glass breaking,

673
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,840
so that's a good sign.

674
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,620
The things you were saying
about doubts creeping in...

675
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,120
Did you mean Ellen?

676
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,780
It's just experience talking.

677
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
Are you OK, Cassie?

678
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm just calling my sister,

679
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,400
let her know it's OK to bring Jess home.

680
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,160
We're going to talk.

681
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
I'd like to see Jamie.

682
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,170
You go home, and I'll bring him over.

683
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,910
When my father put on these parties,

684
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,800
he was happy, genuinely happy.

685
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,520
It was clearly his passion.

686
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Oh, yes...

687
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,060
But it was a clever disguise.

688
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,850
The truth is, he was vicious.

689
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,080
He would beat my mum for anything...

690
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,790
spilt water, creased shirts...

691
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,500
sometimes for nothing,
just to remind her.

692
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,340
- Couldn't you do anything?
- If I tried, he'd beat me.

693
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I wasn't going to stay.

694
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,630
I studied, passed my
exams, all in secret.

695
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,430
He would never have let me do that.

696
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,000
- Because it meant freedom?
- Exactly.

697
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,120
I only made one mistake.

698
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,480
I came home

699
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,330
and there he was,

700
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,770
the letter with my exam
results in one hand...

701
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,900
and his belt in the other.

702
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,730
That was the last time.

703
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
When you first came to see us,

704
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,820
you said that you'd
been trying to find him.

705
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,860
Was this true?

706
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,230
I'm sorry, Amy.

707
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,500
I knew you wouldn't take my case.

708
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,550
I did try to go to the house but
I was nearly sick in the taxi.

709
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,360
So why do you want to find him?

710
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,900
I'm going to be living here.

711
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,330
The thought of seeing him...

712
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,390
Layla, your mum really wants to see you.

713
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,380
She pleaded with me.

714
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,670
I pleaded with her once to
leave him, come with me...

715
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,440
But no. She thought it best to stay.

716
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,210
She was scared! Was
that really her fault?

717
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,020
How can I forgive her?

718
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,750
- She gave me something to give to you.
- What?

719
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,300
Wait here.

720
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,810
I've got your probation
officer's number in here.

721
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,180
You get smart, he'll
be here like a shot.

722
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Hello, Jamie.

723
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,080
This is my exam certificate.

724
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,890
She kept it!

725
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,730
Mum kept it after all these years!

726
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,850
He threw it in the bin but
she must have pulled it out.

727
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,890
She spent so many years
trying to find you.

728
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,050
She just wants to say
she's sorry, that's all.

729
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,600
I was wrong about you, Layla.

730
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,840
- I'm sorry I lied.
- I understand.

731
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,020
I'm glad I stuck with you.

732
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,000
So am I.

733
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,330
Listen...the home she's in?

734
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Thank you.

735
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,960
I was hoping we could,
you know, start again,

736
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,930
act like grown-ups.

737
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,160
- Won't be easy, will it?
- Course not...

738
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,080
- but I apologised to Cass.
- When?

739
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,310
We talked the other night.

740
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,740
- What?
- We were just talking, Paul.

741
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,950
He was here?

742
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,120
He just turned up. It was nothing.

743
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,760
Oh, no. Just like the old days!

744
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, come on, Paul.

745
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,400
Get out! Get out of my house.

746
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,850
I've spoken to a solicitor, Paul.
I want access...to my daughter.

747
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,470
Hi, is that the control room?

748
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,340
Yeah, this is Amy Garnett, MPU.
I've got a mobile number here

749
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,120
with a 999 call on it and I
just want to check the result.

750
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,410
Did we take it, or
did Fire or Ambulance?

751
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,100
Did you plan this? Is that
what you were chatting about?

752
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,950
No, Paul, no. I had no idea.
It's got nothing to do with Cass.

753
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,790
I decided. Oh, you decided, did you?

754
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,810
Congratulations! Is that what
you meant about being grown-up?

755
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,160
- How does it feel?
- It feels good.

756
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,850
I'm ready. I hope so.

757
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,650
- I hope you are.
- Paul, please don't!

758
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,660
- Daddy!
- Jess, sweetheart!

759
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,250
She's beautiful... just like her mum.

760
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,940
A couple of hours ago he was willing
to walk away and leave her to you.

761
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,770
Don't think he meant it.

762
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,400
I just wanted to see her that was all.

763
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,430
What did the solicitor say?

764
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,110
He said he hoped I had the
stomach for a long, hard fight.

765
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,120
Do you?

766
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,940
I'll walk back. Tell Cassie...

767
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,750
No, just say I've gone... for good.

768
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Amy?

769
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,760
- I thought you'd be gone.
- This was just e-mailed.

770
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,150
It's a list of Ellen's phone calls.

771
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,630
- And, anything interesting?
- Big time!

772
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,600
She phoned St Margaret's Hospital
six times in the last three months.

773
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,300
and five of them were just this week,
and check out the last number on the list.

774
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,840
- 999.
- That call was made an hour and a half ago.

775
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,690
Does MJ know about
this? I just called her.

776
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,420
- What are you doing here?
- So she called 999?

777
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,650
It could have been anything.

778
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,400
This hospital has the largest
drug dependency unit in the county.

779
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,050
Let me go and find out what's happened.

780
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
No!

781
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,480
- You don't understand.
- I do, MJ.

782
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,340
She might say she
doesn't want to see you.

783
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,220
You meant well, OK?

784
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,440
Look, I won't go in there. I
just need to think things through.

785
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Ellen?

786

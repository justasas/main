1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Lindy?

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
Lindy?

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,700
Thanks, sorry to call so late.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,840
What's up?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,400
She hasn't come home.

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,880
Well, this is nice!

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,940
I don't make the laws.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,960
You don't have to smoke either...

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Addict.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,990
Look, MJ, I know you are upset with me.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,190
I'm not upset, Danny, I'm furious.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,250
You sat there and dragged
up all the details of

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,050
my sister's disappearance
live on your radio show.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,480
They told me she was dead, Danny.

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Dead.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done it.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,600
But people really
responded to the story, MJ.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,800
My job is to find missing persons

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,060
not to entertain your audience.

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,140
So, let me help you.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,600
I got thousands of listeners, every
one of then your eyes and ears.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll think about it.

23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
DS Croft.

24
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
All right.

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,840
Yeah, I'll be right there.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Gotta go.

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,750
A teenage girl run away
from home last night.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,350
Perfect...

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
For the show.

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,600
Oh, forget it.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,480
They'll be talking again, right?

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,820
You're in early.

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
- What?
- You got ketchup on your face.

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,460
What's that?

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,490
Is that Ellen Croft?

36
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Yeah.

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,130
It's MJ's sister, I aged up the photo.

38
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,910
You'd better get rid of that
before the sarge gets in.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,430
Now look, I did some digging

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,160
and I found these newspaper stories
about the squat fires in Marseilles.

41
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,040
No, no, don't involve me in this.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,910
I went through a list of all the people

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,170
reported dead and found
all sorts of discrepancies.

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,750
Basically It was almost
impossible to say who died.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,430
There's this guy,

46
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,590
he left the squat minutes
before the fire started.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,840
He had no idea people
thought he was dead until

48
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,910
he came back to the UK two years later.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,360
This is Kieran Russell.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,660
He knew Ellen. I e-mailed
him and he just replied.

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,620
She didn't die. MJ has got it wrong.

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,740
Ellen survived the fire.

53
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,280
Are you gonna tell her?

54
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,180
Cos if you do... Jason,

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,090
stop flirting and get your coat.

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,170
We've got a case and I want to
talk to the family straightaway.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,760
Initial checks please, Amy.

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,050
Her name as Alison Hughes,

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,470
aged 16, 24 Branscombe Gardens.

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,890
She didn't come home last night.

61
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,560
Hospitals, traffic,
morgues, the usual. You know.

62
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,280
Maybe she just got drunk
and crashed at a mates house.

63
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,650
Isn't that what
16-year-olds do?

64
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,460
No, that was just you.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,640
Thanks.

66
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,970
Is your husband out at work, Lindi?

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,850
No, he's out looking for Ali.

68
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,740
Something's happened.

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,300
Ali has never stayed out all
night without our approval, never.

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,220
Did she always tell you where she's gonna be?
- Yes, always.

71
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,990
Where does she normally go?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,770
Shopping, her friends' houses.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,950
- What about bars, clubs?
- No, Ali doesn't drink.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,310
We don't allow it. Carl
and I don't drink so...

75
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,000
Sorry, what's this got to do with it?

76
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,390
What about her friends,
do they drink or use drugs?

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,590
Drugs?!

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,030
We're just trying to build up a picture
of Ali's world, her group of friends.

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,680
Is it possible to have a
look at her room, please?

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Look,

81
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,520
we are a close family.

82
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,300
If Ali had been offered
drugs she'd tell me.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Her room's up here.

84
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,520
Any more theories, Poirot, you
share them with me not her, OK?

85
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
Sorry!

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,150
- Can I help you?
- So sorry, it's Frank.

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,440
- Amy.
- Stan.

88
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,870
- Who's Frank?
- Sinatra.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,240
They sent me up here,

90
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm trying to find Missing Persons.

91
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,650
You found it.

92
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,750
Have you got a recent photo
of Ali we could borrow?

93
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Yeah.

94
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,130
You won't find it under there, mate?

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Find what?

96
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,990
This.

97
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,110
Vodka. Let's hope she
took some tonic with it.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,690
It was in Ali's school bag.

99
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,410
<i>Hello?</i>

100
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,250
Up here.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
- Did you know?
- No.

102
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,220
Nothing...

103
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,330
Carl...

104
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,800
- So who's missing, Stan?
- My brother.

105
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,720
- We're twins.
- OK, and what's his name?

106
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,550
We lost touch ages ago

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,010
but our mother passed away a
few weeks ago and I wanted to...

108
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,050
You know.

109
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,340
Stan, his name?

110
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,160
That's the thing, I'm not sure.

111
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,030
You don't know your
twin brother's name?

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,860
I can't even be sure I've got one.

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,670
- What was she even doing with them?
- Someone must have given them to her.

114
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,080
Any idea who?

115
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,040
- Mr. Hughes?
- No, I don't.

116
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,630
Just wait till she gets home.

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,070
I know you're upset but try
not to be to angry with her.

118
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,700
Does Ali have a computer?

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,990
We gave her a laptop for Christmas.

120
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,680
Can we have a look at it, please?

121
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,210
Most girls her age have
at least tried a drink.

122
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,450
Look, my old man was a boozer.
I've seen what it does to people.

123
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,690
And what does Ali think about that?

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,850
- Does it cause any tension?
- No,

125
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
she understands.

126
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,030
Shouldn't you be out
there looking for her?

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,880
It's always nice to feel welcome.

128
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,340
Come on, Jason.

129
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,080
He feels helpless, he
needs someone to blame.

130
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,180
- Great, so he picks us.
- His daughters missing.

131
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,830
We can't do enough.

132
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,870
I'm worried she hasn't at least
rung with parents like that.

133
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,360
Maybe because she's
scared of Mr. Angry.

134
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,520
Let's just concentrate
on finding it, shall we?

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,910
Mum suffered from dementia
for the last three years.

136
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,840
She used to ramble
on, all these memories.

137
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,990
Then she said something that made
the hairs on my neck stand up.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
She told me I had a twin brother.

139
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,640
- And you never knew?
- Not a clue.

140
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,790
- Your dad, is he...?
- I never knew him.

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,060
He was killed in France, 1940.

142
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,590
I don't want to seem rude,
Stan, but you said your mum...

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,630
No, yeah, maybe it was
just more of her gibberish

144
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,860
but it might not have been.

145
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,490
And now I need to know.

146
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,490
Have you looked for a birth certificate?

147
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,750
Mum was a bit of a hoarder.

148
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,360
I can't even find mine let alone his.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,230
The thing is, it's not really our thing.

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
We specialise in finding people
we know exist in the first place.

151
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,770
But you're my last hope

152
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,950
really I... Look, I've done all this.

153
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,040
This family tree back as far
as my mum's great grandfather.

154
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,850
That's amazing!

155
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,100
Yeah, but it's not given me any answers.

156
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,070
Look, there's one or
two things I can try

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
but I'll have to get my boss's
approval so no promises, OK.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,580
I'll call and let you know.

159
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,680
I like your new boyfriend.

160
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,620
Family Tree Trace Your Roots.

161
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,730
I know, I know.

162
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,220
He's searching for his lost twin.

163
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,660
Tell me this is a joke.

164
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,280
He was a really sweet old guy.

165
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,980
Did you tell him to try the library?

166
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,770
His mum's just died.

167
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,500
All right, but don't
spend too long on it, OK.

168
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Right, I need you to get into this.

169
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,460
You're looking for anything on
where their owner was last night.

170
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,810
- I'll get that photo blown up.
- There's something else actually.

171
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,240
- What?
- Can I have a word?

172
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
What's this?

173
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,930
In your office.

174
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,070
Amy, what the hell are you
doing, this is my sister's file?

175
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,410
Please, you really need to hear this.

176
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,260
No, this can't be
right. She died. She...

177
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,620
Kieran definitely knew her.

178
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,470
I didn't use your
surname and he knew it.

179
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,080
What gives you the right to go
digging about in my personal life?

180
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,180
I really wanted to look into
it, I thought it could help.

181
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,710
I've asked him to call me.

182
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,800
What?

183
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,970
You have no right to
be doing any of this.

184
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,100
But we don't know what happened
to Ellen after the fire.

185
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,560
You're talking about my sister, Amy.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,170
I thought she was dead.

187
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,930
You don't know what
I've been through.

188
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,350
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Well, you thought wrong.

189
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,680
This ends. Now.

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,430
What's that?

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,670
It's a photograph... I aged it up.

192
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,160
Danny is downstairs. He said
he'd wait outside for you.

193
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Oh, come on, MJ. I've sold
my producer hard on this.

194
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,870
I told her I was planning
a teenage runaway special.

195
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Danny, Ali Hughes' mum is
out of her mind with worry

196
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,220
and all you want is a
juicy item for your show.

197
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,020
We could help you find her.

198
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,960
No means no.
Look what happened last week.

199
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,720
Now I've got Amy digging around in files

200
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,330
- telling me Ellen's still alive.
- What?

201
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,930
So what are you going to do, are you
going to start looking for her again?

202
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
No.

203
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,970
They told me she was dead, Danny.

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,140
I followed so many leads, I
spent so many months searching.

205
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,740
And then the fire...

206
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
You need to end this.

207
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,160
You need to know.

208
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,380
Let Amy help you find her.

209
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,230
- She hasn't sacked you then?
- Funny.

210
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,180
You cracked it yet?

211
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,980
There's a website she uses,
I just need the password.

212
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,030
- Have you tried Ali 1?
- I've tried Ali 1 to 999.

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,890
Same for Alison Hughes,
street name, school name.

214
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,170
All right. Mine's Attila.

215
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,360
- It's my hamster.
- You've got a hamster?

216
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,250
No, when I was a kid.

217
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,760
Pet names.

218
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,000
Ali has got a rabbit, I saw a photo...

219
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,300
You got anything from that?

220
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,650
Some stuff, yeah, I just
need to crack the password.

221
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,250
If this Kieran Russell
does get in touch,

222
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,930
I want you to inform me immediately.

223
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,850
And if I want you to stop
at any time I'll tell you.

224
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,910
No questions asked.

225
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Right.

226
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,820
Do you want me to
formally reopen the case?

227
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Yes. Thank you.

228
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,740
Ali Hughes.

229
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,000
A runaway,
an abduction, an accident?

230
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,840
Runaway. Family row.

231
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,050
Slow down, we've got no evidence.

232
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,420
The bottle of vodka, the angry Dad.

233
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,490
He was at work when she went missing.

234
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,410
What does he do?

235
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,820
Private hire driver. Drive suits
around for one of the big taxi firms.

236
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,350
He was on shift till 2.30am.

237
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,440
Something might have happened
that morning or to the nigth before.

238
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,730
Let's just concentrate
on where she is for now.

239
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,810
Bingo! I'm in! Thank you, Robbie...

240
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,150
Ali's pet rabbit.

241
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,220
The night she went
missing, just after seven,

242
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,400
she was chatting on-line
with Karen Leyland, or Kaz.

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,400
She's four years older than Ali

244
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,980
and here's her mobile number.

245
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
I haven't seen her.

246
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,310
Kaz, we know that you were the
last person that Ali chatted to.

247
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,630
- I haven't seen her.
- She's been missing for two days.

248
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,650
Look at her, Daddy's little girl.

249
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,670
What do you mean?

250
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,870
Kaz?

251
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,490
I think you know where she is.

252
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,450
- I don't have to be here.
- Kaz.

253
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Kaz!

254
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,700
- Kaz!
- Get off me!

255
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,950
Listen to me, please.

256
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,520
I just need to know where
she is and if she's all right.

257
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,780
I can't make her do anything
she doesn't want to do.

258
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,660
She's upset, you know.

259
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,760
I can't force her to go home.

260
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,580
If you want to get rid of me
then just let me see her, please.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,860
This is wonderful!

262
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,700
I hardly scratched the surface.

263
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,690
This is what I wanted to show you.

264
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,580
Your mother's cousin, Sheila
Crook. You know she had a son?

265
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,630
I couldn't find anything about him.
What was his name?

266
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,980
Neil. Neil Crook.

267
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,970
Here's his birth certificate.

268
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,660
4th September, 1940.

269
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,250
Good grief, that's my birthday!

270
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,440
Ali? I'm DS Croft.

271
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,220
You promised, you promised me.

272
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,650
Ali, it's fine really.

273
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,390
She's the police!

274
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,070
Ali, you're not in trouble.

275
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,790
Ali, just listen, she's
not gonna make you go home.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,080
She just needs to know you're all right.

277
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,570
So I pulled up a list of everyone
born in Dover on the same day as you,

278
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,030
and looked for matches
with your extended family.

279
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,940
- That's where Neil came up.
- But surely he's my cousin?

280
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,700
If what your mum said was true,

281
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,490
then she was left
alone with twin babies.

282
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,840
You think she put one of us up for
adoption? I checked all the agencies.

283
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,830
It wasn't unheard of for
extended families to help out.

284
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,990
Unofficial adoption, that sort of thing.

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,480
Neil Crooks. So...

286
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,290
So, you're saying he's my brother?

287
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,270
He might be.

288
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,410
Probably turn out to be
a complete coincidence,

289
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,840
so please don't get your hopes up.

290
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Missing persons.

291
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Speaking.

292
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,780
Kieran... Kieran Russell?

293
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,320
Can you just hang on?

294
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,640
Stan, I'm really sorry but
I have to take this. Kieran.

295
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,650
- Legenda não traduzida -

296
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

297
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I'm desperate to find
out anything about Ellen.

298
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,060
What are your plans, Ali?

299
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,110
-I'm gonna stay here.
- So what happened?

300
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,570
Is it about your dad?

301
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,500
We had a row. What about?

302
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,080
When did this row happen Ali?

303
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,000
I thought you said I wasn't in trouble.

304
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,100
Your dad's not angry, Ali, he
just wants you to come home.

305
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,010
So, we sent you to fetch me?

306
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,690
Your mum's worried sick.

307
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Don't.

308
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,290
OK, I'll tell her you
won't be coming home then.

309
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,420
You're over 16 now.

310
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,920
You just say the word and you'll
never have to see her again.

311
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,600
All I know as she loves you very much.

312
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Ali!

313
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm sorry, Mum.

314
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,180
My God, look at you.

315
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,560
You're OK?

316
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

317
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,060
How about a hug?

318
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
You saw the way they
were with each other.

319
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,300
What did you expect him to do?

320
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,240
She said they had a row. How
come he never mentioned it?

321
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,720
Guilt. We see it all the time.

322
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,050
People who are ashamed of something
they said in the heat of the moment.

323
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,300
I think she's terrified of him. There's
something going on in that house.

324
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,340
Do you think we did the right thing?

325
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,920
Don't get carried away.

326
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,900
He's just strict, that's all.

327
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,300
My guess is there will be a hell
of a row in that house tonight.

328
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,500
I hope that's all there is.

329
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,880
Hi, Stewart.

330
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,340
Busy lunch break?

331
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,080
I've got one lead but I'm worried
Stan is pinning all his hopes on it.

332
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,620
- I don't suppose...
- What?

333
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,660
You couldn't get him on
Danny's radio show, could you?

334
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,830
He'd be a great guest and
he certainly likes to talk.

335
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,290
If you think it will help.

336
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,400
And it'll get Danny off my back.

337
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,390
Oh, MJ...

338
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,270
He called. Kieran.

339
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,490
Where did he and Ellen
go after the fire?

340
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Barcelona.

341
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,700
Is she still there?

342
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,640
It's complicated.

343
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,910
Erm... They were drug users.

344
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,450
What kind of drugs?

345
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,040
Heroin.

346
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,320
Kieran got busted, he did
some time in a prison in Spain.

347
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,540
- And Ellen?
- They lost touch.

348
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,800
He said she was in a bad
way the last time he saw her.

349
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,480
I've checked the EU databases and
there's a couple of court appearances.

350
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,260
The last one was four years ago.

351
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,270
Is that it?

352
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,760
There's not many records kept of
people... Of people like Ellen.

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,380
Junkies, you mean?

354
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,030
MJ, I'm sorry.

355
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,540
Welcome back.

356
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,030
You're listening to the Danny
Hayworth show on Dover Radio.

357
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,990
Tonight, we're talking to a man
who's searching for a twin brother.

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,160
His name his Stanley Marsh.

359
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,750
He was born here in Dover
on 4th September, 1940

360
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,100
and lived in the Hadden Street area.

361
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,170
So, Stan, it's a bit of a long shot
after all these years, isn't it?

362
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,820
We think we might have
found him, actually.

363
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,500
Well, I hope not, Stan,
because there goes my show!

364
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,500
- But go on, tell me more!
- His name's Neil Crook.

365
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,070
But we don't know where he is now.

366
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
So, DS Croft, that's a
bit of a breakthrough.

367
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,230
Is this case cracked?

368
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,040
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

369
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,680
I mean, this Neil Crook
is a possibility, Stan,

370
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,710
but without concrete proof,
we need to keep on looking.

371
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,650
The thing is, we share a
birthday. 4th September.

372
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,000
All right, so, if anybody remembers
this Neil Crook,

373
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,610
or if that date rings a bell,

374
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,860
get in contact in the usual
way or log onto the website.

375
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,350
This is the Danny
Hayworth Show, Dover Radio.

376
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,880
What's with the tap, tap, tap?

377
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,770
Are you trying to put people off?

378
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Sorry.

379
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,010
Producer won't let me smoke in here.

380
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,670
- It's driving me nuts.
- Oh, what a fascist!

381
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,990
It's a workplace, Danny.

382
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,750
Smoking is illegal.

383
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,340
I told her, I'm not going
two hours without a fag!

384
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,910
Stop the world!

385
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,700
Dan the man needs his fix!

386
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,850
What's your problem?

387
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,150
She's a junkie, Danny.

388
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,190
My little sister's a heroin addict.

389
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,190
If it hasn't killed her yet.

390
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,140
Sorry.

391
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,130
I was all she had.

392
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,930
I could have stopped it.

393
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,850
Maybe if we find her,
we can get her some help.

394
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,000
Why don't you do us all
a favour and pack up.

395
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,300
Someone sent this in
straight after the show.

396
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,230
And she said she was in
Neil's class at school,

397
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,590
and I think that's him.

398
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,170
That's Neil!

399
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,380
That's of me.

400
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,320
Look at that! We could be twins!

401
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,470
Are you sure, Stan,
it's a 50-year-old photo.

402
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,990
We share a birthday.

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,080
The woman who sent this in said
that Neil was mad about climbing.

404
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Why don't I check out all
the mountaineering clubs.

405
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Sarge?

406
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,450
It's Ali, she's gone again.

407
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,780
I haven't seen her. Seriously.

408
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,790
So, where is she?

409
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,630
I knew this would happen.

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,180
What's happened, Kaz?

411
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,780
Did she tell you anything
about this row with her dad?

412
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,730
She didn't really talk
about it. She was upset.

413
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,270
She said she couldn't go home.

414
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,650
Is that who you're
protecting her from? Her dad?

415
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,560
Kaz, this is really important.

416
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,570
I can't.

417
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,780
It looks like you had a heavy night.

418
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,830
I'm a police officer, Kaz, if I open this,
I'll have to deal with whatever I find inside.

419
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,290
Don't do this. Please.

420
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,990
Look, she started seeing this guy.

421
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,260
We need a name.

422
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Mark. Mark Stone.

423
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,070
Who is he?

424
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,880
Where can we find him?

425
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,340
- I don't know.
- Kaz?!

426
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,690
Please! I've given you his name,

427
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,930
now just leave me alone!

428
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,940
All right. Cheers.

429
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,010
Mark Stone. Who is he?

430
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,980
No arrests. No convictions.

431
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,360
Amy's checked him out. He's clean.

432
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,910
Kaz is lying.

433
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,890
She knows who he is and
she's terrified of him.

434
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,380
I'm gonna give Danny a call.

435
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,150
If this Stone's got
history, he'll know about it.

436
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,120
- Mark who?
- Stone.

437
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,180
Has Ali ever mentioned him at all?

438
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,100
No. Not to me.

439
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,510
Carl?

440
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,690
I thought she was with this Kaz.

441
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,070
Did she say anything last night?

442
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,320
Well, like I told you...

443
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,330
Sorry...

444
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,670
I was asking your husband.

445
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,410
Say anything about what?

446
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,950
I don't know, Carl, your
daughter has run away twice now.

447
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,700
Seems she'd rather be anywhere than home

448
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,840
and I can't help wondering why that is.

449
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,900
- What's he saying?
- What's that supposed to mean?

450
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,390
Ali told us she had a row with you.

451
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,780
There was no row. I was out working.

452
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,360
- What do you do to your daughter?
- Nothing.

453
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,690
- DC Doyle!
- Let's just worry

454
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,850
about where she is, OK?

455
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Thanks for your help.

456
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,100
We'll be in touch.

457
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,560
- What the hell was that all about?
- I think he's abusing his daughter.

458
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,220
Yes, you made that quite clear.

459
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,580
Look how he acted.
He's hiding something.

460
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,970
His daughter is missing, DC Doyle!

461
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,300
He and his wife came to us for help.

462
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,620
You're in MPU now, not Vice,

463
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,280
sorry if you don't like
the way we do things,

464
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,500
- but you'd better get used to it.
- Sarge, there's something...

465
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,670
I am THAT far away from putting you
on report, Jason! So don't wind me up!

466
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,810
Forget about them.

467
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,920
Get back to the office and see
what you can dig up on Mark Stone.

468
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Sarge.

469
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,380
I'm so sorry, Stan.

470
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,380
A climbing accident in the Alps.

471
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,520
What a terrible way to go.

472
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,160
Neil's death was
registered in France.

473
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,520
That's why it didn't show
up on any of our searches.

474
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,280
The Kent Mountaineering Club
had that in their archives.

475
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,590
So, my brother was dead
before I even knew he existed.

476
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,750
Well, we don't know for sure
that he was your brother, Stan.

477
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
And we don't know that he wasn't.

478
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,500
Tell you what, why don't I keep
looking, something else might come up.

479
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,340
No, no, I think I'll leave it.

480
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,600
Actually, I'm very grateful
for everything you've done.

481
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,610
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,840
Stan! Look, Stan, wait!

483
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,320
- Got you a coffee.
- Cheers.

484
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,550
Mark Stone!

485
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,870
You're keeping classy company, as usual.

486
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,470
What was you able to
find out about him?

487
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,630
A mate of mine,

488
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,480
contact from the good old days
when I was out fighting crime...

489
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,790
You were a crime reporter, Danny.

490
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,730
... says he's got a club here
on the harbour on Gable Lane.

491
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,600
It's legit, but he uses it as a front.

492
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,450
- What for?
- Escorts, mainly.

493
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,020
Class A's all the way
down to contraband fags.

494
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,100
Vice can't find a way
in. Nobody's talking.

495
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,510
- Any idea how I can find him?
- Well, you could try the club.

496
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,610
They won't give you anything.

497
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,420
Home address, anybody's guess, sorry.

498
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
- Thanks all the same.
- Always a pleasure.

499
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,390
Here, this is for Amy!
It's more information about Stan.

500
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,100
He's quite a star, you know.

501
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,790
Hmm, you wanna watch they
don't give him your slot!

502
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,120
Look, can we go in now, I'm freezing.

503
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,060
I meant it, you know, what
I said about you quitting.

504
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,050
You're beginning to
sound like my producer.

505
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,830
She's not gonna knock the edges
off Danny Haworth, neither are you.

506
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Kaz?

507
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,850
Kaz? Yeah...

508
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,730
What's the matter?

509
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,130
He'll come back.

510
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,470
He's just a bit shocked.

511
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,380
I hope so. He's convinced
himself that Neil was his brother.

512
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,590
- Was he?
- I don't know for sure.

513
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,950
And how's it going with Ellen,
you found out anything more?

514
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Not a lot.

515
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,920
One last court appearance about
four years ago. Possession, again.

516
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,900
- She get sent down?
- No, she paid the fine.

517
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,730
1,500 euros. How does a smack
head get that kind of cash?

518
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,010
That's what I was wondering.
Maybe she was on the game.

519
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,280
Amy, unless she looks like Keira
Knightley, a junkie prostitute's

520
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,350
- barely gonna make that in a month.
- So...

521
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,100
So, maybe she had a guardian angel.

522
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,760
What, someone was giving her money?
You could check the money wires.

523
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,310
Well, she won't have had a bank account,

524
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,000
but you don't need
one to be wired money.

525
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,990
If you've got a name and a city,

526
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,020
you can try a reverse trace
with all the big firms.

527
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,700
See if anyone has sent any money to her,

528
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,560
if they did, you can track it back.

529
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,760
Thanks, Jason.

530
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,180
How's it going with Ali Hughes?

531
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,710
Oh, it's a brick wall.

532
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,720
Erm...MJ asked if you could see if
there was anything on her dad, Carl.

533
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,410
What kind of thing?

534
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,580
Benefit claims, unpaid parking fines,

535
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,380
credit card history, the works, really.

536
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,930
Leave it with me.

537
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,560
Mark Stone.

538
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,850
He found you, did he?

539
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,980
- No, I went to his place.
- Why?

540
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,620
To get Ali away from there.

541
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,130
She's too young.

542
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,550
For what?

543
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,540
I was Mark's girlfriend, once.

544
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,500
I ran away from home, just like Ali.

545
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,690
There he was, all
smiles and cash, and...

546
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,350
Something to help you relax?

547
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,450
It was exciting. Something else.

548
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,700
Then, he wants you to
meet some of his friends.

549
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,960
Sadly, I'm not his girlfriend any more.

550
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,800
I work for him.

551
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,510
You know?

552
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,780
Is that what Ali is now?

553
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
Mark's girlfriend?

554
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,850
I warned her, but, she saw what
she wanted to see, just like I did.

555
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,790
So you went round to try and talk to
him.

556
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,470
Do you wanna press charges?

557
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,380
32 Elwood Court.

558
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,460
Just leave me out of it, all right?

559
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,290
Mark Stone?

560
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,880
DS Croft, DC Doyle,
Missing Persons Unit.

561
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,510
I was just making some coffee.

562
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,690
- Would you like some?
- Lovely.

563
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Ali Hughes.

564
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,600
Yeah, I know her. Sweet kid.

565
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,940
And no, I haven't seen her, but if I do,
I'll tell her you're looking for her, eh?

566
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,140
Have you got her number?

567
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,310
Yeah.

568
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,330
Hello again, Ali.

569
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,420
- What do you want?
- I think you know.

570
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,260
Let's go back to Kaz's
for a chat, shall we?

571
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
No.

572
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,250
I live here now. With Mark.

573
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,050
And she's 16.

574
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,600
I think she can do what she wants.

575
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,940
And is this what you want?

576
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,040
- Yeah.
- Good luck to you.

577
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Good girl.

578
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,430
Is there nothing we can
do to get her out of there?

579
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,340
Where to? Back home?

580
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,870
I thought her father
was the problem.

581
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,240
So what are you suggesting?

582
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,650
Ali won't leave Mark
Stone till she wants to.

583
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,510
Yeah, but she doesn't want to.

584
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,710
No, I think she does.

585
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,970
This is from Danny. Some more
information for your friend Stan.

586
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,460
Oh, thanks. And that stuff
you wanted is on your desk.

587
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,670
What stuff?

588
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,740
On Carl Hughes.

589
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,990
You wanted me to check him out?

590
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Did I?

591
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,990
I asked her to do that, actually.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,590
After I gave you a
clear order to drop it.

593
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,960
Well it might have turned something up.

594
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It did.

595
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,910
He lost his private
hire licence a year ago.

596
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,140
Right. So he's working illegally.

597
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,960
Tell traffic. Not our problem.

598
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,900
What else you got?

599
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,610
He was questioned a couple of nights ago

600
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,820
about an incident involving
a group of drunken lads.

601
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,420
A couple of nights ago?

602
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,220
That's when Ali went missing.

603
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,300
- Any more details?
- Hang on.

604
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah, he refused to take them in his car

605
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,840
and it was on Gable Lane.

606
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,250
That's where Mark Stone's club is.

607
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,820
Question is, what was
he doing in his car

608
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,110
outside Stone's club,
the night Ali ran away?

609
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,670
Could be a coincidence.

610
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,410
Let me just check the CCTV,
see if there's any connection.

611
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,210
Or, should we just ignore it?

612
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,350
All right. Get on it.

613
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,270
Jason, this close...

614
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,030
Cheers. I owe you one.

615
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,590
Yeah, small point,

616
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,660
next time you're thinking
of lying to me, don't!

617
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,490
This is from the camera that
covers Stone's club two nights ago.

618
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,210
That's Carl going into the club.

619
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,890
Said he'd never heard of him.

620
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,750
Well, have a look at this.

621
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,470
There.

622
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,040
That's Karl and Mark Stone together.

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,300
Where did that bag come from?

624
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,280
Looks suspicious.

625
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,650
Yeah, and if it's drugs,
that's Carl Hughes' courier.

626
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,740
This is where it gets
really interesting.

627
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,580
Yeah, there's our little friend, Ali.

628
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,510
The row!

629
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,900
There it is.

630
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,390
Right.

631
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,210
Let's see what Carl's
got to say for himself.

632
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,060
You knew.

633
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,320
You knew! Our daughter is out there with

634
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,380
this man, and you knew all along.

635
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,970
- Lindy...
- Why didn't you tell me?

636
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,010
- Lindy, I couldn't.
- Who is he?

637
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,500
What is he doing with her?

638
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,000
Lindy, please.

639
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,750
Let's just hear what he's got to say.

640
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,850
I jumped a red light up by the
motorway and nearly hit someone.

641
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,420
I lost my private hire licence.

642
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,530
You what?

643
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,010
One of the other drivers
told Mark Stone about it.

644
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,700
- He offered me some work.
- But that's illegal.

645
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,640
We needed the money, Lindy.

646
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,830
He needed drivers.

647
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,600
Because he couldn't use
legit drivers, could he?

648
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,380
- Not for that.
- Not for what?

649
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,460
What's he mean?

650
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,280
I was...

651
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,530
he needed me to take
people to this place he had.

652
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,360
There were prostitutes, love.

653
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,470
That's what he does.

654
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,330
Oh God, my...my little girl!

655
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,340
What's in the bag, Carl?

656
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,700
- I don't know.
- Carl!

657
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,880
- It's cocaine.
- Cocaine?

658
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,160
He said if I said anything,
he'll send people round here.

659
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,870
He threatened to hurt you.

660
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,770
- To hurt Ali.
- And what about Ali?

661
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,050
When did you know about her?

662
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,290
- Two days ago.
- Oh, the night she went missing?

663
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,680
I didn't know she was seeing him!

664
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,400
But then I saw her at the club.

665
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,740
I tried to get her
home, but she was just...

666
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,960
she just got really angry.

667
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,600
Can I blame her?

668
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,910
There's me working for Mark Stone,

669
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,460
and telling my daughter go
home and be good with her mum.

670
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,100
She told me she hoped
she never saw me again.

671
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,690
- What could I do?
- You could have told me.

672
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,240
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,360
I'm so sorry.

674
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,470
Well, do something. Get her back.

675
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,250
How can I, now?

676
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,520
- Talk to us.
- If it gets him away from her, you have to.

677
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,900
Nah. She'd hate me even more.

678
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,230
I don't think that's possible.

679
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Do you?

680
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,090
Someone was sending
her money every month?

681
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,460
Can you tell me who?

682
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,130
OK, well what about a location...

683
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,800
Kersley?

684
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,650
That's in Kent.

685
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, I found it, thanks.

686
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,110
Amy.

687
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,750
Stan! I've been trying to
get hold of you all day!

688
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,770
Well, I haven't been at home.
I had to go and have a think.

689
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
Just me and Frank.

690
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,350
There was another
call from the radio.

691
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,780
No, no. Look, I'm sorry, Amy.

692
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,310
Neil is dead, I just
came to collect my books.

693
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,250
No Stan, listen.

694
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,370
It's not Neil.

695
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,130
There was this woman, she phoned in,
she worked for a doctor, a GP, and she...

696
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,280
- she sent this in.
- Oh please, Amy.

697
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,250
No, Stan, the dates match, just listen!

698
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,650
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

699
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,940
Stan, please! Her name is Cora.

700
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:32,010
She was a housekeeper for a doctor who
lived on Hadden Street, a Dr. Lacey.

701
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Dr. Lacey?

702
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,560
He was our GP.

703
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,390
She said he and his wife
brought a baby home one night.

704
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,840
Cora knew it was a patient's, but it was
never spoken of and they raised him as her own.

705
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,690
- When?
- The first night of the Blitz.

706
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,210
Stan, I checked the date.

707
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,720
The night the Blitz started?

708
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,750
7th September, 1940.

709
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,500
Three days after my birthday.

710
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,100
Oh, and I found him on the registry.

711
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,570
And...

712
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,790
I found his birth certificate.

713
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,260
"Dear Lottie.

714
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,600
"I just received your letter.

715
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,410
"Twins, that's wonderful news.

716
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,660
"I hope to be home
before they arrive".

717
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,280
My father wrote it three
weeks before he was killed.

718
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,250
"If they're boys, we should name them
after our grandfathers, Stanley and...

719
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,130
- "and David."
- That's the name on here!

720
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,400
David.

721
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,150
Oh... Two of us, I mean, how could
she cope? With my father gone.

722
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,150
Oh, what a terrible choice.

723
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,190
- Poor Mum.
- Stan.

724
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,090
David's alive,
he lives right here, in Dover.

725
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,010
You don't all want coffee, do you?

726
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,100
You're funny.
Where is she? Ali! Ali!

727
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,660
It's all right.

728
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,550
- Who are your boyfriends?
- They're for you.

729
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,720
Sorry there's only two of them,
but the rest are down your club,

730
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,670
turning it over. Jason.

731
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,740
I'm arresting you for possession
of a controlled substance.

732
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,470
This is harassment!

733
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,440
You do not have to say anything,
it may harm your defence

734
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,550
if you do not mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court.

735
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
Just wait here, I'll be back.

736
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,260
I don't think so.

737
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,290
What's going on?

738
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,000
He's a drug dealer, Ali.
Your dad told us the truth.

739
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,640
This is because of my dad?

740
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,280
He gave us a statement. He wants
to talk to you, to apologise.

741
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,350
Oh come on, Ali.

742
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,060
Whatever he's done, he's still your dad.

743
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,780
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.

744
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,260
So, what do you wanna say?

745
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,860
Whatever it is you
were thinking I did...

746
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
is true.

747
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,000
All those things I was
telling you not to do...

748
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,010
Drinking?

749
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,180
Mark Stone threatened me.

750
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,850
He threatened your mum.

751
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,160
Our family.

752
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,500
You must know the sort of
people he hangs about with.

753
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,390
He's a dangerous customer, Ali.

754
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,450
I liked him.

755
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,360
I was driving around his girls.

756
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,410
They're no older than you are.

757
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,850
They're his clients,
he knows what they want.

758
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,840
- He was using you.
- No!

759
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
He wasn't going to...

760
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,980
I couldn't stay at home any more, Dad.

761
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,910
You were just so angry with
me, all the time, for nothing.

762
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,260
I just didn't want you to
mess your life up like I...

763
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,270
Like you?

764
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm not stupid, Dad. I'm not a kid.

765
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
I know.

766
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,830
Sometimes I just really find it...

767
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,870
hard to let go.

768
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,030
I'm sorry, baby.

769
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,180
I'm really sorry.

770
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,060
- Mum, is she OK?
- No.

771
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,800
She wants to kill me.

772
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,520
But most of all, she would
be really glad to see you.

773
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,190
Good result?

774
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,890
Admit it. I was right about her dad.

775
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,940
You were half-right.

776
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,990
And half-wrong.

777
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,290
Kersley.

778
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,780
That mean anything to you?

779
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,830
Where d'you hear that name?

780
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,310
From Capital Express.

781
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,310
Someone from Kersley were
sending money to Ellen.

782
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,470
When? Amy, when?

783
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,980
Every month, until about four years ago,

784
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,350
and then it stopped, suddenly.

785
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,090
A few hundred pounds each time, but
it's just a village, I just don't see...

786
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,270
Kersley.

787
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,860
That's where Mike's husband lives.

788
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,130
I'll take over now.

789
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Amy...

790
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,800
thanks.

791
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,280

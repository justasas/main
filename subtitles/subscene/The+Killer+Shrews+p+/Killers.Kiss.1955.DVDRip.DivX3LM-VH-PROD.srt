1
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:22,056
(steam train)

2
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,370
(PA) The Silver Arrow
for Pittsburgh and Chicago

3
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:47,623
leaving at one o'clock.

4
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,917
(train whistle)

5
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,628
(PA announcement continues)

6
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,395
(bell ringing)

7
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:50,477
(man) It's crazy how you can get
yourself in a mess sometimes

8
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,731
and not even be able to think
about it with any sense,

9
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,568
and yet not be able to think
about anything else.

10
00:01:57,693 --> 00:02:01,238
You get so you're no good
for anything or anybody.

11
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,366
Maybe it begins by taking life too serious.

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,120
Anyway, I think that's
the way it began for me,

13
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,916
just before my fight with
Rodriguez, three days ago.

14
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,293
(phone rings)

15
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,462
- Hello?
- Hello, Davey.

16
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,672
- What kept you?
- How are you?

17
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:27,009
OK, but it's getting late.
I hate to wait around like this.

18
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:32,514
You better hop a cab. I had some trouble
with the car. I'll meet you at the arena.

19
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,725
- OK.
- Right. Bye.

20
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,780
- You're doing all right for yourself.
- What do you mean?

21
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,034
- Oh, he just lives in the building.
- Oh.

22
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,745
- Used to be a pretty good fighter.
- A fighter?

23
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,538
Sure.

24
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:06,001
He's fighting tonight, as a matter of fact.
We can watch him on the TV.

25
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,016
(man) Dear Davey,

26
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,727
we still haven't heard
from you yet this month,

27
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:27,189
and we wondered whether
everything was still all right with you.

28
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,984
Out here everything's about the same.

29
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:34,697
I still get into Seattle every week
and the ranch is prospering nicely.

30
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:39,785
Last week I finally bought
Mr Henderson's chestnut Arabian stallion.

31
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,830
Your Aunt Grace's
arthritis is much better.

32
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,001
She can even take short rides
on Jumper now and then.

33
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,255
Well, I guess that's all now,
except that we miss you a lot, Davey.

34
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,009
Write soon. Love,
Uncle George and Aunt Grace.

35
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,016
(crowd yelling)

36
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,129
(crowd yelling in background)

37
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:29,246
(crowd roars)

38
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,115
(TV)... brings together
two very game boys.

39
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:09,286
The youngster, undefeated in 22
professional encounters, Kid Rodriguez,

40
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,749
and the veteran, Davey Gordon,
who's emerged victorious in 88 fights,

41
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,251
while losing nine and drawing two.

42
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:18,754
Gordon's long career-he's now 29 -

43
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,841
has been one long promise
without fulfilment, at least thus far.

44
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:27,304
As hard a puncher as they come, a clever
boxer, he's been plagued by a weak chin

45
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,557
and the unlucky knack of being
at his worst for the big ones.

46
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:36,271
And tonight is a big one indeed, with
a title bout in the offing for the winner.

47
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:39,608
Now let's take time out for
a friendly word from our sponsor.

48
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,444
How often have you come home
and wanted to feel the...

49
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:29,867
(door opens and closes)

50
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:51,680
(bell)

51
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,784
(crowd roars)

52
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:12,951
One.

53
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,078
Two.

54
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,245
Three.

55
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,372
Four.

56
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:17,623
Five.

57
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:18,874
Six.

58
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,334
Seven.

59
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,002
Eight.

60
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,715
(crowd roars)

61
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:51,675
One. Two.

62
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,552
Three. Four.

63
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,971
Five. Six.

64
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,848
Seven. Eight.

65
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:29,004
(crowd roars)

66
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,215
(bell rings)

67
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:34,218
(din from crowd)

68
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,461
(indistinct announcement on PA)

69
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:18,637
(TV) Tonight we may have seen
ring history in the making,

70
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:21,473
in the form of the young
welterweight Rodriguez

71
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:25,227
and his impressive KO over the
experienced campaigner Gordon.

72
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:28,355
But, for Gordon, tonight
must come as a bitter pill.

73
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:32,318
He was to prove that his glass chin
had been remade into sterner stuff,

74
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:36,572
but, unfortunately for him,
tonight again it was as fragile as ever.

75
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:40,868
It's a well-known ring adage that
too much education spoils a fighter.

76
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,649
(phone ringing)

77
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:04,910
Hello?

78
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,621
(woman) Mr Davey Gordon, please.

79
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,289
That's me.

80
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,001
Just a moment. Your party is on the line.

81
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:15,754
- Hi, Davey. This is Uncle George.
- Hey, Uncle George.

82
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:17,715
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

83
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,511
We're all fine, too. Say, how would you
like to take a vacation out here,

84
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:26,807
spend a little time with us? Country's
mighty nice this time of the year.

85
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,393
It's really nice of you to ask me out but...

86
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:32,646
- Dave, we saw the fight on TV tonight.
- So?

87
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,858
- Nothing. We just saw it.
- Must have looked great.

88
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,528
- Well, these things happen.
- I don't know what happened.

89
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:43,782
Forget it. You need a vacation,
and we haven't seen you for two years.

90
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,493
Why don't you make
a reservation and come on out?

91
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:49,413
Well, look, I don't know.

92
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:53,167
Say, look, I feel
a little dopey right now, George,

93
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,878
but... let me think about it.

94
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,380
I'll, uh... I'll call you.

95
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:02,676
- Wait. You're not hurt, are you, Dave?
- No, no. I'm just tired, that's all.

96
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:05,888
- Good. Let us know as soon as you can.
- Sure.

97
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,267
- Your Aunt Grace sends her love.
- Tell her the same from here.

98
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,355
OK. As it stands now,
you'll let us know when to expect you.

99
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:18,525
I certainly will. Thanks for calling.
It was nice hearing from you.

100
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,236
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too. Good night.

101
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:23,405
Good night, Davey.

102
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:25,759
(man) Go on home, you lying bum!
You're a bum!

103
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,595
Go on home, boy. I don't...

104
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,681
(woman screams)

105
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,892
(woman screams)

106
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:44,236
Hey! What's goin' on in there?

107
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,593
(running footsteps)

108
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,179
(door opens and closes)

109
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,852
(door opens and closes)

110
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,797
There you go. That's better.

111
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,258
Look,

112
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:52,096
if you don't mind me...
if you don't mind me asking you,

113
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,390
what happened?

114
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:58,477
Well, about an hour ago...

115
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,063
(knocking on door)

116
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,582
Well?

117
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,628
What do you want?

118
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,464
I'm sorry.

119
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,175
I really am sorry.

120
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:33,929
- It doesn't matter now.
- I said I'm sorry. Can't you forgive me?

121
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:36,098
- No.
- Please.

122
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:39,435
- Gloria, please.
- Go away.

123
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,645
Get out.

124
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,110
Yeah, that figures to be.

125
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,364
All my life I've always spoiled
the things that meant the most to me.

126
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,452
- All my life.
- I don't care. I just want you to get out.

127
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,746
Gloria, can't you understand?

128
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:02,082
If only you could know
how low and worthless I feel.

129
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,711
- I didn't even know you had any feelings.
- You foolish girl.

130
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,921
I'm mad about you.

131
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:12,301
I wanna get you outta here. I'll set you
up right. I'll be your slave all my life.

132
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,138
- You couldn't do anything for me.
- Don't forgive me, just tolerate me,

133
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:19,892
- And let me suffer, knowing how you feel.
- Can't you get it, Vinnie?

134
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,646
To me you're just an old man.
You smell bad.

135
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,273
I'm mad about you.

136
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:30,110
I can't stand when I see those guys
dancing with you. My insides burst.

137
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,238
- Well, you won't have to see it any more.
- Please.

138
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:37,117
- Please, just another chance.
- No. No chance, no nothing.

139
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:40,037
- Please.
- Let go of me or I'll scream.

140
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,789
(screams)

141
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:53,175
Don't think about it any more.
Why, he won't come back.

142
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:55,260
Don't worry.

143
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:59,098
I'm so tired now.

144
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:02,851
Just close your eyes.
Don't worry about anything.

145
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:06,605
I'll sit here with you.

146
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,602
(music box chimes)

147
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:43,637
(Davey) I locked her door and went home.

148
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:47,516
But first thing in the morning
I went back to see how she was.

149
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:52,604
My knocking woke her up, but she was all
smiles and invited me in for breakfast.

150
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,316
Over coffee she told me
she had seen the fight.

151
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:59,903
I suppose that got me started talking
about myself, about what a washup I was,

152
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:03,449
how I was going back to Seattle
and work on my uncle's ranch.

153
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,743
But when I think back about it now

154
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:09,830
I realise that, all the time I was talking,
the thing that was really in my mind

155
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:14,710
was to remember not to ask what it was
her boss Rappalo was so sorry for.

156
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,630
Anyway, let's talk about you.

157
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,214
Like,

158
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:22,760
who are those people in the picture?

159
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:26,722
And how did you get messed up
with that dance-hall guy?

160
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:28,682
What's the matter?

161
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,267
Nothing.

162
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:35,272
Just that... so funny you should
ask those questions that way.

163
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:37,858
- Together that way.
- Why?

164
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:42,029
Well, they have both
so much to do with each other.

165
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:45,991
- How do you mean?
- It's involved. Do you wanna hear it?

166
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:48,494
If you don't mind telling me, I would.

167
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:51,956
I don't mind. For some reason
I feel like telling you.

168
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,875
I've never told anybody before.

169
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:03,634
This is my father. This is my sister Iris.

170
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:06,971
But I suppose it's really Iris's story.

171
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,558
She was a ballet dancer,
and everyone said she was very good.

172
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:16,021
She adored Daddy,
and of course she was his favourite.

173
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:19,066
But let me start from the beginning.

174
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,443
Iris was eight years old.

175
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,279
Father was a writer
with a growing reputation,

176
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,908
and Mother was very beautiful
and very intelligent.

177
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:31,578
They loved each other very much
and they were very happy.

178
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:36,375
Then I was born and
my mother died on the same day.

179
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,212
They say Father went on
a two-week drunk to celebrate the event.

180
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:44,508
And after that I don't think
he ever thought of another woman.

181
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:49,305
Time passed and Iris grew
more beautiful each day.

182
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,684
She was the image of her mother.
Everyone said so.

183
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:57,855
Iris was Daddy's favourite,
and I was very jealous.

184
00:28:58,063 --> 00:29:00,983
And maybe I began to hate her.

185
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,320
Daddy was good to me.
Maybe he loved me a little, too.

186
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:07,865
By the time she was 20,
she was dancing with the Ballets Russes,

187
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,659
and Daddy was so proud of her.

188
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,164
And then - I remember the day clearly -
it was my thirteenth birthday,

189
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,458
Sunday afternoon.

190
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,503
Iris came home excited
and told us of her marriage proposal.

191
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:26,508
The man wasn't bad-looking,
in his early thirties, and very rich.

192
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,719
Father knew him and liked him,

193
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:32,348
but he couldn't stop laughing
when Iris told how she said no,

194
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:37,478
simply because the fellow wanted her to
give up her dancing and just be his wife.

195
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:41,023
She never said if she loved him or not.

196
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:46,111
Then, a few months later,
Daddy took sick and didn't get better.

197
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,530
And it turned out that he never would,

198
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:51,867
and that he would need constant
medical care until the end.

199
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:54,662
Six months to two years, they said.

200
00:29:56,872 --> 00:30:03,128
Iris's salary wasn't enough, and in two
months' time all our savings were gone.

201
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,131
I couldn't work. I was only 1 3,

202
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,759
still in grade school.

203
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,096
The next thing I knew,
she married her rich suitor,

204
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,976
and we were all living in great style
on his estate in Long Island.

205
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:22,940
Daddy had the best care money could
buy, and he seemed happy despite it all.

206
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:26,360
Iris gave up her dancing,
according to the marriage bargain,

207
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:29,905
and did little else
but sit at Daddy's bedside.

208
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:34,702
Sick as he was, he always laughed
a lot when they were together.

209
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:37,538
I guess I hated her more than ever now.

210
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,877
A year passed like that.

211
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:48,465
Her husband was a sweet man, but
none of us paid much attention to him.

212
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:51,802
And by then I'm sure
he knew she didn't love him.

213
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:54,638
But he never said anything.

214
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:59,727
Then one cold winter morning the maid
woke us and said that Daddy was dead.

215
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:04,315
Iris was like a stone.
She didn't even blink.

216
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,776
I began to cry and shout that I hated her,

217
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:12,865
that she had only pretended with Daddy,
and that she didn't ever love him.

218
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,284
She didn't say a word.

219
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:20,789
In his room she stood quietly over
his body for a long time and smiled.

220
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:25,377
Then she went up to her room
and put on their favourite record.

221
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:29,548
It was from one of her ballets.
She played it very loud.

222
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:35,304
A short time later her husband found her
in bed, the covers drawn up to her neck.

223
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:38,432
She'd cut her wrists and she was dead.

224
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:42,186
She left me a note.

225
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,399
Said she loved me.

226
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,819
She was sorry for making
a mess of everything between us.

227
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:55,324
Later, I was in the city
attending to some legal things,

228
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:57,826
and I happened to pass the dance hall.

229
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,829
Sign read "Pleasureland.
Dancing partners wanted."

230
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:06,377
I don't know what possessed me.
I went up. I actually took the job.

231
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:10,214
I don't understand any part of it.

232
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:13,550
Every night I worked
in that depraved place,

233
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,970
a human zoo.

234
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:21,684
I kept thinking "At least Iris
never had... had to dance like this."

235
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:27,648
And then I started to feel less unhappy.

236
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,902
Come on, let's go out for a walk.

237
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,530
(Davey) We went out for a walk.

238
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:38,158
I bought her an ice cream
and saw her laugh for the first time.

239
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:41,620
We must have walked for hours,
and slowly her mood changed.

240
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,249
She became very happy and
optimistic about life in general.

241
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:48,919
But when I said I was taking
the train back to Seattle the next day,

242
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,505
she got serious again and very quiet.

243
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,093
I didn't know it, but I was already in over
my head and I couldn't have cared less.

244
00:32:56,218 --> 00:33:00,389
We didn't get back until after lunch.
And then in her apartment...

245
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:10,691
Something's happened.

246
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:12,985
I know.

247
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:16,238
- Do you know?
- Sure. You kissed me.

248
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,869
- Is that all?
- That's all I saw. I watched all the time.

249
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,565
I love you.

250
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,984
Love me? That's funny.

251
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:57,821
Why is it so funny?

252
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,406
Why?

253
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,534
It's a mistake to confuse pity with love.

254
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:15,130
Look, Gloria...

255
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:24,723
Looking back now, I don't know
what her reasons were then,

256
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:27,434
but she agreed to come
out to Seattle with me.

257
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,688
I should have had sense enough
to know it was no good,

258
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,065
and she was so scared
she'd grab at anything.

259
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:37,152
But I was kidding myself, and all I could
think of was how much I wanted her.

260
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:41,323
We made reservations and wired Uncle
George to brace himself for a niece.

261
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:43,826
And then we got our finances together.

262
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,745
(phone)

263
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,748
- Yes?
- This is Louie.

264
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:55,296
Gloria Price called to say she's
coming in tonight for last week's salary.

265
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,881
You there, Mr Rappalo?

266
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,509
Thanks.

267
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:45,429
(phone ringing)

268
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:57,441
- Albert?
- Hello, Davey. How are you?

269
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:01,487
OK. Have you got enough money on you
to cash my cheque from yesterday?

270
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:03,697
What's the rush?

271
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:07,952
I don't feel too good. I think I'll go out
to Seattle and take stock of things.

272
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:11,288
- Wait a minute, I'll see.
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

273
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:23,300
- OK. Come on over.
- Say, how about, uh...

274
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:28,305
Pleasureland instead? You know,
that dance hall at 49th and Broadway.

275
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,391
Maybe around eight tonight.

276
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:32,893
I'll be there, but it has to be 8.1 5.

277
00:36:33,102 --> 00:36:35,896
I'm taking my wife to a show.
I'll just make it.

278
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:38,941
- Right. I'll see you there. Take it easy.
- OK.

279
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:06,677
(car horns)

280
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:28,300
- Still feel the same way?
- Yes.

281
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:32,680
- I understand you're going away.
- Yes.

282
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:35,933
- Where?
- That's my business. I came for my pay.

283
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:39,478
Oh, sure. How much do I owe you?

284
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:42,606
- A week.
- Can't you tell me where you're going?

285
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:43,857
No.

286
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:46,568
- Will I ever see you again?
- I doubt it.

287
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:49,154
- I couldn't take that.
- You'll have to.

288
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,325
- That's not true.
- Why isn't it?

289
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:58,038
- I could kill you right here and now.
- Oh, I don't think you will.

290
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:01,875
- I wouldn't be too sure of that.
- Look, Vinnie, I...

291
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,712
I really am in a hurry.

292
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,715
- For what?
- Somebody's waiting downstairs.

293
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:20,144
- You going away with him?
- I don't have to tell you anything.

294
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:23,272
- All the same, you are, aren't you?
- You figure it out.

295
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:25,357
- Then you are.
- No comment.

296
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:28,986
- He's a bum. You'll be grubbing for him.
- Is that so?

297
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:32,656
Sure. Like the man said,
"Can happiness buy money? "

298
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,993
Well, you're a comedian, too.
See what I'm missing?

299
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:43,167
Get out.

300
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:46,920
I'm not asking for favours,
but you owe it to me.

301
00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:50,799
Get out!

302
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:10,194
Hey.

303
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,071
Hey.

304
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,074
Come on, give me back the scarf.

305
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:19,161
Come on. Come on.

306
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:20,704
Hey.

307
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,084
Hey!

308
00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:03,455
(swing music ends)

309
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:24,518
Miss? The boss says he's sorry and if you
go upstairs you can collect your money.

310
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,948
What do you guys want?

311
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,537
Who are you?

312
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,540
Here.

313
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:31,168
Do you want my money? Here, take it.

314
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:18,924
- Where did you go?
- After my scarf. Did you get the money?

315
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:21,302
He said no, then gave me
an extra hundred.

316
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,595
Weird. Did you see Albert?

317
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,806
Somebody was here before.

318
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:04,678
I guess he got tired of waiting.
We'll call him when he gets home.

319
00:44:13,437 --> 00:44:17,524
(Davey) We had ham and eggs and
said goodbye to the bright lights.

320
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:21,070
Downstairs in the courtyard
I suggested that we each get packed

321
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:23,572
and I'd come over when I was through.

322
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:17,645
(distant knocking on door)

323
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:20,564
(man) Open the door.

324
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:25,861
Open the door!

325
00:46:31,408 --> 00:46:33,369
- Looks like he's gone.
- Know where?

326
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:35,245
No, sir.

327
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,957
- Where's he from?
- I don't know.

328
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,252
- When did he leave?
- I don't know.

329
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:02,356
- How long's he lived here?
- Oh, about a year.

330
00:47:02,564 --> 00:47:05,693
- Give me a hand with this drawer.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:12,700
- What kind of trouble is he in?
- Bad trouble.

332
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:16,120
Found his manager's body
an hour ago with his head bashed in.

333
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,793
(policeman) OK. Let's go.

334
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:31,528
(squawking)

335
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:00,099
(car door opens and closes)

336
00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:06,146
Good morning, Mr Rappalo. I'm sorry
I missed you at the arena last week, but...

337
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:09,692
Anyway, Mr Albert
told me to tell you that...

338
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:13,529
That was my manager you knocked off.

339
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,739
- What?
- Where is she?

340
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:17,491
- What?
- The girl!

341
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,202
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

342
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:26,583
I'm gonna count to three, and if you
still don't know I'll blow your brains out.

343
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,460
One. Two.

344
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:30,963
- A loft on 24th Street.
- How'd she get there?

345
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:33,340
- Boys were waiting.
- She all right?

346
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:36,677
Yeah, she's all right. I had to do it.

347
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,431
She saw the boys at the dance hall.

348
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:43,142
She was a witness.
I thought you were dead.

349
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:47,646
They grabbed her and made it look
like she'd left. I thought you were dead.

350
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:51,608
I didn't want murder. It's all gone wrong.

351
00:49:51,692 --> 00:49:53,777
Get goin'.

352
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:34,151
Get 'em up.

353
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,493
(lift whirs loudly)

354
00:50:44,787 --> 00:50:47,164
Is that you, Mr Rappalo?

355
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:49,875
Yes, it's me, boys.

356
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:16,276
Up! Everybody up.

357
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:21,907
Against the wall and lean on your hands.

358
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:30,666
Come on.

359
00:51:57,568 --> 00:52:00,070
- How are you, baby?
- I'm OK.

360
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:03,699
(Davey) I can't get the rope.

361
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:05,909
Be careful.

362
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:11,957
You.

363
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,834
Yeah, you.

364
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,003
Untie her.

365
00:53:14,186 --> 00:53:16,188
Listen, Vinnie.

366
00:53:16,397 --> 00:53:19,316
Don't kill me. I don't wanna die.

367
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:22,319
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

368
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:26,282
You love him, though, don't you?

369
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:29,535
I don't know. I don't think so.
I've only known him two days.

370
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:31,912
Two days!

371
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,748
Please, Vinnie. Please don't kill me.

372
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,085
You said you were mad
about me. Remember?

373
00:53:38,294 --> 00:53:41,505
I'm just an old man and
I smell bad. Remember?

374
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,133
I didn't mean it.

375
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:46,719
You know I didn't mean it.

376
00:54:06,238 --> 00:54:08,824
- We could go away.
- Sure.

377
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,995
Sure. I got lots of money. We could
have loads of fun someplace. Sure.

378
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,831
London. Paris. Sicily.

379
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:18,959
- I'll do anything you want.
- Maybe we could get married.

380
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:21,879
Settle down, have a couple of kids.

381
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,839
Sure.

382
00:54:25,716 --> 00:54:29,261
What do you take me for?
1 4-carat sucker?

383
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:32,389
You and lover boy
won't put me in the hot seat.

384
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:36,060
You liked me once. Remember?
Remember how nice it was?

385
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:39,688
- It could be like that again.
- You're forgetting about him?

386
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:41,982
- I don't care.
- You could have had anything,

387
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:46,362
but you were too good for me. So you
come up to my office and get me mad.

388
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,490
I send the boys to work over lover boy.
They grab the wrong guy.

389
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:53,369
He bangs his head too hard on the
sidewalk. That makes me the sucker?

390
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,955
Not on your life, baby. Not on your life.

391
00:54:58,582 --> 00:55:00,042
Hey!

392
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,467
Don't shoot. C'mon.

393
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,725
Stay with her. Go ahead!

394
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:51,844
He went down there.

395
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:57,182
Be careful. It's a dead-end alley.
He'll never get out.

396
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:55,366
Look out!

397
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:03,916
Get that down. C'mon, hurry.

398
00:58:49,313 --> 00:58:51,315
Oh! Oh.

399
00:58:51,523 --> 00:58:53,692
- What's the matter?
- My leg.

400
00:58:53,817 --> 00:58:55,903
- Come on!
- I can't.

401
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,255
I got him.

402
00:59:57,214 --> 00:59:58,882
I gotta get outta here.

403
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:15,769
(siren)

404
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,786
I don't see anything. Do you, Joe?

405
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:37,666
Let's go up and have a look anyway.

406
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,739
(howling)

407
01:04:37,703 --> 01:04:40,497
(Davey) When the cops came
I took them to free Gloria.

408
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:42,708
The guy on the roof was picked up later.

409
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:45,711
On the ride to the police station
Gloria didn't say much.

410
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:50,215
I guess she was trying to work out in
her own mind why I ran and left her alone.

411
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:55,012
I don't suppose she thought how I felt,
listening to her talk to Rappalo that way.

412
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:57,723
At the station
they separated us for questioning.

413
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:00,726
Five hours later they chalked off
Rappalo as self-defence

414
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:05,314
and had worked a confession from
the hoods on Albert's murder. I was free.

415
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:09,610
On my way out, the desk sergeant
said Gloria had left an hour before.

416
01:05:09,693 --> 01:05:13,989
There was no message for me, and I
haven't heard from her or seen her since.

417
01:05:14,198 --> 01:05:16,700
And now I don't suppose I ever will again.

418
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:19,495
Anyway, I guess
the whole thing was pretty silly. :

419
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,331
know a girl for two days and fall in love.

420
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:26,919
So I cashed my cheque, sent flowers
to Albert's widow, cleaned up,

421
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:28,879
and here I am.

422
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,756

423
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:34,510

1
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,912
Ramón?

2
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,992
Ramón?

3
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,393
Ramón!

4
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,279
- What have they done to you?
- Father...

5
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,992
Holy Mother of God!

6
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,390
Look how they messed up
my son...

7
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,236
Stay calm, Ramón.

8
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,073
You'll recover in no time.

9
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,197
All we can do now, is to ask
Barrett for more time.

10
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,191
He will never listen to us.

11
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,748
Believe me son,
it is worth a try!

12
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,559
I wonder why Barrett is so interested
in taking our land away from us.

13
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,760
Why did he give us the money?
Being nice? No...

14
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,112
Barrett is after our land.

15
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,159
He owns 8.000 animals
he has to feed every day.

16
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,754
They already cleared out
many settlers...

17
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,876
By now they
own the property.

18
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,876
When mother and I arrived here,
there was nobody living 'round this place.

19
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,673
The two us worked hard with
our bare hands in the fields.

20
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,356
For two years we ate nothing
but turnips.

21
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,556
The land appeared
to be dead.

22
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,359
A dried out, godforsaken
dusty stony desert.

23
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,468
During the wintertime too frozen
to get a nail into the ground.

24
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,759
Dried out during the summertime,
not a single worm lived in the ground.

25
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,799
But after two years
the land awakened...

26
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,793
Green grass appeared
when the snow melted.

27
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,556
Then came the rain,
and the grain started to grow.

28
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,917
Then you were born.

29
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,829
Your mother died on this land.

30
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,951
She cared for it
to the very last minute.

31
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,352
And the two of us
buried her here on this land.

32
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,396
You remember,
don't you Ramón?

33
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,073
Nobody will run me off
this place!

34
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,436
And those who will try
I'm gonna kill!

35
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,751
Go and see Barrett, Ramón.
Tell him, we're gonna pay him.

36
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,831
We are honest folks.

37
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,159
Ramón!

38
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,152
Tell him, we're gonna pay him.
We are decent people.

39
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,794
Let's learn those bastards a lesson!
Mount up and come on!

40
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,235
I won't, Steven.
I don't like that kind of game.

41
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,949
What's your choice? You want them
going on burning down our houses?

42
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,032
We won't gain anything burning theirs!
The law will protect us!

43
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,874
Did you hear that? The law!
The sheriff couldn't care less.

44
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,431
We have to take the law in our own hands,
or they will run us off our land!

45
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,670
That's right, Ramón.
We have to find justice for us!

46
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,275
Justice this ain't! It is revenge you want!
Go ahead! But leave me out of this!

47
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,193
What if they had burned down your house
instead of Kenneths place?

48
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,272
- What if they had killed your wife?
- They didn't kill anybody.

49
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,351
They beat them up
and burned the crop!

50
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,715
Go tell the sheriff!
After all it's his job!

51
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,998
You are one lousy bastard!
A coward! Just a dirty Mexican!

52
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,709
Leave him alone, Mick!
We don't need people like him!

53
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,594
Just pray, they won't be after
you next time!

54
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,399
If they burn your house,
don't come and see us about it.

55
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,597
Just remember that
you asked for it!

56
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,679
You did fine my son.
Revenge is too easy and unnecessary.

57
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,479
What will be left is a bitter taste,
like eating a green fruit.

58
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,791
But you know that already,
don't you, Ramón?

59
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,038
Stick' em up!

60
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,508
Hurry up bastards!
Hurry up!

61
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,352
Burn the house down!
Hurry up!

62
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,635
Burt!
This man wants to see Mister Barrett.

63
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,990
I have to talk to Mister Barrett.
Where can I find him?

64
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,875
Hey, did you see him?

65
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,313
Here is Ramón.

66
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,917
- Why would Mister Barrett talk to you?
- I'm supposed to bring the mortgage.

67
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,231
- Do you have the money?
- Well, to be honest...

68
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,029
I had the money.
I wanted to tell him that, but...

69
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,199
He took it away from me!
I recognize him!

70
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,555
I was attacked and
Mister Barrett's money was stolen.

71
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,474
- What are you talking about, Bastard?
- It was him. I was robbed, I swear to God!

72
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,313
- It was four of them!
- Did you ever saw this panhandler before?

73
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,676
Not that I recall, Boss.
Lots of panhandlers around this area here.

74
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,876
Sure, but but this one here
calls you a thief.

75
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,555
Let him go and let him repeat
what he just said.

76
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,473
I will,
you are a lousy thief!

77
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,599
What's going on, Slim?

78
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,233
What's wrong with you?
Beating up a guy in my house?

79
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,074
This man says Slim stole money from him
that he was going to bring to you.

80
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,434
That's right.

81
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,557
Ramón,
I was expecting you.

82
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,074
Is that story true?
Who robbed you?

83
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,948
He and three others robbed me while
I was on my way to bring you the money.

84
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,632
Is he right?

85
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,035
- Is it true?
- He is a dirty lyer!

86
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,032
I saw him!
I tore his mask down his face!

87
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,635
- Can you prove what you say?
- No, I was all alone.

88
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,553
I can assure you I'm not wrong
about this. It WAS him.

89
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,391
That is
a serious accusation.

90
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,914
If you can't prove it, you are
in serious trouble.

91
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,389
Believe me, I was on my way
to bring you the money.

92
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,471
I think, he has no money
to pay you.

93
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,279
That's why he came up
with that story.

94
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,273
Now I have no money left to pay you,
but I'm asking you to give me more time.

95
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,717
You should have ask me without
calling my men thieves.

96
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,552
Explain to him that he was wrong.

97
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,076
I'll get it into his head!

98
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,634
Now Ramón, are you still believing
it was me who robbed you?

99
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,598
- Yes, you are a thief!
- What are you saying? I can't hear you.

100
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,399
Speak up,
tell my friends too.

101
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,710
You are
a bunch of thieves!

102
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,830
We're wasting time here.

103
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,629
I want to see you becoming a gentleman.
Don't tell any lies.

104
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,713
Now try to remember.
The guy who robbed you, how did he look like?

105
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,633
He had the face of a thief,
just like yours!

106
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,229
You better admit you made up this story
so you don't have to pay the mortgage.

107
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,355
I didn't, you thief!

108
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,311
When did you came up with that idea
I had robbed you?

109
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,277
You claim to know better
where I was and what happened?

110
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,794
You never saw me there,
ain't that so, Ramón?

111
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,235
You stole the money!

112
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,799
Hurry up guys,
come here!

113
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,036
What happened?
Talk!

114
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,275
Steven burned down the house
at Paso Bolt.

115
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,358
Move on, saddle the horses
and wait for me.

116
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,915
The settlers burned down
the camp at Paso Bolt.

117
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,756
We're wasting time, Barrett.
We have to give them hell.

118
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,116
- If you'd let me go ahead...
- Seems you always do what you want.

119
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,795
- Who burned down Kenneth's Ranch?
- It was necessary.

120
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,871
They wouldn't let pass through
our cattle.

121
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,669
- And they polluted the water.
- I don't like that kind of action.

122
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,151
- By now you should know that.
- I don't care what you like.

123
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,708
You can put on your gentleman
act as much as you want...

124
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,588
...but don't forget that
we are equal partners.

125
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,710
Don't worry,
I won't forget.

126
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,476
But don't come complaining once
the settlers start burning down our camps.

127
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,552
I don't want to start a war
with the settlers, Burt.

128
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,518
I just want the land, that's all.

129
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,353
I prefer to get it by
any means legal.

130
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,036
Legal? You'll spend years trying
to get rid of them adopting lawful means.

131
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,872
Why are you
in such a hurry, Burt?

132
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,997
Steven is gathering all
the settlers around him.

133
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,789
- And once they are united...
- I'll take care of Steven.

134
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,350
You know, certain matters take
a lot of thinking and quietness.

135
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,192
I'm tired of being quiet!

136
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,750
While we wait they might
start using barbwire.

137
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,799
- They'll start giving you hell...
- Enough now, Burt!

138
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,792
You take care of the cattle,
I'll take care of the rest.

139
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,678
Don't talk to me that way!

140
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,638
You think
you are smarter than I am?

141
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,077
You treat me like a bully, because
I don't take my hat off in front of women...

142
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,559
...the way you do it.

143
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,349
Don't forget, I know you as well
as the smell of my own feet.

144
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,355
I could lock you up in jail
while burping in the sheriffs face!

145
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,159
Let's go
and thank those bastards!

146
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,949
Anybody with a weak stomach,
now is the time to tell...

147
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,958
Well hello, Rezza.
Didn't see you for a while...

148
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,678
I'd say so.

149
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,675
You still charge that much?

150
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,678
Even more.

151
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,639
Right. Actually that's why
I'm hiring you.

152
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,350
- Good work has its price.
- We'll see, Mister Barrett.

153
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,237
What are we talking about?

154
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,192
- What's this all about?
- Burt.

155
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,829
- You're short 1.000 Dollars.
- Take this for a start.

156
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,434
In one month you'll
get another 10.000.

157
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,478
When did you become
a benefactor?

158
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,029
Who do you want to kill?
The governor?

159
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,469
- Someone more important.
- He's worth 10.000 Dollars?

160
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,233
Dead even more, you can
count on that.

161
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,199
Maybe it's none of my business,
but why in a month and not now?

162
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,874
A bit of time will
calm the waves first.

163
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,191
By then the farmers will
stop acting like defenders.

164
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,556
In the meantime they'll run
further into dept...

165
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,838
At the right moment,
I'll go after them.

166
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,309
You're 1.000 Dollars short, Senor.
I won't work for less.

167
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,631
Alright, Rezza.

168
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,914
But don't forget to be
secretive about it!

169
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,389
The man will die
at his own hands.

170
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,392
The two of us have a deal then.
I'll expect you in one month.

171
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,755
But I warn you,
it's going to be a difficult job.

172
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,310
I'll keep in shape, Senor.
Besides, a month passes by so quickly.

173
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,793
And don't forget: I'm the one
around here who gives the orders!

174
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,510
Those you give to me cost a fortune.
You better not waste them.

175
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,032
Seven...

176
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,110
...seems to be
your lucky day.

177
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,839
That's the fifth time
you got seven.

178
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,196
- Are you saying that I'm cheating?
- No, I don't. Heaven forbid.

179
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,589
I would never
dare to say so.

180
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,029
Then I guess
I heared wrongly.

181
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,391
Go ahead,
bet your money.

182
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,835
Who's holding the bank?

183
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,717
Nobody's holding the bank?

184
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,318
It's a town
of starving people!

185
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,911
This place should get rid of the pigs
that pollute it!

186
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,954
You could start
by hanging yourself, Burt.

187
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,036
When talking about pigs, you were
talking about yourself, right?

188
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,395
Stop it or I'll call the sheriff!

189
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,679
- Get out to settle your affair!
- Out of my way, Lady!

190
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,514
You think you can scare me off
with your lady manners?

191
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,797
Stop it, Burt.
You drank too much.

192
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,190
- I'll go and tell Barrett.
- Go to hell!

193
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,397
You and Barrett,
that quitter!

194
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,994
I do as I please.

195
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,435
I'm not his mistress.

196
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,029
You dirty whore!

197
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,278
- You're gonna pay for that!
- Watch out, Burt!

198
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,319
The boss doesn't like that kind of talk
when it comes to his broad.

199
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,230
Barett, Barrett, Barrett!

200
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,158
Barrett is trash,
just like her!

201
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,110
So you left Ramón
to become a lady.

202
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,639
But you always stayed a whore!

203
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,719
What's going on?
Who fired his gun?

204
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,917
Seems like no one wants to talk?

205
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,788
The next time I'm gonna
arrest all of you!

206
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,754
Rum.

207
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,594
Seven.

208
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,792
Hey!

209
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,395
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- I won't continue with this game.

210
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,993
Rum.

211
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,119
- No easy way out. I'm losing.
- But you're winning 500 Dollars.

212
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,953
My friend says he's losing,
so he's losing.

213
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,234
I'm the one
who's behind.

214
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,108
What kind of gentleman would leave
the table while winning.

215
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,159
No more games my friend,
bet your money!

216
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,870
Don't think about it. Hold the bank,
it might pay off.

217
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,678
Go on, bet your money

218
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,518
Will you hurry up?

219
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,873
Put on Banco.

220
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,670
Banco!

221
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,469
Not you my friend.

222
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,597
- Not you I said.
- You heard him?

223
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,273
Thanks.

224
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,116
Banco.

225
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,639
Banco.

226
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,478
Seven.

227
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,637
You are a cheat.

228
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,231
You hear me?
You are cheating!

229
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,749
My name is Rezza.
I acted in self-defense.

230
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,115
If you want to,
tell it everybody.

231
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,071
Slim! You thief!
Murderer!

232
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,232
- Is he hurt?
- There's a bullet in his shoulder.

233
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,276
- You know him?
- yes.

234
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,750
Take him away, I beg you.
He is Mexican, they will blame him.

235
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,432
I beg you for it.

236
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,994
For the first time in my life
I have to thank somebody...

237
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,435
...and I do it with pleasure.

238
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,036
Don't worry, I'll return him
once he has recovered.

239
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,990
- What happened?
- Archangel Gabriel came along.

240
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,991
And disappeared again.

241
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,994
There's a bullet
in your shoulder.

242
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,952
Try not to move.

243
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,794
I'll try to get it out,
but it won't be easy.

244
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,239
Take it.
Drink it, it's coffee.

245
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,319
As you wish.

246
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,119
What's your name?

247
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,511
You lost your voice?

248
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,797
You still had it when
you tried to kill that man.

249
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,317
Listen to me, Chico:
Shoot first and then talk.

250
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,354
Nobody listens
to that crap anyway.

251
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,240
So it's better
not to talk at all.

252
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,998
Are you afraid?

253
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,070
Let's see whether you
really lost your breath.

254
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,672
Drink, Chico!

255
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,200
So you still have a voice!

256
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,634
Hey Chico, it's thougher
to get it out...

257
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,196
...than to get it in.

258
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,478
At least for me it is.

259
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,395
Drink.

260
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,475
In a few days you're free to go
wherever you want to go to.

261
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,995
The girl is waiting for you.

262
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,160
Hey Chico,
you still think of that girl?

263
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,959
What's her name?

264
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,231
- I don't know.
- She is very pretty.

265
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,517
I bet a lot of bastards
are chasing her around.

266
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,113
I used to know one like her too.

267
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,078
For a dollar she'd spend
a night with you.

268
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,314
She had a boyfriend.
A Mexican just like you.

269
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,517
This guy
was really tight-lipped.

270
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,513
Believe me, Chico,
the boy really was in love with her.

271
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,550
He even promised her,
to marry her someday.

272
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,393
,, For what you need her, just give
her a Dollar", some said.

273
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,869
,, Why would you
marry her?"

274
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,274
Whenever she took some guy to bed
with her, he took his rifle and shouted...

275
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,715
...he was going
to kill them.

276
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,710
In the end he married her.

277
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,749
When he was away to work, she
brought in men and paid them.

278
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,439
- One Dollar, to be specific.
- Enough now!

279
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,478
Hey Chico, what's the matter?

280
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,031
Go to sleep and forget about it.
Women are all alike anyway.

281
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,156
What are you doing?
Are you leaving?

282
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,313
That's fine.

283
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,439
We are even now.
You have a nice trip, Chico.

284
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,077
Hey Chico!

285
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,916
Where are you
going anyway?

286
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,032
Why don't you stay a while.

287
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,236
There's still time to go away.
But don't act like a mummy.

288
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,995
- If I stay, I want to learn from you.
- What do want to learn?

289
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,832
How to shoot.

290
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,190
Don't wait until you're running
out of bullets before you reload.

291
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,637
Fire off five shots and then reload.
So there's always one left in the chamber.

292
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,952
Stand tall.
Just like that.

293
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,396
First stretch your arm,
then we'll go on.

294
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,799
Go!

295
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,912
Too low.

296
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,039
Too high.

297
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,118
Now!

298
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,157
No, not like that. You have to
do it with the first shot, Chico.

299
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,471
There's no risk shooting at bottles.
But facing a man armed with a gun...

300
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,870
...you either kill him or
he might kill you.

301
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,873
Hit him with your first shot
or it will be too late, Chico.

302
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,911
I would never have guessed
that you can play.

303
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,310
I used to play a lot.

304
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,470
The place I grew up,
there was an old man.

305
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,473
Each day at dawn I saw
him play on the street.

306
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,278
Where were you born?

307
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,634
Down south. Walk towards the sun
and sooner or later you'll get there.

308
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,029
Why don't you
go back there?

309
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,151
I will return. I hardly can wait.
Two more weeks and I'm on my way.

310
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,832
Why not now?

311
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,152
There's something left to do.
An important job, maybe the last one.

312
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,393
What kind of job?

313
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,517
None of your business, Chico.
Actually it's not even my business.

314
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,636
I only know I get paid well.

315
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,757
I wanna take the money, go home
and see whether the old man still lives...

316
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,070
...playing music at dawn.

317
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,589
Margaret, come here.

318
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,352
Sit down.

319
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,432
You want a sip?

320
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,030
That's enough now.

321
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,830
You are some kind of guy...

322
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,710
How come, Mister Barrett
is not here yet?

323
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,759
Relax, Paquito.
Barrett is always on time.

324
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,515
You never know when he comes,
but he always comes.

325
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,111
Any more words
and I'll fire you.

326
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,078
Hello.

327
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,749
An interesting table.
May I join you?

328
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,116
- We're playing low stakes.
- Very well...

329
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,278
This place surely changed since
poor Burt left it for good.

330
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,036
- It became less amusing.
- Nobody misses him, Mister Barrett.

331
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,793
You probably
the least of all.

332
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,111
- He was a true friend.
- A son of a bitch.

333
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,150
Whatever. I'm sure now everything
will fall into places.

334
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,152
We have to work together
and change this land...

335
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,708
...into a paradise.

336
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,597
You said that before.

337
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,993
I just discovered my love
for this land my dear...

338
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,471
No matter what it produces.
I'm just a simple man.

339
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,358
I have to talk to you.
Please excuse us.

340
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,510
Just a moment gentlemen.

341
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,552
- A common thief.
- The land that he loves belongs to others.

342
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,710
First and final
commandment:

343
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,314
Do not steal
your neighbors land...

344
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,960
...but die on your own.

345
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,718
Amuse yourself? What's the big joke?
I'd like to see you...

346
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,998
You'll never see me
like that, Chico.

347
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,319
What do you think you got,
holding a gun in your hand?

348
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,153
- A weapon.
- No, Chico.

349
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,553
Just an excuse to get killed.

350
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,916
A gun means nothing
unless you can use it!

351
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,515
- But I'm learning.
- How to shoot, but that's not enough.

352
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,398
This here is you
and that's your opponent.

353
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,949
You're facing each other,
equal rivals.

354
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,237
Each one carries a gun,
each loaded with six bullets.

355
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,673
You're all ready to shoot.

356
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,911
But one of you is in a better position:
the one with the sun behind his back.

357
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,755
First: with the sun behind your back
your opponent stands in full light.

358
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,556
Second: that way your opponent
has difficulties seeing you that well.

359
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,437
Watch your shadow,
Chico.

360
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,909
If you see it in front of you,
you can draw.

361
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,039
If you don't see your shadow, wait.
Move slowly until you see it.

362
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,236
While you're moving,
wet your lips.

363
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,754
Wet them all around.

364
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,637
If it feels cold on the right side,
the wind is coming from that direction.

365
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,712
If it's cold in the middle, the wind
is blowing right into your direction.

366
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,678
Facing the wind is bad.

367
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,228
It will slow down your shot.
It's better to have the wind in your back.

368
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,233
- It won't affect you then.
- What if it blows from the side?

369
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,996
You have to learn to judge its strength.
If you see dust, the wind is deep and strong.

370
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,993
If the leaves in the trees move,
the wind is high up and blowing less hard.

371
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,389
How do you judge the wind?

372
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,398
I feel it in my hairs, Chico.
That's why I wear them long.

373
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,190
It's all instinct, like being an animal.
Forget that you are a human being.

374
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,948
You have to feel like an animal
facing another animal.

375
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,918
Your whole body must be dedicated to kill.

376
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,992
Your skin, your breath, your eyes.

377
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,356
Everything can help you getting
some kind of advantage.

378
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,638
- How come you know these things?
- I understand and learned them, Chico.

379
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,271
When you're facing death,
you feel like an animal.

380
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,476
Nothing but an animal.

381
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,352
If you refuse to become one,
you might not survive.

382
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,112
Did you ever see a mountain lion?

383
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,998
If he's hungry,
he'll slowly walk around.

384
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,356
Then he suddenly stops, stretches out
his snout and waits.

385
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,829
- He doesn't move, just stands still.
- Why?

386
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,478
He smells the wind.

387
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,958
As soon as he feels it,
he stops in his tracks...

388
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,793
...and the wind supplies
him with all kind of smells...

389
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,156
Once he likes a smell, he jumps
and stays leeward.

390
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,676
That way his victim smells him too late,
when he is already on it.

391
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,629
Remember, in a duel of life and death,
the winner is the one with more will to live.

392
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,950
And the living usually are more
hungry than the dead.

393
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,032
You don't eat
before a duel?

394
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,157
No, I just shave.

395
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,119
If someone faces death and
he bothers to shave...

396
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,558
...you can be damn sure he rather
wants to live than to die.

397
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,077
Just like you?

398
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,116
Yes...

399
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,876
I'm not like you.

400
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,879
- My life is not that important to me.
- This too could be an advantage.

401
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,315
You could become an
excellent killer.

402
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,915
Some sort of killing machine.
You could make a lot of money.

403
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,797
I'm not interested in money.

404
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,509
Chico, this girl, she'd appreciate you staying
alive much more than being dead, right?

405
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,079
No.

406
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,350
You're so right.

407
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,120
It's impossible to understand women.

408
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,354
They're like walls: you never know
what's on the other side.

409
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,877
There's a barrier you'll you never
break down, once you killed someone.

410
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,637
- What is that?
- Society.

411
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,190
They will build up a high wall
in front of you, they will respect you.

412
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,475
They will fear you
but never love you.

413
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,836
You'll always stay on one side
of that wall.

414
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,198
- Better that way.
- That's what I used to think.

415
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,193
Then one day you realise life is
on the other side of that wall...

416
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,113
...and you are
no part of it. Ever.

417
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,512
- I think you're getting old.
- Maybe.

418
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,309
I'm tired of this life.
You're always alone, like a dog...

419
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,710
...and you're waiting to die
like a dog, only more miserably.

420
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,756
You're the only friend
I ever met, Chico.

421
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,633
Probably because I never
wanted any friends before.

422
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,313
Are you sure
I am your friend?

423
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,796
Sure, and you can be
sure I am yours.

424
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,873
So take care, you said you still
have a job to do.

425
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,589
Do it first and then think
of the rest.

426
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,873
- You taught me that.
- You're right, Chico.

427
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,632
Work comes first.

428
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,431
You know, Chico,
friendship is one of those things...

429
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,592
...you leave behind at the other
side of that wall.

430
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,829
For ever.

431
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,509
Remember that once you killed
somebody for the very first time.

432
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,918
- I'm gonna tear you to pieces!
- He's letting you have it.

433
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,515
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Order is order.

434
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,519
Enough now!
Stop it I said!

435
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,149
What the hell is the matter with you?
Enough now!

436
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,993
He attacked one of my men
who was unarmed.

437
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,469
Are you crazy?
He attacked me from behind!

438
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,313
He was still not armed
and you are carrying a gun!

439
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,870
My men had enough of
those provocations.

440
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,192
Listen sheriff, I can't calm them down
anymore by now.

441
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,752
Maybe I should put you all in jail
and call the federal judge!

442
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,400
Don't tell any jokes,
sheriff.

443
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,074
If someone has to be
locked up, it's Steven!

444
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,311
He attacks my men as soon as
they are unarmed!

445
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,472
Don't expect to get rid of me
that way, Barrett.

446
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,120
I respected the cease-fire.

447
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,317
But from now on my men
will be heavily armed.

448
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,072
You want a war on your hands,
you got it!

449
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,390
- Dirty bastards!
- Let it be, Steven!

450
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,951
For now I'll lock you up to
calm you down. Then we'll see...

451
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,159
Alright, Chico.

452
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,198
You aim well.

453
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,270
- You're sure to go ahead.
- I proved that, didn't I?

454
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,759
Well...

455
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,599
So you don't mind
facing me in a duel?

456
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,549
- You still want to test me?
- No, Chico. A duel. For real.

457
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,357
If you can kill me,
it will mean you are ready.

458
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,191
No, I won't do that.
I might really kill you.

459
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,957
Are you accepting or
are you a coward?

460
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,439
No.

461
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,793
A real duel, Chico.
Try to kill me - if you can.

462
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,232
So your life isn't important to you.
You are afraid to die, that's it.

463
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,869
Once you are dead, that girl will find
100 men better than you are.

464
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,518
Don't worry.

465
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,990
Then do it for her, give her the chance
to improve herself.

466
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,868
You asked for it.
If I succeed I'm gonna kill you!

467
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,714
That's the way I like you, boy.
We're equal opponents.

468
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,758
So it's either me or you!

469
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,357
Hey, here I am!

470
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,551
Go ahead, kill me!

471
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,313
You felt secure,
you needed a cold shower.

472
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,595
If you can count up to 'six'
you can save yourself.

473
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,389
Otherwise you've had it.
Remember that, son.

474
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,390
It's called math, Chico.

475
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,189
You have to count.
All the time.

476
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,196
Count the steps,
count the shots.

477
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,592
Yours and those
of your opponent.

478
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,473
Count, Chico, always count.
Count the minutes.

479
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,235
No one can hold a pistol
for longer than three minutes...

480
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,880
...without starting
to tremble.

481
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,394
Once you start trembling
you're the loser.

482
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,757
Count Chico,
always count.

483
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,674
If your opponent makes a step
and then stops, he's afraid.

484
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,479
If he makes two steps
he is uneasy.

485
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,632
If makes three steps
he's about to kill you.

486
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,631
Why this cross?

487
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,316
If this bullet hits you it will
have the impact of a canonball.

488
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,676
If such a bullet hits its target,
you can't go wrong.

489
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,318
What's your job?
Who has to die?

490
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,271
I don't know yet,
I don't know him.

491
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,954
Tomorrow will be my last day
as a warrior.

492
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,994
- Then I'm gonna change my life.
- How?

493
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,548
I told you, Chico.

494
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,509
I'll go back to where I came from.
Settling down, raising a family.

495
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,750
A wife maybe.

496
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,149
If that old man is still there,
playing music at dawn...

497
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,789
...I'm gonna invite him to my house
and give him food and drinks.

498
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,348
He may lie down on a bed.

499
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,317
And I will say to him:

500
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,874
,, You walked a long way, old man.
Now it's time to rest.

501
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,838
I saw you walking around
since I was a little boy."

502
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,554
- He must have rested along the way.
- I only saw him walking around.

503
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,315
As far as I'm concerned
that old man never stopped walking.

504
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,116
That old man is you.

505
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:44,236
And now your mind is set on climbing
that wall you talked about.

506
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,118
- Maybe.
- Don't think too much about it.

507
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,031
I was only joking.

508
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,233
How come you never asked me
why I wanted to learn how to shoot?

509
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,835
Because I knew it.
You're out to kill someone.

510
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,354
Yes, but who?
Don't you want to know?

511
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,877
Maybe yourself.
The old Chico you once was.

512
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,078
I saw many people die,
it doesn't affect me any longer.

513
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,199
I'm sorry I'm leaving you behind.
You'll be in a lot of touble.

514
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,113
- I'm sure.
- Don't worry about me.

515
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,838
I know what I'm doing.

516
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,513
I'm sorry
I can't support you.

517
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,955
One thing
I can do for you.

518
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,632
Take this. You'll find everything:
A razor, a brush and a mirror.

519
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,711
- Thank you.
- Shave my son.

520
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:27,157
Remember: who bothers to shave
rather wants to live than to die.

521
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,959
Chico!

522
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,117
Practice, practice all the time.
Getting better will cheer you up.

523
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,431
If you miss you'll never
know what you're missing anyway.

524
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,557
- Good luck!
- But... Hey!

525
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,474
- So you missed it too?
- Who can tell, my boy?

526
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,993
Life is an illusion.

527
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,516
The important thing is to believe
that you can make it! Farewell.

528
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,113
- Ramón was here.
- Ramón...

529
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,990
...was here.
And who is Ramón?

530
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,790
You forgot about him?

531
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,437
But he remembered you.

532
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,876
He came back here
because of you.

533
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,071
- He wants to kill you.
- Kill me?

534
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,357
- But why?
- You better ask him.

535
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,908
He said he has time.
That he waited for so long...

536
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,037
...a day more or less
won't make a difference.

537
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,112
What are you talking about?
Come on, tell me what you know!

538
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,636
Seems that you strechted things
with this boy, Barrett.

539
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,874
There's only one thing left for you:
Kill him.

540
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,713
Maybe you'd do him
a favour with that.

541
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,840
Unless he kills you. He might gain
a greater pleasure from that.

542
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,559
Thank Barrett I let you go,
he asked me for it.

543
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,077
He promised he'd do his best
to avoid further incidents.

544
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,869
I can't believe what I hear, Sheriff.
You all believe that Barrett is an angel.

545
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,349
Be prepared for a big surprise.

546
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,913
- Come on Steven, he's no devil.
- He is a devil.

547
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,471
As long as I am here,
the settlers will keep their land.

548
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,950
It would be better if you would
not help this bastard.

549
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,399
Ramón.

550
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,311
May God forgive him.

551
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:25,071
1.000 Dollars for the man
who will bring me the murderer!

552
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,471
Hey Ramón! Barrett said
you wanted to talk to him.

553
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,518
With Barrett, not with
his bootlickers.

554
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,034
- Talk about what?
- That sort of talk!

555
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,716
You're early, Senor.

556
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,670
How much will you charge me
for a favour?

557
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,398
Another one?

558
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,756
You intend to move up
Armageddon?

559
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,593
No. No jokes.
This is serious business.

560
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,116
- How much do you want?
- Nothing, my work is done.

561
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,749
- Your last job, I promise.
- No way.

562
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,594
In the end I kill the whole village
with only you and me left.

563
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:51,196
I'm telling you, this is the last job.
I'll give you another 10.000 Dollars.

564
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,515
15.000!

565
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,796
Alright, 20.000.

566
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,032
Who is the guy?

567
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,589
His name is Ramón. You'll find him in
a burned down house near the village.

568
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,672
- You can't miss it.
- I bet you burned it down.

569
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,557
So you accept?

570
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,033
Agreed.
Payment in advance.

571
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,311
- Very well, tonight I'll bring you the money.
- You'll find me here.

572
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,156
<i>who bothers to shave</i>
<i>rather wants to live than to die</i>.

573
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,673
Ramón!

574
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,350
- Did Barrett send you?
- It's him you wanted to kill, right?

575
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,319
- None of your business. Go away, Rezza!
- I'm a professional, Ramón.

576
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,437
Once I got paid,
I'll go all the way.

577
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,718
- Why do you want to kill Barrett?
- You said it yourself once.

578
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,189
By killing him, I kill what
I once was.

579
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,956
You can have my horse. Take it
and leave this place forever.

580
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,350
If you hate somebody,
the world is not big enough.

581
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,317
You will forget very soon,
you'll see.

582
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,914
You wanted to go back
to the place you were born, remember?

583
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,913
- I was born here and I stay here!
- Don't push me, Ramón.

584
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,151
If you stay,
I have to kill you!

585
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,909
I told you to have
the sun behind you.

586
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,316
Don't forget to count the steps.
One step and he is afraid.

587
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,037
Two steps and he is uneasy.

588
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,955
Three steps, Ramón,
he is about to kill you!

589
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,597
But I had a shave!

590
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,870
Rezza... Rezza!

591
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,998
Hey Chico,
you made it.

592
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,435
A small credit goes to me
as well.

593
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,555
Now you'll feel this wall, Chico.
A big wall.

594
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,076
Don't try to climb it, Chico.

595
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,355
You'll never succeed.

596
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,196
Alright, Mick.
What's your decision?

597
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,634
Okay, Mister Barrett,
I'm selling.

598
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,678
I appreciate it, Mick.
That's a splendid idea.

599
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,196
Let's go have a drink and
discuss the selling price.

600
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,993
Barrett!

601
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,715
Don't move, Barrett!

602
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,153
What are you waiting for?
Don't just stare at him.

603
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,197
- Ramón!
- Ramón!

604
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,556
- What do you want? What's the matter, boy?
- Out of my way, sheriff!

605
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,473
- I'm not a boy!
- Do something, sheriff!

606
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,950
- This madman is about to kill me!
- What is it that you want?

607
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,828
- I want to kill Barrett!
- Stop it, Ramón, I beg you!

608
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,356
- Why kill him? What has he done to you?
- He is a lousy murderer!

609
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,670
- He killed my father!
- That's not true!

610
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,478
I had nothing to do with it!
It was Burt!

611
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,314
Burt worked for you and you had
him kill my father. Just like Steven!

612
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,595
What do you know
about Steven?

613
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,717
Go ask Barrett.
He knows everything!

614
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,315
If you know something, tell us, Ramón!
I'm gonna arrest him!

615
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,188
Get out of my way, sheriff!
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

616
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,714
Then I'm going
to tell you everything.

617
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,792
The killer is not dead yet, Barrett!
He is still alive!

618
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,629
Ramón. Ramón!

619
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,112
What did you say? Who is that killer?
Why did you say he isn't dead?

620
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,115
Now he is dead, sheriff.

621
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,511
He was the last one.

622
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,156
THE END

1
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:12,919
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

2
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:24,116
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!

3
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:33,996
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!

4
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,623
What is it like,
the planet we're approaching?

5
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,666
Nothing but ice and snow.
A barren desert of whiteness.

6
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,774
Scan it with our computer waves.

7
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:21,737
The enemy's weapons may be
hidden beneath its surface.

8
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,940
Aha!
Looks like the cops.

9
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,715
As Thor, chief of the imperial police,

10
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,203
I order you to surrender at once

11
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,148
Stella, you cheap smuggler

12
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,991
I am police robot M.

13
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,003
You have the right to remain silent.

14
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,877
Go for hyper space.

15
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,536
Let's hope this star-buggy stays together.

16
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:53,073
What's our chances?
40% total disintegration..

17
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:55,164
30% molecular ignition..

18
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,264
..20% gamma contamination.

19
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,319
You are very reassuring
I assume that means -

20
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,504
we have a 10% chance
of making it.

21
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,078
Not really!
3% structural collapse

22
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,160
3%...
Alright Alright!

23
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,004
Just keep on course
and get ready

24
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,004
to reenter normal space.

25
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:17,023
Ready when you are.

26
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,276
We've done it!
We've done it!

27
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,376
Not quite. Look!
The Nutrant star!

28
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,966
If it gets a hold on us,
it'll crush us.

29
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,302
Prepare to release
Ath-Power stage.

30
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:43,823
Eject!
Eject!

31
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,927
Ha Ha!
We made it.

32
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,515
Plot us a new course,
so that cop cant find us.

33
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,026
Even as you speak.
It's been taken care of.

34
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,355
There's the border
of the haunted stars.

35
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,439
If we'd traveled
one second further,

36
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:11,777
we would have wound up
right beside them.

37
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:14,635
What in the universe is that?

38
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,878
It's a spaceship.

39
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,067
No, its a launch.

40
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,693
Their power is totally down.

41
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,999
Maybe they're wounded,

42
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,099
to weak to send a signal.

43
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,299
I'm gonna have a look.

44
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,541
What's the radiation level?

45
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:58,002
Normal.
The hull isn't damaged.

46
00:07:58,204 --> 00:07:59,907
I'm going inside.

47
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,735
Is everything alright?

48
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:18,403
Yes!

49
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:21,103
Wait a minute..
There's someone here.

50
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,003
He looks like he's hurt pretty bad,

51
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,433
but he's alive

52
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,275
I'll try to get him back to the ship.

53
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,375
I'll help you bring him aboard.

54
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,127
He's dehydrated.

55
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,753
Suffering from exhaustion.

56
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,833
But the launch was full of supplies.
Everything he could have needed.

57
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,193
He's also in chock.

58
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,775
He keeps talking about monsters..
..Red monsters

59
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,990
He wants us to alert someone..
Urgently.

60
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,098
Who?

61
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:15,078
The Emperor
of the first circle of the universe.

62
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,081
It's the emblem of the chief
officers of the imperial navy.

63
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,778
I'd say red hot potatoes for
small time smugglers on the run like us.

64
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,752
We'll, what do we do?

65
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,626
You go to prison, Stella star.

66
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,500
Your leap through
hyperspace didn’t fool us.

67
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,219
Your friction trail was easy to follow.

68
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,016
Hehehe..

69
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,237
You are completely
surrounded by fighter ships.

70
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,213
This time you've won.

71
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,279
We surrender.

72
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,620
There won't be a next time, Stella Star!

73
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,153
Don't worry.
We'll get out of this.

74
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:42,613
My Lord!

75
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,269
Yes. What is it Ellrik?

76
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,797
They found one damned survivor.

77
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:54,810
Right now, the imperial shuttle ship
has taken him to their medical centre.

78
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,042
But his brain seems to
be thoroughly damaged

79
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,425
He will be of no help to them,
to find the ship.

80
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,823
Mhmm..

81
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:18,598
Come to me, Golem!

82
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,124
I have a simple task for you.

83
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,999
You must not fail me.

84
00:11:55,297 --> 00:12:00,240
Therefore, the great machines
of the central operating system..

85
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,410
..of imperial justice hereby sentence you,

86
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,380
Akton, of ninth Vega..

87
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,002
..to 220 years hard labor

88
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:16,070
in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd.

89
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,763
As for you, Stella Star,

90
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,938
having considered all the arguments..

91
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:28,338
Studied all the Video-tapes,
the accusations..

92
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:33,063
..we condemn you to forced labor for life..

93
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,960
..in the penal colony..

94
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,510
..of Nocturne the 2nd

95
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,599
This session is hereby adjourned.

96
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:48,445
Throw the radium into the furnace.

97
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,874
Careful now.

98
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,164
I said let's go, move!

99
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,308
Faster!

100
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,158
Move, Let's go!

101
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,932
Will you step it up!

102
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,520
Here! You can move faster than that!

103
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,046
Careful with that Radium.

104
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:07,412
Will you move!
Move down those stairs!

105
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:08,924
Throw it the furnace!

106
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,024
Do what I tell you!

107
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,824
Where do you think you are.
We haven't got all day!

108
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,999
Alright, 5 minutes of rest

109
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,727
Move quickly now!

110
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,627
Prisoners get back to their posts!
Let's go!

111
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,927
Come on quickly now!

112
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,501
Let's go!

113
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,977
I've been at this for 12 straight hours..

114
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,202
..the radiation will burn my skin off.

115
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,097
Were not slaves.

116
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,203
You'd better work.

117
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:44,024
If you don’t want the taste of the burning
of their energy whips too.

118
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,634
But there must be a way to escape.

119
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:49,227
There will be a way, you know.

120
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,294
Blow ups happen.

121
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,967
If I could only succeed
in overfeeding the furnace.

122
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,279
But overfeed it with what?

123
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,884
Energy!

124
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:01,061
Then a gun ray could be enough.

125
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:02,465
Planing an escape!

126
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,089
This is what you're gonna get, lady!

127
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,313
You can drop the riffle-ray.

128
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,470
Now turn around.

129
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:38,685
You!

130
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,849
I bet you never expected to see me here.

131
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,586
And you too.

132
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,990
Poor Stella.
Your escape efforts have been wasted.

133
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,449
OK.

134
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,691
I've lost again.

135
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,444
We were sent to free you,
your sentence has been cancelled.

136
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,531
Have you both gone mad?

137
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,547
I only have logic animotion circuits.
No room for craziness.

138
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:02,243
Well, I've been assigned
to a top secret imperial mission,

139
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,452
we must now leave and set Akton free.

140
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,034
There, he's yours

141
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:16,841
My gift to you.

142
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,068
Would I lie to you?

143
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:39,012
Look, it is the imperial flagship.

144
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,665
Akton, you are gonna meet
some real royalty.

145
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:58,527
He's here!
There is his holographic image.

146
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:14,672
His Highness; The emperor
of the first circle of the universe.

147
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:20,354
I come to you because my faithful robot,
Elle, has told me..

148
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,163
..that you are the only one
who could save us.

149
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,860
You know, you must
be the best pilot in the whole galaxy..

150
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:32,738
..and you Akton, the best navigator.

151
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,101
Stella, our galaxy is split..

152
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,554
..into 2 waring factions.

153
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:45,105
Our own and
the one ruled by the evil count..

154
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:49,287
..Zarth Arn!
From the league of the dark worlds.

155
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,880
Recently we've begun to receive troublesome
reports from our spies among the league.

156
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,776
They have informed us
that the count has created a weapon..

157
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,706
..a new, limitless weapon.

158
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,626
A Weapon so vast, so huge..

159
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:11,246
..that it would take
a whole planet to conceal it.

160
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:15,408
That is why we sent the mission ship.

161
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,685
Did they find the planet?

162
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,519
The ship came so close..

163
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,629
..so close..

164
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,172
..to discovering the counts secret..

165
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:31,764
.. when it was suddenly attacked
by a horde of unknown monsters.

166
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:35,229
We had assumed it was destroyed,

167
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,240
we lost all hope.

168
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:43,136
Until you found the launch from that ship.

169
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,046
And now, with the utmost secrecy..

170
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:51,954
..you must sail to the haunted stars.

171
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,841
You must find that ship.

172
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,827
Find the counts secret

173
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,191
planet and destroy it.

174
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,330
There's something else.

175
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:13,079
When you complete the mission..

176
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:16,370
.. search for the commander..

177
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,224
..of that missing ship.

178
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,364
He was my only son.

179
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,385
The first possibility is the Origa system.

180
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,533
Also know as the worlds asleep.

181
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,102
But this system is still within our galaxy

182
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,642
and we should've found it by now.

183
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,376
The same also applies
to the white sun of Ohzon

184
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:10,082
so only the third possibility remains:

185
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,909
The heart of the haunted stars.

186
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,357
An unknown planet named..

187
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:18,141
Euraphas!

188
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:21,121
Well, shall we begin our search?

189
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,723
Lets go!

190
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:25,885
The distance we must travel is enormous.

191
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:29,149
By using hyperspace,
what would normally take 2 months to reach

192
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,262
We should do in 2 hours.

193
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,474
Everything ready?
Ready! Right!

194
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:40,083
Every time I go into hyperspace
I get nervous.

195
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,783
Prepare for re-entry to normal space.

196
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:03,481
We've arrived!

197
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:21,263
Its not very far from here.
You can reach by using the space shuttle.

198
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:27,278
Thor and I will wait for you there.
Hidden in that canyon.

199
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,219
So that were ready in case of another
surprise attack of the count.

200
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,285
That sounds fine with me.

201
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:34,963
Is there air out there?

202
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,768
Yeah. Yeah you can breathe.

203
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:39,981
Alright. lets go!
Follow me!

204
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:48,457
I'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship.
The controls are easy!

205
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,638
Now watch your step right here.

206
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,732
Take care.

207
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,536
You alright?
You bet. Lets go.

208
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:25,333
Don't you think were a little low?
I haven't been programmed to walk on water.

209
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,182
Ohh me. water makes me so nervous

210
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,344
Everything makes you nervous.

211
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:35,197
It's the launch.
Lets land.

212
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,006
OK! Take it in easy.

213
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,835
Shuttle to star-ship!
We are landing now.

214
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,411
Roger. Out.

215
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,430
My seat-belt’s stuck.

216
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:53,631
Oh Elle, come on!

217
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,732
Take it easy, I'm coming.

218
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:01,706
Look at that!

219
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,030
Amazing!

220
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,662
It's almost buried.

221
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,829
The impact was tremendous.

222
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,222
I doubt if anyone could have survived.

223
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:17,572
The nuclear exhaust ports
have been gutted by fire.

224
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:22,841
We'd better look around.

225
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:24,746
What's that?

226
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:27,424
I don't know.

227
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,446
Seems to be a planetary artifact.

228
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:44,779
Well, it certainly is an antique.

229
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,892
Looks like some sort of Laser spear.

230
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:49,808
This planet is inhabited.

231
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,773
We must be very careful.

232
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:53,995
We are in the evil counts domain.

233
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,908
These stars are extremely far
and remote, even for him.

234
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,117
Probably they've set up
a fully independent kind of civilization.

235
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:09,419
We're wasting time. We'd better
start looking for the missing crew.

236
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,697
Come on. Lets go this way.

237
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:16,190
Look!
Amazons on horseback.

238
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,241
I hope they are friendly.

239
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,487
We'll soon find out.

240
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:36,983
Take my revenge.

241
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:41,188
Kill 'em.

242
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,590
Die robot.

243
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,134
You'll pay for this -
All of you!

244
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,121
Don't make us kill you.

245
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:08,454
Come on!

246
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:15,181
Stop!
There is no escape.

247
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,770
Take your hands off of me.

248
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,119
Let me go.

249
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:31,881
Get your hands off of me.
Let me go.

250
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,310
Queen Querrelia. This
is the spy we captured.

251
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,136
She came through the forbidden sea.

252
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,576
You're a spy.

253
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,799
As the men from the launch were too.

254
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:50,362
But nothing
is going to stop the count anymore.

255
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:54,492
Even if you had passed by this world..

256
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,858
..you'd never
be able to discover the counts planet.

257
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:04,988
Two packs of murdering guardians are there
to watch and protect it from intruders.

258
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:09,711
..and now:
Put her into the mind probe.

259
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:11,305
No! No!

260
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:12,992
Hold it right there!

261
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,242
Elle!

262
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:17,912
Release her or I'll blast your queen.

263
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,063
I mean it.

264
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,992
Come on now.

265
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,015
Don’t you people move or you are dead.

266
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:29,410
Give me the trouble and I'm
gonna clean out your sinuses real good lady

267
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,078
Now you stand there.

268
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:32,903
Ok, Close the door.

269
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,868
Don’t you follow us now.

270
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,031
Stop them!
Stop them!

271
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:43,936
Behind you!

272
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,407
Come on, lets go!

273
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:49,947
Elle you're terrific.
I didn't know you had it in you.

274
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,737
Where's the release mechanism?

275
00:28:57,883 --> 00:28:59,149
It's jammed!

276
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,296
Take cover!

277
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,046
Here goes the last shot.

278
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:07,882
Full power!

279
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:11,963
Come on, lets go!

280
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,728
Hurry! Hurry!!

281
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,118
Guardian..

282
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,656
..take my revenge.

283
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,534
Kill them.

284
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:36,628
Look!

285
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,562
Whoa!
Run for your life!

286
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,564
There! That narrow
passage in the rocks.

287
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,362
Come on Stella, run!

288
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:13,159
Hurry!

289
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:33,176
Oh! Elle!

290
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,053
We better move!

291
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,256
The amazon air-fighters will be here soon.

292
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,914
Quick, to the ship!

293
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,879
They're attacking.
I'll man the laser-canon.

294
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:24,046
Specter 7..Fire!

295
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:35,866
Ok, get ready.
Here they come.

296
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,972
Power is up to full battle speed.

297
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,257
You!

298
00:31:50,215 --> 00:31:52,255
Why don't you come back now?

299
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:55,363
Here they come. Specter 3.

300
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,445
Alright.
We've got them!

301
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,734
Fire! Fire!

302
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,695
Yeah!

303
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:13,853
One more.
There's one more!

304
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:20,569
We've got 'em.

305
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,706
Watch out on the right.

306
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:26,364
We're down from 6 to 5.

307
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:27,713
Get ready.

308
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:36,003
More to the left.

309
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:40,803
Steady.

310
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:42,497
Then fire 5.

311
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,114
Then 6.

312
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:46,678
Fire the laser-canon, robot.
Fire!

313
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:49,598
Yeah! Hahaa!

314
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,175
We got it!

315
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,431
We're holding.

316
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:00,651
Now!

317
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:02,940
8 ships approaching from the right. Fire!

318
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:09,767
Alright, we've won.
We did it.

319
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:24,907
I found the positions
to both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship.

320
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:28,818
The mother-ship is closest
so we'll check it out first.

321
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:31,515
It's here.

322
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:33,864
On the 3rd planet
of the next solar system.

323
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:35,889
I've never been there.

324
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:38,956
What's it like?

325
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:42,092
Red fogs, high winds, low gravity.

326
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:44,660
The air is breathable.

327
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:46,707
And the atmospheric conditions are stable.

328
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,310
However..

329
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:52,076
The entire planet
is covered with ice and snow.

330
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,923
And you must
be extremely careful when the sun sets.

331
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:58,289
The temperature drops
thousands of degrees.

332
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:00,729
And in an instant, everything freezes over.

333
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:38,457
What a terrible crash.

334
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,910
No-one could have survived.

335
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:47,354
Do you see any signs of the emperors son?

336
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:49,698
If he's in the middle of all this

337
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:53,032
I don't even know
if his own mother would recognize him.

338
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:56,846
Then it's all over.

339
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,449
There's no hope of ever
finding the counts secret fortress.

340
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,944
There's still the third launch.

341
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,898
It's probably
lost out in the stars, who knows?

342
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:11,750
Anyway, it's useless
to raise false hopes.

343
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:13,905
It's been too long.

344
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,349
And this galaxy is wild and hostile.

345
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:19,166
Come on Elle, lets go back to the ship.

346
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:21,664
We'd better hurry.

347
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:25,315
We're running out of time
and our power-packs are nearly finished.

348
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:26,831
Let's get rid of them.

349
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:29,363
It's gonna be a long walk back.

350
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:32,754
My feet are already cold.

351
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,920
It's times like these
i'm glad to be a robot.

352
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,323
What's the matter with you, Akton?

353
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,480
Well, I'm just refining my powers.

354
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:13,623
And what's your problem,
ships-computer, huh!

355
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:20,261
Is everything alright with Stella and Elle?

356
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,452
I'm not worried about them.

357
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,654
I'm just waiting.

358
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,712
Your waiting is over.

359
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:42,094
At last Thor.
You have some good news for me?

360
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:45,301
Yes Excellency.
I have killed the alien pathfinder..

361
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:47,029
..and taken over this ship.

362
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,592
What of Stella Star?

363
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,758
And that tin policeman.

364
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:55,798
This planet
will take care of them, Excellency.

365
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,430
Good!

366
00:36:57,992 --> 00:37:01,072
And I await your immediate arrival.

367
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:16,688
Elle, how much further?

368
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,910
We should be close.
Just a few more radiants.

369
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:28,509
Ships-computer!
Why aren't the main engines firing?

370
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:32,851
There is a malfunction.

371
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,310
A malfunction?

372
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,150
Where?

373
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:41,576
I am not programmed for this malfunction.

374
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,338
Akton!
We're here!

375
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:29,521
Akton! Thor!
Let us in. The sun is setting.

376
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,704
That's exactly why I'm not letting you in.

377
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:35,039
Soon you'll be dead and
I'll be gone from this planet.

378
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,439
Have you gone crazy? Open this hatch!

379
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:39,614
No!

380
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:41,169
Where's Akton?

381
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:43,135
Akton is dead.

382
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:45,547
And I'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn..

383
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:47,628
..as the prince of the League of Darkness.

384
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,926
Thor, a traitor?
I cannot believe it.

385
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,846
I cannot trust
my own logic circuits anymore.

386
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,391
He fooled me too.

387
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,010
It's no use. We're gonna freeze.

388
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,603
Maybe not.
Maybe I can save you.

389
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,666
Let's stop here.

390
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:09,143
Now you lie down in the snow, face up.

391
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:10,735
Okay.

392
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:20,016
Now give me your hand
so I can monitor your temperature.

393
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:26,088
I can use my energy
to keep your heart working.

394
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,421
You'll be in a state
of suspended animation.

395
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,116
Elle!

396
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:34,878
As an opponent, I always knew
you were programmed to never give up.

397
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,006
Which was infuriating.

398
00:39:40,627 --> 00:39:42,246
But now that quality..

399
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,386
..must be..

400
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,441
..best.

401
00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:49,429
You are the most faithful companion
a woman ever had.

402
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,810
And I too, respect you, Stella.

403
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:54,104
You are the nicest human being I've known.

404
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:58,255
Now, maybe, is a good time
to use your ancient system of prayer.

405
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:00,532
And hope it works for robots, as well.

406
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,487
Goodbye my friend.

407
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:06,709
Goodbye for now, Stella.

408
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:32,007
You were expected here hours ago!

409
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,452
I've been delayed by a malfunction.

410
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,793
I don't tolerate malfunctions..

411
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,127
..or inefficiency here in my realm

412
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:45,268
How long will the delay be?

413
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:47,974
I think a very long time.

414
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:50,728
You shouldn't try taking off
without asking me first.

415
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,609
This time I'll make sure you are dead.

416
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,502
I'll fix you.

417
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:46,553
Alright Akton.
This is it.

418
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,617
Say goodbye.

419
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:50,029
What?

420
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:52,785
Stop!

421
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,754
Put down the gun.

422
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:55,800
Stop!

423
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:58,397
No-one can survive these deadly rays.

424
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:03,305
Those deadly rays will be your death.

425
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:17,643
Elle?

426
00:42:19,048 --> 00:42:20,199
Elle, do you read me?

427
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:22,651
This is Akton.
I've taken over the ship.

428
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,548
Do you read me?

429
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,223
Her pulse rate is 16.

430
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:44,675
She may survive if you can use your powers
and bring her back slowly.

431
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:46,722
Careful now.

432
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,620
Close the hatch.

433
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:46,770
Look! It's working!

434
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:48,652
She's going to make it.

435
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,904
Come on Stella!

436
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,175
Whats wrong?

437
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,548
The main engines will not fire.

438
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,484
Thor must have tried everything.

439
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,231
What are we gonna do now?

440
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:48,579
So..We get out of one mess..

441
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:50,443
..just to find ourselves in another.

442
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:51,499
Not necessarily.

443
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:53,928
What do you mean?
We are stuck!

444
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,328
Even the transmitter is out of order.

445
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:58,987
We can take off immediately.

446
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:00,709
Take off?
How?

447
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:05,443
The ship is not operating,
simply because I borrowed this reactor.

448
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:16,233
Then you knew about Thor.

449
00:45:16,763 --> 00:45:17,855
Yes I did.

450
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,474
So you see into the future.

451
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,601
All these years you never told me.

452
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,696
Think of all the trouble
I might have avoided

453
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:29,562
You have tried to change the future.

454
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,745
Which is against the law.

455
00:45:32,142 --> 00:45:33,737
So therefore, I can tell you nothing.

456
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,484
Let's find the 3rd launch.

457
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:38,016
Akton, you are something else!

458
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:40,341
Yes.
Time is running out.

459
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:41,831
Lets go!

460
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:15,878
We're arriving.

461
00:46:16,836 --> 00:46:18,725
That's the planet Demundia.

462
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:21,855
There in barren land
and wast emptiness

463
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,655
we'll find the 3rd launch.

464
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:28,504
Somethings wrong.

465
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:29,901
Everything has stopped.

466
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:30,941
What's happening?

467
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,124
Power failure!

468
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,044
My circuits!
My circuits are failing.

469
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:46,129
We've been hit.
By an energy beam.

470
00:46:51,828 --> 00:46:53,899
I am out of control.

471
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:55,741
Look!

472
00:46:58,163 --> 00:46:59,401
What is it?

473
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,290
It must be the Counts weapon!

474
00:47:03,338 --> 00:47:05,623
Oh my head, oh!

475
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,804
Fire, you stupid robot!
Fire!

476
00:47:32,538 --> 00:47:34,292
What's happening?

477
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,269
Here, let me help you.

478
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:57,899
The attack is over.
You'll be alright.

479
00:47:57,931 --> 00:47:59,912
I thought I was gonna go insane.

480
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:01,651
We've just survived an attack

481
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:04,238
of the most powerful weapon
in the entire galaxy.

482
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:28,701
If Akton's calculations
are correct

483
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:30,799
we should find the launch this way.

484
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,637
In a crater just over..

485
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:36,105
There!

486
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:07,138
Oh me!

487
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:10,400
Don't say it. Don't say
I know..

488
00:49:10,463 --> 00:49:12,400
Steam makes you nervous.

489
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,834
No, no! Not really.

490
00:49:15,438 --> 00:49:17,324
Why should I be nervous?

491
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:20,366
There is nothing
to be afraid of round here.

492
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:36,673
Looks totally wrecked
but it's definitely the third launch.

493
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:37,951
I'd better go down.

494
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:41,774
No, I insist.
Time for a little robot-chauvinism.

495
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:43,243
You stay here.

496
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:45,351
Be careful Elle.

497
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:48,041
You do not have to worry about me!

498
00:50:33,044 --> 00:50:34,068
Release her!

499
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:38,967
Let me down!

500
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,443
Help!

501
00:51:43,173 --> 00:51:44,078
Help!

502
00:52:16,397 --> 00:52:17,286
Help!

503
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,350
Don't.. Don't..

504
00:52:38,816 --> 00:52:39,840
Relax.

505
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,467
Take it easy.
I'll cut you down.

506
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:47,275
There.

507
00:52:47,703 --> 00:52:48,790
You're free.

508
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,743
That was a little too close for comfort.

509
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:00,641
Come on.

510
00:53:01,164 --> 00:53:01,958
Come on!

511
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:25,527
We rest here.

512
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:27,241
This is safe.

513
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:37,897
Who are you?

514
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:50,579
This is an energy-shield mask.

515
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:53,099
And the amount of energy is limited.

516
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:57,138
My name is Simon.

517
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,844
I'm the only survivor
from the wreck of an imperial mission.

518
00:54:01,216 --> 00:54:02,264
Are you really?

519
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,075
We've been searching for you
all through these damned haunted stars.

520
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:07,792
Why?

521
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:10,869
The emperor's orders
were to find the Count's phantom planet

522
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:12,324
and to destroy it.

523
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,022
So you know about the monsters?

524
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,340
Yes I do.

525
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:18,994
But it's useless.

526
00:54:20,502 --> 00:54:22,589
We did not succeed
in find the planet either.

527
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:25,854
And now there's no time left.

528
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,831
The cavemen will waiting for us.

529
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,818
Alright, stay very close and very quiet.

530
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:51,702
Oh, this way looks safe.

531
00:54:58,854 --> 00:54:59,943
This way.

532
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:26,485
Simon!

533
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:49,554
No!

534
00:55:59,715 --> 00:56:00,809
Akton!

535
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:29,587
You alright?

536
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,496
Akton, thank god you got here in time.

537
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,877
You must've known all along.

538
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:38,586
By the way, this is Simon.

539
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:40,824
The only survivor
from the imperial mission.

540
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:42,383
We owe you our lives.

541
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:44,113
Now maybe..

542
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:46,850
..with your help, we can still
find the Count's phantom planet

543
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:49,754
Lets go aboard your ship
and continue on at once.

544
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,596
There's no need to continue.

545
00:56:51,704 --> 00:56:53,093
Have you gone crazy?

546
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:56,902
That's our primary mission: To
find the planet and destroy it.

547
00:56:56,927 --> 00:56:59,077
I know,
but we've already found it.

548
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,719
Think about it.

549
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:03,608
Then you'll understand that
this is the Count's planet.

550
00:57:05,138 --> 00:57:07,043
Remember what the Amazon queen said:

551
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,575
A planet occupied
by two packs of evil defenders.

552
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:13,212
The first we met while in space.

553
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,339
The red monsters.

554
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:16,284
And the second..

555
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:17,641
Right here. The Troglodytes.

556
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:21,355
And there’s no question about it.
This is the planet!

557
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,942
This?

558
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:24,990
That's incredible.

559
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,132
I was here and I didn't even realise it.

560
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:29,081
There's no way you could have.

561
00:57:29,467 --> 00:57:32,212
Anyway, we proceed at once
and destroy all that machinery.

562
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:33,181
Right?

563
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:34,435
Right.

564
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,313
There is the door
that'll take us to the machinery.

565
00:58:28,426 --> 00:58:30,227
This is the Counts secret domain.

566
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,283
The very heart of the phantom planer.

567
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,382
From here he plan to control
the entire universe.

568
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:39,980
This is incredible.

569
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,466
Where is everybody?

570
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,569
Everything is set in our destiny.

571
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,811
Soon you'll know all the answers.

572
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,039
This will take
us to operation headquarters.

573
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:15,412
After you, my dear.

574
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,695
Here's the nerve center
of the entire operation.

575
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:25,727
This is unbelievable.

576
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,025
Fantastic.

577
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:32,287
Pre-programmed computers.
They could run forever.

578
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:35,094
All these power modules,
what are they for?

579
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:38,942
This is the force
that projected the red monsters into space.

580
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,477
Then this is the way
they produced real monsters?

581
00:59:43,418 --> 00:59:45,045
No. Not real.

582
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,910
The monsters never existed.

583
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:50,816
These machines discharged mental
projections of monsters in our brains

584
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:52,794
There's the control-panel.

585
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,012
Well, destiny must take it's course.

586
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:16,845
No, we can't allow this to happen.

587
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:19,553
We must destroy it, at once.

588
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,838
You've been very lucky.

589
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,520
And clever.

590
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,320
You survived every trap
that I'd lay for you.

591
01:00:51,864 --> 01:00:55,864
Then I realized that your success
would become my triumph.

592
01:00:57,192 --> 01:00:58,759
How much time is left, Captain?

593
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:00,514
Half a quadrant to go, My-lord.

594
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:05,336
You hear?

595
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,824
In less than an hours time

596
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:10,435
All that'll be left of this planet

597
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,784
Will be ashes and cosmic dust.

598
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:14,839
Forever.

599
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:20,303
Then you will be among the dead.

600
01:01:21,702 --> 01:01:24,012
The emperor will make you pay for this.

601
01:01:24,037 --> 01:01:26,104
The Emperor?

602
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:28,374
I forgot to inform you..

603
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:33,911
..that the Emperor will be
blown to pieces along with the rest of you.

604
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:35,983
Yes!

605
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,808
I told the emperor
that we had found you on this planet.

606
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:44,221
He's on his way here now, at top speed.

607
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:47,371
He'll get here just in time..

608
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,830
..to join the fireworks.

609
01:01:52,886 --> 01:01:54,814
I'm sorry, your highness.

610
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,489
You've lost.

611
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:57,799
Highness?

612
01:01:58,471 --> 01:01:59,535
Forgive me Stella.

613
01:02:00,638 --> 01:02:03,043
But in the beginning
I didn't know whose side you were on.

614
01:02:04,357 --> 01:02:07,262
And after-wards
I didn't know how to tell you

615
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:10,884
Yes, he is Simon, son of the Emperor
and heir to the throne.

616
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:25,938
You two are to prevent them
from leaving this room at all cost.

617
01:02:26,749 --> 01:02:29,638
You will stay with them until the end.

618
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:32,446
Kill them..

619
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,350
..if you have to.

620
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:54,580
Now it will be just a matter of waiting.

621
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,516
An hour goes by quickly.

622
01:03:15,937 --> 01:03:18,055
We've got to get past those golems.

623
01:03:18,547 --> 01:03:19,697
Yes, but how?

624
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,106
Have faith.

625
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:28,583
And never give up hope.

626
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,420
Look out!

627
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:40,652
We are now approaching Demundia.

628
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,765
All crewmen to landing stations.

629
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:45,162
All crewmen to landing stations.

630
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:08,160
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

631
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,637
You and the prince will live.

632
01:06:12,123 --> 01:06:13,988
Akton, you've got to get up.

633
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,726
We must get away from here.

634
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,690
I shall remain here.

635
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:21,929
Please get up, please.

636
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,074
I'm no longer useful at this time.

637
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,628
You're talking nonsense.
You can heal yourself in no time at all.

638
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:32,326
No.

639
01:06:33,837 --> 01:06:35,297
I must obey destiny.

640
01:06:35,979 --> 01:06:37,000
Akton!

641
01:06:37,813 --> 01:06:39,027
We'll carry you.

642
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:40,615
Go.

643
01:06:40,774 --> 01:06:42,338
It's your duty.

644
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,861
You must live.

645
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:49,696
I can't.

646
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:50,942
I can't leave you.

647
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,068
You're the only human-like
friend I ever had.

648
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:56,964
I don't understand. You never die.

649
01:06:57,099 --> 01:06:58,797
Stella, Stella.

650
01:06:58,971 --> 01:07:00,685
I've accomplished the mission.

651
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:01,806
Yes, but I..

652
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:05,626
Others are coming.
Even as I speak they'll rescue you.

653
01:07:07,586 --> 01:07:08,634
Don't worry.

654
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:12,872
I'll live forever.

655
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:15,996
Now go.

656
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:17,711
Go.

657
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:13,597
Father!

658
01:08:25,036 --> 01:08:26,521
We must leave at once.

659
01:08:27,132 --> 01:08:29,076
48 seconds left to the explosion.

660
01:08:29,101 --> 01:08:30,584
We've got to get out of here.

661
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:31,663
It's true father.

662
01:08:31,688 --> 01:08:34,143
The Count has mined the planet
with nuclear charges.

663
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:35,730
We're all about to die.

664
01:08:36,604 --> 01:08:38,160
You know something, my boy?

665
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:42,025
I wouldn't be emperor
if I didn't have some powers at my command.

666
01:08:48,093 --> 01:08:49,672
Imperial battle-ship!

667
01:08:51,575 --> 01:08:52,488
Holt..

668
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,971
..the flow of time.

669
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,251
In the space of 3 minutes

670
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,833
Every molecule on this planet
will be immobilized.

671
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:11,525
But after the third minute

672
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:13,157
The green ray loses it's power.

673
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,255
Time will flow once again.

674
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:17,819
And everything will explode.

675
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:20,189
Three minutes are enough, father.

676
01:10:24,939 --> 01:10:26,868
Now, the Count believe that we are dead.

677
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:30,239
That our armies have dispersed.

678
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:31,612
And that we have no leader.

679
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:37,238
He is supremely confident that he can
overcome us with the greatest of ease.

680
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:40,415
Well then.

681
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:42,749
Now is the time to surprise him.

682
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:48,017
We will attack his headquarters

683
01:10:48,573 --> 01:10:51,319
before his fleets can join him.

684
01:10:52,446 --> 01:10:54,732
If we succeed in this

685
01:10:54,757 --> 01:10:56,867
we could save billions of lives.

686
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,972
Gather together all our legions.
Sir!

687
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:08,094
And order the attack.

688
01:12:51,906 --> 01:12:55,414
By sunset,
I'll be the new Emperor.

689
01:12:56,092 --> 01:13:00,822
And I will be the master
of the whole universe.

690
01:13:58,037 --> 01:13:59,489
Kill them!

691
01:14:58,231 --> 01:14:59,921
Enemy arriving with torpedoes.

692
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:01,429
Prepare for attack.

693
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,293
Kill! Kill!

694
01:15:47,318 --> 01:15:48,611
Over there.

695
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:53,387
We've got them, father.
It's working

696
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:13,991
Kill!

697
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:15,030
Kill!

698
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:49,739
Kill them!

699
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,652
Let's squad. Come on

700
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,481
Over there, quickly.

701
01:19:05,394 --> 01:19:08,108
Now let's give the Emperor

702
01:19:08,133 --> 01:19:09,957
a great reception.

703
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,727
Put in use the mightiest weapon.

704
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,691
The doom-machine.

705
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:19,730
Send it off to towards
the Emperor's capital world

706
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:23,516
and destroy the emperor's imperial planet.

707
01:19:23,919 --> 01:19:27,085
Zarth-Arn!!
Yeah!

708
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:29,490
It's over.

709
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,759
We're finished.

710
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:36,783
We've lost.

711
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:40,998
No.

712
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:45,457
No, there's still a way.

713
01:19:46,211 --> 01:19:47,957
There's one solution left.

714
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,508
I'm afraid we're forced to use it.

715
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:52,556
What?

716
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,765
Starcrash!

717
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,892
Four dimensional attack.

718
01:19:59,551 --> 01:20:00,360
Yes!

719
01:20:00,785 --> 01:20:02,976
If we can re-enter space

720
01:20:03,001 --> 01:20:06,140
at the precise moment

721
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:10,535
the impact of surprise upon the Count
will be so overwhelming

722
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,618
that he cannot halt us.

723
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:14,976
But father,
there is not a weapon powerful enough.

724
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:16,540
Oh yes, there is.

725
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,651
The floating city.

726
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,965
The floating city.

727
01:20:21,173 --> 01:20:22,372
Yes, yes I know.

728
01:20:23,212 --> 01:20:26,879
Although we destroy it's
hope, it's future..

729
01:20:27,812 --> 01:20:29,637
..I'm afraid we must sacrifice it.

730
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:33,287
By setting it towards the Count's fortress.

731
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,913
It's our only way.

732
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:43,250
Now you must help me.

733
01:20:47,353 --> 01:20:48,773
Both of you.

734
01:20:50,602 --> 01:20:51,285
Go!

735
01:20:51,453 --> 01:20:52,986
And direct it's course.

736
01:21:11,693 --> 01:21:12,407
Zoltan!

737
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:13,804
Yes, my-lord.

738
01:21:14,379 --> 01:21:18,600
Now set the doom-machine
against the imperial space station itself.

739
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,450
How long will it take?

740
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:21,213
15 minutes.

741
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:22,721
The set it in motion.

742
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:26,118
I want to wipe out the Emperor
from the whole of the universe.

743
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:27,785
Yes, my-lord.

744
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:33,477
When do we reach the floating city?

745
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:34,819
In less than 2 minutes.

746
01:21:34,844 --> 01:21:37,065
Right. I'll check the docking facility.

747
01:21:38,057 --> 01:21:38,708
Right!

748
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:52,680
Everything checks out OK.

749
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:54,831
Look!

750
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:56,013
The floating city.

751
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:57,307
Already evacuated.

752
01:21:57,719 --> 01:22:00,775
The technicians have already set the
charges and freed the atomic engines.

753
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,687
If everything goes smoothly

754
01:22:02,712 --> 01:22:06,006
I'll try to eject myself
as soon as I re-enter space.

755
01:22:06,582 --> 01:22:07,792
But surely I'll come with you!

756
01:22:07,817 --> 01:22:08,864
No, no, no!

757
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:11,983
It's more important that you stay here
to rescue me once this is all over.

758
01:22:14,419 --> 01:22:15,324
Alright.

759
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:16,999
I'll stay.

760
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,110
But I cannot let you go alone.

761
01:22:20,086 --> 01:22:22,185
In fact our best scientists
have spent the last

762
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:24,308
few hours reconstructing
an old friend of yours.

763
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:29,446
Elle!

764
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:33,692
You can't keep a good robot down.

765
01:22:36,312 --> 01:22:38,637
This is incredible, they rebuild you.

766
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,494
But how?
You look marvelous.

767
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:42,145
Very carefully.

768
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,153
And they used the latest components.

769
01:22:44,178 --> 01:22:46,422
I feel like a new machine.

770
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:47,709
Go now. Quickly!

771
01:22:47,734 --> 01:22:49,702
The survival of our galaxy
is in your hands.

772
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:29,426
This will take us directly
to the control-room.

773
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:32,521
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

774
01:23:39,197 --> 01:23:41,237
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

775
01:23:45,952 --> 01:23:47,928
This doesn't make you nervous, does it?

776
01:23:48,261 --> 01:23:49,960
I've never flown a city before.

777
01:23:50,468 --> 01:23:52,047
Well, leave it to me.

778
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,440
Build up maximum energy.

779
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:33,924
We must leap
through the very heart of the stars.

780
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,137
Prepare to transit. 8 degrees.

781
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:48,683
Ok. I'm ready.

782
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,092
My-lord!

783
01:25:07,497 --> 01:25:08,382
Yes Ellrik?

784
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,986
A floating ship is about to crash into us.

785
01:25:11,011 --> 01:25:11,732
What?

786
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:13,550
Zoltan!

787
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:14,883
Yes my-lord.

788
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:17,799
Destroy the floating ship approaching us.

789
01:25:22,347 --> 01:25:23,945
It can't be done.

790
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,016
It's too close.

791
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:27,639
There it is. Dead-ahead.
Alright!

792
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:31,309
The Count's fighters.
We've got to evade them.

793
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:37,022
All systems prepare for full power.

794
01:26:05,088 --> 01:26:06,905
Let's lock in these controls.

795
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,606
Move it out. Quick.

796
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:09,495
Right!

797
01:26:10,067 --> 01:26:10,805
Let's go!

798
01:26:29,437 --> 01:26:31,643
Come back, you fools.
You cowards.

799
01:26:31,668 --> 01:26:32,897
Come back and fight.

800
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:33,818
My-lord?
Yes!

801
01:26:33,843 --> 01:26:35,247
Come, or you'll be destroyed.

802
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:36,694
You stay here.
Go!

803
01:26:41,455 --> 01:26:45,035
Let's get out of here or there won't be
enough left of me to put back together.

804
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:46,484
You can bet on that!

805
01:26:49,364 --> 01:26:51,182
Circuits, don't fail me now.

806
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:10,462
Zarth-Arn!! Zarth-Arn!!

807
01:28:26,544 --> 01:28:29,329
It's Simon. Simon!

808
01:28:29,968 --> 01:28:31,127
We're over here.

809
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:37,767
Stella. Stella!

810
01:28:40,652 --> 01:28:42,113
And welcome home.

811
01:28:58,747 --> 01:28:59,628
Stella!

812
01:28:59,653 --> 01:29:00,462
Simon!

813
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:01,961
Ah Stella.

814
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,614
Simon.

815
01:29:06,368 --> 01:29:08,002
Is that so.

816
01:29:08,027 --> 01:29:10,003
Well..
It's done

817
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:11,836
It's happened.

818
01:29:13,357 --> 01:29:15,675
The stars are clear.

819
01:29:17,379 --> 01:29:19,213
The planets shine.

820
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:23,229
We've won.

821
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:29,536
Oh, some dark force no doubt

822
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:31,298
Will show it's face once more.

823
01:29:33,139 --> 01:29:36,289
The wheel will always turn.

824
01:29:39,686 --> 01:29:40,964
But for now it's calm.

825
01:29:44,276 --> 01:29:45,514
And for a little time..

826
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:47,554
..at least..

827
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,161
..we can rest.

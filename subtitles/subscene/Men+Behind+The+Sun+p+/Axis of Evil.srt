00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,297
Completely undetectable.

164
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,633
<i>[Mackey]
We would deploy over North Korea...</i>

165
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>glide the 60 miles
to the Yongjiri missile site...</i>

166
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,305
and sabotage the missile
as it's being fueled.

167
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,308
Secondary explosions
should destroy the entire complex.

168
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,312
Whole thing will be perceived
as an industrial accident of some kind.

169
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,022
North Korea'd have
no grounds to retaliate.

170
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,318
<i>And if it turned out to be a nuclear warhead,
what about the radiation?</i>

171
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,780
The blast from the fuel explosions
would be massive, sir.

172
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,823
Even though it wouldn't be
an atomic blast...

173
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,201
it would probably create
its own mushroom cloud.

174
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,870
The heat from the blast would
incinerate any nuclear materials...

175
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,414
alleviating any radiation concerns.

176
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,708
Sir, I don't recommend this.

177
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,255
<i>If they're detected, it's an act of war,
and we lose the element of surprise.</i>

178
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,800
<i>What's the window of opportunity
to explore a Special Ops plan?</i>

179
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,719
I'd say 72 hours,
but I wouldn't-

180
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,974
<i>- Seventy-two hours.
- Sir, a covert action?</i>

181
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,770
L-We need to send a strong
proportional and visible response...

182
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,772
to the North Koreans-
to the whole world-

183
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,774
to put them on notice
that that dog don't hunt.

184
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,193
We will never allow them
to be an I.C.B.M. Power.

185
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,947
<i>Commander Mackey,
could you be ready in 72 hours?</i>

186
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,241
Yes, sir. I believe
we could be ready.

187
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,577
<i>Admiral?</i>

188
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,912
It's not much time to put
a mission together, sir, but-

189
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,456
<i>I understand.</i>

190
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,042
Gentlemen, keep up
with your preparations.

191
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,420
I'll give you a decision
within six hours.

192
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,755
Yes, sir. We'll give it
everything we've got.

193
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,049
[Weylon]
Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,761
"Give it everything we've got."
Tell me I didn't just say that.

195
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,389
<i>- [Chuckling]
- What are you looking at?</i>

196
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,517
<i>- Get Lieutenant James in here.
- Yes, sir.</i>

197
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,897
Mr. President...

198
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,402
<i>- Kim Jong II is 5'2'". He wears four-inch lifts.
- [Chuckles] Sexy.</i>

199
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,947
He lives in a pleasure palace where he
indulges his penchant for Swedish prostitutes.

200
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,911
This missile is pompous grandstanding
by a very small man.

201
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,206
Sir, in 1996, the Korea Institute
for National Reunification...

202
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,959
<i>applied a computer model that accurately
predicted Eastern Europe's collapse.</i>

203
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,129
<i>- Yeah?
- According to the model-</i>

204
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,049
North Korea
should have collapsed in 1992.

205
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,302
I say we give this job to Special Ops
and make this all go away...

206
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:45,224
and let North Korea collapse
when it collapses.

207
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,226
<i>Cam?</i>

208
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,144
Yeah.

209
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,065
Okay.

210
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,108
Tell Mackey his mission is a "go."

211
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,321
But keep General Vance
and his Stealth bombers on standby...

212
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,990
should the SEALs fail.

213
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,844
- Lieutenant.
- Colonel. Thanks for the lift today, sir.

214
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,721
- Well, they gave us a nice plane for this one.
- I see that.

215
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,183
<i>- We gonna get miles for this?
- No, but I did order you the kosher meal.</i>

216
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:32,521
<i>- L.T.C.
- [Man] Okay, guys,
grab a seat and stow your stuff.</i>

217
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,858
Let me know when you and your guys
get settled in. We'll be on our way.

218
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,901
Appreciate the hell
outta that, sir.

219
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,363
- Hoo-ya, Lieutenant James.
- Hoo-ya, Shultiess.

220
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,199
<i>- How you feelin' today, papa?
- I feel immortal.</i>

221
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,243
<i>- I'm "the Stoke."
- Stoke?</i>

222
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,538
- Oh, it's just my new call sign.
- Wasn't aware you had an old one.

223
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, my old one was for mortals,
and I am immortal.

224
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,211
- I'm the Stoke.
- Whatever.

225
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,924
<i>Okay. Good evening, gentlemen...</i>

226
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,927
and welcome to United States
Air force light 738...

227
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,430
with nonstop service
to the skies over North Korea...

228
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,975
where we'll be jumping from an altitude
of approximately 33,000 feet.

229
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,354
- [Clamoring]
- Meideros in the hatch.
Barnes, Shultiess, Ballantine.

230
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,909
AK-47s.

231
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,417
<i>Not a scratch, guys.
The airline wants this plane back...</i>

232
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,378
in the same condition
they gave it to us in.

233
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,465
<i>- You got it, Daiwi.
- Daiwi? Why do you guys call him that?</i>

234
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,676
I don't call him that, but I've known him
since, like, the second grade.

235
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,762
<i>- Hey, hey! What did he just say?
- I'm sorry.</i>

236
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,931
<i>[Callaghan]
It's okay, kid.</i>

237
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,684
<i>Hey, you scared?
Don't lie to me.</i>

238
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,188
Uh- I don't know.
Maybe- Maybe a little.

239
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,733
<i>Damn straight you're scared.
Who wouldn't be?</i>

240
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,777
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,030
Stick with me, kid.
I'm immortal.

242
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,823
Go. Go.

243
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,829
Yeah. A P.V.C. 77 SATCOM.

244
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,374
That's you, schoolboy.

245
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,794
- Give it to Ballantine.
- I got it.

246
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,839
<i>[Man] Okay, gentleman,
time to give up the personal shit.</i>

247
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,925
<i>[Man #2]
Throw in the jewels. Let's go, boys.</i>

248
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,470
[Chattering]

249
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,725
<i>[Man]
Be careful with that. That's my wife.</i>

250
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,894
<i>[Callaghan]
I want these back.</i>

251
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,896
<i>[Man's Voice]
What are those, son?</i>

252
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:45,529
<i>I said, what are those, Ensign?</i>

253
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,614
- Silver wings, Master Chief!
- Bullshit!

254
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,700
Army lead wings, son.

255
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,494
You get 'em inside CrackerJacks.

256
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,330
<i>- Where'd you get 'em, son?
- Ort Benning, Master Chief.</i>

257
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,541
Ort Benning, Georgia.

258
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,336
The army's version of 48 hours
of intensive training...

259
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,714
crammed into 21 days.

260
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,885
Making pussy-ass static-line jumps
out of an Army C-141...

261
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,555
and landing on firm ground.

262
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,433
My one-year-old, Scott Jr.,
can do that.

263
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,768
<i>- You see these?
- Yes, Master Chief.</i>

264
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,814
[Screams]
Navy gold wings, son.

265
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,693
Get those out of my sight. I will teach you
to drop like a Navy SEAL-

266
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,737
from heights where there's
no air to breathe...

267
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,780
into water so cold
you'll wish you was dead.

268
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,533
You will drop at night
with N.V.G.'s...

269
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,702
<i>fall five minutes
before you pull your cord.</i>

270
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,496
<i>And if you manage
to stay alive through all that...</i>

271
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,166
we'll see about getting you
a pair of these.

272
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,335
<i>Is that clear?</i>

273
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,880
[All]
Hoo-ya, Master Chief!

274
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,052
<i>[Chattering]</i>

275
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,513
<i>I don't know why you
always bring these, sir.</i>

276
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,017
You just make sure
I get 'em back.

277
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,603
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,523
<i>- [Chattering Continues]
- [Man] Check your "O" rings.</i>

279
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,069
<i>How you doin' there, Shultiess?</i>

280
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,530
Good, sir.

281
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,867
Sir, it says here that the Koreans,
uh, believe in shamans.

282
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,453
Sometimes he appears as an old man.
Sometimes as a tiger.

283
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,581
- Sometimes as a leopard.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

284
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,167
Y-Uh-
[Exhales]

285
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,003
It's just, uh-

286
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,549
<i>I was glad to read
about those shamans, you know?</i>

287
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,760
I don't want to die
in a godless land, sir. That's all.

288
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,430
Hey.

289
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,558
<i>Nobody's dying from my stick.
You copy that, sailor?</i>

290
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,770
Yes, sir.

291
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,772
Makes me look bad.

292
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,073
<i>- Pressurize in six.
- [Man] Pressurize in six.</i>

293
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,785
<i>[Man #2]
Six minutes. Six. Six to go.</i>

294
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>[Man #3]
On deck. Six minutes.</i>

295
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,378
- Sir, we're ready for the bounce.
- Okay.

296
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,964
Two minutes.

297
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,383
<i>[Chattering]</i>

298
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,468
<i>- All right, listen up.
- What is your problem?</i>

299
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,805
I'm throwing up.
I hate jumping out of airplanes.

300
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,640
- Swallow it.
- I am.

301
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>"Pencil-dick" engineers
designed this aircraft...</i>

302
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,644
to carry pussy-ass businessmen
from Omaha to St. Louis.

303
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,272
- If they see you chuckin',
they're gonna red tag you.
- I know.

304
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,400
We may find it useful to jump out of
a commercial piece of shit such as this.

305
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,987
What I don't get is why you go Navy SEALs
when you hate jumping out of airplanes.

306
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,157
I like swimming.
I'm a good swimmer.

307
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,326
Depressurize.

308
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,498
[Loud Rattling]

309
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,335
Now, obviously,
the pencil dicks in Seattle...

310
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,090
didn't design this ramp
to be deployed under these conditions.

311
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,511
The system's hydraulics can't compete
with the overwhelming force...

312
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,804
of the airstreams
under the fuselage...

313
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,390
preventing the stairs
from locking into place.

314
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:05,020
Fortunately, the U.S. Navy
has devised "the bounce."

315
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,147
Now, personally...

316
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,527
I've seen men injured, maimed...

317
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,695
<i>and even killed
attempting to do this.</i>

318
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,199
So I suggest you pay close att-

00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,161
[Grunts]

320
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,624

321
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,629
Anyone laughs,
you're fucking dead.

322
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,515
Shultiess. You're jumping first.

323
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,726
Trust me.
It's better that way.

324
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,564
<i>The high-altitude, high-opening drop-
the HAHO.</i>

325
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:54,027
The single most effective aerial infiltration
available to the special warfare operator.

326
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:57,573
<i>Ensign James,
if I hear one snortle, one snicker...</i>

327
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,741
one chuckle out of you
or Callaghan...

328
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,703
I will personally give you both
one of these. I shit you not!

329
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,372
<i>- Understood?
- [Both] Hoo-ya, Master Chief.</i>

330
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,334
The MT1 X-The crown jewel-
The crown jewel-

331
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,546
The crown jewel
of naval parachutes.

332
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,925
It can put a spec war operator
anywhere on this earth at any time.

333
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,846
Provided, that is,
you survive the jump.

334
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,100
- All right, Barnes. Open her up.
- Oxygen.

335
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,023
<i>Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...</i>

336
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,733
<i>Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...</i>

337
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:37,821
we were able to use thermal imaging
to acquire these new target folders.

338
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,282
Rom this lower perigee...

339
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,620
these images clearly show
a diamond-shaped missile tip.

340
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,663
Indicative of
a nuclear-tipped warhead.

341
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,124
Mr. President, we can now say
with high confidence...

342
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,669
that this missile was designed
to deliver a nuclear device.

343
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,005
<i>How do we know
it's carrying one?</i>

344
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,007
How do we know it's not
a dummy warhead...

345
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,009
<i>that's tricked out to look like
a nuclear warhead?</i>

346
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,679
Well, sir, when plutonium is reprocessed
to make a nuclear bomb material...

347
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,557
it emits a radioactive gas-
krypton-85.

348
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,604
<i>Our Lacrosse synthetic aperture radar
detected this gas from Yongjiri...</i>

349
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,483
<i>at levels consistent
with the existence of a mid-range...</i>

350
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,110
three-to-five megaton
nuclear device.

351
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:21,281
Mr. President, we are as sure about this
as we ever were about any Soviet missile site.

352
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:26,411
That is an actual, live,
nuclear-tipped missile on the launchpad.

353
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:30,082
What's more disturbing, Mr. President,
is they seem to be fueling this missile...

354
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,084
<i>to its highest alert level.</i>

355
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,338
<i>In this condition, it could be launched
within three minutes of receiving a "go" order.</i>

356
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,424
- And then how much time do we have-
- Thirty minutes.

357
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,471
[Weylon]
That's right.

358
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,682
A Topol-class missile
launched from North Korea...

359
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,767
<i>would strike the United States...</i>

360
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:53,188
in approximately 30 minutes.

361
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,234
Once it's in the air, there is no asset
in our arsenal that can bring it down.

362
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,945
Sir, in light of this, I think we ought
to revisit your decision...

363
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,614
to give Mackey's team
the go-ahead.

364
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:18,338
<i>- Mazetti, you're up.
- [Man] Let's go, Mazetti!</i>

365
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,638
- Good bounce.
- Thank you, sir.

366
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,807
Good bounce, Mazetti!

367
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,685
- Ten bucks says the new guy freezes.
- Shut up, Mazetti!

368
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,478
<i>[James]
Shultiess!</i>

369
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,065
- Happy jumping, Shultiess.
- Thank you, sir.

370
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,610
Meideros!

371
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,905
This is what we do, boys.

372
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,740
Whoo!

373
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,159
- [Alarm Beeping]
- [James] Mazetti, hold on.

374
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,369
Hold on, guys.
Back up.

375
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,748
<i>[Man On Radio] Team Leader, this is the cockpit.
Pentagon is saying stand down.</i>

376
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,255
Abort.

377
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,758
- Abort!
- Abort!

378
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,387
[Thinking]
Un-fucking-believable.

379
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:13,769
We have an abort mission.
You keep these boys on the plane!

380
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,730
[Barnes]
Bobby!

381
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,778
- What the hell's going on, Chief!
- Get back, sailor.

382
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,447
Mazetti, on the hatch.
Ballantine, check the hydraulics.

383
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,533
<i>What are you doing?
Our guys are out there!</i>

384
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,035
Following orders.
Now step back, Master Chief.

385
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,120
That's bullshit!
They got no SATCOM!

386
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,790
Bobby is completely fucked
down there.

387
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,668
They will send a cleanup team.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

388
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,337
Ballantine, take it off.
Take it off!

389
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,422
<i>Callaghan, what are you doing?</i>

390
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,801
Can't send a clean-up crew, 'cause they'll
never find 'em, and the North KO's will.

391
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,429
That's not for you to decide.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

392
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:52,140
Callaghan,
you will not exit this plane.

393
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,103
Barnes, I am making this jump!

394
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,482
<i>[Man]
Callaghan, don't be an idiot!</i>

395
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,526
<i>[Barnes]
Track this leg for coordinates.</i>

396
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,737
<i>Stay on oxygen
until we stabilize.</i>

397
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,158
[James, Thinking]
Exit airplane, proper body position.

398
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,661
Forget that.

399
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,665
Today, we're gonna go through a variety
of non-optimal parachute functions-

400
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,001
inversions, cigarette rolls,
line-overs, totals...

401
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:22,254
And my personal favorite-
the Mae West.

402
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,675
All of which have one thing in common-
They're all fatal.

403
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,011
[James, Thinking]
Stay with the program. Don't deploy in spin.

404
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,805
Spin recovery- full spread eagle.
Spin recovery- arch back.

405
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,807
Don't deploy.
Recover position.

406
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,809
Gain control.
Deploy parachute.

407
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,811
Come on, Bobby,
stay with the program.

408
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,315
Gain control. Deploy parachute.
Brace for opening shock.

409
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,360
<i>[Boytano] On rare occasions,
your parachute will fail to deploy.</i>

410
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:48,864
It is for this reason the U.S. Navy
provides you with a reserve chute.

411
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,992
But before you attempt
to cut away your main chute...

412
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,203
you must first cut away your Twinkie.

413
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,079
[James, Thinking]
Cut away the chute.

414
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,208
Get to the Twinkie.
Get to the Twinkie.

415
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,377
<i>[Boytano] Worse than a total
deployment failure is a partial deployment.</i>

416
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:06,048
Centrifugal force rushes all the blood
from your brain to your feet.

417
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,509
Fifteen seconds,
you get tunnel vision.

418
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,802
<i>Ten seconds, you black out.</i>

419
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:14,181
<i>After that, you die.</i>

420
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,476
[James, Thinking]
Ka-bar knife. Right thigh pocket.

421
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,895
Full spread eagle.
Brace for opening shock.

422
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,648
[Groans]

423
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,945
Crown jewel, my ass.

424
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,242
<i>What's going on, Admiral?</i>

425
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,911
The situation's very fluid here.

426
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,205
Our of my guys jumped
before the recall order was-

427
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,207
That's not how I heard it,
Commander.

428
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,669
I heard two of your guys, including
your lieutenant, jumped after the red.

429
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,671
Rom what I gather,
General Vance...

430
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:48,006
Lieutenant James slipped
and was sucked out the plane.

431
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,759
<i>- And Callaghan?
- Well, he may have jumped before the order.</i>

432
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,095
- His comm unit was probably-
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Mackey.

433
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,139
Your men lack discipline.
They got no respect for chain of command.

434
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,725
<i>- I disagree with that assessment, sir.
- You think they're heroes?</i>

435
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,895
They're cowboys. They're gonna get people killed.
You better pray they're not detected.

436
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,565
I've ordered Team 1 Helo Platoon
to organize an exfil-

437
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,150
No, sir. You will not.

438
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:11,238
<i>- General, my guys are my res-
- Your guys will dig in and stay put.</i>

439
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:16,201
The president has ordered
a surgical strike at the missile site.

440
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:20,747
Your guys will do B.D.A. And when that's done,
our guys will pull 'em out in a Pave Low.

441
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,208
<i>And when is this happening, sir?</i>

442
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,460
You'll know when you need
to know, Commander.

443
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,173

You're right.
I'm sorry, Colonel.

01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:09,725
On your feet, Master Chief.

1151
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:18,358
- Lieutenant James.
- Yes, sir.

1152
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,527
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1153
01:29:20,652 --> 01:29:22,738
- Come in. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

1154
01:29:22,863 --> 01:29:25,908
<i>On the Article 15 charge
of striking an officer...</i>

1155
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:29,161
we find the defendant
guilty as charged...

1156
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:33,040
and sentence him to one year
in the Naval Consolidated Brig at Miramar.

1157
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,794
<i>Sir? The lieutenant's witness is here.</i>

1158
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:41,006
Send him in.

1159
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:47,304
<i>[Woman Vocalizing]</i>

1160
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:53,018
<i>On the Article 90 charge
of disobeying a lawful order...</i>

1161
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,145
we find the defendant guilty...

1162
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:59,191
and sentence him to 10 years
at NAVCONBRIG Miramar.

1163
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,277
Lieutenant Robert James...

1164
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:06,865
for service to your country...

1165
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:11,495
I am proud to present you
with the Distinguished Service Cross.

1166
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:19,169
<i>Does the prisoner
have anything he'd like to say?</i>

1167
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:21,880
No, sir.

1168
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:23,966
Very well.

1169
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:27,636
By executive order...

1170
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:32,516
the transcripts of this tribunal
are classified top secret.

1171
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:37,229
The record of these charges are to be
expunged from your permanent record...

1172
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:39,898

is commuted to time served.

<i>- You saw that?

1177
01:31:06,842 --> 01:31:08,844
<i>Why didn't you ever red tag me?</i>

1178
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:13,682
Because I never saw anybody
who wanted to be a Navy SEAL bad as you.

1179
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:20,397
You know, Master Chief...

1180
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:25,235
what you taught me,
what you trained me to do-

1181
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:27,404
You saved my life
over there, sir.

1182
01:31:30,365 --> 01:31:32,326
Come on, son.

<i>The mushroom cloud
was first detected Sunday...</i>

1188
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:02,314
<i>in satellite images
by South Korean media...</i>

1189
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:05,901
<i>indicating the cloud
was approximately four kilometers...</i>

1190
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:11,698
<i>at the border area between North Korea
and China in Yanggang Province.</i>

1191
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:15,702
<i>Pyongyang initially denied
that any explosion had occurred...</i>

1192
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:19,456
<i>but later reversed themselves,
linking the explosion...</i>

1193
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,125
<i>to a hydroelectric dam project.</i>

1194
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:25,796
<i>In the U.S.,
several high-ranking officials...</i>

1195
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:29,466
<i>were unusually quick
to accept Pyongyang's explanation...</i>

1196
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:33,303
<i>or offered differing explanations
of their own.</i>

1197
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:38,767
<i>National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
told CNN yesterday...</i>

1198
01:32:38,851 --> 01:32:43,564
<i>"There are all kinds of reports, and there are
all kinds of assessments that are going on.</i>

1199
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:46,400
<i>Maybe it was a forest fire
of some kind."</i>

1200
01:32:46,525 --> 01:32:49,111
When the stories
broke over the weekend...

1201
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:52,656
<i>about some explosion
taking place in North Korea...</i>

1202
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:55,450
my instincts told me
it was not a nuclear explosion.

1203
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:57,578
As you know,
the North Koreans announced today...

1204
01:32:57,703 --> 01:33:01,540
that they were doing some demolition work
for a hydroelectric project...

1205
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:04,960
and they're inviting
visiting foreign officials-

1206
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,754
especially from the United Kingdom-
to visit the site.

1207
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:11,884
<i>However, upon their return,
the diplomats told reporters...</i>

1208
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:14,052
<i>that, according
to the satellite images...</i>

1209
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,889
<i>they had been taken
to the wrong position-</i>

1210
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:21,351
<i>about 100 kilometers
from the suspected explosion site.</i>

1211
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:25,105
<i>Today, the story
took another curious turn...</i>

1212
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:30,027
<i>as the South Korean
Vice Minister of Unification, Rhee Bong-jo...</i>

1213
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:34,114
<i>released a statement
claiming that there was no explosion...</i>

1214
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,658
<i>stating the supposed
mushroom cloud...</i>

1215
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:39,661
<i>was a natural cloud formation.</i>

1216
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:44,249
<i>Perhaps the most troubling theory
put forth to explain the large cloud...</i>

1217
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:48,378
<i>is that a foreign state
may have incurred into North Korea...</i>

1218
01:33:48,504 --> 01:33:52,257
<i>to conduct a clandestine
military operation.</i>

1219
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:56,178
<i>This theory took on greater potential
for being accurate...</i>

1220
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:59,681
<i>when it was discovered today
that the explosion occurred...</i>

1221

<i>near the site

1
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,179
original site and ruins of Manchu 731

2
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:48,026
Ping Fang District, Harbin, China

3
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:57,865
Prior to the Second World War

4
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,038
the Japanese Militarists had occupied N.E. China

5
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,415
& established the puppet state Manchoukou

6
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:14,222
ln order to expand their Greater East Asia Empire

7
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,757
the Japanese did a lot of preparatory work.

8
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,692
Some of the least known work

9
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,229
were the experiments on bacterial weapons.

10
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:24,732
by the Manchu 731 Squadron

11
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,238
This Squadron 731 had many Sub-Sections

12
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:36,233
They were: Helier,

13
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:39,243
Sun Wu,

14
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:41,750
Lion Kou,

15
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:44,252
Mu Dan Jiang,

16
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,755
and An Da Rural Experimental Station.

17
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,759
The main offices of 731

18
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:54,589
were situated in a residential district of Harbin

19
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,697
They covered a large area of land

20
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,268
The headquarters were highly classified,

21
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:05,273
and surrounded by a high tension electric fence.

22
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,776
lnside there were extensive facilities,

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,278
there was an animal farm,

24
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:12,781
a crematorium,

25
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,283
a pathology laboratory, a jail,

26
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,786
an electricity generating plant,

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,286
the commanders’ quarters,

28
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:21,790
& other sections for various experimental projects.

29
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:24,292
By February 1945

30
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:26,795
the Japanese forces were suffering losses on the battle front

31
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,798
to win the war by biological warfare

32
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:33,301
the Military Headquarters reinstated a Lt. General to be the
Squadron commander.

33
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,304
Yet this person had previously been relieved off this post
because of corruption.

34
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:40,297
This man, the inventor of the lshit Water Purifier

35
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,311
a military medical doctor, Lt. lshii Shiro.

36
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,314
A group of young soldiers were sent to Harbin to
provide new blood for this squadron.

37
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,818
The banks of Song Hua River,

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,329
When will they come to pick us up?

39
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,331
Captain Takehara's gone to Bai Hua Liao

40
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,329
to find our new sergeant.

41
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,335
He's been gone for almost an hour.

42
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,830
Why aren't we allowed to go to Bai Hua Liao?

43
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:12,340
This place is freezing cold

44
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,843
Yes, it's similar to Chiba Prefecture

45
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,345
l think it's much colder here

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,848
lshikawa, don't you think so?

47
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:22,350
lt makes no difference,

48
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,853
we aren't going home anyway.

49
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,354
Look!

50
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,858
lshikawa already misses home after leaving
Mom for a few days.

51
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:32,360
He is just a Momma's boy,

52
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,363
he even broke down & cried when his
mom saw him off.

53
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,366
But you cried too!

54
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,869
No. l didn't!

55
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:41,869
But my mom & sister did.

56
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,871
Yes my mom cried too.

57
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,873
l didn't cry.

58
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,908
but l felt really bad.

59
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,377
My father was killed fighting in China.

60
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:50,545
So was mine!

61
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:52,373
So were my father and my elder brother,

62
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,880
they died fighting in China.

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,948
This kind of food is even hard to get back home
in our Japan.

64
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,950
Did you know that?

65
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:06,454
Drag him out!

66
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:12,450
Yeah! Stuff it in!

67
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,557
The original building housing

68
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:52,553
the Manchu 731 Squadron.

69
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:22,590
General,

70
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,592
Doctor lshii's arrived at the H.Q.,

71
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:25,589
would you...

72
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,592
Yeah, l'm coming.

73
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,606
lshikawa,

74
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,608
Catch the ball!

75
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,611
Dr. lshii!

76
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:49,606
General Kikuchi.

77
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,624
You still look like the same great lshii.

78
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,627
Squadron 731's lshii.

79
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:09,297
Welcome back, lshii!

80
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,645
Lt. General lshii's returned to the corps!

81
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:28,656
ldiots! Listen!

82
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:31,659
l'm the new Section Head, Captain Kawasaki.

83
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,162
From now on you are in the Kwangtung Army,

84
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:37,665
members of the 731 Squadron Youth Corps!

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,668
lf you get the chance to go to Harbin,

86
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:43,671
weather you leave or your day off,

87
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,669
you must change into civilian clothes before leaving,

88
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,669
& when you return,

89
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:51,672
put your uniforms back on at Bai Hua Liao.

90
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,677
lf you run into any other Japanese

91
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,679
or if you are stopped by a patrol,

92
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,679
you will not reveal your secondment to this squadron.

93
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,688
ls that clear?

94
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:02,690
Yes, Sir!

95
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:15,692
Crematorium

96
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,729
lt's almost three years since 1942

97
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,732
A toast to you and your brothers reunion.

98
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,736
Cheers!

99
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,740
Thank you, Sir.

100
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,746
Now, Gentleman,

101
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:02,743
l've not been here for the last couple of years

102
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:05,749
but l know all about what has been going on here.

103
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,756
l've looked into the research done by Mr. Kitano

104
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,259
and l think it has been handled wrongly.

105
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,761
What we need most now

106
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:17,754
is to increase the production & the number
of bacteria.

107
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,268
We must use bacterial weapons in the war

108
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:22,769
to speed our victory.

109
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:24,772
A toast to victory!

110
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:25,769
To the empire!

111
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:26,770
To victory

112
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,272
And to Mr. lshii for leading 731!

113
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,275
Cheers!, Cheers!

114
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:30,778
Sir!

115
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,281
Lt. General sir.

116
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:38,775
Lt. Onoe Shunji reporting for duty from the
Kwangtung Army Commanders’ office.

117
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,288
Lt. General?

118
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:43,791
l should have been a full general!

119
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,293
l don't understand

120
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,797
Why those idiots at the Central Planning Office decline
that army doctors can go no higher than Lt. General.

121
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,299
lt's ridiculous!

122
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:55,794
Lt. Onoe!

123
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,799
l've just made a criticism against the
Central Planning Office

124
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,809
would you inform on me?

125
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,318
Stop!

126
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,487
Have you no respect for your seniors?

127
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,839
Forget it, let’s go back!

128
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:33,841
We'll be in trouble if we are discovered.

129
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:35,343
No!

130
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:37,845
My brother gave me that ball when l left Japan.

131
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:55,923
Get up! out of your beds!

132
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,096
Where's Hoshino and lshikawa?

133
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:03,264
l don't know.

134
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,432
l don't either.

135
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,934
Ono... where's he gone to?

136
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:09,934
l don't know!

137
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:39,967
Animal Breeding Unit

138
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,107
Hoshino!

139
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:03,110
Don't run!

140
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,119
Hoshino!

141
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,129
Stop running! Hoshino...

142
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,155
That was totally undisciplined

143
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,158
that must never be repeated.

144
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,160
The training of the Youth Corps is important.

145
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:55,663
lt's not only because we are short of staff

146
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:59,166
it's also because what we require here

147
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,669
are people of the highest integrity.

148
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:03,670
Headquarters only recognizes the importance

149
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:06,173
of bacterial weapons in this war.

150
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,176
The fail to realize that biological & chemical weapons

151
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,179
will greatly affect the future of Japan.

152
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,682
They will play a very important role.

153
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,184
So we must work doubly hard on these experiments.

154
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,181
Yes, sir!

155
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:21,181
That was really unexpected.

156
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:24,191
We have to step up security and discipline.

157
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,194
lt's late. l'd better leave you two to talk!

158
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,702
Brother, please sit down!

159
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,213
Shiro,

160
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:50,217
what's happening back in Chiba Prefecture?

161
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,723
There's shortage of everything

162
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:59,226
but people are managing

163
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,729
People have suffered a lot these past few years.

164
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:04,231
We can only do our best, brother

165
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,734
How are things here?

166
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:09,236
What about the men's morale?

167
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,231
Not too bad,

168
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,236
things are all right.

169
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,409
Also we confirmed that the incident

170
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,237
which got you relieved

171
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,242
was due to an informer.

172
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:21,582
lt was Lt. Colonel Nakatome who reported you

173
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,751
He even ridiculed the effectiveness of your
water purifier.

174
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:28,255
Nakatome! Goddamn him!

175
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,273
Attention

176
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,268
Nakatome! Lt. Colonel Nakatome
present!

177
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,308
Lt. General lshii wants you!

178
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,402
Kawasaki, any absentees?

179
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:59,406
Unfortunately

180
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:00,741
we had an accident just now.

181
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:09,416
l want you to treat those kids from Chiba gently.

182
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:12,578
They are important to us

183
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,422
Thank you!

184
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:23,430
Damn you!

185
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,433
Hashino brought about his own death

186
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:29,436
and you are acting like a bunch of school girls.

187
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,439
What kind of soldiers are you?

188
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:34,942
How can you gain honor for Chiba like this?

189
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,444
Soldiers shouldn't act like this!

190
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,946
Quick, close ranks!

191
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,452
Everybody down, prone position, crawl!

192
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,022
Assholes, quick!

193
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,537
Stand up!

194
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,540
Attention!

195
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,572
l heard that the fighting is very heavy
on the southern front,

196
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:55,082
our whole army could possibly be wiped out!

197
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,587
lt sounds serious.

198
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:02,589
We have to push our people

199
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:04,584
to speed up the experiments on the marut

200
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,586
These biological weapons

201
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,588
are the only way to turn the war in our favor.

202
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,590
What did they say?

203
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:12,766
lt sounded like little Japan is finished!

204
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:15,601
Let’s go!

205
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:23,610
Wait!

206
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,615
Sir, please!

207
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,619
Give me back my baby!

208
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,630
My baby, my baby... please give her back to me!

209
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,661
Sir, didn't General lshii tell us that

210
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,164
we are supposed to conservatively use the "marut"?

211
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:19,666
This one can be stuffed and mounted, it
won't be wasted.

212
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,664
February 29, 1945

213
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,007
Victim: Zhao Qing, Han Chinese, 3 month old

214
00:25:51,232 --> 00:25:53,200
Oh water!

215
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,705
Water's coming out!

216
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,722
lt's really tough.

217
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:18,225
Thank god the money is All right.

218
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,226
also l can study.

219
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,729
do you send money home?

220
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,231
No.

221
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,733
Come on, you spend it all every month!

222
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,236
No, mom said l must have it for the war efforts.

223
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,738
This is a nice place!

224
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:34,741
it's similar to Chiba Prefecture.

225
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,743
Chiba is not that cold

226
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,246
this is like a hospital.

227
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,748
l say it's not

228
00:26:42,283 --> 00:26:44,251
We only have dead bodies here

229
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,753
hospitals should have patients

230
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,755
this is more like a medical school

231
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,258
Anyway this is fine by me

232
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,259
l eat well and l can make money

233
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:55,762
The only thing is this fat Captain

234
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,265
Look, isn't that Hoshino's ball?

235
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,768
Get it back!

236
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:05,272
Come on, let’s get it back!

237
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,776
Let's get it back!

238
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:29,789
Stop!

239
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:32,799
There's nowhere to run!

240
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,797
Give the ball back to us!

241
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:43,810
This is not Hoshino's ball!

242
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,814
Who are you? What are you doing here?

243
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,321
He is a mute!

244
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,370
Hold on a minute!

245
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:48,875
What is wrong with him?

246
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,378
He's been here for over a month,

247
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:53,880
but he's still not adjusted to this place yet.

248
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:55,875
He vomits every time he goes to work.

249
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,875
When it happens

250
00:28:57,418 --> 00:28:58,885
we have to let him take a break

251
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,547
it will take him a while to get used to it!

252
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:04,891
That's O.K., he'll soon get used to it!

253
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:06,893
His job is important!

254
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,896
we rely on the colors to determine the results
of the experiments

255
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:12,232
we can't depend totally on black and white pictures.

256
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,901
Look after him, see that he works well!

257
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:16,903
Sir!

258
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,910
Lt. Col. Nakatome Jiro

259
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,906
l've been transferred to the southern front by order
of the Kwangtung Army Commander

260
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:29,241
l'd like to say goodbye sir.

261
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,918
Congratulations,

262
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,921
the situation in the south is serious,

263
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:38,091
a patriotic soldier like you

264
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,260
should be able to achieve a lot here

265
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,596
especially as you have a close relationship with
the planning office

266
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:43,930
you can do a lot for the war effort!

267
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:45,932
Yes, Sir!

268
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:56,943
This must be your arrangement.

269
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:06,953
This marut

270
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:08,955
has been injected with plague three times.

271
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:10,950
But no symptoms have appeared.

272
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,952
So now let’s conduct live dissection on him,
& see what's so special about him.

273
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:13,952
Good!

274
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:16,963
The correct data,

275
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:19,959
relies on continuous tests on experimental subjects

276
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:21,961
so these maruts,

277
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,304
not only have to be alive,

278
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,973
but they also have to be fit and healthy.

279
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,968
experiments on such live subjects

280
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:30,970
is a rare opportunity.

281
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:42,989
What is this?

282
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:44,984
lt's a man!

283
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:52,999
What is this?

284
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:54,501
He's a Chinese man.

285
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:06,680
What is this?

286
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:09,015
He is a bad Chinese man!

287
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,022
This is a marut.

288
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,358
lt is a log for the fire or making coffins,

289
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,694
it is material for experiment.

290
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,028
lt is called a "Marut"

291
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:24,023
What is this?

292
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:26,032
This is a marut.

293
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,034
What is this?

294
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:30,036
A Marut!

295
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:33,039
What is this?

296
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,041
A Marut!

297
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,047
What is this?

298
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:47,043
A Marut!

299
00:31:47,588 --> 00:32:01,059
Beat him!

300
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:06,072
We must try to get evidence

301
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,575
& get it out of here

302
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:10,576
so the outside world knows what's going on in here.

303
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,703
lt's the only thing we can do!

304
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:31,097
Look, why go through all that trouble?

305
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:33,099
say we have no chance of getting out here!

306
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:37,103
You chicken! You have no back-bone!

307
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,439
and you... learn to be a man. Don't copy him.

308
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,108
You don't act like a Chinese!

309
00:32:47,147 --> 00:32:50,116
Beyond Practice Ground

310
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:07,126
Order arms!

311
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:09,635
At ease!

312
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,140
The lessons on experiments will start tomorrow,

313
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,643
so work hard men, & learn well,

314
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:18,144
is that clear?

315
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,141
Yes, sir!

316
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,158
Sir, please!

317
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,153
let her carry it away

318
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:36,162
it’s her baby!

319
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,169
Let's go!

320
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,177
Please, Sir!

321
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,186
Bacterial Extermination Room

322
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,702
Quickly change your clothes!

323
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:18,204
Hurry up!

324
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,716
Let's go!

325
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:39,225
March 9, 1945

326
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:42,221
Outdoor Frostbite Experimental Station

327
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:45,224
Victim: Zhao Hui Xiu, Han Chinese, 24 years old

328
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,368
Bacteria Breeding Room

329
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:05,371
Look, this is the "gene" production room.

330
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,378
This is the high temperature bacteria
exterminating room.

331
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:40,406
Look this way please,

332
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:43,409
this is the bacteria transplants,

333
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:45,912
you must study hard and learn all this as
soon as possible.

334
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,247
Yes, Sir!

335
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:49,415
Frostbite Experimental Room

336
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,428
This is the cold treatment station

337
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:08,434
At -35°C for 10 hours Cold Treatment

338
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:10,937
Water temperature 15°C.

339
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:49,475
March 9, 1945

340
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,811
Victim: Jin Yuan Long, Manchurian, 31years old

341
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:03,489
What you are looking at now,

342
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:05,825
is a quick freezing station, it is -196°C.

343
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,519
Finish chewing your apple,

344
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:35,514
& spit it out like l do.

345
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:38,524
Don't swallow it.

346
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,860
This way you can

347
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,525
collect the germs from the mouth.

348
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:43,521
Yes, Sir!

349
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:52,537
Go back and tell your captain,

350
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:54,874
that you’ll be my guests this Sunday,

351
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:56,539
we'll have drinks together.

352
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:58,044
Yes Sir!

353
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,048
And you’ll come too, O.K.?

354
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,551
O.K.

355
00:40:07,587 --> 00:40:09,555
Thank you!

356
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,567
This is a question of humanity.

357
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:22,902
No!

358
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:26,572
This concerns the rise or fall of the
Great Japanese Empire.

359
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,908
Listen lshikawa, they are human beings too,

360
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:31,244
they have parents just like you!

361
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,579
What are you talking about?

362
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:36,575
Give me better justification than that!

363
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,917
Today is Sunday

364
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:40,086
let’s not talk about business,

365
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,254
come on lets eat up.

366
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,589
This fruit is specially brought over from Japan.

367
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:44,924
Help yourselves.

368
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,593
Let me, you must look after your health.

369
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:55,601
Take Mrs. Takamura for example,

370
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,937
what's the difference between the children she bore

371
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:00,273
& the maruts?

372
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,608
What are you talking about?

373
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,944
That's not right!

374
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:07,280
You can not compare the maruts to the Japanese,

375
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,615
you & l speak a different language.

376
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,610
Please don't say anymore

377
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,620
l'm sorry, please excuse me.

378
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,629
lshikawa, wait!

379
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,720
lshikawa, lshikawa!

380
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,728
Kawasaki pushed him... from upstairs!

381
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:05,064
He's badly hurt,

382
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:07,400
let’s think of a way to teach Kawasaki a lesson.

383
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,735
l hope you'll work well together.

384
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,238
To be a member of the 731 Youth Corps

385
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:13,739
we should...

386
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:16,075
obey the regulations.

387
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,411
l think you'd better forget about it.

388
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:19,745
Don't pretend now,

389
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,740
you have no guts.

390
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:30,756
Coward. Stop pretending!

391
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,385
April 11, 1945

392
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,828
Those goddamned Japs...

393
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:45,164
What the hell are they up to?

394
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:46,499
Hey Specs!

395
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,834
What do you think the Japs will do to us?

396
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:06,852
What did they inject into us this morning?

397
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,188
l have no reaction at all!

398
00:45:09,889 --> 00:45:11,857
l have no idea what it was.

399
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:16,862
Why didn't those people get it too?

400
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:40,886
Be careful of contamination!

401
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:43,222
the last accident cost Sakagami & Ohtani their lives,

402
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,891
so be careful everyone.

403
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:06,912
Sir, according to the previous test results,

404
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,248
it would be a rather difficult job to produce a
Black Death Virus

405
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:10,913
that is 60times stronger.

406
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:18,924
Now this is the 7th experiment,

407
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,427
here is the record for the last few tests!

408
00:46:22,962 --> 00:46:24,930
Sir, l've heard the Germans are using the Jews
to perform similar kinds of tests

409
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:27,266
and they’ve achieved good results,

410
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:29,602
so can't we...

411
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:34,940
Dr. lshii did 2years research on this in Europe
before the war.

412
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:38,277
According to him, the German researches into that
area are fare behind ours.

413
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:41,614
Compared to this, their equipment & facilities are
fare behind ours

414
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:47,942
What they achieved so far may not be of
any use for us.

415
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:50,956
Don't be discouraged, keep up the good work,

416
00:46:51,324 --> 00:46:54,293
report to me at once when the experiments
are completed.

417
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,965
Yes sir, l heard that Lt. Colonel Nakatome
died in action on the southern front, is that right?

418
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:09,975
Dr. lshii may have been too...

419
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:16,982
We'd better keep out of that,

420
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:19,485
You'd better concentrate on your own career.

421
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:22,988
The Empire Medical Department is waiting
for your return.

422
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,492
The medical future of Japan relies on you people.

423
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:37,002
Early summer 1945

424
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,005
Japanese were retreating from the Pacific Front

425
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:43,001
They also suffered many losses in China.

426
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:47,001
The moral of the Japanese troops was very bad.

427
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,009
All of Japan had been mobilized,

428
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,009
there were still great shortages of everything.

429
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:58,016
A large deficit of manpower for the Japanese

430
00:47:58,558 --> 00:48:01,026
military resulted in more adolescents joining

431
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:04,025
the forces. The cloud of defeat loomed larger

432
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:07,025
ln other words, the success or failure of 731

433
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,028
decides the survival of the Empire.

434
00:48:10,403 --> 00:48:12,371
So today...

435
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:16,038
we should have no more illusions about the
Kwangtung Army,

436
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:19,044
the Kwangtung Army relies on our bacterial war,

437
00:48:19,412 --> 00:48:22,040
there is no other way of winning it.

438
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:25,384
l've always thought that biological weapons
are more effective than bombers and guns

439
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:28,050
Right now we must regroup our forces,

440
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:31,049
& mobilize them.

441
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:34,052
l entreat you to work doubly hard

442
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:37,062
We must get ourselves well prepared
for the coming bacterial war.

443
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:41,066
Gentleman, do you have any questions?

444
00:48:45,538 --> 00:48:48,063
Please, go ahead!

445
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:52,077
We have already successfully produced

446
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:54,413
a large quantity of virus which is 60times stronger
than the Black Death Virus.

447
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,082
The amount of culture we have,

448
00:48:58,117 --> 00:49:00,085
according to our calculations,

449
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:03,081
has enough power to wipe out the
whole mankind.

450
00:49:04,123 --> 00:49:06,091
At the same time

451
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:08,761
we have increased the number

452
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:11,096
of bacteria carrying rats to three million,

453
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,766
& jumping fleas to 300 kilos.

454
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:17,102
The number is estimated at 10 billion,

455
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:20,105
if this 10 billion bacteria carrying fleas

456
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,100
were all released, then it's not hard to imagine

457
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:26,111
the situation on the war front would change
drastically,

458
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:29,114
we would gain the final victory!

459
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:31,113
Because of the bacterial weapons

460
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,786
the fate of the Great Japanese Empire

461
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:36,121
lies in our hands.

462
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:38,116
Still after numerous experiments

463
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:40,459
the metal shell casings holding the bacteria

464
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,127
get very hot during firing.

465
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:43,462
And a majority of the infected fleas inside
get killed

466
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,631
so these bacterial bombs have failed to produce
the expected results.

467
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:47,132
Weapons Production Department...

468
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:51,136
Anything else?

469
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:55,140
Sir, there's been a strong reaction to the incident

470
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:57,476
when Kawasaki assaulted the Youth Corps member

471
00:49:58,177 --> 00:50:00,145
and it's getting to be quite serious.

472
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:03,145
There's a lot of tension & unrest amongst the Corps.

473
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:06,151
Transfer Kawasaki from the Youth Corps.

474
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,146
Onoe you'll replace him.

475
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:10,155
Yes, Sir!

476
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,158
Sukizan Geisha House

477
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:18,163
Sorry to disturb you,

478
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:36,181
General, it seems your sword's not rusted yet!

479
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,188
Get out both of you!

480
00:50:44,223 --> 00:50:46,191
Yes, Sir!

481
00:53:43,636 --> 00:53:49,597
Whoever... was hit or touched by the chess pieces,
raise your hands.

482
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:02,621
Gentlemen.

483
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:06,625
This is... my new invention.

484
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,628
This... is called Low Temperature Pottery...

485
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,623
Bacterial Bomb!

486
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:48,667
The Great Japan will not be defeated!

487
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:59,677
Careful! Don't break the pottery bomb!

488
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:31,710
May 22, 1945

489
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:34,712
An Da Rural Experimental Station

490
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,709
Victims: Names unknown, 29 males and females

491
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:43,722
Hurry up lshikawa!

492
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,755
May 29, 1945

493
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,750
Decompression Laboratory

494
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,753
Victim: Qu Hua, Han Chinese, 34 years old

495
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:11,869
not a female "maruta"

496
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,866
Kawasaki, l want you to bring me a healthy
young man.

497
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:18,873
What's the use of a healthy young man?

498
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,872
lt's of no use for you,

499
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,874
but it's of great use for us.

500
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,049
Please help us get one!

501
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:25,550
Kawasaki,

502
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:27,886
if you can help us find a healthy young man,

503
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,222
then i'll buy you a drink.

504
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:31,886
Right, we'll all buy you a drink.

505
00:58:32,424 --> 00:58:34,892
Kawasaki's good at that.

506
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,229
l'm sorry, l can't help you with that.

507
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,397
Kawasaki's only good at finding girls!

508
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:42,400
That's nonsense!

509
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:46,905
Come on Kawasaki!

510
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,241
Do something for us.

511
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:50,905
We'll reward you. Please!

512
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:53,912
O.K., l'll try.

513
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:56,915
June 12, 1945

514
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,251
Poison Gas Laboratory

515
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:03,918
Victim: Natashalvanova, White Russia, 35 years old

516
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:11,930
You can do what ever you want with me!

517
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,266
Let my daughter go, please!

518
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:16,935
Please, l beg you, let her go!

519
00:59:23,475 --> 00:59:25,943
Please!

520
01:01:24,096 --> 01:01:27,065
You've been here a while, are you used to it?

521
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,066
Yes, sir, l am!

522
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:34,072
Do you still see that Chinese mute?

523
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,408
Not very often, sir!

524
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:38,743
Do you think you can find him for me?

525
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,078
What for, sir?

526
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,108
Sir, l've brought you the mute.

527
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:13,111
Thank you, well done.

528
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:17,115
Don't be afraid!

529
01:02:32,164 --> 01:02:34,132
Let him in.

530
01:02:37,169 --> 01:02:41,128
Come here, come inside.

531
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:46,144
You wait here,

532
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,480
When the surgery is finished,

533
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:50,815
you can take him away.

534
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:53,151
Surgery? What surgery?

535
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,146
No questions!

536
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,322
Keep your nose out of these things.

537
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:23,181
Come here!

538
01:03:24,216 --> 01:03:26,184
Go on!

539
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:42,200
Come here!

540
01:06:46,418 --> 01:06:48,386
Where are you going?

541
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,384
Surgery is finished! Take him away! Quickly!

542
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:51,556
Yes sir!

543
01:06:56,428 --> 01:06:58,396
Are you satisfied now?

544
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,392
Each of you got what you wanted... the heart...

545
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,396
the liver,

546
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,397
and the brain.

547
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:06,400
these organs from a living healthy young man
in puberty,

548
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,403
are difficult to come by!

549
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:12,410
We should thank Kawasaki.

550
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:18,416
Don't mention it!

551
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,918
We'll invite you to dinner this evening.

552
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:22,920
Thank you! Thank you!

553
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:26,424
What's wrong with you? Quickly push the cart away!

554
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,423
Yes, sir!

555
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:31,929
July 2, 1945

556
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:34,432
Victim: A mute, name unknown, Han Chinese

557
01:07:36,468 --> 01:07:38,436
Tunnel connecting Pathology Lab to Crematorium

558
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,509
Makimura, draw the curtains.

559
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:58,516
That fat ass is a barbarian.

560
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:01,519
Come here, that mute was not a marut

561
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,518
That animal has gone too far!

562
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,523
Yeah, l have always detested him.

563
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,696
Let's find a way to fix him!

564
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,031
What do you think?

565
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:20,527
l want to kill him. lf there's a problem, l take
responsibility!

566
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:24,542
No, we are all in this together!

567
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,558
Hurry up!

568
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:45,563
Ready for disinfection?

569
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,088
What are you doing here? Get back!

570
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:48,746
A smart rat can beat a cat.

571
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,748
Fleas & germs can defeat bombers and guns too!

572
01:12:52,283 --> 01:12:54,751
This is... my theory behind 731 Squadron.

573
01:12:55,286 --> 01:12:57,254
lt's also my philosophy.

574
01:12:57,789 --> 01:12:59,757
For Victory,

575
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,259
we shall groom the strongest and nurture them,

576
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,261
the same applies for the Youth Corps.

577
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:06,263
Understand?

578
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:14,772
Stone, stone!

579
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:24,782
Stone, wait!

580
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:29,787
You must get out of here alive!

581
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:32,289
No matter what happens,

582
01:13:32,824 --> 01:13:34,792
we must get the evidence out!

583
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:36,794
Stone, quick!

584
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:38,796
Release him!

585
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,797
Get in the hole you bastard!

586
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,134
Stone won't follow a coward like you...

587
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:44,801
Stone won't go into anything blindly with you

588
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,797
The door is open!

589
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:55,812
Stone!

590
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:02,820
Fire!

591
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:06,323
Charge, charge!

592
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:09,827
Stone, watch where you are going!

593
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:10,995
Fire!

594
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,823
Get down quick!

595
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:37,854
ldiots!

596
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:40,357
So many maruts are dead,

597
01:14:40,558 --> 01:14:42,856
this is a serious matter.

598
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,858
Do you realize your job

599
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,031
is to keep them in good shape,

600
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,859
so they can live longer

601
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,861
But you neglected your duties,

602
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,863
with very serious consequences.

603
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,038
Your error is intolerable

604
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,866
& unforgivable!

605
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,869
Maruts are precious experimental material.

606
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:02,213
they mean more to us than ever...

607
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,878
You have no right to kill them.

608
01:15:07,919 --> 01:15:09,887
The Russo-Japanese war is coming,

609
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,223
but many of our experiments

610
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,888
have not been completed yet.

611
01:15:15,426 --> 01:15:17,394
The 731 Squadron is our nation's hope,

612
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:20,898
we hold the power to turn the war in our favour
and save Japan.

613
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:23,901
Get up now!

614
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:26,403
l hope you won’t forget,

615
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:28,906
that l was the one who brought you here from Chiba.

616
01:15:31,943 --> 01:15:34,912
Takamura at An Da Rural Station

617
01:15:35,446 --> 01:15:37,914
is preparing for the final pottery shell tests.

618
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,919
Have the Maruts gone yet?

619
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:45,923
They left early this morning, sir!

620
01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:08,946
Specs said,

621
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,448
that what you did was stupid.

622
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:14,952
We can't get out of here anyway.

623
01:16:15,486 --> 01:16:17,954
The more we resist, the faster we get killed.

624
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,959
He said the only thing we can do is to try &

625
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:24,295
get the evidence out.

626
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:26,960
So the world will know about this hell hole.

627
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,960
Dr. lshii, we're running out of time,

628
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,303
The situation at the front is very bad.

629
01:16:33,004 --> 01:16:35,973
Looks like this is the final straw for us.

630
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:37,474
The trip to Feng Tiang

631
01:16:38,009 --> 01:16:39,977
is very important, don't worry about things here.

632
01:16:47,018 --> 01:16:48,986
Thank you, l rely on you.

633
01:16:57,028 --> 01:16:57,995
Report, sir!

634
01:16:58,529 --> 01:17:00,497
lnform the air corps to take off now!

635
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:03,000
Preparations are complete at the shell test site.

636
01:17:03,534 --> 01:17:05,502
Come in... we haven't contacted them yet.

637
01:17:06,037 --> 01:17:07,004
Right...

638
01:17:07,538 --> 01:17:09,506
Let's go to the upper.

639
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:12,009
Fire the signal!

640
01:17:13,044 --> 01:17:16,013
Let's move!

641
01:17:30,728 --> 01:17:33,026
We need the Maruts urgently.

642
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:35,532
Are they on their way or not!

643
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:37,034
Reporting, Sir!

644
01:17:41,072 --> 01:17:43,040
Excuse me sir, urgent telegram.

645
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:46,043
You may go.

646
01:17:57,088 --> 01:18:00,057
August 9th, Nagasaki was bombed.

647
01:18:01,092 --> 01:18:02,559
The Russians have officially declared war.

648
01:18:03,094 --> 01:18:05,062
Manchuria 731 Sqdn. retreat if necessary.

649
01:18:05,596 --> 01:18:08,064
Go to Feng Tian and get the commander here!

650
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,068
Stop the delivery of Maruts.

651
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:19,065
Hello!

652
01:18:22,613 --> 01:18:25,081
Hello Airport!

653
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:32,089
Sir, the Maruts have escaped.

654
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:41,097
Go after them, don't let them run away!

655
01:18:41,632 --> 01:18:43,600
Get in the car quick! After them!

656
01:19:02,653 --> 01:19:06,111
Run, split out! Quick!

657
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:30,147
Hurry up! We must get the evidence out!

658
01:19:31,182 --> 01:19:33,150
Run, quick!

659
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:05,242
Stone, go that way, quick!!

660
01:21:12,283 --> 01:21:13,250
Quickly, run!

661
01:22:22,353 --> 01:22:24,321
August 8, 1945

662
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,658
Proclaim Bacterial Bomb Experiment

663
01:22:37,368 --> 01:22:39,336
Cover him!

664
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:10,367
Put him down here.

665
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:44,401
Sorry to disturb you!

666
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:50,407
Urgent telegram from Headquarters, sir!

667
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,415
Nagasaki was bombed.

668
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,413
The Russians have officially declared war.

669
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,587
The Kwangtung Army H.Q. ordered all troops
to retreat if necessary.

670
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,756
Are you coming back, sir?

671
01:24:11,462 --> 01:24:13,430
All troops to retreat?

672
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,768
What do we do, sir?

673
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:44,461
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombed
by the Americans.

674
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,797
The cities have been completely destroyed.

675
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:49,132
Now the Russians have declared war to us.

676
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,469
Our fate has been sealed.

677
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:55,465
We've received orders to retreat.

678
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,808
But l personally think,

679
01:24:58,175 --> 01:25:00,473
that the work of the 731 Sqdn.

680
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,813
involves top security information.

681
01:25:03,514 --> 01:25:06,483
So l'm now requesting the following:

682
01:25:07,518 --> 01:25:10,487
1) Exterminate all remaining Maruts

683
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:13,483
& destroy this whole facility.

684
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:16,486
The engineers will be in charge of that
the place must be flattened, l want no traces left.

685
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,829
2) Collect all data and documents

686
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,498
destroy them at once.

687
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,834
3) The Youth Corps is to retreat to Tung Hwa,

688
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:27,504
4) All units will commit suicide.

689
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:31,508
5) Their families and departments

690
01:25:32,543 --> 01:25:35,512
will also commit suicide.

691
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:39,516
ln other words...

692
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:45,511
no evidence must be left behind!

693
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:49,526
Dr. lshii,

694
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:52,529
Our squadron has a lot of highly qualified people,

695
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:54,865
isn't it a waste do order them to die?

696
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:58,034
We shouldn't allow such meaningless sacrifices.

697
01:25:59,069 --> 01:26:00,536
l realize that too Gen. Kikuchi,

698
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,873
but we have to guard the secret of this place.

699
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:05,041
Dr. lshii, if...

700
01:26:05,576 --> 01:26:09,535
you commit suicide, then l'll join you.

701
01:26:11,582 --> 01:26:14,551
These soldiers & their families have followed you

702
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,547
from Japan to Manchuria.

703
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:19,890
You should at least,

704
01:26:20,591 --> 01:26:22,559
get them back home.

705
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:25,562
lsn't that reasonable?

706
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,898
As the head of 731you're responsible for them.

707
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:30,567
You should be protecting them, not ordering them to die.

708
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,562
l hope you face up your responsibilities.

709
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:34,564
Gen. Kikuchi is right

710
01:26:35,606 --> 01:26:37,574
We should return to our home land,

711
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:41,574
and we should take all data with us.

712
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:51,087
That might be possible,

713
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:55,592
but we must still prepare for the possibility
of being captured.

714
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,587
No matter what,

715
01:26:58,128 --> 01:26:59,595
we can't allow these secrets to be made known.

716
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,597
How about this?

717
01:27:02,132 --> 01:27:03,599
We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide,

718
01:27:04,134 --> 01:27:06,102
if anyone's captured, then they

719
01:27:06,637 --> 01:27:08,605
commit suicide.

720
01:27:11,642 --> 01:27:12,609
Well...

721
01:27:13,143 --> 01:27:14,610
that's what we'll do.

722
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:17,113
l will personal be in charge of the retreat,

723
01:27:17,648 --> 01:27:19,115
& arrange the transport.

724
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,618
l'm very happy you made this decision,

725
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:25,622
l'm sure everybody is grateful to you.

726
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,648
What are you doing?

727
01:27:53,684 --> 01:27:55,652
These are our children's clothes!

728
01:27:56,186 --> 01:27:57,653
The data is important!

729
01:28:07,698 --> 01:28:09,666
Please take this with you, Madame!

730
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,668
You must take it if you are captured.

731
01:28:13,704 --> 01:28:15,672
Mr. Takamura prepared them.

732
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:22,679
Where are you going at his time?

733
01:28:23,213 --> 01:28:25,181
l'm going to the office to get more data!

734
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,018
The war is over and we are going home!

735
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,687
Shut up! What do you know!

736
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:33,690
l don't care about anything else

737
01:28:34,725 --> 01:28:37,694
all l know is that we are going home!

738
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:41,698
You are a woman, you know nothing!

739
01:28:42,733 --> 01:28:43,700
Yes l may know nothing,

740
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:46,703
and l certainly don't know how to make poison!

741
01:28:47,738 --> 01:28:49,706
How dare you to speak to me like that!

742
01:28:51,742 --> 01:28:53,710
Takamura! Takamura!

743
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,718
This is important data,

744
01:29:02,252 --> 01:29:04,755
We can not destroy it!

745
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:06,723
lf anyone dares to burn anymore...

746
01:29:07,257 --> 01:29:10,715
Takamura, l just want to go home!
Nothing else is important!

747
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:16,733
That’s all l want, Takamura!

748
01:29:23,774 --> 01:29:26,743
Burn it! Burn it all!

749
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:30,747
Takamura! This is an order, burn it all!

750
01:29:31,782 --> 01:29:33,750
l don't want a single piece left.

751
01:29:36,787 --> 01:29:38,755
You can't destroy the data!

752
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:41,091
This is the whole reason for our being here!

753
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,756
lt represents years of hard work!

754
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:49,099
& Japan will need it one day!

755
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,768
lf you want to destroy it kill me first!

756
01:30:25,836 --> 01:30:28,805
We're releasing the poison gas! Retreat! Hurry up!

757
01:31:07,878 --> 01:31:10,847
Hasegawa, Miki, come quick!

758
01:31:11,882 --> 01:31:13,850
Miki, go up!

759
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:51,888
lt's platinum, it's worth a lot of money.

760
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:27,924
This place is blowing up! Find shelter!

761
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:21,978
Quick, retreat!

762
01:33:22,512 --> 01:33:24,980
Retreat!

763
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:47,003
Come on, let's go!

764
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:06,022
This place is blowing up. Find shelter!

765
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,049
August 15, 1945

766
01:35:13,123 --> 01:35:15,091
Where are you going? Get back!

767
01:35:16,126 --> 01:35:18,094
l'm sorry, quick!

768
01:35:18,628 --> 01:35:20,095
Don't run around!

769
01:37:51,281 --> 01:37:55,240
Hold on, Madame, Hold on!

770
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:02,258
Sir, Mrs. Takamura is going into labor!

771
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:03,593
Can't she get in the car?

772
01:38:04,294 --> 01:38:07,263
The car is full of Dr. lshii's personal data.

773
01:38:31,321 --> 01:38:33,289
Sir, the train is leaving in 5 minutes.

774
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:37,293
Do you want a last look at the squadron?

775
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:46,302
All right!

776
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:32,348
Gentlemen! This is just a change in strategy,

777
01:39:33,383 --> 01:39:35,351
The Great Japanese Empire

778
01:39:36,386 --> 01:39:39,355
has still not been defeated,

779
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:42,358
our base has been destroyed,

780
01:39:42,892 --> 01:39:44,860
but our careers will continue.

781
01:39:45,395 --> 01:39:48,364
Now you’re all going back to Japan,

782
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:52,368
l trust you will safe guard the secrets of this base

783
01:39:53,403 --> 01:39:55,371
and always remember this

784
01:39:56,406 --> 01:39:59,375
no contact is allowed between squadron members

785
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:04,369
and under no circumstances will you reveal the
nature of work here.

786
01:40:05,415 --> 01:40:07,383
You are disbarred from taking up government posts.

787
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:13,378
Anyone who contravenes these conditions will be
severely punished.

788
01:41:36,506 --> 01:41:39,475
Madame! Madame!

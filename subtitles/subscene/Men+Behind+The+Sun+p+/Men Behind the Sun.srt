1
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:42,075
Original site and ruins of Manchu 731

2
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:47,922
Ping Fang District, Harbin, China

3
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,761
Prior to the Second World War

4
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,934
the Japanese Militarists
had occupied N.E.China

5
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,311
<i>&</i> established the puppet state Manchoukou

6
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,118
In order to expand their
Greater East Asia Empire

7
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,934
the Japanese did a lot
of preparatory 'work.

8
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,588
Some of the least knomm 'work

9
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,125
were the experiments on bacterial weapons.

10
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,628
By the Manchu 731 Squadron

11
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,134
This Squadron 731 had many Sub-Sections

12
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:36,129
They 'were: Helier,

13
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,139
Sun Wu,

14
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,646
Lion Kuu,

15
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,148
Mu Dan Jiang,

16
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,651
and An Da Rural Experimental Station.

17
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,655
The main offices of 731

18
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,485
were situated in a residential
district of Harbin

19
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,593
They covered a large area of land

20
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,164
The headquarters 'were highly classified,

21
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,169
and surrounded by a high
tension electric fence.

22
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,672
Inside there were extensive facilities,

23
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,174
there was an animal farm,

24
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,677
a crematorium,

25
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,179
a pathology laboratory, a jail,

26
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,682
an electricity generating plant,

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,181
the commanders quarters,

28
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,746
<i>&</i> other sections for various
experimental projects.

29
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,188
By February 1945

30
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,151
the Japanese forces were suffering
losses on the battle front

31
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,694
to win the war by biological warfare

32
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,377
the Military Headquarters reinstated a Lt.
General to be the Squadron commander.

33
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,200
Yet this person had previously been relieved
off this post because of corruption.

34
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,193
This man, the inventor of
the Ishit Water Purifier

35
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,207
a military medical doctor, Lt. Ishii Shiro.

36
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,210
A group of young soldiers were sent to Harbin
to provide new blood for this squadron.

37
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,714
The banks of Song Hua River,

38
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,225
When will they come to pick us up?

39
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,309
Captain Takehara's gone to Bai Hua Lian

40
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,225
to find our new sergeant.

41
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,231
He's been gone for almost an hour.

42
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,726
Why aren't we allowed
to go to Bai Hua Lian?

43
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,236
This place is freezing cold

44
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,739
Yes, it's similar to Chiba Prefecture

45
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,241
I think it's much colder here

46
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,744
Ishikawa, don't you think so?

47
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,246
It makes no difference,

48
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,749
we aren't going home anyway.

49
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,249
<i>Look!</i>

50
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,754
Ishikawa already misses home after leaving
Mum for a few days.

51
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,256
He is just a Momma's boy,

52
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,259
he even broke down <i>&</i> cried when his
mum saw him off.

53
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,262
But you cried too!

54
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,765
Nu. I didn't!

55
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,247
But my mum <i>&</i> sister did.

56
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,767
Yes my mum cried too.

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,769
I didn't cry.

58
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,803
But I felt really bad.

59
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,273
My father was killed fighting in China.

60
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,440
So was mine!

61
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,268
So were my father and my elder brother,

62
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,776
they died fighting in China.

63
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,844
This kind of food is even hard
to get back home in our Japan.

64
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,846
Did you know that?

65
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,350
Drag him out!

66
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:12,346
Yeah! Stuff it in!

67
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,453
The original building housing

68
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,449
the Manchu 731 Squadron.

69
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,485
General,

70
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,488
Doctor Ishii's arrived at the H.Q.,

71
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,485
would you...

72
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,487
Yeah, I'm coming.

73
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,501
Ishikawa,

74
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,504
Catch the ball!

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,507
Dr. Ishii!

76
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,502
General Kikuchi.

77
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,520
You still look like the same great Ishii.

78
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,523
Squadron 731's Ishii.

79
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:08,546
Welcome back, Ishii!

80
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,541
Lt. General Ishii's returned to the corps!

81
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,552
Idiots! Listen!

82
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,555
I'm the new Section Head, Captain Kawasaki.

83
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,058
From now on you are in the Kwangtung Army,

84
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,561
members of the 731 Squadron Youth Corps!

85
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,564
If you get the chance to go to Harbin,

86
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,567
weather you leave or your day off,

87
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,876
you must change into civilian
clothes before leaving,

88
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,565
<i>&</i> when you return,

89
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,568
put your uniforms back on at Bai Hua Lian.

90
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,573
If you run into any other Japanese

91
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,575
or if you are stopped by a patrol,

92
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,575
you will not reveal your
secondment to this squadron.

93
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,584
Is that clear?

94
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,585
Yes, Sir!

95
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:15,588
Crematorium

96
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,625
It's almost three years since 1942

97
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,628
A toast to you and your brothers reunion.

98
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,632
Cheers!

99
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,636
Thank you, Sir.

100
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,642
Now, Gentleman,

101
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,639
I've not been here for
the last couple of years

102
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,645
but I know all about what
has been going on here.

103
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,652
I've looked into the
research dune by Mr. Kitanu

104
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,155
and I think it has been handled wrongly.

105
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,657
What we need must now

106
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,650
is to increase the production <i>&</i> the number
of bacteria.

107
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,164
We must use bacterial weapons in the war

108
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,665
to speed our victory.

109
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,668
A toast to victory!

110
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,665
To the empire!

111
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,666
To victory

112
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,180
And to Mr. Ishii for leading 731!

113
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,170
Cheers!, Cheers!

114
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,673
Sir!

115
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,177
Lt. General sir.

116
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,671
Lt. Onue Shunji reporting for duty from the
Kwangtung Army Commanders office.

117
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,183
Lt. General?

118
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,687
I should have been a full general!

119
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,188
I don't understand

120
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:49,692
Why those idiots at the Central Planning Office decline
that army doctors can go no higher than Lt. General.

121
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,194
It's ridiculous!

122
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,690
Lt. Onue!

123
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,695
I've just made a criticism against the
Central Planning Office

124
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,705
would you inform on me?

125
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,213
Stop!

126
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,383
Have you no respect for your seniors?

127
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,735
Forget it, lets go back!

128
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,898
We'll be in trouble if we are discovered.

129
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,238
Nu!

130
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,741
My brother gave me that
ball when I left Japan.

131
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,819
Get up! Out of your beds!

132
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,992
Where's Hushino and Ishikawa?

133
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,159
I don't know.

134
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,327
I don't either.

135
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,830
<i>Ono... where's he gone m'?</i>

136
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,829
I don't know!

137
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,863
Animal Breeding Unit

138
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,003
Hushino!

139
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,006
Don't run!

140
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,014
Hushino!

141
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,025
Stop running! Hushino...

142
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,051
That 'was totally undisciplined

143
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,054
that must never be repeated.

144
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,378
The training of the Youth
Corps is important.

145
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,559
It's not only because we are short of staff

146
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,062
it's also because what we require here

147
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,565
are people of the highest integrity.

148
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,807
Headquarters only recognizes the importance

149
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,069
of bacterial weapons in this war.

150
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,072
The fail to realize that
biological & chemical 'weapons

151
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,075
will greatly affect the future of Japan.

152
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,578
They will play a very important role.

153
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,140
So 'we must 'work doubly
hard on these experiments.

154
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,077
Yes, sir!

155
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,077
That 'was really unexpected.

156
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,087
We have to step up security and discipline.

157
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,090
It's late. I'd better
leave you two to talk!

158
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,598
Brother, please sit down!

159
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,108
Shiro,

160
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,113
what's happening back in Chiba Prefecture?

161
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,619
There's shortage of everything

162
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,122
but people are managing

163
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,625
People have suffered a lot
these past few years.

164
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,127
We can only do our best, brother

165
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,630
How are things here?

166
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,132
What about the men's morale?

167
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,126
Nut too bad,

168
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,132
things are all right.

169
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,305
Also we confirmed that the incident

170
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,132
which got you relieved

171
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,138
was due to an informer.

172
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,478
It was Lt. Colonel
Nakatome who reported you

173
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,647
He even ridiculed the effectiveness of your
water purifier.

174
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,151
Nakatome! Goddamn him!

175
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,169
Attention

176
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,163
Nakatome! Lt. Colonel Nakatome
present!

177
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,204
Lt. General Ishii wants you!

178
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,298
Kawasaki, any absentees?

179
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,302
Unfortunately

180
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,779
we had an accident just now.

181
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,312
I want you to treat those
kids from Chiba gently.

182
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,474
They are important to us

183
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,318
Thank you!

184
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,325
Damn you!

185
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,329
Hashino brought about his own death

186
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,332
and you are acting like a
bunch of school girls.

187
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,335
What kind of soldiers are you?

188
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,838
How can you gain honor for Chiba like this?

189
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,340
Soldiers shouldn't act like this!

190
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,842
Quick, close ranks!

191
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,348
Everybody down, prune position, crawl!

192
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,918
Assholes, quick!

193
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,433
Stand up!

194
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,436
Attention!

195
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,735
I heard that the fighting is very heavy
on the southern front,

196
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,978
our 'whole army could
possibly be wiped out!

197
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,483
It sounds serious.

198
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,485
We have to push our people

199
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,479
to speed up the experiments on the marut

200
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,481
These biological 'weapons

201
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,686
are the only way to turn
the war in our favor.

202
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,485
What did they say?

203
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,662
It sounded like little Japan is finished!

204
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,497
Lets go!

205
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,505
Wait!

206
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,511
Sir, please!

207
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,515
Give me back my baby!

208
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,526
My baby, my baby... please
give her back to me!

209
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,557
Sir, didn't General Ishii tell us that

210
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
we are supposed to
conservatively use the "marut"?

211
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,863
This one can be stuffed and mounted, it
“won't be 'wasted.

212
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,559
February 29, 1945

213
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,903
Victim: Zhao Qing, Han Chinese, 3 month old

214
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,096
Oh water!

215
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,601
Water's coming out!

216
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,618
It's really tough.

217
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,121
Thank god the money is Al right.

218
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,122
Also I can study.

219
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,625
Do you send money home?

220
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,126
No.

221
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,629
Come on, you spend it all every month!

222
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,132
No, mum said I must have
it for the war efforts.

223
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,634
This is a nice place!

224
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,637
It's similar to Chiba Prefecture.

225
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,639
Chiba is not that cold

226
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,142
this is like a hospital.

227
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,644
I say it's not

228
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,147
We only have dead bodies here

229
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,649
hospitals should have patients

230
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,651
this is more like a medical school

231
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,154
Anyway this is fine by me

232
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,155
I eat well and I can make money

233
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,658
The only thing is this fat Captain

234
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,161
Look, isn't that Hoshinu's ball?

235
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,664
Get it back!

236
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,168
Come on, lets get it back!

237
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,672
Let's get it back!

238
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,684
Stop!

239
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,695
There's nowhere to run!

240
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,693
Give the ball back to us!

241
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,706
This is not Hoshinu's ball!

242
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,710
Who are you? What are you doing here?

243
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,217
He is a mute!

244
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,266
Hold on a minute!

245
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,771
What is wrung with him?

246
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,274
He's been here for over a month,

247
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,776
but he's still not adjusted
to this place yet.

248
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,770
He vomits every time he goes to 'work.

249
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:56,771
When it happens

250
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,781
we have to let him take a break

251
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,443
it will take him a while to get used to it!

252
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,787
That's O.K., he'll soon get used to it!

253
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,789
His job is important!

254
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,872
We rely on the colors to determine
the results of the experiments

255
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,309
'we can't depend totally on
black and 'white pictures.

256
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,797
Look after him, see that he 'works 'well!

257
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,798
Sir!

258
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,806
Lt. Col. Nakatome Jiro

259
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,802
I've been transferred to the southern front
by order of the Kwangtung Army Commander

260
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,137
I'd like to say goodbye sir.

261
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,814
Congratulations,

262
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,817
the situation in the south is serious,

263
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,987
a patriotic soldier like you

264
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,156
should be able to achieve a lot here

265
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,492
especially as you have a close
relationship with the planning office

266
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,287
you can do a lot for the war effort!

267
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,828
Yes, Sir!

268
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,839
This must be your arrangement.

269
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,848
This marut

270
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,052
has been injected with plague three times.

271
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,845
But no symptoms have appeared.

272
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,847
So now lets conduct live dissection on him,
<i>&</i> see what's so special about him.

273
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:13,848
<i>Good!</i>

274
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,859
The correct data,

275
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,855
relies on continuous tests
on experimental subjects

276
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,856
so these maruts,

277
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,200
not only have to be alive,

278
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,869
but they also have to be fit and healthy.

279
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,863
Experiments on such live subjects

280
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,865
is a rare opportunity.

281
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,884
What is this?

282
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,879
It's a man!

283
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:52,937
What is this?

284
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,396
He's a Chinese man.

285
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,576
What is this?

286
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,911
He is a bad Chinese man!

287
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,918
This is a marut.

288
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,254
It is a lug for the fire or making coffins,

289
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,590
it is material for experiment.

290
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:21,923
It is called a "Marut"

291
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,918
What is this?

292
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:25,927
This is a marut.

293
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,930
What is this?

294
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,931
A Marut!

295
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:32,934
What is this?

296
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,936
A Marut!

297
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,943
What is this?

298
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,010
A Marut!

299
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,084
Beat him!

300
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,968
We must try to get evidence

301
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,471
<i>&</i> get it out of here

302
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,993
so the outside world knows
what's going on in here.

303
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,599
It's the only thing we can do!

304
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,993
Look, why go through all that trouble?

305
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,196
Say we have no chance of getting out here!

306
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,999
You chicken! You have no back-bone!

307
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,335
And you... learn to be
a man.Don't copy him.

308
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,004
You don't act like a Chinese!

309
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,012
Beyond Practice Ground

310
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,021
Order arms!

311
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,531
At ease!

312
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,036
The lessons on experiments
will start tomorrow,

313
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,539
so 'work hard men, & learn 'well,

314
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,039
is that clear?

315
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,037
Yes, sir!

316
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,054
Sir, please!

317
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,048
Let her carry it away

318
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,058
its her baby!

319
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,064
Let's go!

320
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,072
Please, Sir!

321
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,082
Bacterial Extermination Room

322
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,598
Quickly change your clothes!

323
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,099
Hurry up!

324
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,612
Let's go!

325
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,121
March 9, 1945

326
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,117
Outdoor Frostbite Experimental Station

327
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,120
Victim: Zhao Hui Xiu, Han
Chinese, 24 years old

328
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,264
Bacteria Breeding Room

329
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,267
<i>Look, this</i> is <i>the "gene" production room.</i>

330
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,535
This is the high temperature bacteria
exterminating room.

331
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,302
Look this way please,

332
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,305
this is the bacteria transplants,

333
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,148
you must study hard and learn all this as
soon as possible.

334
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,141
Yes, Sir!

335
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,311
Frostbite Experimental Room

336
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,324
This is the cold treatment station

337
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,330
At -35°C for 10 hours Cold Treatment

338
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,833
Water temperature 15°C.

339
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,371
March 9, 1945

340
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,707
Victim: Jin Yuan Long,
Manchurian, 31 years old

341
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,385
What you are looking at now,

342
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,721
is a quick freezing station, it is -196°C.

343
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,415
Finish chewing your apple,

344
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,409
<i>&</i> spit it out like I do.

345
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,420
Don't swallow it.

346
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,756
This way you can

347
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,433
collect the germs from the mouth.

348
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,417
Yes, Sir!

349
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,433
Go back and tell your captain,

350
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,770
that you'll be my guests this Sunday,

351
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,434
we'll have drinks together.

352
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,939
Yes Sir!

353
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,944
And you'll come too, O.K.?

354
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,447
O.K.

355
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,451
Thank you!

356
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,463
This is a question of humanity.

357
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,797
Nu!

358
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,468
This concerns the rise or fall of the
Great Japanese Empire.

359
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,804
Listen Ishikawa, they are human beings too,

360
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,140
they have parents just like you!

361
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,475
What are you talking about?

362
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,471
Give me better justification than that!

363
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:37,812
Today is Sunday

364
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,982
lets not talk about business,

365
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,149
come on lets eat up.

366
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,485
This fruit is specially
brought over from Japan.

367
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,819
Help yourselves.

368
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,489
Let me, you must look after your health.

369
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,497
Take Mrs. Takamura for example,

370
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,893
what's the difference between
the children she bore

371
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,169
<i>&</i> the maruts?

372
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,504
What are you talking about?

373
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,840
That's not right!

374
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,176
You can not compare the
maruts to the Japanese,

375
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,511
you &I speak a different language.

376
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,505
Please don't say anymore

377
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,516
I'm sorry, please excuse me.

378
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,525
Ishikawa, wait!

379
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,616
Ishikawa, Ishikawa!

380
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,624
Kawasaki pushed him... from upstairs!

381
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,960
He's badly hurt,

382
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,296
lets think of a way to
teach Kawasaki a lesson.

383
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,631
I hope you'll 'work 'well together.

384
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,134
To be a member of the 731 Youth Corps

385
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,634
we should...

386
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,971
obey the regulations.

387
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,307
I think you'd better forget about it.

388
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,640
Don't pretend now,

389
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,635
you have no guts.

390
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,652
Coward. Stop pretending!

391
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,280
April 11, 1945

392
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,724
Those goddamned Japs...

393
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,060
What the hell are they up to?

394
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,394
HEY Specs!

395
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,730
What do you think the Japs will do to us?

396
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,748
What did they inject into us this morning?

397
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,084
I have no reaction at all!

398
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,753
I have no idea what it was.

399
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,758
Why didn't those people get it too?

400
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,782
Be careful of contamination!

401
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,258
The last accident cost
Sakagami <i>&</i> Ohtani their lives,

402
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,787
so be careful everyone.

403
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,089
Sir, according to the
previous test results,

404
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,144
it would be a rather difficult job
to produce a Black Death Virus

405
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,808
that is 60 times stronger.

406
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,820
Now this is the 7th experiment,

407
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,323
here is the record for the last few tests!

408
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,826
Sir, I've heard the Germans are using the
Jews to perform similar kinds of tests

409
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,162
and they've achieved good results,

410
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,498
so can't

411
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,876
Dr. Ishii did 2 years research on
this in Europe before the war.

412
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,192
According to him, the German researches
into that area are fare behind ours.

413
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,510
Compared to this, their equipment
<i>&</i> facilities are fare behind ours

414
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:47,838
What they achieved so far may not be of
any use for us.

415
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,852
Don't be discouraged,
keep up the good work,

416
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,189
report to me at once when the experiments
are completed.

417
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,640
Yes sir, I heard that Lt. Colonel Nakatome died
in action on the southern front, is that right?

418
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,871
Dr. Ishii may have been too...

419
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,878
We'd better keep out of that,

420
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,381
You'd better concentrate
on your own career.

421
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,884
The Empire Medical Department is 'waiting
for your return.

422
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,388
The medical future of Japan
relies on you people.

423
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,898
Early summer 1945

424
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,901
Japanese were retreating
from the Pacific Front

425
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,897
They also suffered many losses in China.

426
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,897
The moral of the Japanese
troops 'was very bad.

427
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:50,905
All of Japan had been mobilized,

428
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,905
there were still great
shortages of everything.

429
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,912
A large deficit of
manpower for the Japanese

430
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,922
military resulted in
more adolescents joining

431
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,921
the forces. The cloud
of defeat loomed larger

432
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,921
In other 'words, the
success or failure of 731

433
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,924
decides the survival of the Empire.

434
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,267
So today...

435
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,934
we should have no more illusions about the
Kwangtung Army,

436
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,940
the Kwangtung Army relies
on our bacterial war,

437
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,936
there is no other way of winning it.

438
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,619
I've always thought that biological weapons
are more effective than bombers and guns

439
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,946
Right now we must regroup our forces,

440
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,945
<i>&</i> mobilize them.

441
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,948
I entreat you to 'work doubly hard

442
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,038
We must get ourselves well prepared
for the coming bacterial war.

443
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,962
Gentleman, do you have any questions?

444
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,959
Please, go ahead!

445
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,973
We have already successfully produced

446
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,309
a large quantity of virus which is 60 times
stronger than the Black Death Virus.

447
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,978
The amount of culture 'we have,

448
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,981
according to our calculations,

449
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,977
has enough power to wipe out the
'whole mankind.

450
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,987
At the same time

451
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,657
we have increased the number

452
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,992
of bacteria carrying rats to three million,

453
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,662
&jumping ﬂeas to 300 kilos.

454
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,998
The number is estimated at 10 billion,

455
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,001
if this 10 billion bacteria carrying ﬂeas

456
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,277
were all released, then
it's not hard to imagine

457
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,007
the situation on the war front would change
drastically,

458
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,010
we would gain the final victory!

459
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,008
Because of the bacterial weapons

460
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,682
the fate of the Great Japanese Empire

461
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,017
lies in our hands.

462
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,011
Still after numerous experiments

463
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,355
the metal shell casings
holding the bacteria

464
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,125
get very hot during firing.

465
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,357
And a majority of the infected ﬂeas inside
get killed

466
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,527
so these bacterial bombs have failed
to produce the expected results.

467
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,329
Weapons Production Department...

468
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,031
Anything else?

469
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,096
Sir, there's been a strung
reaction to the incident

470
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,372
when Kawasaki assaulted
the Youth Corps member

471
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,041
and it's getting to be quite serious.

472
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,041
There's a lot of tension &
unrest amongst the Corps.

473
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,047
Transfer Kawasaki from the Youth Corps.

474
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,041
Onue you'll replace him.

475
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,050
Yes, Sir!

476
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,054
Sukizan Geisha House

477
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,059
Sorry to disturb you,

478
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:36,077
General, it seems your
sword's not rusted yet!

479
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,084
Get out both of you!

480
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,087
Yes, Sir!

481
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,493
Whoever... was hit or touched by the
chess pieces, raise your hands.

482
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,517
Gentlemen.

483
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,521
This is... my new invention.

484
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,524
This... is called Low
Temperature Pottery...

485
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,517
Bacterial Bomb!

486
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,563
The Great Japan will not be defeated!

487
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,573
Careful! Don't break the pottery bomb!

488
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,606
May 22, 1945

489
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,608
An Da Rural Experimental Station

490
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,604
Victims: Names unknown,
29 males and females

491
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,618
Hurry up Ishikawa!

492
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,651
May 29, 1945

493
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,644
Decompression Laboratory

494
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,648
Victim: Qu Hua, Han Chinese, 34 years old

495
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,765
not a female "maruta"

496
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,761
Kawasaki, I want you to bring me a healthy
young man.

497
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,769
What's the use of a healthy young man?

498
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,766
It's of no use for you,

499
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,768
but it's of great use for us.

500
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:23,944
Please help us get one!

501
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,445
Kawasaki,

502
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,782
if you can help us find
a healthy young man,

503
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,117
then I'll buy you a drink.

504
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,794
Right, we'll all buy you a drink.

505
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,788
Kawasaki's good at that.

506
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,124
I'm sorry, I can't help you with that.

507
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,334
Kawasaki's only good at finding girls!

508
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,296
That's nonsense!

509
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,801
Come on Kawasaki!

510
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,136
Do something for us.

511
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,800
We'll reward you. Please!

512
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,808
O.K., I'll try.

513
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,811
June 12, 1945

514
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,146
Poison Gas Laboratory

515
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,814
Victim: Natasha Ivanova,
White Russia, 35 years old

516
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,826
You can do whatever you want with me!

517
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,161
Let my daughter go, please!

518
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,831
Please, I beg you, let her go!

519
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,839
Please!

520
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,961
You've been here a while,
are you used to it?

521
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,962
Yes, sir, I am!

522
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,968
Do you still see that Chinese mute?

523
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,303
Nut very often, sir!

524
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,639
Do you think you can find him for me?

525
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:39,973
What for, sir?

526
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,004
Sir, I've brought you the mute.

527
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,007
Thank you, 'well done.

528
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,011
Don't be afraid!

529
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,028
Let him in.

530
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:41,024
Come here, come inside.

531
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,040
You wait here,

532
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,375
When the surgery is finished,

533
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,711
you can take him away.

534
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,047
Surgery? What surgery?

535
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,040
No questions!

536
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,218
Keep your nose out of these things.

537
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,077
Come here!

538
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,080
<i>Go on!</i>

539
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,096
Come here!

540
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,282
Where are you going?

541
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,280
Surgery is finished! Take him away!
Quickly!

542
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,451
Yes sir!

543
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,292
Are you satisfied now?

544
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,287
Each of you got what you wanted...
the heart...

545
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,292
the liver,

546
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,293
and the brain.

547
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,296
These organs from a living
healthy young man in puberty,

548
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,299
are difficult to come by!

549
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,306
We should thank Kawasaki.

550
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,312
Don't mention it!

551
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,814
We'll invite you to dinner this evening.

552
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,816
Thank you! Thank you!

553
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,320
What's wrung with you?
Quickly push the cart away!

554
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,319
Yes, sir!

555
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,825
July 2, 1945

556
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,328
Victim: A mute, name unknown, Han Chinese

557
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,332
Tunnel connecting Pathology
Lab to Crematorium

558
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:51,405
Makimura, draw the curtains.

559
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,412
That fat ass is a barbarian.

560
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,415
Come here, that mute was not a marut

561
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,412
That animal has gone too far!

562
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,419
Yeah, I have always detested him.

563
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,592
Let's find a way to fix him!

564
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,927
What do you think?

565
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:20,423
I want to kill him. If there's a
problem, I take responsibility!

566
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,438
No, we are all in this together!

567
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,454
Hurry up!

568
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,459
Ready for disinfection?

569
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,984
What are you doing here? Get back!

570
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,642
A smart rat can beat a cat.

571
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,644
Fleas <i>&</i> germs can defeat
bombers and guns too!

572
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,647
This is... my theory behind 731 Squadron.

573
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,150
It's also my philosophy.

574
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,653
For Victory,

575
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,155
we shall groom the strongest
and nurture them,

576
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,158
the same applies for the Youth Corps.

577
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,159
Understand?

578
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,668
Stone, stone!

579
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,678
Stone, wait!

580
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,683
You must get out of here alive!

581
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,185
No matter what happens,

582
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,688
we must get the evidence out!

583
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:36,689
Stone, quick!

584
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,691
Release him!

585
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,693
Get in the hole you bastard!

586
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,029
Stone “won't follow a coward like you...

587
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,019
Stone “won't go into
anything blindly with you

588
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,691
The door is open!

589
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,708
Stone!

590
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,716
Fire!

591
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,219
Charge, charge!

592
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,723
Stone, watch where you are going!

593
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:10,890
Fire!

594
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,717
Get down quick!

595
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,750
Idiots!

596
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,253
So many maruts are dead,

597
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,752
this is a serious matter.

598
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,754
Do you realize your job

599
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,927
is to keep them in good shape,

600
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,753
so they can live longer

601
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,755
But you neglected your duties,

602
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,757
with very serious consequences.

603
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:53,955
Your error is intolerable

604
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,760
& unforgivable!

605
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,764
Maruts are precious experimental material.

606
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:02,108
They mean more to us than ever..

607
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,774
You have no right to kill them.

608
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,783
<i>The Russo-Japanese war is coming,</i>

609
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,118
but many of our experiments

610
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,784
have not been completed yet.

611
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,290
The 731 Squadron is our nation's hope,

612
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:20,794
we hold the power to turn the war
in our favour and save Japan.

613
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,797
Get up now!

614
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,299
I hope you “won't forget,

615
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,862
that I was the one who
brought you here from Chiba.

616
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,808
Takamura at An Da Rural Station

617
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,810
is preparing for the final
pottery shell tests.

618
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,815
Have the Maruts gone yet?

619
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,819
They left early this morning, sir!

620
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,842
Specs said,

621
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,344
that what you did was stupid.

622
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,848
We can't get out of here anyway.

623
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,850
The more 'we resist, the
faster 'we get killed.

624
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,855
He said the only thing
we can do is to try <i>&</i>

625
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,190
get the evidence out.

626
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,856
So the 'world will know
about this hell hole.

627
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,855
Dr. Ishii, we're running out of time,

628
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,198
The situation at the front is very bad.

629
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,869
Looks like this is the final straw for us.

630
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:37,369
The trip to Feng Tiang

631
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,893
is very important, don't
'worry about things here.

632
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,882
Thank you, I rely on you.

633
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:57,890
Report, sir!

634
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,393
Inform the aircorps to take off now!

635
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,896
Preparations are complete
at the shell test site.

636
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,398
Come in... we haven't contacted them yet.

637
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:06,899
Right...

638
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,402
Let's go to the upper.

639
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,905
Fire the signal!

640
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,909
Let's move!

641
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,922
We need the Maruts urgently.

642
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,428
Are they on their way or not!

643
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:36,929
Reporting, Sir!

644
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,936
Excuse me sir, urgent telegram.

645
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,939
You may go.

646
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,953
August 9th, Nagasaki was bombed.

647
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,696
The Russians have officially declared 'war.

648
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,958
Manchuria 731 Sqdn. retreat if necessary.

649
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,960
Go to Feng ﬂan and get the commander here!

650
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,964
Stop the delivery of Maruts.

651
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,961
Hello!

652
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,977
Hello Airport!

653
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,985
Sir, the Maruts have escaped.

654
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:40,993
Go after them, don't let them run away!

655
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,496
Get in the car quick! After them!

656
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:06,007
Run, split out! Quick!

657
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:30,043
Hurry up! We must get the evidence out!

658
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,046
Run, quick!

659
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,138
Stone, go that 'way, quick!!

660
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,145
Quickly, run!

661
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,217
August 8, 1945

662
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,553
Proclaim Bacterial Bomb Experiment

663
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,232
Cover him!

664
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,263
Put him down here.

665
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,297
Sorry to disturb you!

666
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,303
Urgent telegram from Headquarters, sir!

667
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:58,311
Nagasaki was bombed.

668
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,309
The Russians have officially declared 'war.

669
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,483
The Kwangtung Army H.Q. ordered all troops
to retreat if necessary.

670
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,651
Are you coming back, sir?

671
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,326
All troops to retreat?

672
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,663
What do we do, sir?

673
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,618
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombed
by the Americans.

674
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,692
The cities have been completely destroyed.

675
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,028
Now the Russians have declared 'war to us.

676
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,365
Our fate has been sealed.

677
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,360
We've received orders to retreat.

678
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,703
But I personally think,

679
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:00,369
that the 'work of the 731 Sqdn.

680
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,708
Involves top security information.

681
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:06,379
So I'm now requesting the following:

682
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,383
1) Exterminate all remaining Maruts

683
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,378
& destroy this 'whole facility.

684
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,381
The engineers will be in charge of that the
place must be ﬂattened, I 'want no traces left.

685
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,724
2) Collect all data and documents

686
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,394
destroy them at once.

687
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,729
3) The Youth Corps is
to retreat to Tung Hwa,

688
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:27,400
4) All units will commit suicide.

689
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:31,404
5) Their families and departments

690
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:35,408
will also commit suicide.

691
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,412
In other 'words...

692
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:45,407
no evidence must be left behind!

693
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,422
Dr. Ishii,

694
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,445
Our squadron has a lot of
highly qualified people,

695
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,760
isn't it a waste do order them to die?

696
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,930
We shouldn't allow such
meaningless sacrifices.

697
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,432
I realize that too Gen. Kikuchi,

698
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,768
but we have to guard the
secret of this place.

699
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,937
Dr. Ishii, if...

700
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,431
you commit suicide, then I'll join you.

701
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:14,447
These soldiers & their
families have followed you

702
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,442
from Japan to Manchuria.

703
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:19,785
You should at least,

704
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,455
get them back home.

705
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,458
Isn't that reasonable?

706
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,793
As the head of 731 you're
responsible for them.

707
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,724
You should be protecting them,
not ordering them to die.

708
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:32,458
I hope you face up your responsibilities.

709
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,458
Gen. Kikuchi is right

710
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,470
We should return to our homeland,

711
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,470
and we should take all data with us.

712
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,983
That might be possible,

713
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,488
but we must still prepare for the
possibility of being captured.

714
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:57,481
No matter what,

715
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:59,892
'we can't allow these
secrets to be made knomm.

716
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:01,493
How about this?

717
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:03,736
We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide,

718
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:05,998
if anyone's captured, then they

719
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,501
commit suicide.

720
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:12,504
Well...

721
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,506
that's what we'll do.

722
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:17,009
I will personal be in
charge of the retreat,

723
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:19,011
<i>&</i> arrange the transport.

724
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,514
I'm very happy you made this decision,

725
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,518
I'm sure everybody is grateful to you.

726
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,544
What are you doing?

727
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,548
These are our children's clothes!

728
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,549
The data is important!

729
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,562
Please take this with you, Madame!

730
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,564
You must take it if you are captured.

731
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,568
Mr. Takamura prepared them.

732
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,575
Where are you going at his time?

733
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:25,077
I'm going to the office to get more data!

734
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,913
The 'war is over and 'we are going home!

735
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:30,583
Shut up! What do you know!

736
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,586
I don't care about anything else

737
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:37,590
all I know is that we are going home!

738
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,594
You are a “roman, you know nothing!

739
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:43,595
Yes I may know nothing,

740
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,599
and I certainly don't
know how to make poison!

741
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,602
How dare you to speak to me like that!

742
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,606
Takamura! Takamura!

743
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,614
This is important data,

744
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:04,638
We can not destroy it!

745
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,619
If anyone dares to burn anymore...

746
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:10,611
Takamura, I just want to go home!
Nothing else is important!

747
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:16,629
Thats all I want, Takamura!

748
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:26,639
Burn it! Burn it all!

749
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:30,643
Takamura! This is an order, burn it all!

750
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,646
I don't want a single piece left.

751
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,651
You can't destroy the data!

752
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,986
This is the 'whole reason
for our being here!

753
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:43,652
It represents years of hard 'work!

754
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,994
<i>&</i> Japan will need it one day!

755
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,664
If you want to destroy it kill me first!

756
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,701
We're releasing the poison gas!
Retreat! Hurry up!

757
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,743
Hasegawa, Miki, come quick!

758
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,746
Miki, go up!

759
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,784
It's platinum, it's 'worth a lot of money.

760
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:27,820
This place is blowing up! Find shelter!

761
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:21,874
Quick, retreat!

762
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:24,876
Retreat!

763
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:46,899
Come on, let's go!

764
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,918
This place is blowing up. Find shelter!

765
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:32,945
August 15, 1945

766
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:14,987
Where are you going? Get back!

767
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,990
I'm sorry, quick!

768
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:19,991
Don't run around!

769
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:55,136
Hold on, Madame, Hold on!

770
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:02,154
Sir, Mrs Takamura is going into labor!

771
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,509
Can't she get in the car'

772
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:07,159
The car is full of
Dr. Ishii's personal data.

773
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:33,185
Sir, the train is leaving in 5 minutes.

774
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,189
Do you want a last look at the squadron?

775
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:46,198
Al right!

776
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:32,244
Gentlemen! This is just
a change in strategy,

777
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:35,247
The Great Japanese Empire

778
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:39,251
has still not been defeated,

779
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,254
our base has been destroyed,

780
01:39:42,776 --> 01:39:44,756
but our careers will continue.

781
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,260
Now you're all going back to Japan,

782
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:52,264
I trust you will safe guard
the secrets of this base

783
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,267
and always remember this

784
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:59,271
no contact is allowed
between squadron members

785
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:04,265
and under no circumstances will you
reveal the nature of 'work here.

786
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:07,299
You are disbarred from
taking up government posts.

787
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:13,274
Anyone who contravenes these
conditions will be severely punished.

788
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:39,371
Madame! Madame!

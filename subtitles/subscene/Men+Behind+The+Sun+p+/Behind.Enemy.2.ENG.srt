Imaging data from a KH-12 over North Korea...

showing what we can now
say with certainty...

47
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,497
is a three-stage, Topol-class
intercontinental ballistic missile...

at the Yongjiri missile center.

49

as the crane was loading the missile...

we never would have seen it.

The longest-range missile
North Korea had prior to this...

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,750
would have run out of fuel
somewhere over Alaska.

We've always assumed North Korea would
never deploy a long-range missile like this...

63

and inevitable military response.

There is just no viable
diplomatic option.

115

And if they do
test that missile...

116
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,219
it devastates our footing

117
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,260
Yeah.

118
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,029

Mr. President,
if we attack that missile site...

131
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,766
the D.P.R.K. Will most surely
counterattack at Seoul...

132
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:06,468
using their 11,000 artillery tubes.

133
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,203
That's possible.

134
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,939
Or a more proportional response
would be Scud missile attack...

135
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,572
against the research center
at Taejon.

136
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,548

with a strike at the D.M.Z. -

137

Or the Pyongyang nuclear facility.

138
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,588
And the North Koreans respond
with their artillery.

139
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,592
We bomb them-
They bomb their neighbors.

140
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,561

sir, should the North attempt that-

141

Operation Swift Rage.

142
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,260
We can neutralize 90%
of North Korea's response capabilities...

143
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,961
in the first 24 hours of hostilities.

144
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,630
And we'd be at war.

145
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,436

for at least six hours now.

to commercial airliners.

154
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,365
A platoon from SEALs Team 1 could
board a commercial airlines flight in Seoul...

00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,237
deploy over North Korea-

156
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:15,607
You don't think the North Koreans
would pick up a commercial airliner...

157
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,514
leaving from a U.S. Military base
in South Korea?

158
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:18,708
Leaving from a U.S. Military base
in South Korea?

159
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,783
Sir, we would just dress
the SEALs up...

160
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,875
walk 'em right through

161
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:26,012
put 'em on a chartered
commercial airliner and take off...

162
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,488
mixed right in with civilian traffic.

163
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,492
Completely undetectable.

164
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,824
(Mackey)
We would deploy over North Korea...

165
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,591
glide the 60 miles
to the Yongjiri missile site...

166
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,497
and sabotage the missile
as it's being fueled.

167
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:41,503
Secondary explosions
should destroy the entire complex.

168
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:45,507
Whole thing will be perceived
as an industrial accident of some kind.

169
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,236
North Korea'd have
no grounds to retaliate.

170
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:51,508
And if it turned out to be a nuclear warhead,
what about the radiation?

171
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:54,982
The blast from the fuel explosions
would be massive, sir.

172
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,019
Even though it wouldn't be
an atomic blast...

173
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,418
it would probably create
its own mushroom cloud.

174
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:02,048
The heat from the blast would
incinerate any nuclear materials...

175
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:04,592
alleviating any radiation concerns.

176
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,889
Sir, I don't recommend this.

177
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:11,434
If they're detected, it's an act of war,
and we lose the element of surprise.

178
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,993
What's the window of opportunity
to explore a Special Ops plan?

179
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,903
I'd say 72 hours,
but I wouldn't-

180
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:22,172
- Seventy-two hours.
- Sir, a covert action?

181
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,978
L-We need to send a strong
proportional and visible response...

182
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,983
to the North Koreans-
to the whole world-

183
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,985
to put them on notice
that that dog don't hunt.

184
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,385
We will never allow them
to be an I.C.B.M. Power.

185
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,124
Commander Mackey,
could you be ready in 72 hours?

186
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,457
Yes, sir. I believe
we could be ready.

187
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,758
Admiral?

188
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:44,095
It's not much time to put
a mission together, sir, but-

189
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,634
I understand.

190
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:49,227
Gentlemen, keep up
with your preparations.

191
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,603
I'll give you a decision
within six hours.

192
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,938
Yes, sir. We'll give it
everything we've got.

193
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:56,239
(Weylon)
Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:59,975
"Give it everything we've got."
Tell me I didn't just say that.

195
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,574
- (Chuckling)
- What are you looking at?

196
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,712
- Get LieutenantJames in here.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:10,083
Mr. President...

198
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:15,597
- Kim Jong II is 5'2': He wears four-inch lifts.
- (Chuckles) Sexy.

199
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,157
He lives in a pleasure palace where he
indulges his penchant for Swedish prostitutes.

200
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:24,104
This missile is pompous grandstanding
by a very small man.

201
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:27,404
Sir, in 1996, the Korea Institute
for National Reunification...

202
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,139
applied a computer model that accurately
predicted Eastern Europe's collapse.

203
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:34,341
- Yeah?
- According to the model-

204
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,249
North Korea
should have collapsed in 1992.

205
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:40,517
I say we give this job to Special Ops
and make this all go away...

206
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:45,425
and let North Korea collapse
when it collapses.

207
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,428
Cam?

208
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,361
Yeah.

209
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,268
Okay.

210
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,304
Tell Mackey his mission is a "go."

211
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:59,501
But keep General Vance
and his Stealth bombers on standby...

212
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:02,169
should the SEALs fail.

213
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:22,060
- Lieutenant.
- Colonel. Thanks for the lift today, sir.

214
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,929
- Well, they gave us a nice plane for this one.
- I see that.

215
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:28,368
- We gonna get miles for this?
- No, but I did order you the kosher meal.

216
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:32,703
- L.T.C.
- (Man) Okay, guys,
grab a seat and stow your stuff.

217
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:36,040
Let me know when you and your guys
get settled in. We'll be on our way.

218
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,114
Appreciate the hell
outta that, sir.

219
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:41,547
- Hoo-ya, LieutenantJames.
- Hoo-ya, Shultiess.

220
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,415
- How you feelin' today, papa?
- I feel immortal.

221
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,421
- I'm "the Stoke."
- Stoke?

222
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:49,720
- Oh, it's just my new call sign.
- Wasn't aware you had an old one.

223
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:53,193
Well, my old one was for mortals,
and I am immortal.

224
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,424
- I'm the Stoke.
- Whatever.

225
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:01,129
Okay. Good evening, gentlemen...

226
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:04,138
and welcome to United States
Air Force Flight 738...

227
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,640
with nonstop service
to the skies over North Korea...

228
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:10,179
where we'll be jumping from an altitude
of approximately 33,000 feet.

229
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,546
- (Clamoring)
- Meideros in the hatch.
Barnes, Shultiess, Ballantine.

230
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,122
AK-47 s.

231
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,633
Not a scratch, guys.
The airline wants this plane back...

232
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,572
in the same condition
they gave it to us in.

233
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:41,667
- You got it, Daiwi.
- Daiwi? Why do you guys call him that?

234
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:44,872
I don't call him that, but I've known him
since, like, the second grade.

235
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,949
- Hey, hey! What did he just say?
- I'm sorry.

236
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,143
(Callaghan)
It's okay, kid.

237
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:52,881
Hey, you scared?
Don't lie to me.

238
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:56,390
Uh- I don't know.
Maybe- Maybe a little.

239
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:59,951
Damn straight you're scared.
Who wouldn't be?

240
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:05,228
Stick with me, kid.
I'm immortal.

242
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,030
Go. Go.

243
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:13,034
Yeah. A P.V.C. 77 SATCOM.

244
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,577
That's you, schoolboy.

245
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:18,977
- Give it to Ballantine.
- I got it.

246
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:22,017
(Man) Okay, gentleman,
time to give up the personal shit.

247
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:25,110
(Man #2)
Throw in thejewels. Let's go, boys.

248
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,679
(Chattering)

249
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,929
(Man)
Be careful with that. That's my wife.

250
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,089
(Callaghan)
I want these back.

251
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,099
(Man's Voice)
What are those, son?

252
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:45,737
I said, what are those, Ensign?

253
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:47,833
- Silver wings, Master Chief!
- Bullshit!

254
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,878
Army lead wings, son.

255
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,709
You get 'em inside CrackerJacks.

256
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:55,512
- Where'd you get 'em, son?
- Fort Benning, Master Chief.

257
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,745
Fort Benning, Georgia.

258
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:01,551
The army's version of 48 hours
of intensive training...

259
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,922
crammed into 21 days.

260
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:08,088
Making pussy-ass static-line jumps
out of an Army C-141...

261
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:11,759
and landing on firm ground.

262
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,632
My one-year-old, ScottJr.,
can do that.

263
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:16,967
- You see these?
- Yes, Master Chief.

264
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:21,009
(Screams)
Navy gold wings, son.

265
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,910
Get those out of my sight. I will teach you
to drop like a Navy SEAL-

266
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:26,948
from heights where there's
no air to breathe...

267
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,984
into water so cold
you'll wish you was dead.

268
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,713
You will drop at night
with N.V.G.'s...

269
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,914
fall five minutes
before you pull your cord.

270
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:36,685
And if you manage
to stay alive through all that...

271
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:39,353
we'll see about getting you
a pair of these.

272
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,521
Is that clear?

273
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:45,067
(All)
Hoo-ya, Master Chief!

274
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,233
(Chattering)

275
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,706
I don't know why you
always bring these, sir.

276
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:57,208
You just make sure
I get 'em back.

277
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,781
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,716
- (Chattering Continues)
- (Man) Check your 'O"rings.

279
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,247
How you doin'there, Shultiess?

280
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,723
Good, sir.

281
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:14,058
Sir, it says here that the Koreans,
uh, believe in shamans.

282
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,631
Sometimes he appears as an old man.
Sometimes as a tiger.

283
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,793
- Sometimes as a leopard.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

284
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,371
Y- Uh-
(Exhales)

285
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,202
It's just, uh-

286
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,744
I was glad to read
about those shamans, you know?

287
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,973
I don't want to die
in a godless land, sir. That's all.

288
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,612
Hey.

289
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,743
Nobody's dying from my stick.
You copy that, sailor?

290
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,988
Yes, sir.

291
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,956
Makes me look bad.

292
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,268
- Pressurize in six.
- (Man) Pressurize in six.

293
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,964
(Man #2)
Six minutes. Six. Six to go.

294
00:17:57,073 --> 00:18:00,008
(Man #3)
On deck. Six minutes.

295
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,573
- Sir, we're ready for the bounce.
- Okay.

296
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:09,174
Two minutes.

297
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,583
(Chattering)

298
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,656
- All right, listen up.
- What is your problem?

299
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:17,021
I'm throwing up.
I hate jumping out of airplanes.

300
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,821
- Swallow it.
- I am.

301
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,293
'Pencil-dick"engineers
designed this aircraft...

302
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:22,830
to carry pussy-ass businessmen
from Omaha to St. Louis.

303
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,457
- If they see you chuckin',
they're gonna red tag you.
- I know.

304
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:28,594
We may find it useful to jump out of
a commercial piece of shit such as this.

305
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:32,197
What I don't get is why you go Navy SEALs
when you hate jumping out of airplanes.

306
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,368
I like swimming.
I'm a good swimmer.

307
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,537
Depressurize.

308
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,681
(Loud Rattling)

309
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,550
Now, obviously,
the pencil dicks in Seattle...

310
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:52,283
didn't design this ramp
to be deployed under these conditions.

311
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:55,728
The system's hydraulics can't compete
with the overwhelming force...

312
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,993
of the airstreams
under the fuselage...

313
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,569
preventing the stairs
from locking into place.

314
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,198
Fortunately, the U.S. Navy
has devised "the bounce."

315
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:07,333
Now, personally...

316
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:11,709
I've seen men injured, maimed...

317
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,873
and even killed
attempting to do this.

318
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:17,384
So I suggest you pay close att-

319
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,346
(Grunts)

320
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:25,826
(Grunts)
Like I said-

321
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,831
Anyone laughs,
you're fucking dead.

322
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,703
Shultiess. You're jumping first.

323
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:44,939
Trust me.
It's better that way.

324
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:48,779
The high-altitude, high-opening drop-
the HAHO.

325
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:54,221
The single most effective aerial infiltration
available to the special warfare operator.

326
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:57,759
Ensign James,
if I hear one snortle, one snicker...

327
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,953
one chuckle out of you
or Callaghan...

328
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,896
I will personally give you both
one of these. I shit you not!

329
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,559
- Understood?
- (Both) Hoo-ya, Master Chief.

330
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:09,536
The MT1 X-The crown jewel-
The crown jewel-

331
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,733
The crown jewel
of naval parachutes.

332
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:17,142
It can put a spec war operator
anywhere on this earth at any time.

333
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:21,046
Provided, that is,
you survive the jump.

334
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:25,287
- All right, Barnes. Open her up.
- Oxygen.

335
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,960
Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,951
Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...

337
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:38,022
we were able to use thermal imaging
to acquire these new target folders.

338
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:40,500
From this lower perigee...

339
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:44,801
these images clearly show
a diamond-shaped missile tip.

340
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,841
Indicative of
a nuclear-tipped warhead.

341
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,309
Mr. President, we can now say
with high confidence...

342
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:52,848
that this missile was designed
to deliver a nuclear device.

343
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,213
How do we know
it's carrying one?

344
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,218
How do we know it's not
a dummy warhead...

345
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,220
that's tricked out to look like
a nuclear warhead?

346
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:02,883
Well, sir, when plutonium is reprocessed
to make a nuclear bomb material...

347
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:05,756
it emits a radioactive gas-
krypton-85.

348
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:10,822
Our Lacrosse synthetic aperture radar
detected this gas from Yongjiri...

349
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:14,699
at levels consistent
with the existence of a mid-range...

350
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:17,295
three-to-five megaton
nuclear device.

351
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:21,467
Mr. President, we are as sure about this
as we ever were about any Soviet missile site.

352
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:26,605
That is an actual, live,
nuclear-tipped missile on the launchpad.

353
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:30,277
What's more disturbing, Mr. President,
is they seem to be fueling this missile...

354
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,286
to its highest alert level.

355
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:36,552
In this condition, it could be launched
within three minutes of receiving a 'go"order.

356
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,628
- And then how much time do we have-
- Thirty minutes.

357
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:44,658
(Weylon)
That's right.

358
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,894
A Topol-class missile
launched from North Korea...

359
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:48,971
would strike the United States...

360
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:53,405
in approximately 30 minutes.

361
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,445
Once it's in the air, there is no asset
in our arsenal that can bring it down.

362
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,141
Sir, in light of this, I think we ought
to revisit your decision...

363
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,809
to give Mackey's team
the go-ahead.

364
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:18,527
- Mazetti, you're up.
- (Man) Let's go, Mazetti.!

365
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,835
- Good bounce.
- Thank you, sir.

366
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:29,002
Good bounce, Mazetti!

367
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,875
- Ten bucks says the new guy freezes.
- Shut up, Mazetti!

368
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:33,676
(James)
Shultiess.!

369
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,280
- Happy jumping, Shultiess.
- Thank you, sir.

370
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:39,786
Meideros!

371
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,120
This is what we do, boys.

372
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,921
Whoo!

373
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:47,359
- (Alarm Beeping)
- (James) Mazetti, hold on.

374
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,556
Hold on, guys.
Back up.

375
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,930
(Man On Radio) Team Leader, this is the cockpit.
Pentagon is saying stand down.

376
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,441
Abort.

377
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,943
- Abort!
- Abort!

378
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,572
(Thinking)
Un-fucking-believable.

379
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:13,953
We have an abort mission.
You keep these boys on the plane!

380
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:16,923
(Barnes)
Bobby!

381
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:22,956
- What the hell's going on, Chief!
- Get back, sailor.

382
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:25,625
Mazetti, on the hatch.
Ballantine, check the hydraulics.

383
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,726
What are you doing?
Our guys are out there!

384
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:30,237
Following orders.
Now step back, Master Chief.

385
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,307
That's bullshit!
They got no SATCOM!

386
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:35,002
Bobby is completely fucked
down there.

387
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,875
They will send a cleanup team.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

388
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,540
Ballantine, take it off.
Take it off!

389
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,641
Callaghan, what are you doing?

390
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:45,983
Can't send a clean-up crew, 'cause they'll
never find 'em, and the North Ko's will.

391
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:49,615
That's not for you to decide.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

392
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:52,353
Callaghan,
you will not exit this plane.

393
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,295
Barnes, I am making this jump!

394
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,660
(Man)
Callaghan, don't be an idiot.!

395
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,704
(Barnes)
Track this leg for coordinates.

396
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,933
Stay on oxygen
until we stabilize.

397
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,336
(James, Thinking)
Exit airplane, proper body position.

398
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,846
Forget that.

399
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:16,850
Today, we're gonna go through a variety
of non-optimal parachute functions-

400
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:19,216
inversions, cigarette rolls,
line-overs, totals...

401
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:22,450
And my personal favorite-
the Mae West.

402
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,858
All of which have one thing in common-
They're all fatal.

403
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:29,192
(James, Thinking)
Stay with the program. Don't deploy in spin.

404
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,994
Spin recovery- full spread eagle.
Spin recovery- arch back.

405
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:34,001
Don't deploy.
Recover position.

406
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,003
Gain control.
Deploy parachute.

407
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:38,005
Come on, Bobby,
stay with the program.

408
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:41,508
Gain control. Deploy parachute.
Brace for opening shock.

409
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,546
(Boytano) On rare occasions,
your parachute will fail to deploy.

410
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:49,049
It is for this reason the U.S. Navy
provides you with a reserve chute.

411
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:52,177
But before you attempt
to cut away your main chute...

412
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:54,381
you must first cut away your Twinkie.

413
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,287
(James, Thinking)
Cut away the chute.

414
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:59,418
Get to the Twinkie.
Get to the Twinkie.

415
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:02,554
(Boytano) Worse than a total
deployment failure is a partial deployment.

416
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:06,226
Centrifugal force rushes all the blood
from your brain to your feet.

417
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,701
Fifteen seconds,
you get tunnel vision.

418
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,999
Ten seconds, you black out.

419
00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:14,372
After that, you die.

420
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,674
(James, Thinking)
Ka-bar knife. Right thigh pocket.

421
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,112
Full spread eagle.
Brace for opening shock.

422
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,844
(Groans)

423
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:28,121
Crown jewel, my ass.

424
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,427
What's going on, Admiral?

425
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,123
The situation's very fluid here.

426
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,393
Four of my guys jumped
before the recall order was-

427
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,401
That's not how I heard it,
Commander.

428
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:43,870
I heard two of your guys, including
your lieutenant, jumped after the red.

429
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:45,873
From what I gather,
General Vance...

430
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:48,205
LieutenantJames slipped
and was sucked out the plane.

431
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,938
- And Callaghan?
- Well, he may have jumped before the order.

432
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,276
- His comm unit was probably-
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Mackey.

433
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:56,317
Your men lack discipline.
They got no respect for chain of command.

434
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,944
- I disagree with that assessment, sir.
- You think they're heroes?

435
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:02,080
They're cowboys. They're gonna get people killed.
You better pray they're not detected.

436
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,751
I've ordered Team 1 Helo Platoon
to organize an exfil-

437
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,351
No, sir. You will not.

438
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:11,456
- General, my guys are my res-
- Your guys will dig in and stay put.

439
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:16,402
The president has ordered
a surgical strike at the missile site.

440
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:20,942
Your guys will do B.D.A. And when that's done,
our guys will pull 'em out in a Pave Low.

441
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,409
And when is this happening, sir?

442
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:25,673
You'll know when you need
to know, Commander.

443
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,383
(Slams Receiver)

444
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,433
(James)
Echo 7 Yankee. Any up?

445
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,626
Report in. Over.

446
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:50,865
Echo 7 Yankee. Any up?
Report in. Over.

447
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:53,100
Get that.

448
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,143
Echo 2 on site.

449
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:57,144
Also Echo-
Uh, what number are you?

450
00:26:57,246 --> 00:27:00,272
- That would be three.
- Also Echo 2- 3. Three. Over.

451
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,475
Copy that.
Echo 2, Echo 3.

452
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:05,520
- What's your position? Over.
- Give me your G.P.S.

453
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,589
Uh-

454
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,995
- 221 by 39.851. Over.
- Copy that. Stand by.

455
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:20,234
Okay. We're 20 miles apart.

456
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:25,797
Proceed to coordinates
2107 by 38.720. Over.

457
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:29,708
- Roger that.
- Get there as fast as you can, Echo 3.

458
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:32,303
L.T., where are the others?

459
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,975
We're it. Over.

460
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:39,919
(Callaghan)
Not entirely, Echo 7. Echo 12 in the air.

461
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:42,422
- No shit?
- No shit.

462
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,823
All right. Echo 3, you got
a 10-mile hump ahead of ya.

463
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:46,861
- Get movin:
- Roger that.

464
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,931
Echo 12, glide to these coordinates.

465
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:53,991
Sir, why haven't we turned this plane around?
We have got to get back to base.

466
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:57,732
Son, we're flying commercial airspace
with a commercial I.F.F. Signature.

467
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,173
- Any deviation of our flight plan, they'll-
- Shit.

468
00:28:01,277 --> 00:28:04,246
You're right.
I'm sorry, Colonel.

469
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:06,246
We got to get back to base, A.S.A.P.

470
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:08,373
I got four guys down there
that need my help.

471
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,384
I understand.

472
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:13,011
We'll drop off the North Korean radar
somewhere over Kazakhstan...

473
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:15,022
then vector back to Seoul.

474
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:17,558
I'll have you in South Korea
in under four hours.

475
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,560
Thank you, sir.

476
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:24,366
(Grunting)

477
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,134
Did you jump on the red?

478
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,140
- Oh, Jesus, man. You scared me.
- Did you jump on the red?

479
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,040
Yes, I did. How about a little help
getting me down from here?

480
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:37,976
- That was real dumb, Spaz.
- Yeah, I know.

481
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,071
- (Laughing)
- It's not funny, Neil.

482
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:43,982
- I don't suppose you brought a SATCOM?
- No.

483
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:47,317
But I did bring
my travel backgammon.

484
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:54,126
One P.V.C. 77
satellite-encrypted transceiver.

485
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:56,129
Good job, Spaz.

486
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:59,291
- Thanks.
- But you're still in a lot of trouble.

487
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:02,996
- How are they?
- There's four of them on the ground.

488
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:05,005
They're all okay.
They're scattered in two spots.

489
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:07,007
- What's his call sign?
- Echo 7.

Any injuries?

Yeah, we're all tip-top, sir.

492
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:15,440
Okay, listen up.
Your mission has been recalled.

493
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:19,510
I want you to reconnoiter to a safe hide site
and dig in awaiting exfiltration.

to a minimum.

- It's been aborted.

497

- Any time estimate on exfil, sir?
- Not at this time.

there's not gonna be
a boat drop.

509
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:13,207
They're gonna exfiltrate
using an MH-53 Pave Low.

510

How's a chopper gonna
avoid detection, sir?

511
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:20,172
When we're bombing the shit out of them,
we won't be so worried about detection.

512
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:23,376
Sir, we've got four Navy SEALs
downrange behind enemy lines.

513
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:27,421
- They are sitting ducks-
- Did you come in here to tell me that, Chief?

514
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:30,014
There's not gonna be
a navy rescue.

They're probably
gonna ask us to do B.D.A.

Mr. President, wars are started

- Wars.

And this war will be fought
on South Korea's soil.

Your USS Ronald Reagan
has made way to the Sea ofJapan...

is on course to the Yellow Sea.

606

You don't think North Korea
could misconstrue your actions...

607

when you were going to discover it.

Were you ever planning on telling us
about this grave threat?

625

Mr. Ambassador, when we first
discovered the missile...

626
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,747
we had hopes for a preemptive
Special Operations mission.

627

- Your mission was compromised.

Yes.

629
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:17,188
It was an act of war
against the D.P.R.K.

630
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:21,956
- We felt that we could count-
- Their retaliation will be against my country.

632

a fragile peace.

634
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:37,111
Your administration has always preached regime
change, and now you see the chance to effect it.

635
00:43:37,212 --> 00:43:41,478
All that stands in the way
are the many hundreds of thousands of lives-

636
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:44,848
Korean lives-
that will be lost in the process.

637
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:49,413
- It won't be hundreds of thousands.
- That'll be all, General.

638
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:52,118
And should you succeed,
what then?

639
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:56,926
- We have no plans for-
- Twenty-three million hungry North Koreans.

640
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,330
Where do they go?
New York? Philadelphia?

641
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:02,403
They come to Seoul.

642
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,904
They come to Seoul
like East Germany went to Berlin.

643
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:08,533
They come to Seoul
and destroy our economy.

644
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:12,670
We are not ready for this.
We did not ask for this.

645
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,682
And you- now you-
give us no choice but this?

646
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:21,118
What of China's reactions? Japan's?
The United Nations'? The world's reactions?

647

Mr. Ambassador, we assure you there will be
no further military action conducted...

see eye to eye.

00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:46,872
both reporting
troop strengths at over 85%.

659
00:45:46,975 --> 00:45:49,170
- (Vance) What's the deal with these estimates?
- (Man) Sir?

660
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:52,110
- 10,000 U.S. Casualties?
- 5,000 to 10,000. Yes, sir.

661
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:56,309
- 10,000 to 50,000 South Korean?
- That's combined civilian-military.

662
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:59,181
Sir, it is what it is.
These are good numbers.

663
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:03,189
Bullshit. We're taking out 90%
of their artillery in the first 90 minutes.

664
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:06,226
- We factored that in, sir.
- I can't take these numbers to the president.

665
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:10,491
- He'll shut us down.
- Sir, we stand by these numbers.

666
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:12,498
Yeah, I heard you.

667
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,262
Bring me different ones.

668
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:28,810
- (Korean)
- Okay!

669
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,441
Bobby, don't you say-
(Grunts)

670
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:37,090
(Korean)

671
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:42,384
- What your mission?
- I don't understand.

672
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:44,522
What your mission?

673
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:47,362
I don't understand
what you're saying.

674
00:46:47,468 --> 00:46:49,402
(Screams)

675
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:54,768
What... your mission?

676
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,975
No. No.

677
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:08,021
- Come on, man.
- You Delta Forces?

678
00:47:08,122 --> 00:47:12,081
- Huh?
- Delta? Screw those-

679
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:14,559
(Screams)

680
00:47:26,374 --> 00:47:30,504
Today, I'm supposed to teach you
about survival techniques... for torture.

681
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:33,171
But there's nothing
I can say to you today...

682
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:37,547
that's gonna change things
when and if you get captured by the enemy.

683
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,021
The Vietcong did their thing on me
for three days.

684
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:46,351
They did things...

685
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:50,488
that were truly unimaginable,
un-human.

686
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:55,798
If any of you...

687
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,428
should ever get
captured by the enemy...

688
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:00,507
know this-

689
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:06,172
that I will be there with you.

690
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,874
Because you men
are my brothers...

691
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:13,414
and I will never leave you alone.

692
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:17,753

You, uh, Army Ranger?

695
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:32,602
- Black Hawk Ground?
- Yeah.

696
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:35,403
I'm Black Hawk Ground.

697
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,740
- Black Hawk Ground?
- Yeah.

698
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:43,249
I will never leave you.

699
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:51,486
Yeah, I'm Black Hawk Ground,
you fucking pussy.

00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,028
Pussy?
What do you mean "pussy"?

701
00:48:58,132 --> 00:49:01,124
Pussy. You pussy.

703
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:08,870

707
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:26,891
You think we 'savagy"?

708
00:49:26,994 --> 00:49:30,657
I know how speak Englishy,
Chinesy and Frenchy.

709
00:49:33,234 --> 00:49:37,193
I study stupid university
in Pyongyang.

710
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:41,241
I travel to Shanghai, study Mandarin.

711
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:44,175
You're a great man.

716
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:12,467
I told him
that you are Lieutenant RobertJames...

717
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:14,905
Navy SEALs Team 1.

718
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:17,068
(Laughing)

719
00:50:17,178 --> 00:50:19,942
He said, if you are navy,
then where is your boat?

720
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:22,345
(Laughing)
Funny, huh?

721
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:28,180
We have a real problem,
you and me.

722
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:36,190
You see, America sees
two Koreas-

723
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:38,765
North and South.

724
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:47,136

(Groans)

727
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:05,955

- I apologize, Lieutenant.
That must be very painful.

00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:13,157
(Man Speaking Korean)

730
00:51:14,502 --> 00:51:16,436
Hwang here is very excited.

731
00:51:16,537 --> 00:51:19,597
Delivering American soldiers
to our Dear Leader...

732
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:22,039
would bring him and his men
great rewards-

733
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:25,943
enough pork and beef
for perhaps two months, maybe even more.

734
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:29,448
Maybe a letter of commendation
from our Dear Leader.

735
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:33,353
(Korean)

736
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:40,257
You see...

737
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:42,659
Hwang here- He wants me
to radio my commanders...

738
00:51:42,763 --> 00:51:46,699
to tell them
about his great discovery.

739
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:52,361
You see, America sees two Koreas.

740
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:54,441
We see only one.

741
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:58,740
We call her
the "Land of the Morning Calm."

742
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:03,447
(Coughs)

743
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:06,586
Our Dear Leader tells us...

744
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:10,020
soon we will reunify
under his great command.

745
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:15,287
So we wait and prepare
for this day.

746
00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:18,297
Yeah, well,
that's never gonna happen.

747
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:20,799
- No?
- No.

748
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:23,802
Maybe you are right.

749
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:27,067
Maybe you and I
are not so different.

750
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:33,370
Yeah, well, your leader-
He's fuckin' crazy.

751
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:35,608
(Laughing)

752
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:38,082
In my country,
we are killed...

753
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:41,177
for saying such things
about our leaders.

754
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:44,189
Yeah, well, in mine,
it's pretty much national sport.

755
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,316
I am afraid
that if our Dear Leader...

756
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:50,386
finds that there are
Navy SEALs in the D.P.R. K...

757
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:54,400
that would give him enough reason
for the reunification.

758
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:56,231
That'd be really stupid.

759
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:59,397
I think so too.

760
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:02,169
I am afraid
that our Dear Leader...

761
00:53:02,276 --> 00:53:04,904
thinks that we are more powerful
than we really are.

762
00:53:06,547 --> 00:53:10,415
I think people are afraid to tell him
how hungry his soldiers are...

763
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:12,816
how old his equipment is.

764
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:17,947
- So?
- So I think it is better that you die here...

765
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:20,357
without our Dear Leader
ever knowing.

766
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,798
Don't you think so?

767
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:31,661
(Korean)

768
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,740
(Man Speaking Korean)

769
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,243
I told him to tell the villagers...

770
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:40,643
to say nothing
about ever seeing you.

771
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:44,311
Better, no?

772
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:48,912
You see, I am...
a good chingu.

773
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,321
Do you know
what chingu means?

774
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:53,325
"Friends."

775
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:58,592
Friends with common interests.

776
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:01,293
(Korean)

777
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:03,302
We go to my command.

778
00:54:03,404 --> 00:54:05,770
There you will tell me
what I need to know.

779
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:14,578
Why haven't we heard
from the North Koreans?

780
00:54:14,682 --> 00:54:17,150
They may still be deciding
what to ask for.

781
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,219
There's been no increased
military activity-

782
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,153
not at Yongjiri, D.M.Z., Yongbyon-
nothin'.

783
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,384
Likely they're looking for the Dear Leader.
He goes missing from time to time.

784
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:27,518
- Mr. President.
- Have you spoken to them?

785
00:54:27,628 --> 00:54:29,323
- Yeah.
- So?

786
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,523
So, here's what
the South Koreans are saying.

787
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:34,795
If we execute the surgical strike
at the missile site...

788
00:54:34,902 --> 00:54:38,599
they believe the D.P.R.K.
Will retaliate with artillery.

789
00:54:38,706 --> 00:54:42,142
And their damage estimates
are far greater than the Pentagon estimates-

790
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:44,211
as high as one million dead.

791
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:47,212
- They're utterly misguided. They-
- Hold on, General.

792
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:49,282
What do they suggest?

793
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:53,516
I'll let the general
take you through it, sir.

794
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:56,715
I'd just like to say up front
that we had this scenario ourselves...

795
00:54:56,824 --> 00:54:59,054
but we didn't think
you'd abide our suggesting it.

796
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,221
The truth is, sir, in terms of allied
casualty projections, they're-

797
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,298
Well, they're extremely positive, sir.

798
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:09,062
- Let's hear the plan, General.
- Admiral.

799
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:14,631
Well, sir, it starts with an absolute
naval blockade along the 37 th parallel.

800
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:18,075
We're prepared to effect that
any time tomorrow after 1200 hours.

801
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:21,012
(Vance)
Then, Mr. President, the plan calls for...

802
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:24,243
a combined R.O.K. -U.S.
Preemptive first strike-

803
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:28,344
a sudden massive and overwhelming
barrage along the entire D.P.R.K. Line.

804
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:31,549
Artillery, air bases,
supply depots, army bases.

805
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:33,684
We can get half their forces
asleep in their barracks.

806
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:35,853
We could keep their MIGs
from ever takin' off.

807
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:39,194
Probably could get another 20% of their
ground force as they're approaching their tubes.

808
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,827
Any tubes we missed
in the first Cruise strikes and F-117 runs-

809
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,906
the South Koreans
have Patriot batteries all along the line.

810
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:48,031
A second wave of sorties
90 minutes later...

811
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:50,201
would end the threat
of artillery altogether.

812
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:55,078
We would make the missile sites
and the nuclear research facilities...

813
00:55:55,182 --> 00:55:57,343
secondary and tertiary targets.

814
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:00,648
Ellie. This is what
the South Koreans proposed?

815
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:02,722
If it's this or a surgical strike...

816
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,723
which would leave
the North Koreans...

817
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:07,225
entirely capable
of a full-strength retaliation...

818
00:56:07,328 --> 00:56:10,627
then, yes, they'd prefer
preemptive attack.

819
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:13,791
It's a provocative strategy, sir,
no question.

820
00:56:13,901 --> 00:56:18,099
But, well-The allied casualty projections
are the real draw.

821
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:22,437
- What are they?
- We could reasonably project
total allied casualties-

822
00:56:22,543 --> 00:56:24,875
I'm talkin' combined
U.S. And South Korean total dead-

823
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:28,380
1,000 to 3,000.

824
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:30,950
It'd all be over
in a matter of hours, sir.

825
00:56:34,888 --> 00:56:36,981
General, what are the enemy
casualty projections?

826
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:39,753
Sir?

827
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,158
I truly believe our response

by North Korea deploying
a nuclear I.C.B.M.

829
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:46,595
What are the projections, General?

830
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,761
Somewhere between
350,000 and 500,000 dead, sir.

831
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:56,341
Yeah.

832
00:56:56,443 --> 00:56:58,911
Cam, Ellie- my office.
Right now.

833
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:13,858
This-This thing
is totally out of hand!

pushing Armageddon since the beginning.

- Oh. (Clears Throat) Excuse me.

836
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:23,294
I've gotta use the head.

837
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:28,932
You know what I love most
about the navy, Mr. President?

838
00:57:29,043 --> 00:57:31,841

What is that?

839
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:36,873

Mr. Ambassador, this proposal-
this surprise attack-it's-

843
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,271
Does this represent the wishes
of your government?

844
00:59:15,382 --> 00:59:17,782
Mr. President...

845
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:23,824
3.5 million North Koreans have died
from starvation in the last three years.

846
00:59:23,924 --> 00:59:27,257
What has your nation done
to grieve these deaths?

847
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:32,062
The casualties-
The enemy casualties-

848
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:35,363
Mr. President, you give us
only evils to choose from.

Sir, I have two K.I.A.

And Callaghan-
Well, sir, he's hurt pretty bad.

But, sir, there's something
you need to pass on right away.

Mr. President.

898
01:04:44,878 --> 01:04:47,073
I've got Commander Mackey
on the line.

899
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,478
Lieutenant BobbyJames
is freed in North Korea...

900
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,710
and safe with South Korean Special Forces.

901
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,878
Additionally, sir,
LieutenantJames is reporting...

902
01:04:54,988 --> 01:04:57,752
that at least some of his captors
were Chieu Hoi.

903
01:04:57,858 --> 01:04:59,985
- That's, um-
- Vietnamese for "defectors."

904
01:05:00,093 --> 01:05:03,256
- I know what it means, Admiral. I was there.
- Beg your pardon, sir.

905
01:05:03,363 --> 01:05:05,695
Ellie, I want you
to hear this.

906
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:07,994
- Go ahead, Commander.
- (Mackey) Sir.

907
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:10,763
LieutenantJames is asking permission
to cross deck.

908
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:13,635
Uh, I was Army Ranger,
not a sailor.

909
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,904
"Cross deck," sir, means to cross over and join
the troops that have come to replace you.

910
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:21,469
Sir, he's asking to remount
Operation Silent Night...

911
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:23,606
with the help of
the South Korean Special Ops.

912
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:25,981
They think they can
sabotage the missile site?

913
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:27,986
- That's absurd.
- Vance.

914
01:05:28,088 --> 01:05:31,524
- Admiral?
- That is what he's saying, sir.

915
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,718
Okay, we need to get
Ambassador Li in here.

916
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:35,795
Commander Mackey,
how many men are there?

917
01:05:35,896 --> 01:05:37,796
Six, including LieutenantJames.

918
01:05:37,898 --> 01:05:40,128
I don't see a downside.

919
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:42,133
Excuse me.

920
01:05:42,235 --> 01:05:46,194
Detection, loss of the initiative,
element of surprise.

921
01:05:46,306 --> 01:05:49,036
If the D.P.R.K. Central command
doesn't know about the SEALs...

922
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:51,838
there's a chance they don't know
we're coming for their missile.

923
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:55,608
- Mr. President, we've been
down this road, sir. We can-
- Vance.

924
01:05:55,715 --> 01:05:58,445
I'm done talkin' about this.

925
01:05:58,552 --> 01:06:01,112
Commander Mackey,
permission granted.

926
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:03,451
And tell your man that,
should he succeed...

927
01:06:03,557 --> 01:06:06,287
he'll have the thanks
of more than one grateful nation.

928
01:06:06,393 --> 01:06:08,725
Yes, sir. We'll give it
everything we've got.

- Roger. Hilary.

931
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:26,569
- Report at 0400 prior to your assault.
- Yes, sir.

932
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:33,278
Captain Chung,
I am Ambassador Li Sung Park.

933
01:06:33,386 --> 01:06:36,583
I am calling from the office
of the president of the United States.

934
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,284
(Speaking Korean)

935
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:47,526
I have just received order
to assist you in any way possible.

936
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:50,102
(Inhales)
I guess we are-

937
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,103
how do you say- in business.

938
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:54,765
- In business.
- Yes!

939
01:07:00,513 --> 01:07:02,504
We gotta get rid
of this taxi.

940
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:08,015
I must speak
to my president now.

941
01:07:08,121 --> 01:07:10,646
I wish our soldiers success,
Mr. President.

942
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:14,523
I fear their actions
will determine war or peace.

943
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:17,529
Mr. Ambassador, our nation thanks you
for your actions here today.

944
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:22,768
(Door Closes)

945
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:26,430
I don't care what the president
of South Korea's willing to do.

946
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:30,771
I'm not gonna authorize a preemptive
full-scale assault on North Korea.

947
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:33,243
We'll give the SEALs 24 hours.

948
01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:37,339
If they fail, we'll proceed
with a surgical strike on the missile site.

949
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,921
I'm done talkin' about this.

950
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:47,323
- If we go that way, who's gonna
tell the South Koreans?
- They'll see it on CNN.

951
01:07:47,427 --> 01:07:50,794
If the South Koreans are right, our strike
could provoke a lethal counterattack.

952
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:53,695
If they come at us with everything,
including W.M.D.'s...

953
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,430
we're talking 700,000 to a million
South Koreans dead.

954
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:02,936
They won't do that.

955
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:05,011
They know we need
to take this site out.

956
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:07,136
Unless they want us to attack...

957
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:10,011
so they can say
we started this war.

- (Tires Screeching)

959
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:43,443
- Now we go to missile?
- I need you to get me to
the hills above the village.

960
01:08:53,994 --> 01:08:56,895
A few toys for our trip.
Let's move out.

961
01:09:07,307 --> 01:09:10,572
I got satellite photos
of the missile site.

962
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,543
Oh. Look.

963
01:09:16,349 --> 01:09:19,147

Why are they wearing these uniforms?

01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:32,661
Oh. Prisoners.
They are all political prisoners.

968
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,894
They work there
until they die.

969
01:09:37,003 --> 01:09:41,133
That way, no risk
of D.P.R.K. Secrets ever leaving.

970
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:45,234
- What about the ones that don't die?
- Eventually they all die.

971
01:09:45,345 --> 01:09:47,438
Fortunately for Kim Jong II...

972
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:52,246
there is no shortage
of new political prisoners in North Korea.

973
01:09:56,356 --> 01:09:59,189
All along the perimeter,
there's double bands of razor wire...

974
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,692
plus guards every 50 meters.

975
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:05,754
Except here.
No fences at the mouth of valley...

976
01:10:05,865 --> 01:10:07,765
because of these cliffs.

977
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:11,132
- Okay. Well, can the truck take us there?
- No.

978
01:10:11,237 --> 01:10:13,865

- Mm-hmm.

01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:19,136
Does the prisoner
have anything he'd like to say?

1167
01:30:19,244 --> 01:30:21,872
No, sir.

1168
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,948
Very well.

1169
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:27,617
By executive order...

1170
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:32,486
the transcripts of this tribunal
are classified top secret.

1171
01:30:32,591 --> 01:30:37,187
The record of these charges are to be
expunged from your permanent record...

1172
01:30:37,296 --> 01:30:39,890
and your sentence
is commuted to time served.

1173
01:30:44,803 --> 01:30:46,828
You're free to go, Master Chief.

1174
01:30:46,938 --> 01:30:49,907
**(Vocalizing Continues)

1175
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:04,720
I never seen anybody swallow more puke
on one of my planes than you, BobbyJames.

1176
01:31:04,823 --> 01:31:06,723
- You saw that?
- (Chuckles)

1177
01:31:06,825 --> 01:31:08,816
Why didn't you ever red tag me?

1178
01:31:10,495 --> 01:31:13,658
Because I never saw anybody
who wanted to be a Navy SEAL bad as you.

1179
01:31:17,969 --> 01:31:20,369
You know, Master Chief...

1180
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:25,203
what you taught me,
what you trained me to do-

1181
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,369
You saved my life
over there, sir.

1182
01:31:30,349 --> 01:31:32,317
Come on, son.
(Pats Shoulder)

1183
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:46,497
(Woman Reporter)
High-ranking U.S. Officials...

1184
01:31:46,598 --> 01:31:50,056
attempting to explain the cause
of a large mushroom cloud...

1185
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:53,001
first seen over North Korea
on Sunday...

1186
01:31:53,105 --> 01:31:56,165
are raising more questions
than answers.

1187
01:31:56,274 --> 01:31:59,437
The mushroom cloud
was first detected Sunday...

1188
01:31:59,544 --> 01:32:02,308
in satellite images
by South Korean media...

1189
01:32:02,414 --> 01:32:05,872
indicating the cloud
was approximately four kilometers...

1190
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:11,684
at the border area between North Korea
and China in Yanggang Province.

1191
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:15,692
Pyongyang initially denied
that any explosion had occurred...

1192
01:32:15,794 --> 01:32:19,423
but later reversed themselves,
linking the explosion...

1193
01:32:19,531 --> 01:32:22,125
to a hydroelectric dam project.

1194
01:32:22,234 --> 01:32:25,795
In the U.S.,
several high-ranking officials...

1195
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:29,431
were unusually quick
to accept Pyongyang's explanation...

1196
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:33,272
or offered differing explanations
of their own.

1197
01:32:33,378 --> 01:32:38,748
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
told CNN yesterday...

1198
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:43,549
'There are all kinds of reports, and there are
all kinds of assessments that are going on.

1199
01:32:43,655 --> 01:32:46,385
Maybe it was a forest fire
of some kind."

1200
01:32:46,491 --> 01:32:49,085
When the stories
broke over the weekend...

1201
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:52,630
about some explosion
taking place in North Korea...

1202
01:32:52,731 --> 01:32:55,427
my instincts told me
it was not a nuclear explosion.

1203
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:57,559
As you know,
the North Koreans announced today...

1204
01:32:57,669 --> 01:33:01,537
that they were doing some demolition work
for a hydroelectric project...

1205
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:04,939
and they're inviting
visiting foreign officials-

1206
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,739
especially from the United Kingdom-
to visit the site.

1207
01:33:07,846 --> 01:33:11,873
However, upon their return,
the diplomats told reporters...

1208
01:33:11,983 --> 01:33:14,042
that, according
to the satellite images...

1209
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:16,882
they had been taken
to the wrong position-

1210
01:33:16,988 --> 01:33:21,357
about 100 kilometers
from the suspected explosion site.

1211
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:25,089
Today, the story
took another curious turn...

1212
01:33:25,197 --> 01:33:29,998
as the South Korean
Vice Minister of Unification, Rhee Bong-jo...

1213
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:34,094
released a statement
claiming that there was no explosion...

1214
01:33:34,206 --> 01:33:36,640
stating the supposed
mushroom cloud...

1215
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:39,642
was a natural cloud formation.

1216
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:44,238
Perhaps the most troubling theory
put forth to explain the large cloud...

1217
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:48,376
is that a foreign state
may have incurred into North Korea...

1218
01:33:48,487 --> 01:33:52,253
to conduct a clandestine
military operation.

1219
01:33:52,357 --> 01:33:56,157
This theory took on greater potential
for being accurate...

1220
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:59,662
when it was discovered today
that the explosion occurred...

1221
01:33:59,764 --> 01:34:02,995
near the site
of Yongjiri Missile Base...

1222
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:07,470
a secret facility thought to have
an underground missile-firing system...

1223
01:34:07,572 --> 01:34:10,166
and which is also suspected
to contain...

1224
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:15,008
part of the D.P.R.K. 's
uranium-enrichment program.

1225
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:19,277
Mee Yong Chae,
Korea News International, Seoul.

1226
01:34:22,987 --> 01:34:32,979

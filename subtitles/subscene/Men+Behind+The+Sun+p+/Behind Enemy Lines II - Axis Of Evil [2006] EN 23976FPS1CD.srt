1
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,782
Korea, 1950.

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,087
America fights in a war
that leaves two million dead.

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,533
The fighting ends in a draw,
leaving Korea divided...

4
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,597
North and South...
and technically still at war.

5
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,131
The North becomes a surreal blend
of Stalinism, Communism...

6
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,134
and cult of personality dictatorship,
known to the world...

7
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,900
as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
or the D.P.R.K.

8
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,474
April 1994.
The D.P.R.K. Stuns the world...

9
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:02,078
when it announces its withdrawal
from the nonproliferation treaty...

10
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,021
and reveals its plan
to build nuclear weapons.

11
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,620
May 1994.

12
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,255
Determined to prevent North Korea
from becoming a nuclear power...

13
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,166
President Bill Clinton orders
Defense Secretary William Perry...

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,262
to draw up military OPLAN 5027...

15
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,037
a U.S. Surgical strike
on the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,979
Many voice their concern
the D.P.R.K. Might retaliate...

17
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:33,542
with their 11,000 artillery tubes
trained on Seoul, South Korea.

18
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,781
Just as the N.S.C. Is meeting
to discuss the evacuation...

19
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,324
of all nonmilitary personnel
in Seoul...

20
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,020
there is a telephone call
from former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

21
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,328
As a private citizen, President
Carter had flown to Pyongyang...

22
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,595
met with North Korea's leader,
Kim II Sung...

23
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,298
and struck a deal
which averted military action.

24
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,035
Had OPLAN 5027 been executed...

25
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,579
the Pentagon had projected
up to one million deaths.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,581
Few people realize,
in June 1994...

27
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,746
America was days, if not hours,
away from war with North Korea.

28
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,232
They're gonna crucify Weylon for this.

29
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,736
- How long till launch time?
- They're saying six days.

30
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,738
- Ten-hut!
- Good morning, sir.

31
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,105
All right, Weylon.
Tell me what you know.

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,202
Mr. President, Secretary of Defense Beekman
is in Qatar for the week...

33
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,247
unless you direct him home sooner.

34
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,249
General Vance,
as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

35
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,649
- will be discussing the military viewpoint.
- Mr. President.

36
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,118
General.

37
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,712
Sir, approximately six hours ago...

38
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,124
the Satellite Reconnaissance Center
analyzed imaging data from a...

39
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,994
- Mr. President, um...
- Oh, I'm sorry, guys. Be seated.

40
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,399
Imaging data from a KH...12 over North Korea...

41
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,664
showing what we can now
say with certainty...

42
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,299
is a three...stage, Topol...class
intercontinental ballistic missile...

43
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,570
at the Yongjiri missile center.

44
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,977
We were fortunate to acquire these images
as the crane was loading the missile...

45
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,776
into its underground silo.

46
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,750
If it was half an hour later,
we never would have seen it.

47
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,219
The longest...range missile
North Korea had prior to this...

48
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,552
would have run out of fuel
somewhere over Alaska.

49
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,186
Three stages means it can hit New York,
Washington, D.C. Anywhere in CONUS.

50
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,322
- What do we know about its payload?
- It's impossible to say.

51
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,493
- Could it be a warhead or a nuclear device?
- We can't say.

52
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,537
It's not likely, Mr. President.

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,072
The Lockheed KH...12
has a rotating periscope mirror...

54
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,267
which means it can get
a high angle of obliquity.

55
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,503
We're gonna spin the bird around,
get a better angle.

56
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,580
That'll help us
determine the load.

57
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,617
We've always assumed North Korea would
never deploy a long-range missile like this...

58
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,484
because of our certain
and inevitable military response.

59
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,388
Sir, even test-firing a three-stage rocket
is a 10-year leap forward...

60
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,392
in their strategic capabilities...

61
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,396
and it represents a direct and grave threat
to our national security.

62
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,966
We won't let that happen.

63
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,853
Let's try to keep things under
control tonight, okay?

64
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,854
Let's try.

65
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,691
- Shultiess, how you doin'?
- Good, sir.

66
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,027
What are you doing?

67
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,899
Master Chief asked me to tell him
when this old man gets off the phone.

68
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,698
Well, carry on.

69
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,774
Where'd you find the banana?
Looks like he's 12.

70
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,400
He speaks some Korean,
and he's a hell of a shot.

71
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,948
I need, like, 200500...won coins
just to call Boston. Isn't that ridiculous?

72
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,210
L.T., did you get
the score of the 49ers game?

73
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,752
- What was that, 36...27?
- Guys, come on. I'm tryin' to count.

74
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,879
- The field temperature was, like, 97.
- You happy?

75
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,718
You guys suck.
Get me a beer.

76
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,284
- Meideros, what's goin' on?
- I got two 8,000p laser-guided chopsticks...

77
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,025
suspended from an extended range
CH-53 chopper, and I'm figuring...

78
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,500
Bad idea. You're way vulnerable to R.P.G.'s
coming from those soy sauce bottles.

79
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,935
Bound to be small-arms fire
coming from the fish flakes.

80
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,768
I bet you even money there's a sniper
hiding in that bowl of jigae.

81
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,036
- Gotta think.
- That's why I roll with you, man.

82
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,079
- Master Chief!
- Keep your eye on these.

83
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,114
- Baby, is that you?
- Fifty bucks says he starts bawlin'.

84
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,514
- I'll take that.
- I love you so much.

85
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,519
- Here it comes.
- I miss you.

86
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,921
Just tell me what's going on?
Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,926
Wait, wait. Here it comes.
Wait for it.

88
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,189
- A girl?
- Wait for it.

89
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,289
- This is sad, man. I can't look.
- I got a baby girl?

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,664
- Waterworks.
- What's up with that?

91
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,165
Hello? Amy!

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,174
Hello? This goddamn...

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,176
- It's a girl?
- It's a girl, dude.

94
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,441
- I got a baby girl.
- Yeah! Congratulations, man.

95
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,642
Yo, um, I already
talked to Amy about it.

96
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,651
We're gonna name her Bobbi.

97
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,812
That's real nice, Spaz.

98
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,288
- I got a baby girl, man.
- You got a baby girl.

99
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,191
I got a baby girl, gentlemen!

100
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,366
What's on offer, General?

101
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,942
Sir, we propose
Operation Sheet Lightning...

102
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,068
a surgical strike on the missile site.

103
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,840
Multiple Cruise missile launches
concurrent with sorties...

104
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,315
from seven B...2 Stealth Spirits
and five ...117 As.

105
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,079
Ellie?

106
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,280
If it was any other sovereign nation, sir,
I'd urge negotiations.

107
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,981
But D.P.R.K. ...

108
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,787
There is just no viable
diplomatic option.

109
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,385
And if they do
test that missile...

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,022
it devastates our footing
in the multilateral talks.

111
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,062
Yeah.

112
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,831
Have the warning
orders been given, General?

113
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,567
Okay. So we take out
the missile site.

114
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,371
What's Pyongyang gonna do?

115
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,141
Well, sir, I think Kim's people
could be persuaded to stand down.

116
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,241
I think the general overestimates
my skills of diplomacy, sir.

117
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,883
What are they gonna do, Weylon?

118
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,721
Either a cantankerous
political...diplomatic protest...

119
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,318
or some sort of military response...
not much in between.

120
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,488
Sir?

121
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,498
Sir, that is
Commander Tim Mackey...

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,068
Commander, U.S. Naval Base,
Jinhae, South Korea.

123
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,832
Mr. President,
if we attack that missile site...

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,568
the D.P.R.K. Will most surely
counterattack at Seoul...

125
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,270
using their 11,000 artillery tubes.

126
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,006
That's possible.

127
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,742
Or a more proportional response
would be Scud missile attack...

128
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,375
against the research center
at Taejon.

129
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,351
The South Koreans respond
with a strike at the D.M.Z. ...

130
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,945
Or the Pyongyang nuclear facility.

131
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,390
And the North Koreans respond
with their artillery.

132
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,395
We bomb them...
They bomb their neighbors.

133
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,364
We have a contingency,
sir, should the North attempt that...

134
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,366
Operation Swift Rage.

135
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,062
We can neutralize 90%
of North Korea's response capabilities...

136
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,763
in the first 24 hours of hostilities.

137
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,433
And we'd be at war.

138
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,238
Sir, I believe we've been at war
for at least six hours now.

139
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,594
Mr. President, if I may?

140
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,561
Negative, Commander.

141
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,757
Go on, Commander.

142
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,391
Mr. President, in 1997...

143
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,471
North Korea opened its air space
to commercial airliners.

144
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,167
A platoon from SEALs Team 1 could
board a commercial airlines flight in Seoul...

145
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,039
deploy over North Korea...

146
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,409
You don't think the North Koreans
would pick up a commercial airliner...

147
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,012
leaving from a U.S. Military base
in South Korea?

148
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,510
Leaving from a U.S. Military base
in South Korea?

149
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,586
Sir, we would just dress
the SEALs up...

150
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,677
walk 'em right through
Incheon International...

151
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,814
put 'em on a chartered
commercial airliner and take off...

152
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,291
mixed right in with civilian traffic.

153
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,294
Completely undetectable.

154
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,626
We would deploy over North Korea...

155
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,394
glide the 60 miles
to the Yongjiri missile site...

156
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,299
and sabotage the missile
as it's being fueled.

157
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,305
Secondary explosions
should destroy the entire complex.

158
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,309
Whole thing will be perceived
as an industrial accident of some kind.

159
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,038
North Korea'd have
no grounds to retaliate.

160
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,310
And if it turned out to be a nuclear warhead,
what about the radiation?

161
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,784
The blast from the fuel explosions
would be massive, sir.

162
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,821
Even though it wouldn't be
an atomic blast...

163
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,220
it would probably create
its own mushroom cloud.

164
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,850
The heat from the blast would
incinerate any nuclear materials...

165
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,395
alleviating any radiation concerns.

166
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,692
Sir, I don't recommend this.

167
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,236
If they're detected, it's an act of war,
and we lose the element of surprise.

168
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,795
What's the window of opportunity
to explore a Special Ops plan?

169
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,705
I'd say 72 hours,
but I wouldn't...

170
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,974
- Seventy-two hours.
- Sir, a covert action?

171
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:26,780
L...We need to send a strong
proportional and visible response...

172
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,786
to the North Koreans...
to the whole world...

173
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,788
to put them on notice
that that dog don't hunt.

174
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,188
We will never allow them
to be an I.C.B.M. Power.

175
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,927
Commander Mackey,
could you be ready in 72 hours?

176
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,259
Yes, sir. I believe
we could be ready.

177
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,560
Admiral?

178
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,897
It's not much time to put
a mission together, sir, but...

179
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,437
I understand.

180
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,030
Gentlemen, keep up
with your preparations.

181
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,405
I'll give you a decision
within six hours.

182
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,740
Yes, sir. We'll give it
everything we've got.

183
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,041
Thank you, Mr. President.

184
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,777
"Give it everything we've got."
Tell me I didn't just say that.

185
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,376
What are you looking at?

186
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,514
- Get Lieutenant James in here.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,885
Mr. President...

188
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:15,399
Kim Jong II is 5'2".
He wears four-inch lifts.

189
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,959
He lives in a pleasure palace where he
indulges his penchant for Swedish prostitutes.

190
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,906
This missile is pompous grandstanding
by a very small man.

191
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,206
Sir, in 1996, the Korea Institute
for National Reunification...

192
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,942
applied a computer model that accurately
predicted Eastern Europe's collapse.

193
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,144
- Yeah?
- According to the model...

194
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,051
North Korea
should have collapsed in 1992.

195
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,319
I say we give this job to Special Ops
and make this all go away...

196
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:45,227
and let North Korea collapse
when it collapses.

197
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,231
Cam?

198
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,164
Yeah.

199
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,070
Okay.

200
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,106
Tell Mackey his mission is a "go."

201
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,303
But keep General Vance
and his Stealth bombers on standby...

202
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,971
should the SEALs fail.

203
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,862
- Lieutenant.
- Colonel. Thanks for the lift today, sir.

204
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,731
- They gave us a nice plane for this one.
- I see that.

205
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,170
- We gonna get miles for this?
- No, but I did order you the kosher meal.

206
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,506
- L.T.C.
- Guys, grab a seat and stow your stuff.

207
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,842
Let me know when you and your guys
get settled in. We'll be on our way.

208
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,916
Appreciate the hell
outta that, sir.

209
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,350
- Hoo-ya, Lieutenant James.
- Hoo-ya, Shultiess.

210
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,217
- How you feelin' today, papa?
- I feel immortal.

211
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,223
- I'm "the Stoke."
- Stoke?

212
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,522
- Oh, it's just my new call sign.
- Wasn't aware you had an old one.

213
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,995
Well, my old one was for mortals,
and I am immortal.

214
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,226
- I'm the Stoke.
- Whatever.

215
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,931
Okay. Good evening, gentlemen...

216
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,941
and welcome to United States
Air force light 738...

217
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,443
with nonstop service
to the skies over North Korea...

218
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,981
where we'll be jumping from an altitude
of approximately 33,000 feet.

219
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,348
Meideros in the hatch.
Barnes, Shultiess, Ballantine.

220
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,924
AK-47s.

221
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,436
Not a scratch, guys.
The airline wants this plane back...

222
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,374
in the same condition
they gave it to us in.

223
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,469
- You got it, Daiwi.
- Daiwi? Why do you guys call him that?

224
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,674
I don't call him that, but I've known him
since, like, the second grade.

225
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,751
- Hey, hey! What did he just say?
- I'm sorry.

226
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,945
It's okay, kid.

227
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,683
Hey, you scared?
Don't lie to me.

228
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,192
I don't know.
Maybe... Maybe a little.

229
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,753
Damn straight you're scared.
Who wouldn't be?

230
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,765
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

231
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,030
Stick with me, kid.
I'm immortal.

232
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,832
Go. Go.

233
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,837
Yeah. A P.V.C. 77 SATCOM.

234
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,379
That's you, schoolboy.

235
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,780
- Give it to Ballantine.
- I got it.

236
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,819
Okay, gentleman,
time to give up the personal shit.

237
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,913
Throw in the jewels. Let's go, boys.

238
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,732
Be careful with that. That's my wife.

239
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,891
I want these back.

240
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,901
What are those, son?

241
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,540
I said, what are those, Ensign?

242
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,635
- Silver wings, Master Chief!
- Bullshit!

243
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,680
Army lead wings, son.

244
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,512
You get 'em inside CrackerJacks.

245
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,314
- Where'd you get 'em, son?
- Ort Benning, Master Chief.

246
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,548
Ort Benning, Georgia.

247
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,353
The army's version of 48 hours
of intensive training...

248
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,724
crammed into 21 days.

249
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,890
Making pussy...ass static...line jumps
out of an Army C...141...

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,561
and landing on firm ground.

251
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,434
My one...year...old, Scott Jr.,
can do that.

252
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,770
- You see these?
- Yes, Master Chief.

253
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,811
Navy gold wings, son.

254
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,713
Get those out of my sight. I will teach you
to drop like a Navy SEAL...

255
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,751
from heights where there's
no air to breathe...

256
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,786
into water so cold
you'll wish you was dead.

257
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,515
You will drop at night
with N.V.G.'s...

258
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,716
fall five minutes
before you pull your cord.

259
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,488
And if you manage
to stay alive through all that...

260
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,155
we'll see about getting you
a pair of these.

261
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,323
Is that clear?

262
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,869
Hoo...ya, Master Chief!

263
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,508
I don't know why you
always bring these, sir.

264
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,011
You just make sure
I get 'em back.

265
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,584
Yes, sir.

266
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,518
Check your "O" rings.

267
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,050
How you doin' there, Shultiess?

268
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,525
Good, sir.

269
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:13,860
Sir, it says here that the Koreans,
uh, believe in shamans.

270
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,434
Sometimes he appears as an old man.
Sometimes as a tiger.

271
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,595
- Sometimes as a leopard.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

272
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,173
Y...Uh...

273
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,004
It's just, uh...

274
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,546
I was glad to read
about those shamans, you know?

275
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,775
I don't want to die
in a godless land, sir. That's all.

276
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,414
Hey.

277
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,546
Nobody's dying from my stick.
You copy that, sailor?

278
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,790
Yes, sir.

279
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,759
Makes me look bad.

280
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,070
- Pressurize in six.
- Pressurize in six.

281
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,767
Six minutes. Six. Six to go.

282
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,810
On deck. Six minutes.

283
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,376
- Sir, we're ready for the bounce.
- Okay.

284
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,976
Two minutes.

285
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,458
- All right, listen up.
- What is your problem?

286
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,824
I'm throwing up.
I hate jumping out of airplanes.

287
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,624
- Swallow it.
- I am.

288
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,095
"Pencil...dick" engineers
designed this aircraft...

289
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,633
to carry pussy...ass businessmen
from Omaha to St. Louis.

290
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,259
If they see you chuckin',
they're gonna red tag you.

291
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,396
We may find it useful to jump out of
a commercial piece of shit such as this.

292
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,999
What I don't get is why you go Navy SEALs
when you hate jumping out of airplanes.

293
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,171
I like swimming.
I'm a good swimmer.

294
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,339
Depressurize.

295
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,353
Now, obviously,
the pencil dicks in Seattle...

296
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,086
didn't design this ramp
to be deployed under these conditions.

297
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,530
The system's hydraulics can't compete
with the overwhelming force...

298
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,795
of the airstreams
under the fuselage...

299
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,371
preventing the stairs
from locking into place.

300
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:05,000
Fortunately, the U.S. Navy
has devised "the bounce."

301
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,135
Now, personally...

302
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,512
I've seen men injured, maimed...

303
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,676
and even killed
attempting to do this.

304
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,186
So I suggest you pay close att...

305
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,629
Like I said...

306
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,634
Anyone laughs,
you're fucking dead.

307
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,505
Shultiess. You're jumping first.

308
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,741
Trust me.
It's better that way.

309
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,581
The high...altitude, high...opening drop...
the HAHO.

310
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:54,023
The single most effective aerial infiltration
available to the special warfare operator.

311
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,562
Ensign James,
if I hear one snortle, one snicker...

312
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,756
one chuckle out of you
or Callaghan...

313
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,698
I will personally give you both
one of these. I shit you not!

314
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,361
- Understood?
- Hoo...ya, Master Chief.

315
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,338
The MT1 X...The crown jewel...
The crown jewel...

316
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,535
The crown jewel
of naval parachutes.

317
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,944
It can put a spec war operator
anywhere on this earth at any time.

318
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,849
Provided, that is,
you survive the jump.

319
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,089
- All right, Barnes. Open her up.
- Oxygen.

320
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,040
Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...

321
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,753
Although the missile has already
been lowered into its underground casing...

322
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:37,824
we were able to use thermal imaging
to acquire these new target folders.

323
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,302
Rom this lower perigee...

324
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,603
these images clearly show
a diamond...shaped missile tip.

325
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,644
Indicative of
a nuclear...tipped warhead.

326
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,111
Mr. President, we can now say
with high confidence...

327
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,650
that this missile was designed
to deliver a nuclear device.

328
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,015
How do we know
it's carrying one?

329
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,020
How do we know it's not
a dummy warhead...

330
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,022
that's tricked out to look like
a nuclear warhead?

331
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,685
Well, sir, when plutonium is reprocessed
to make a nuclear bomb material...

332
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,558
it emits a radioactive gas...
krypton...85.

333
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:10,624
Our Lacrosse synthetic aperture radar
detected this gas from Yongjiri...

334
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,502
at levels consistent
with the existence of a mid...range...

335
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,097
three...to...five megaton
nuclear device.

336
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,270
Mr. President, we are as sure about this
as we ever were about any Soviet missile site.

337
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,408
That is an actual, live,
nuclear...tipped missile on the launchpad.

338
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:30,079
What's more disturbing, Mr. President,
is they seem to be fueling this missile...

339
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,088
to its highest alert level.

340
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,354
In this condition, it could be launched within
three minutes of receiving a "go" order.

341
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,430
- And then how much time do we have...
- Thirty minutes.

342
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,461
That's right.

343
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,696
A Topol-class missile
launched from North Korea...

344
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,773
would strike the United States...

345
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:53,208
in approximately 30 minutes.

346
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,248
Once it's in the air, there is no asset
in our arsenal that can bring it down.

347
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,943
Sir, in light of this, I think we ought
to revisit your decision...

348
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,612
to give Mackey's team
the go...ahead.

349
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,329
- Mazetti, you're up.
- Let's go, Mazetti!

350
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,637
- Good bounce.
- Thank you, sir.

351
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,804
Good bounce, Mazetti!

352
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,678
- Ten bucks says the new guy freezes.
- Shut up, Mazetti!

353
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,478
Shultiess!

354
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,083
- Happy jumping, Shultiess.
- Thank you, sir.

355
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,589
Meideros!

356
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,922
This is what we do, boys.

357
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,723
Whoo!

358
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,162
Mazetti, hold on.

359
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,358
Hold on, guys.
Back up.

360
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,733
Team Leader, this is the cockpit.
Pentagon is saying stand down.

361
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,243
Abort.

362
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,745
- Abort!
- Abort!

363
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,375
Un...fucking...believable.

364
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,755
We have an abort mission.
You keep these boys on the plane!

365
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,726
Bobby!

366
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,758
- What the hell's going on, Chief!
- Get back, sailor.

367
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,428
Mazetti, on the hatch.
Ballantine, check the hydraulics.

368
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,528
What are you doing?
Our guys are out there!

369
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,039
Following orders.
Now step back, Master Chief.

370
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,110
That's bullshit!
They got no SATCOM!

371
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,804
Bobby is completely fucked
down there.

372
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,677
They will send a cleanup team.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

373
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,343
Ballantine, take it off.
Take it off!

374
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,443
Callaghan, what are you doing?

375
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,785
Can't send a clean...up crew, 'cause they'll
never find 'em, and the North KO's will.

376
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,418
That's not for you to decide.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

377
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,156
Callaghan,
you will not exit this plane.

378
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,098
Barnes, I am making this jump!

379
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,463
Callaghan, don't be an idiot!

380
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,506
Track this leg for coordinates.

381
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,735
Stay on oxygen
until we stabilize.

382
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,138
Exit airplane, proper body position.

383
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,648
Forget that.

384
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,653
Today, we're gonna go through a variety
of non...optimal parachute functions...

385
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,019
inversions, cigarette rolls,
line...overs, totals...

386
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,252
And my personal favorite...
the Mae West.

387
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,660
All of which have one thing in common...
They're all fatal.

388
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,995
Stay with the program. Don't deploy in spin.

389
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,796
Spin recovery- full spread eagle.
Spin recovery- arch back.

390
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,803
Don't deploy.
Recover position.

391
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,805
Gain control.
Deploy parachute.

392
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,807
Come on, Bobby,
stay with the program.

393
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,310
Gain control. Deploy parachute.
Brace for opening shock.

394
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:45,349
On rare occasions,
your parachute will fail to deploy.

395
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,851
It is for this reason the U.S. Navy
provides you with a reserve chute.

396
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,980
But before you attempt
to cut away your main chute...

397
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,183
you must first cut away your Twinkie.

398
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,089
Cut away the chute.

399
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,220
Get to the Twinkie.
Get to the Twinkie.

400
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,357
Worse than a total
deployment failure is a partial deployment.

401
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,028
Centrifugal force rushes all the blood
from your brain to your feet.

402
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,503
Fifteen seconds,
you get tunnel vision.

403
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,802
Ten seconds, you black out.

404
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,174
After that, you die.

405
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,476
Ka...bar knife. Right thigh pocket.

406
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,914
Full spread eagle.
Brace for opening shock.

407
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,924
Crown jewel, my ass.

408
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,229
What's going on, Admiral?

409
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,925
The situation's very fluid here.

410
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,195
Our of my guys jumped
before the recall order was...

411
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,203
That's not how I heard it,
Commander.

412
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,672
I heard two of your guys, including
your lieutenant, jumped after the red.

413
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,675
Rom what I gather,
General Vance...

414
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,007
Lieutenant James slipped
and was sucked out the plane.

415
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,741
- And Callaghan?
- Well, he may have jumped before the order.

416
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,079
- His comm unit was probably...
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Mackey.

417
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,119
Your men lack discipline.
They got no respect for chain of command.

418
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,746
- I disagree with that assessment, sir.
- You think they're heroes?

419
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,883
They're cowboys. They're gonna get people
killed. You better pray they're not detected.

420
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,553
I've ordered Team 1 Helo Platoon
to organize an exfil...

421
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,154
No, sir. You will not.

422
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,258
- General, my guys are my res...
- Your guys will dig in and stay put.

423
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,204
The president has ordered
a surgical strike at the missile site.

424
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,745
Your guys will do B.D.A. And when that's done,
our guys will pull 'em out in a Pave Low.

425
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,211
And when is this happening, sir?

426
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,476
You'll know when you need
to know, Commander.

427
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,235
Echo 7 Yankee. Any up?

428
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,429
Report in. Over.

429
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,667
Echo 7 Yankee. Any up?
Report in. Over.

430
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,902
Get that.

431
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,945
Echo 2 on site.

432
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,946
Also Echo...
Uh, what number are you?

433
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,074
- That would be three.
- Also Echo 2...3. Three. Over.

434
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,278
Copy that.
Echo 2, Echo 3.

435
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,322
- What's your position? Over.
- Give me your G.P.S.

436
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,391
Uh...

437
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,797
- 221 by 39.851. Over.
- Copy that. Stand by.

438
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,037
Okay. We're 20 miles apart.

439
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:25,599
Proceed to coordinates
2107 by 38.720. Over.

440
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,510
- Roger that.
- Get there as fast as you can, Echo 3.

441
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,105
L.T., where are the others?

442
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,778
We're it. Over.

443
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,721
Not entirely, Echo 7. Echo 12 in the air.

444
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,224
- No shit?
- No shit.

445
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,625
All right. Echo 3, you got
a 10...mile hump ahead of ya.

446
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,663
- Get movin".
- Roger that.

447
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,734
Echo 12, glide to these coordinates.

448
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,793
Sir, why haven't we turned this plane around?
We have got to get back to base.

449
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,534
Son, we're flying commercial airspace
with a commercial I- signature.

450
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,975
- Any deviation of our flight plan, they'll...
- Shit.

451
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,048
You're right.
I'm sorry, Colonel.

452
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,049
We got to get back to base, A.S.A.P.

453
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,176
I got four guys down there
that need my help.

454
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,186
I understand.

455
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,813
We'll drop off the North Korean radar
somewhere over Kazakhstan...

456
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,824
then vector back to Seoul.

457
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,360
I'll have you in South Korea
in under four hours.

458
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,362
Thank you, sir.

459
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,937
Did you jump on the red?

460
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,942
- Oh, Jesus, man. You scared me.
- Did you jump on the red?

461
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,842
Yes, I did. How about a little help
getting me down from here?

462
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,778
- That was real dumb, Spaz.
- Yeah, I know.

463
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,873
It's not funny, Neil.

464
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,784
- I don't suppose you brought a SATCOM?
- No.

465
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,119
But I did bring
my travel backgammon.

466
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,928
One P.V.C. 77
satellite...encrypted transceiver.

467
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,932
Good job, Spaz.

468
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,094
- Thanks.
- But you're still in a lot of trouble.

469
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,799
- How are they?
- There's four of them on the ground.

470
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,807
They're all okay.
They're scattered in two spots.

471
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,809
- What's his call sign?
- Echo 7.

472
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,039
Echo 7, you all right?
Any injuries?

473
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,116
Yeah, we're all tip...top, sir.

474
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,243
Okay, listen up.
Your mission has been recalled.

475
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,312
I want you to reconnoiter to a safe hide site
and dig in awaiting exfiltration.

476
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,086
Keep your terrestrial comms
to a minimum.

477
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,787
There's not a lot of R- up there.
You guys'll stick out bad.

478
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,763
- Sir, we had a rubber...duck contingency.
- It's been aborted.

479
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,167
- Any time estimate on exfil, sir?
- Not at this time.

480
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,204
Understood.

481
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,239
Make contact again at 1800.

482
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,241
Alpha Whiskey out.

483
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,671
1800. Echo 7 out.

484
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,143
All right.
Let's hump, Stokeman.

485
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,949
Hey. It's "the Stoke."

486
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,461
Sir? Master Chief Barnes is here.

487
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,798
- Sir.
- Master Chief.

488
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,131
Requesting permission to mount
a boat...drop rescue mission.

489
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,431
Barnes...

490
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,973
there's not gonna be
a boat drop.

491
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,009
They're gonna exfiltrate
using an MH...53 Pave Low.

492
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,841
How's a chopper gonna
avoid detection, sir?

493
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,974
When we're bombing the shit out of them,
we won't be so worried about detection.

494
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:23,178
Sir, we've got four Navy SEALs
downrange behind enemy lines.

495
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,224
- They are sitting ducks...
- Did you come in here to tell me that, Chief?

496
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,816
There's not gonna be
a navy rescue.

497
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,663
Flyboys will handle this.

498
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,701
- Return to your staging area.
- Sir.

499
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,078
Shultiess, get the computer
and bring up a sat image of the area.

500
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,455
There's a little village about a half klick down
the hill that wasn't even on this damn map.

501
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,891
Of course.

502
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,816
At nightfall, we're gonna move
to the top of these mountains...

503
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,547
then east,
over into this area here.

504
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,919
It's more remote,
but it's closer to the missile site.

505
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,924
They're probably
gonna ask us to do B.D.A.

506
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,792
- So we might as well dig in near the site.
- Hey, L.T. Look...

507
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,830
all due respect...

508
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,459
I didn't risk a court...martial
to do bomb damage assessment...

509
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,560
for a bunch of faggot-ass F-117 flyboys.
Now, look.

510
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,937
Let's just go find that missile site
and blow its ass up.

511
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,135
You done?

512
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,845
Shh!

513
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,499
Bobby, he saw us. What should we do?

514
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,577
Shut up!

515
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,444
- Callie, check the window!
- L.T., what do you want me to do?

516
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,075
I got her.

517
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,518
Neil, cover that window.

518
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,783
Stop! You got to shut up!

519
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,620
Neil, shut her up!

520
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,887
- Shultiess, grab her!
- Meideros, grab her!

521
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,691
I got her!

522
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,365
Bobby, get out of there!

523
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,462
Shultiess! Meideros! On me!

524
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,996
Neil, let's go!
Come on!

525
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,531
Meideros, get us restocked!
Shultiess, check our six.

526
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,802
Fucker shot me
right in my Kevlar.

527
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,903
Seeing how we're compromised...

528
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,982
can we call in
for an exfiltration?

529
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,074
Negative on that.
We're on our own.

530
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,123
This way's no good. Cliffs.

531
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:08,028
All right. We're gonna have to turn around,
take the fight to them.

532
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,533
We're gonna leapfrog in pairs.
Meideros, you're with me.

533
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,628
No different than a live-fire exercise,
San Clemente.

534
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:19,073
Hey! Radio frequency charts
are in my right thigh pocket, okay?

535
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,839
And all the instructions
are right there too.

536
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,471
I expect you to hand them to me
if I need them.

537
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,140
On your command, Daiwi.

538
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,337
Let's go to work.

539
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,205
Come on, kid.

540
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,734
- Advance!
- Callie! Come on!

541
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,231
R.P.G.!

542
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,371
Meideros! Get over here!

543
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,258
Echo 7 to base. Do you copy?

544
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,692
Base, this is Echo 7.
Do you copy? Over.

545
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,072
Bobby! We're gonna die!

546
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,085
Bobby! Man down!

547
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,088
We got to get out of here!
Come on!

548
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,750
Stay with me, Shultiess.
Stay with me.

549
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,022
I can't see anything!

550
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:29,031
Echo 7 to base. We have
brevity code Charlie. I repeat: Charlie.

551
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,068
We're facing heavy enemy fire.
We have engaged. Do you copy? Over.

552
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:42,541
No one is dying on my stick.
I told you. Hold tight.

553
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,555
Our father, who art in heaven...

554
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,953
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Mr. President.

555
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,993
I was just about to call your president
on the phone.

556
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:41,190
Mr. President, wars are started
over misunderstandings.

557
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,459
- I don't quite...
- Wars.

558
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,025
And this war will be fought
on South Korea's soil.

559
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:51,301
Your USS Ronald Reagan
has made way to the Sea of Japan...

560
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,969
and your destroyer, the USS Lassen
is on course to the Yellow Sea.

561
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,175
You don't think North Korea
could misconstrue your actions...

562
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,808
as a provocation towards engagement?

563
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,979
- I wouldn't confuse the navy...
- from your ships' movements...

564
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,217
I assume you have seen the missile.

565
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,524
Your Navy SEALs were captured...

566
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,895
by the D.P.R.K. Fifth Regiment
in Kimhyongjik.

567
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,566
I should say, two captured.

568
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,437
Two of your men...
were killed.

569
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,602
How did you get these?

570
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,148
Your government spends billions
of dollars on your satellites...

571
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:36,413
all to avoid putting human intelligence
inside hostile territory.

572
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,014
These photos came from one soldier
with a $3,000 camera...

573
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,025
connected to a satellite phone.

574
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,856
They were taken
four hours ago.

575
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,453
We discovered the missile
at Yongjiri 10 days ago...

576
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,864
and we've been watching them
assemble it in the caves.

577
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,631
Our Special Operations Task force 121
infiltrated the area.

578
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,868
We were wondering
when you were going to discover it.

579
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:02,275
Were you ever planning on telling us
about this grave threat?

580
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,075
Mr. Ambassador, when we first
discovered the missile...

581
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,549
we had hopes for a preemptive
Special Operations mission.

582
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:12,179
- It required the utmost secrecy...
- Your mission was compromised.

583
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,052
Yes.

584
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,991
It was an act of war
against the D.P.R.K.

585
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,758
- We felt that we could count...
- Their retaliation will be against my country.

586
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,891
How could you have such...

587
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,664
We're trying to preserve
a fragile peace.

588
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,366
By attacking a sovereign country.

589
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:36,913
Your administration has always preached regime
change, and now you see the chance to effect it.

590
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:41,280
All that stands in the way
are the many hundreds of thousands of lives...

591
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,650
Korean lives...
that will be lost in the process.

592
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,215
- It won't be hundreds of thousands.
- That'll be all, General.

593
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,920
And should you succeed,
what then?

594
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,728
- We have no plans for...
- Twenty-three million hungry North Koreans.

595
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,133
Where do they go?
New York? Philadelphia?

596
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,205
They come to Seoul.

597
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,706
They come to Seoul
like East Germany went to Berlin.

598
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,335
They come to Seoul
and destroy our economy.

599
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,472
We are not ready for this.
We did not ask for this.

600
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,485
And you... now you...
give us no choice but this?

601
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:20,921
What of China's reactions? Japan's?
The United Nations'? The world's reactions?

602
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:25,052
Mr. Ambassador, we assure you there will be
no further military action conducted...

603
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,063
until South Korea and the United States
see eye to eye.

604
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
That's right.

605
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,803
Then turn your ships around.

606
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:38,262
Sir, as of 0900 this morning...

607
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:41,637
Operation Sheet Lightning
remains on schedule...

608
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,732
with the Eighth Fighter Wing
and 18th Bomber Wing...

609
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:46,710
both reporting
troop strengths at over 85%.

610
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:49,008
- What's the deal with these estimates?
- Sir?

611
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:51,948
- 10,000 U.S. Casualties?
- 5,000 to 10,000. Yes, sir.

612
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:56,146
- 10,000 to 50,000 South Korean?
- That's combined civilian-military.

613
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,019
Sir, it is what it is.
These are good numbers.

614
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:03,026
Bullshit. We're taking out 90%
of their artillery in the first 90 minutes.

615
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,063
- We factored that in, sir.
- I can't take these numbers to the president.

616
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:10,328
- He'll shut us down.
- Sir, we stand by these numbers.

617
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,334
Yeah, I heard you.

618
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,098
Bring me different ones.

619
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,645
Okay!

620
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,277
Bobby, don't you say...

621
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:42,219
- What your mission?
- I don't understand.

622
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:44,356
What your mission?

623
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:47,196
I don't understand
what you're saying.

624
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:54,602
What- your mission?

625
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:04,808
No. No.

626
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:07,853
- Come on, man.
- You Delta forces?

627
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:11,914
- Huh?
- Delta? Screw those...

628
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:30,335
Today, I'm supposed to teach you
about survival techniques- for torture.

629
00:47:30,443 --> 00:47:33,002
But there's nothing
I can say to you today...

630
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:37,377
that's gonna change things
when and if you get captured by the enemy.

631
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,851
The Vietcong did their thing on me
for three days.

632
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:46,181
They did things...

633
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:50,317
that were truly unimaginable,
un-human.

634
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,628
If any of you...

635
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:58,258
should ever get
captured by the enemy...

636
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:00,336
know this...

637
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:06,001
that I will be there with you.

638
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:08,703
Because you men
are my brothers...

639
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,241
and I will never leave you alone.

640
00:48:26,994 --> 00:48:30,020
You, uh, Army Ranger?

641
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:32,429
- Black Hawk Ground?
- Yeah.

642
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:35,229
I'm Black Hawk Ground.

643
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:37,566
- Black Hawk Ground?
- Yeah.

644
00:48:41,174 --> 00:48:43,074
I will never leave you.

645
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:51,311
Yeah, I'm Black Hawk Ground,
you fucking pussy.

646
00:48:55,554 --> 00:48:57,852
Pussy?
What do you mean "pussy"?

647
00:48:57,957 --> 00:49:00,949
Pussy. You pussy.

648
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:08,694
What your mission?

649
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:24,241
American think we stupid? Huh?

650
00:49:24,348 --> 00:49:26,714
You think we "savagy"?

651
00:49:26,817 --> 00:49:30,480
I know how speak Englishy,
Chinesy and renchy.

652
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:37,014
I study stupid university
in Pyongyang.

653
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:41,062
I travel to Shanghai, study Mandarin.

654
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:43,996
You're a great man.

655
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:12,286
I told him that you
are Lieutenant Robert James...

656
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:14,725
Navy SEALs Team 1.

657
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:19,760
He said, if you are navy,
then where is your boat?

658
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:22,164
Unny, huh?

659
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:27,999
We have a real problem,
you and me.

660
00:50:31,843 --> 00:50:36,007
You see, America sees two Koreas...

661
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:38,582
North and South.

662
00:51:00,503 --> 00:51:05,770
- I apologize, Lieutenant.
That must be very painful.

663
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:16,250
Hwang here is very excited.

664
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,411
Delivering American soldiers
to our Dear Leader...

665
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,853
would bring him and his men
great rewards...

666
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:25,756
enough pork and beef
for perhaps two months, maybe even more.

667
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,261
Maybe a letter of commendation
from our Dear Leader.

668
00:51:37,772 --> 00:51:40,069
You see...

669
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,471
Hwang here... He wants me
to radio my commanders...

670
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:46,512
to tell them
about his great discovery.

671
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:52,173
You see, America sees two Koreas.

672
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:54,252
We see only one.

673
00:51:54,353 --> 00:51:58,551
We call her
the "Land of the Morning Calm."

674
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,397
Our Dear Leader tells us...

675
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,831
soon we will reunify
under his great command.

676
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,097
So we wait and prepare
for this day.

677
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:18,107
Yeah, well,
that's never gonna happen.

678
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:20,608
- No?
- No.

679
00:52:21,712 --> 00:52:23,612
Maybe you are right.

680
00:52:23,714 --> 00:52:26,877
Maybe you and I
are not so different.

681
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:33,180
Yeah, well, your leader...
He's fuckin' crazy.

682
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:37,891
In my country, we are killed...

683
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:40,986
for saying such things
about our leaders.

684
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:43,998
Yeah, well, in mine,
it's pretty much national sport.

685
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,125
I am afraid that if our Dear Leader...

686
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:50,193
finds that there are
Navy SEALs in the D.P.R.K...

687
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:54,207
that would give him enough reason
for the reunification.

688
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,038
That'd be really stupid.

689
00:52:56,144 --> 00:52:59,204
I think so too.

690
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:01,975
I am afraid
that our Dear Leader...

691
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:04,710
thinks that we are more powerful
than we really are.

692
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:10,221
I think people are afraid to tell him
how hungry his soldiers are...

693
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:12,622
how old his equipment is.

694
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,752
- So?
- So I think it is better that you die here...

695
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,162
without our Dear Leader
ever knowing.

696
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:24,603
Don't you think so?

697
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:38,048
I told him to tell the villagers...

698
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,448
to say nothing
about ever seeing you.

699
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,114
Better, no?

700
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:48,716
You see, I am...
a good chingu.

701
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,124
Do you know
what chingu means?

702
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,129
"Friends."

703
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:58,395
Friends with common interests.

704
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,104
We go to my command.

705
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,572
There you will tell me
what I need to know.

706
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:14,379
Why haven't we heard
from the North Koreans?

707
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:16,951
They may still be deciding
what to ask for.

708
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:19,020
There's been no increased
military activity...

709
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:21,954
not at Yongjiri, D.M.Z., Yongbyon...
nothin'.

710
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:25,184
Likely they're looking for the Dear Leader.
He goes missing from time to time.

711
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:27,318
- Mr. President.
- Have you spoken to them?

712
00:54:27,428 --> 00:54:29,123
- Yeah.
- So?

713
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,323
So, here's what
the South Koreans are saying.

714
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:34,595
If we execute the surgical strike
at the missile site...

715
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:38,398
they believe the D.P.R.K.
Will retaliate with artillery.

716
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:41,941
And their damage estimates
are far greater than the Pentagon estimates...

717
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:44,010
as high as one million dead.

718
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:47,012
- They're utterly misguided. They...
- Hold on, General.

719
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:49,082
What do they suggest?

720
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:53,314
I'll let the general
take you through it, sir.

721
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:56,513
I'd just like to say up front
that we had this scenario ourselves...

722
00:54:56,622 --> 00:54:58,852
but we didn't think
you'd abide our suggesting it.

723
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:03,019
The truth is, sir, in terms of allied
casualty projections, they're...

724
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:05,096
Well, they're extremely positive, sir.

725
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:08,859
- Let's hear the plan, General.
- Admiral.

726
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:14,428
Well, sir, it starts with an absolute
naval blockade along the 37th parallel.

727
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:17,872
We're prepared to effect that
any time tomorrow after 1200 hours.

728
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:20,808
Then, Mr. President, the plan calls for...

729
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:24,039
a combined R.O.K. U.S.
Preemptive first strike...

730
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:28,141
a sudden massive and overwhelming
barrage along the entire D.P.R.K. Line.

731
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:31,346
Artillery, air bases,
supply depots, army bases.

732
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:33,479
We can get half their forces
asleep in their barracks.

733
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:35,648
We could keep their MIGs
from ever takin' off.

734
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:38,989
Probably could get another 20% of their ground
force as they're approaching their tubes.

735
00:55:39,095 --> 00:55:42,622
Any tubes we missed
in the first Cruise strikes and ...117 runs...

736
00:55:42,732 --> 00:55:45,701
the South Koreans
have Patriot batteries all along the line.

737
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:47,826
A second wave of sorties
90 minutes later...

738
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:49,995
would end the threat
of artillery altogether.

739
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:54,872
We would make the missile sites
and the nuclear research facilities...

740
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,137
secondary and tertiary targets.

741
00:55:57,245 --> 00:56:00,441
Ellie. This is what
the South Koreans proposed?

742
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:02,516
If it's this or a surgical strike...

743
00:56:02,616 --> 00:56:04,516
which would leave
the North Koreans...

744
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:07,018
entirely capable
of a full-strength retaliation...

745
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:10,420
then, yes, they'd prefer
preemptive attack.

746
00:56:10,524 --> 00:56:13,583
It's a provocative strategy, sir,
no question.

747
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:17,891
But, well... The allied casualty projections
are the real draw.

748
00:56:17,997 --> 00:56:22,229
- What are they? - We could reasonably
project total allied casualties...

749
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:24,667
I'm talkin' combined
U.S. And South Korean total dead...

750
00:56:24,771 --> 00:56:28,171
1,000 to 3,000.

751
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:30,741
It'd all be over
in a matter of hours, sir.

752
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,773
General, what are the enemy
casualty projections?

753
00:56:36,882 --> 00:56:39,544
Sir?

754
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:41,948
I truly believe our response
is justified...

755
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:44,021
by North Korea deploying
a nuclear I.C.B.M.

756
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:46,386
What are the projections, General?

757
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:50,552
Somewhere between
350,000 and 500,000 dead, sir.

758
00:56:54,232 --> 00:56:56,131
Yeah.

759
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,701
Cam, Ellie- my office.
Right now.

760
00:57:09,812 --> 00:57:13,646
This... This thing
is totally out of hand!

761
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:17,276
These num... Vance has been
pushing Armageddon since the beginning.

762
00:57:17,386 --> 00:57:20,913
- It's...
- Oh. Excuse me.

763
00:57:21,023 --> 00:57:23,081
I've gotta use the head.

764
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,719
You know what I love most
about the navy, Mr. President?

765
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,628
What is that?

766
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:36,660
The boats go real slow.

767
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:10,652
Mr. Ambassador, this proposal...
this surprise attack... it's...

768
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,050
Does this represent the wishes
of your government?

769
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:17,561
Mr. President...

770
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:23,603
3.5 million North Koreans have died
from starvation in the last three years.

771
00:59:23,703 --> 00:59:27,035
What has your nation done
to grieve these deaths?

772
00:59:29,475 --> 00:59:31,841
The casualties...
The enemy casualties...

773
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:35,141
Mr. President, you give us
only evils to choose from.

774
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,230
Come. Come. Come.
I want to show you something.

775
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:57,425
You know movie Taxi Rider?

776
00:59:57,534 --> 01:00:00,059
Robert "Niro," "JoJo" Foster?

777
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:07,865
Taxi Rider.

778
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:23,280
I said get the fuck off me!

779
01:00:29,197 --> 01:00:31,495
Taxi Rider. Yeah.

780
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:38,903
Tell me about Taxi Rider.
Jo...JoJo oster.

781
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:01,951
Don't shoot!
Please, don't shoot!

782
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,994
- Are you Robert James?
- Yes.

783
01:01:04,096 --> 01:01:08,123
This is Captain Chung Won Joon
of the South Korean Task Force 121...

784
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:10,599
Bobby!

785
01:01:10,702 --> 01:01:13,102
Our government has sent us
to help you.

786
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:17,033
Would you like to come
with us, sir?

787
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,769
That'd be real good.

788
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:27,108
Hey. See if you can
get this thing goin'.

789
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,347
It's not happening.
No fuel.

790
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:08,915
Captain. I need that jeep.

791
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:11,183
My men.

792
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:30,032
Shit!

793
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,852
- I'm gonna go for the jeep.
- That's a bad idea, Bobby.

794
01:02:41,953 --> 01:02:43,887
What are we gonna do?
We can't just stick here.

795
01:03:29,564 --> 01:03:31,691
Bobby! The wall!

796
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:42,006
- Bobby, it's a dead end. Back up! Back up!
- I can see that, Neil!

797
01:03:58,258 --> 01:04:00,316
Chingu.

798
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:02,689
Chingu.

799
01:04:31,188 --> 01:04:33,816
- Echo 7?
- Yes, sir!

800
01:04:33,924 --> 01:04:36,392
Sir, I have two K.I.A.

801
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:40,054
And Callaghan...
Well, sir, he's hurt pretty bad.

802
01:04:40,163 --> 01:04:42,722
But, sir, there's something
you need to pass on right away.

803
01:04:42,832 --> 01:04:44,527
Mr. President.

804
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:46,828
I've got Commander Mackey
on the line.

805
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:49,234
Lieutenant Bobby James
is freed in North Korea...

806
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:51,465
and safe with South Korean Special forces.

807
01:04:51,574 --> 01:04:54,634
Additionally, sir,
Lieutenant James is reporting...

808
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:57,506
that at least some of his captors
were Chieu Hoi.

809
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:59,739
- That's, um...
- Vietnamese for "defectors."

810
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:03,011
- I know what it means, Admiral. I was there.
- Beg your pardon, sir.

811
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:05,449
Ellie, I want you
to hear this.

812
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,748
- Go ahead, Commander.
- Sir.

813
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:10,517
Lieutenant James is asking permission
to cross deck.

814
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:13,388
Uh, I was Army Ranger,
not a sailor.

815
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,657
"Cross deck," sir, means to cross over and join
the troops that have come to replace you.

816
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:21,222
Sir, he's asking to remount
Operation Silent Night...

817
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,359
with the help of
the South Korean Special Ops.

818
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:25,733
They think they can
sabotage the missile site?

819
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,738
- That's absurd.
- Vance.

820
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,276
- Admiral?
- That is what he's saying, sir.

821
01:05:31,377 --> 01:05:33,470
Okay, we need to get
Ambassador Li in here.

822
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:35,547
Commander Mackey,
how many men are there?

823
01:05:35,648 --> 01:05:37,547
Six, including Lieutenant James.

824
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:39,879
I don't see a downside.

825
01:05:39,985 --> 01:05:41,885
Excuse me.

826
01:05:41,987 --> 01:05:45,946
Detection, loss of the initiative,
element of surprise.

827
01:05:46,057 --> 01:05:48,787
If the D.P.R.K. Central command
doesn't know about the SEALs...

828
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:51,589
there's a chance they don't know
we're coming for their missile.

829
01:05:51,695 --> 01:05:55,358
Mr. President, we've been down
this road, sir. We can...

830
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:58,196
I'm done talkin' about this.

831
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,862
Commander Mackey,
permission granted.

832
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:03,201
And tell your man that,
should he succeed...

833
01:06:03,307 --> 01:06:06,036
he'll have the thanks
of more than one grateful nation.

834
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,474
Yes, sir. We'll give it
everything we've got.

835
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,387
Echo 7 Yankee.

836
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:23,219
- Mission status: Hilary.
- Roger. Hilary.

837
01:06:23,325 --> 01:06:26,317
- Report at 0400 prior to your assault.
- Yes, sir.

838
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:33,026
Captain Chung,
I am Ambassador Li Sung Park.

839
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:36,331
I am calling from the office
of the president of the United States.

840
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:47,272
I have just received order
to assist you in any way possible.

841
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,848
I guess we are...

842
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:51,850
how do you say... in business.

843
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:54,512
- In business.
- Yes!

844
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:02,250
We gotta get rid
of this taxi.

845
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,760
I must speak
to my president now.

846
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:10,391
I wish our soldiers success,
Mr. President.

847
01:07:10,502 --> 01:07:14,267
I fear their actions
will determine war or peace.

848
01:07:14,372 --> 01:07:17,273
Mr. Ambassador, our nation thanks you
for your actions here today.

849
01:07:22,613 --> 01:07:26,173
I don't care what the president
of South Korea's willing to do.

850
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:30,515
I'm not gonna authorize a preemptive
full-scale assault on North Korea.

851
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,986
We'll give the SEALs 24 hours.

852
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:37,083
If they fail, we'll proceed
with a surgical strike on the missile site.

853
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:42,663
I'm done talkin' about this.

854
01:07:42,765 --> 01:07:47,065
If we go that way, who's gonna tell Koreans?
- They'll see it on CNN.

855
01:07:47,169 --> 01:07:50,536
If the South Koreans are right, our strike
could provoke a lethal counterattack.

856
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,437
If they come at us with everything,
including W.M.D.'s...

857
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:58,171
we're talking 700,000 to a million
South Koreans dead.

858
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:02,678
They won't do that.

859
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,752
They know we need
to take this site out.

860
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:06,878
Unless they want us to attack...

861
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:09,751
so they can say
we started this war.

862
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:43,182
- Now we go to missile?
- I need you to get me to the hills.

863
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:56,632
A few toys for our trip.
Let's move out.

864
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:10,308
I got satellite photos
of the missile site.

865
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:13,280
Oh. Look.

866
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,883
These are fan-fuckin'-tastic.

867
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:20,716
Fan-fucking-tastic?

868
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,690
I like this saying.

869
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,996
These workers...
Why are they wearing these uniforms?

870
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:32,396
Oh. Prisoners.
They are all political prisoners.

871
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:36,628
They work there
until they die.

872
01:09:36,737 --> 01:09:40,867
That way, no risk
of D.P.R.K. Secrets ever leaving.

873
01:09:40,975 --> 01:09:44,967
- What about the ones that don't die?
- Eventually they all die.

874
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:47,171
Fortunately for Kim Jong II...

875
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,979
there is no shortage
of new political prisoners in North Korea.

876
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:58,921
All along the perimeter,
there's double bands of razor wire...

877
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:01,424
plus guards every 50 meters.

878
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:05,486
Except here.
No fences at the mouth of valley...

879
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:07,498
because of these cliffs.

880
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,864
- Okay. Well, can the truck take us there?
- No.

881
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:13,597
- Looks like we're gonna have to climb then.
- Mm...hmm.

882
01:10:58,914 --> 01:11:02,907
Chung, I gotta radio in brevity code
so they don't assume we've been compromised.

883
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:05,213
Sure.

884
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,525
Want to try this?

885
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:06,399
Come on. Let's go.

886
01:12:31,633 --> 01:12:35,296
- There's no way that I'm lettin' you...
- You're not comin' with me, Neil.

887
01:12:35,403 --> 01:12:37,371
Sorry.

888
01:12:51,685 --> 01:12:53,915
Echo 7 Yankee, do you copy?

889
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:58,747
Echo 7 Yankee, come in.

890
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,526
All right. They're still
fueling the missile. That's good.

891
01:13:11,636 --> 01:13:13,604
There's light guard
on the bunker.

892
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:16,173
Soldiers must still
be in their barracks.

893
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,173
Jinhae, this is Kunsan 230.

894
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:22,508
Your signal is strong.
Good check.

895
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:26,208
Continue beacon at constant interval.

896
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:29,047
Roger, Kunsan.
Maintaining current signal strength.

897
01:13:30,654 --> 01:13:32,986
Jinhae, this is the USS Ronald Reagan.

898
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:36,685
Continuing signal sweep.
No signals reported. Over.

899
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:43,328
Ronald Reagan, Jinhae.
Appreciate the help, sir.

900
01:13:43,433 --> 01:13:46,095
Henry, this plan of yours
is gonna get people hurt.

901
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:48,534
What's your status?

902
01:13:48,638 --> 01:13:52,368
We're waiting for contact
from Lieutenant James.

903
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,345
He's overdue.

904
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:00,438
I'm shuttin' you down, bud.

905
01:14:00,549 --> 01:14:03,450
Norman, for God's sake,
give it a chance.

906
01:14:05,252 --> 01:14:07,152
Just give it 10 more minutes.

907
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,825
You guys ready?

908
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:09,066
Echo 7 Yankee, come in.

909
01:16:11,303 --> 01:16:14,704
- Echo 7 Yankee, do you copy?
- Come on. Come on.

910
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:03,882
Okay.

911
01:17:57,901 --> 01:17:59,528
Prisoners.

912
01:17:59,636 --> 01:18:02,696
Tell 'em they're free to go.
They got to get outta here now.

913
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:10,540
Admiral, General Vance tells me we may
have lost track of Operation Silent Night.

914
01:18:10,647 --> 01:18:12,978
- That's correct, sir.
- What does that mean?

915
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:16,051
I'm afraid we...

916
01:18:16,152 --> 01:18:18,620
We have to assume
that they have been compromised.

917
01:18:26,728 --> 01:18:28,559
He say,
"Thank you for my freedom."

918
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:37,428
Fight?
You want to fight alongside us?

919
01:18:39,106 --> 01:18:41,006
Okay.

920
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,415
American Navy SEAL!

921
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:52,848
No!

922
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,857
Let's get the hell outta here now.
Come on. Let's get outta here.

923
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:10,800
American Navy SEAL.
You come.

924
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:12,367
American Navy SEAL.
You come.

925
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:15,163
You come!

926
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:32,055
I know, if you do not
succeed here...

927
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:34,646
things will only get
worse for my country.

928
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,594
Tell your president that we are not all
ignorant peasants here in Korea.

929
01:19:48,637 --> 01:19:51,197
All right, let's get the hell outta here.
Now. Come on.

930
01:20:07,622 --> 01:20:09,385
Come on.

931
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:13,258
They're on their own.
We can't do any more for them.

932
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:33,945
Mr. President, if we're gonna
make our window, we have to put...

933
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:38,483
the B-2s at Okinawa and the 117s
at Jinhae in the air right now.

934
01:20:44,222 --> 01:20:46,383
Very well.

935
01:20:51,896 --> 01:20:54,626
Okinawa and Jinhae are "go."

936
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:01,562
Jinhae, Okinawa, you are "go."

937
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:04,937
Eighteenth Bomber Wing,
you are "go."

938
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:06,737
...cleared for takeoff.

939
01:21:06,844 --> 01:21:10,404
- Requesting priority clearance Runway 275.
- Go, Okinawa. Go.

940
01:21:10,513 --> 01:21:12,378
Tucson, Eighth Fighter Wing
is a "go."

941
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:19,581
- Jinhae launching and away.
- Roger, Okinawa. Launching and away.

942
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:21,247
Move!

943
01:21:53,853 --> 01:21:56,913
Roger, Okinawa.
On course. Proceeding north 270.

944
01:21:57,023 --> 01:21:58,820
Initializing target-acquisition software.

945
01:22:10,736 --> 01:22:14,536
Jinhae 17 moving into attack formation.

946
01:22:29,954 --> 01:22:31,444
Chung!

947
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,150
Okay!

948
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,799
There are too many of them
at the bunker.

949
01:22:44,901 --> 01:22:47,368
- No matter what, hold them here.
- Right!

950
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:57,541
Sir, the first wave breaks
North Korean airspace in nine minutes.

951
01:22:57,646 --> 01:23:00,443
Past this point, the squadron needs
a "go forward" order.

952
01:23:00,548 --> 01:23:03,210
- So ordered.
- Oscar 20.

953
01:23:03,318 --> 01:23:06,185
- "Go" order is affirmed.
- Roger that, CENTCOM.

954
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:10,383
Proceeding on course.
Crossing hostile territory in 0847.

955
01:24:01,272 --> 01:24:05,072
- Chung! Get your men! Let's go!
- They're dead!

956
01:24:05,175 --> 01:24:07,370
Watch out!

957
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,447
Sir, the first squad penetrates
hostile airspace in 45 seconds.

958
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,898
The tanker should have
blown the bunker.

959
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:36,761
Hold on.

960
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:16,698
Mr. President.

961
01:25:16,809 --> 01:25:19,572
Initializing weapon systems. Safety off.

962
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:30,809
Get new orders to all pilots
in Operation Sheet Lightning!

963
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:33,856
Brevity code Allison. All elements stand down.
All pilots return to base.

964
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:37,051
Echo 20. Echo 20.
Brevity code Allison.

965
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,889
Stand down.
I repeat- Stand down.

966
01:25:38,996 --> 01:25:41,658
Roger that, CENTCOM. Aborting approach.

967
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,498
Man, that was close.

968
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,693
Sir, our boys have done it.

969
01:25:54,276 --> 01:25:56,972
- Neil! You good?
- Yeah.

970
01:25:57,079 --> 01:25:59,171
Yeah, you were making
quite a racket up there.

971
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,612
I was just tryin'
to get some sleep.

972
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:04,514
Better hold on.
It's gonna get bumpy.

973
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:18,223
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Come on in, Barnes.

974
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:21,358
If I can drop you here,
can you get a rubber-duck exfil team...

975
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,995
two kilometers up the Tumen River
from the Sea of Japan?

976
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:27,470
With resupply tanks...

977
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:29,541
you bet your ass we could, sir.

978
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:34,839
So, how would you and your boys
like to go get your L.T.?

979
01:26:51,863 --> 01:26:53,762
Spaz.

980
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:17,609
- Meideros and Shultiess, they...
- We know.

981
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,688
We couldn't...
I-I wanted...

982
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:21,756
Bobby. We know.

983
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:45,577
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
General.

984
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,115
- Please sit down.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

985
01:27:49,216 --> 01:27:52,617
This nation owes you
a debt of gratitude, Norman.

986
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,917
You've had a long...
and a distinguished career.

987
01:27:57,023 --> 01:27:58,752
Thank you, Mr. President.

988
01:28:02,294 --> 01:28:04,194
Norman.

989
01:28:05,998 --> 01:28:08,262
I'm relieving you
of your command.

990
01:28:11,971 --> 01:28:13,871
Will the defendant approach?

991
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:21,642
You wanted to see me, sir.

992
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:27,376
You've been invited
to the White House, Lieutenant.

993
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:30,180
The president wants to give you
a commendation.

994
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:34,124
Me, sir?

995
01:28:35,392 --> 01:28:37,360
I should be at that tribunal
with Callaghan.

996
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:42,125
Yeah, well, you're going
to the White House instead.

997
01:28:43,299 --> 01:28:45,631
It's a classified meeting.
You understand?

998
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:47,703
No invited guests.

999
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:49,828
It's the Oval Office.

1000
01:28:49,939 --> 01:28:51,964
Just you and the president.

1001
01:28:56,245 --> 01:28:58,212
You can take one witness there.

1002
01:28:58,346 --> 01:29:00,280
One guy?

1003
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:04,680
Master Chief Petty Officer
Neil T. Callaghan...

1004
01:29:04,786 --> 01:29:07,277
this tribunal
has reached its verdict.

1005
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:09,357
On your feet, Master Chief.

1006
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:17,998
- Lieutenant James.
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:29:18,098 --> 01:29:20,157
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1008
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:22,360
- Come in. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

1009
01:29:22,469 --> 01:29:25,528
On the Article 15 charge
of striking an officer...

1010
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:28,766
we find the defendant
guilty as charged...

1011
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:32,675
and sentence him to one year
in the Naval Consolidated Brig at Miramar.

1012
01:29:34,881 --> 01:29:37,406
Sir? The lieutenant's witness is here.

1013
01:29:38,517 --> 01:29:40,610
Send him in.

1014
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:52,626
On the Article 90 charge
of disobeying a lawful order...

1015
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,755
we find the defendant guilty...

1016
01:29:54,865 --> 01:29:58,801
and sentence him to 10 years
at NAVCONBRIG Miramar.

1017
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:01,905
Lieutenant Robert James...

1018
01:30:04,475 --> 01:30:06,499
for service to your country...

1019
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:11,104
I am proud to present you
with the Distinguished Service Cross.

1020
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:18,780
Does the prisoner
have anything he'd like to say?

1021
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:21,515
No, sir.

1022
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:23,592
Very well.

1023
01:30:25,361 --> 01:30:27,261
By executive order...

1024
01:30:27,363 --> 01:30:32,130
the transcripts of this tribunal
are classified top secret.

1025
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:36,829
The record of these charges are to be
expunged from your permanent record...

1026
01:30:36,938 --> 01:30:39,532
and your sentence
is commuted to time served.

1027
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:46,469
You're free to go, Master Chief.

1028
01:31:00,993 --> 01:31:04,360
I never seen anybody swallow more puke
on one of my planes than you, Bobby James.

1029
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:06,363
You saw that?

1030
01:31:06,465 --> 01:31:08,456
Why didn't you ever red tag me?

1031
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:13,299
Because I never saw anybody
who wanted to be a Navy SEAL bad as you.

1032
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:20,009
You know, Master Chief...

1033
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,842
what you taught me,
what you trained me to do...

1034
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:27,008
You saved my life
over there, sir.

1035
01:31:29,987 --> 01:31:31,955
Come on, son.

1036
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:46,135
High-ranking U.S. Officials...

1037
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:49,693
attempting to explain the cause
of a large mushroom cloud...

1038
01:31:49,806 --> 01:31:52,639
first seen over North Korea
on Sunday...

1039
01:31:52,742 --> 01:31:55,801
are raising more questions
than answers.

1040
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:59,074
The mushroom cloud
was first detected Sunday...

1041
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,945
in satellite images
by South Korean media...

1042
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:05,508
indicating the cloud
was approximately four kilometers...

1043
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:11,319
at the border area between North Korea
and China in Yanggang Province.

1044
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:15,327
Pyongyang initially denied
that any explosion had occurred...

1045
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:19,058
but later reversed themselves,
linking the explosion...

1046
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:21,760
to a hydroelectric dam project.

1047
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,429
In the U.S.,
several high...ranking officials...

1048
01:32:25,538 --> 01:32:29,065
were unusually quick
to accept Pyongyang's explanation...

1049
01:32:29,175 --> 01:32:32,906
or offered differing explanations
of their own.

1050
01:32:33,012 --> 01:32:38,381
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
told CNN yesterday...

1051
01:32:38,484 --> 01:32:43,183
"There are all kinds of reports, and there are
all kinds of assessments that are going on.

1052
01:32:43,288 --> 01:32:46,018
Maybe it was a forest fire
of some kind."

1053
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:48,719
When the stories
broke over the weekend...

1054
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:52,262
about some explosion
taking place in North Korea...

1055
01:32:52,363 --> 01:32:55,059
my instincts told me
it was not a nuclear explosion.

1056
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,191
As you know,
the North Koreans announced today...

1057
01:32:57,301 --> 01:33:01,169
that they were doing some demolition work
for a hydroelectric project...

1058
01:33:01,272 --> 01:33:04,570
and they're inviting
visiting foreign officials...

1059
01:33:04,674 --> 01:33:07,370
especially from the United Kingdom...
to visit the site.

1060
01:33:07,477 --> 01:33:11,504
However, upon their return,
the diplomats told reporters...

1061
01:33:11,615 --> 01:33:13,674
that, according
to the satellite images...

1062
01:33:13,784 --> 01:33:16,514
they had been taken
to the wrong position...

1063
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:20,988
about 100 kilometers
from the suspected explosion site.

1064
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:24,719
Today, the story
took another curious turn...

1065
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:29,628
as the South Korean
Vice Minister of Unification, Rhee Bong-jo...

1066
01:33:29,732 --> 01:33:33,724
released a statement
claiming that there was no explosion...

1067
01:33:33,835 --> 01:33:36,269
stating the supposed
mushroom cloud...

1068
01:33:36,371 --> 01:33:39,272
was a natural cloud formation.

1069
01:33:39,374 --> 01:33:43,868
Perhaps the most troubling theory
put forth to explain the large cloud...

1070
01:33:43,978 --> 01:33:48,004
is that a foreign state
may have incurred into North Korea...

1071
01:33:48,115 --> 01:33:51,881
to conduct a clandestine
military operation.

1072
01:33:51,985 --> 01:33:55,785
This theory took on greater potential
for being accurate...

1073
01:33:55,889 --> 01:33:59,289
when it was discovered today
that the explosion occurred...

1074
01:33:59,392 --> 01:34:02,623
near the site
of Yongjiri Missile Base...

1075
01:34:02,728 --> 01:34:07,097
a secret facility thought to have
an underground missile-firing system...

1076
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,794
and which is also suspected
to contain...

1077
01:34:09,902 --> 01:34:14,634
part of the D.P.R.K.'s
uranium-enrichment program.

1078
01:34:14,739 --> 01:34:18,903
Mee Yong Chae,
Korea News International, Seoul.

00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:11,085
If they're detected, it's an act of war,
and we lose the element of surprise.

163
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:14,630
What's the window of opportunity
to explore a Special Ops plan?

164
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,604
I'd say 72 hours, but I wouldn't.
Seventy-two hours. Sir, a covert action?

165
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:26,800
I... We need to send a strong
proportional and visible response...

166
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,602
...to the North Koreans,
to the whole world....

167
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:30,604
...to put them on notice
that that dog don't hunt.

168
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:33,023
We will never allow them
to be an I.C.B.M. power.

169
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,777
Commander Mackey,
could you be ready in 72 hours?

170
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:39,071
Yes, sir.
I believe we could be ready.

171
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,407
Admiral?

172
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:46,286
It's not much time to put a mission
together, sir, but... I understand.

173
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,872
Gentlemen, keep up with your preparations.

174
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,250
I will give you a decision
within six hours.

175
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,885
Yes, sir. We will give it
everything we have got.

176
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,879
[Weylon]
Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,191
"Give it everything we have got."
Tell me I didn't just say that.

178
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,009
- [Chuckling]
- What are you looking at?

179
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,147
- Get Lieutenant James in here.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:09,727
Mr. President...

181
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:15,002
Kim Jong II is 5'2". He wears four-inch lifts.
[Chuckles] Sexy.

182
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:18,577
He lives in a pleasure palace where he
indulges his penchant for Swedish prostitutes.

183
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:23,341
This missile is pompous grandstanding
by a very small man.

184
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:27,036
Sir, in 1996, the Korea Institute
for National Reunification...

185
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:31,289
...applied a computer model that accurately
predicted Eastern Europe's collapse.

186
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,959
- Yeah?
- According to the model,

187
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,879
North Korea should have collapsed in 1992.

188
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,132
I say we give this job to Special Ops
and make this all go away...

189
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:44,254
...and let North Korea collapse
when it collapses.

190
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,754
[President] Cam?

191
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,474
Yeah.

192
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,895
Okay.

193
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:55,238
Tell Mackey his mission is a "go."

194
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:59,151
But keep General Vance
and his Stealth bombers on standby...

195
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,820
...should the SEALs fail.

196
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,374
Lieutenant.
Colonel. Thanks for the lift today, sir.

197
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,351
Well, they gave us a nice plane for this one.
I see that.

198
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,013
- We going to get miles for this?
- No, but I did order you the kosher meal.

199
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:32,951
L.T.C.
[Man] Okay, guys, grab a seat and stow your stuff.

200
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:35,688
Let me know when you and your guys
get settled in. We will be on our way.

201
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,431
Appreciate the hell out of that, sir.

202
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,593
- Hoo-ya, Lieutenant James.
- Hoo-ya, Shultiess.

203
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:45,873
- How you feeling today, papa?
- I feel immortal. I am "the Stoke." Stoke?

204
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:49,168
- Oh, it's just my new call sign.
- Wasn't aware you had an old one.

205
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:52,830
Well, my old one was for mortals,
and I am immortal.

206
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,541
- I am "the Stoke".
- Whatever.

207
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,994
Okay. Good evening, gentlemen...

208
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,757
...and welcome to United States
Air Force Flight 738...

209
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,860
...with nonstop service
to the skies over North Korea...

210
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,305
...where we will be jumping from an
altitude of approximately 33,000 feet.

211
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:14,484
- [Clamoring] Meideros in the hatch.
- Barnes, Mazetti, Shultiess, Ballantine.

212
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,739
AK-47s.

213
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,247
Hey, not a scratch, guys.
The airline wants this plane back...

214
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,308
...in the same condition
they gave it to us in.

215
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:41,295
- You got it, Daiwi.
- Daiwi? Why do you guys call him that?

216
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:44,206
I don't call him that, but I have known
him since, like, the second grade.

217
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:46,992
- Oh, hey, hey! What did he just say?
- I am sorry.

218
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,761
[Callaghan]
It's okay, kid.

219
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:56,018
Hey, you scared? Don't lie to me.
Uh, I don't know. Maybe... Maybe a little.

220
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:59,563
Damn straight you're scared.
Who wouldn't be?

221
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:04,060
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Stick with me, kid.
- I am immortal.

222
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,653
- Go.
- Go.

223
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:14,104
- Yeah. PVC-77 SATCOM.
- That's you, schoolboy.

224
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:18,004
- Give it to Ballantine.
- I got it.

225
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,269
[Man] Okay, gentleman,
time to give up the personal shit.

226
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,755
[Man #2] Yes.
Throw in the jewels. Let's go, boys.

227
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,300
[Chattering]

228
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,555
[Man]
Be careful with that. That's my wife.

229
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,724
[Callaghan]
I want these back.

230
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,726
[Man's Voice]
What are those, son?

231
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:45,359
I said, what are those, Ensign?

232
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:49,530
- Silver wings, Master Chief!
- Bullshit! Army lead wings, son.

233
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,324
You get them inside CrackerJacks.

234
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:55,160
- Where'd you get them, son?
- Ort Benning, Master Chief.

235
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,371
Ort Benning, Georgia.

236
00:15:57,371 --> 00:16:03,544
The army's version of 48 hours of
intensive training crammed into 21 days.

237
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:07,715
Making pussy-ass static-line jumps
out of an Army C-141...

238
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:11,385
...and landing on firm ground.

239
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:16,398
My one-year-old, Scott Jr., can do that.
You see these? Yes, Master Chief.

240
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:20,644
[Screams]
Navy gold wings, son.

241
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:24,523
Get those out of my sight. I will teach
you to drop like a Navy SEAL...

242
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,567
...from heights where there's
no air to breathe...

243
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,610
...into water so cold
you will wish you was dead.

244
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,532
You will drop at night with NVG's fall
five minutes before you pull your cord.

245
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:36,326
And if you manage
to stay alive through all that...

246
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:40,765
...we will see about getting you
a pair of these. Is that clear?

247
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:44,710
[All]
Hoo-ya, Master Chief!

248
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:49,882
[Chattering]

249
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:52,743
I don't know why you
always bring these, sir.

250
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:56,847
You just make sure I get them back.

251
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,833
Yes, sir.

252
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,353
- [Chattering Continues]
- [Man] Check your "O" rings.

253
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:06,899
How you doing there, Shultiess?

254
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,360
Good, sir.

255
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,497
Sir, it says here that the Koreans,
uh, believe in shamans.

256
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:16,583
Sometimes he appears as an old man.
Sometimes as a tiger.

257
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:21,997
Sometimes as a leopard. Everything's
going to be all right. Yeah... [Exhales]

258
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:24,833
It's just, uh...

259
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,379
I was glad to read
about those shamans, you know?

260
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:32,390
I don't want to die
in a godless land, sir. That's all.

261
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,660
Hey.

262
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,088
Nobody's dying from my stick.
You copy that, sailor?

263
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,600
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,992
Makes me look bad.

265
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,203
- Pressurize in six.
- [Man] Pressurize in six.

266
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:56,415
[Man #2]
Six minutes. Six. Six to go.

267
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:59,990
[Man #3] Let's run this down again.
On deck. Six minutes.

268
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:08,004
- Sir, we're ready for the bounce.
- Okay. Two minutes.

269
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,213
[Chattering]

270
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,298
- All right, listen up.
- What is your problem?

271
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,935
I am throwing up.
I hate jumping out of airplanes.

272
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,230
"Pencil-dick" engineers designed this aircraft...
Swallow it. I am.

273
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,774
...to carry pussy-ass Corporate Businessmen
from Omaha to St. Louis.

274
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:25,402
If they see you chucking, they're going
to red tag you. I know. Sometimes....

275
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:28,730
...we may find it useful to jump out of
a commercial piece of shit such as this.

276
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,217
What I don't get is why you go Navy SEALs
when you hate jumping out of fucking airplanes.

277
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,987
I like swimming.
I am a good swimmer.

278
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:37,156
Depressurize.

279
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:43,128
[Loud Rattling]

280
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:46,465
Now, obviously,
the pencil dicks in Seattle...

281
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:51,920
...didn't design this ramp
to be deployed under these conditions.

282
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,341
The system's hydraulics can't compete
with the overwhelming force...

283
00:18:55,341 --> 00:19:00,220
...of the airstreams under the fuselage
preventing the stairs from locking into place.

284
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,850
Fortunately, the U.S. Navy
has devised "the bounce."

285
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,977
Now, personally.

286
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:10,457
I have seen men injured, maimed...

287
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,725
...and even killed attempting to do this.

288
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:17,629
So I suggest you pay close atten...

289
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:18,948
[Grunts]

290
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:25,454
[Grunts]
Like I said.

291
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:30,459
Anyone laughs, you're fucking dead.

292
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,345
Shultiess.
You're jumping first.

293
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,256
Trust me.
It's better that way.

294
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:48,594
The high-altitude, high-opening drop,
the HAHO.

295
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:53,857
The single most effective aerial infiltration
available to the special warfare operator.

296
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:57,403
Ensign James,
if I hear one snortle, one snicker...

297
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,771
...one chuckle out of you or Callaghan...

298
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:02,533
I will personally give you both
one of these. I shit you not!

299
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,202
- Understood?
- [Both] Hoo-ya, Master Chief.

300
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:12,176
The MT1X, The crown jewel. The crown jewel...
The crown jewel of naval parachutes.

301
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:16,955
It can put a spec war operator
anywhere on this earth at any time.

302
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:20,676
Provided, that is, you survive the jump.

303
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,630
- All right, Barnes. Open her up.
- Oxygen.

304
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:32,563
Although the missile has already been
lowered into its underground casing...

305
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:37,651
...we were able to use thermal imaging
to acquire these new target folders.

306
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,112
From this lower perigee...

307
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:44,450
...these images clearly show
a diamond-shaped missile tip.

308
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,493
Indicative of a nuclear-tipped warhead.

309
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,904
Mr. President, we can now say
with high confidence...

310
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:52,109
...that this missile was designed
to deliver a nuclear device.

311
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,835
Well, how do we know it's carrying one?

312
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:58,639
How do we know it's not a dummy warhead that's
tricked out to look like a nuclear warhead?

313
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,309
Well, sir, when plutonium is reprocessed
to make a nuclear bomb material...

314
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,387
...it emits a radioactive gas, krypton-85.

315
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:10,434
Our Lacrosse synthetic aperture radar
detected this gas from Yongjiri...

316
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:17,140
...at levels consistent with the existence of
a mid-range 3-to-5 Megaton nuclear device.

317
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,341
Mr. President, we are as sure about this
as we ever were about any Soviet missile site.

318
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:26,241
That is an actual, live,
nuclear-tipped missile on the launchpad.

319
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:30,212
What's more disturbing, Mr. President,
is they seem to be fueling this missile...

320
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:31,914
...to its highest alert level.

321
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:36,368
In this condition, it could be launched
within three minutes of receiving a "go" order.

322
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:39,854
- And then how much time do we have.
- Thirty minutes.

323
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,001
[Weylon]
That's right.

324
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:46,912
A Topol-class missile
launched from North Korea...

325
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:52,218
...would strike the United States
in approximately 30 minutes.

326
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:57,064
Once it's in the air, there is no asset
in our arsenal that can bring it down.

327
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,775
Sir, in light of this, I think we ought
to revisit your decision...

328
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,044
...to give Mackey's team the go-ahead.

329
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:18,468
- Mazetti, you're up.
- [Man] Let's go, Mazetti!

330
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:26,468
- Good bounce.
- Thank you, sir.

331
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:31,815
Good bounce, Mazetti! Ten bucks says
the new guy freezes. Shut up, Mazetti!

332
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,608
[James]
Shultiess!

333
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:39,240
- Happy jumping, Shultiess.
- Thank you, sir. Meideros!

334
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:44,170
This is what we do, boys.
Whoo!

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,989
- [Alarm Beeping]
- [James] Mazetti, hold on.

336
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:49,199
Hold on, guys. Back up.

337
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,778
Team Leader, this is the cockpit. Back up.
Pentagon is saying stand down. Shut it off.

338

- Abort. Abort. Abort!

Un-fucking-believable.

340

You keep these boys on the plane!

[Barnes]
Bobby!

342
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,408
- What the hell's going on, Chief!
- Get back, sailor.

343
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:25,077
Mazetti, on the hatch.
Ballantine, check the hydraulics.

344
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:27,163
What are you doing?
Our guys are out there!

345
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,565
Following orders.
Now step back, Master Chief.

346
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:34,120
That's bullshit! They got no SATCOM!
Bobby is completely fucked down there.

347
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,498
They will send a clean-up team.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

348
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:41,752
Ballantine, take it off. Take it off!
Callaghan, what are you doing?

349
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,431
Can't send a clean-up crew, because they will
never find them, and the North KO's will.

350
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:49,059
That's not for you to decide.
Mazetti, on the hatch!

351
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:55,433
Callaghan, you will not exit this plane.
Barnes, I am making this jump!

352
00:23:57,785 --> 00:23:59,812
[Man]
Callaghan, don't be an idiot!

353
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:05,167
[Barnes] Track this leg for coordinates.
Stay on oxygen until we stabilize.

354
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:10,991
[James, Thinking] Exit airplane,
proper body position. Forget that.

355
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:16,305
Today, we're going to go through a variety
of non-optimal parachute functions....

356
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,831
...inversions, cigarette rolls,
line-overs, totals...

357
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,084
And my personal favorite, the Mae West.

358
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:26,105
All of which have one thing in common.
They're all fatal.

359
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,841
[James, Thinking]
Stay with the program. Don't deploy in spin.

360
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:31,635
Spin recovery, full spread eagle.
Spin recovery, arch back.

361
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,637
Don't deploy.
Recover position.

362
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:37,441
Gain control. Deploy parachute.
Come on, Bobby, stay with the program.

363
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:41,305
Gain control. Deploy parachute.
Brace for opening shock.

364
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,790
[Boytano] On rare occasions,
your parachute will fail to deploy.

365
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,694
It is for this reason the U.S. Navy
provides you with a reserve chute.

366
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:51,822
But before you attempt
to cut away your main chute...

367
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:54,033
...you must first cut away your Twinkie.

368
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:58,338
[James, Thinking] Cut away the chute.
Get to the Twinkie. Get to the Twinkie.

369
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:02,357
[Boytano] Worse than a total deployment
failure is a partial deployment.

Centrifugal force rushes all the blood
from your brain to your feet.

371
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,339
Fifteen seconds, you get tunnel vision.

00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:14,210
Ten seconds, you black out.
After that, you die.

00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:35,741
The situation's very fluid here.

378
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:39,837
Four of my guys jumped before the recall order
was... That's not how I heard it, Commander.

379
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:43,199
I heard two of your guys, including
your lieutenant, jumped after the red.

380
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,501
From what I gather, General Vance...

381
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:48,436
Lieutenant James slipped at the exit
point and was sucked out the plane.

382
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:50,559
And Callaghan?
Well, he may have jumped before the order.

383
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,925
- His comm unit was probably...
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Mackey.

384
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:55,869
Your men lack discipline.
They got no respect for chain of command.

385
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,455
- I disagree with that assessment, sir.
- You guys think they're heroes?

386
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:01,605
They're cowboys. They're going to get people killed.
You better pray they're not detected down there.

387
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:06,380
I have ordered Team 1 Helo Platoon to
organize an exfiltr.... No, sir. You will not.

388
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,368
- General, my guys are my resp...
- Your guys will dig in and stay put.

389
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:15,531
The president has ordered
a surgical strike at the missile site.

390
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:20,877
Your guys will do BDA, and when that's done,
our guys will pull them out in a Pave Low.

391
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:24,590
And when is this happening, sir?
You will know when you need to know, Commander.

Uh, what number are you?

- No shit.

All right. Echo 3, you got a 10-mile hump
ahead of you. Get moving. Roger that.

00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:49,183
Echo 12, glide to these coordinates.

We have got to get back to base.

with a commercial IFF signature.

I am sorry, Colonel.

over Kazakhstan then vector back to Seoul.

Yes, I did. How about a little help getting me
down from here? That was real dumb, Spaz.

00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,997
Yeah, I know.
It's not funny, Neil. [Laughing]

423
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:43,595
- I don't suppose you brought a SATCOM?
- No.

- There's four of them on the ground.

00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:05,759
- [Gasping] I apologize, Lieutenant.
- That must be very painful.

642
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:08,273
[Muffled Groaning]

643
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:13,195
[Man Speaking Korean]

644
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,298
Hwang here is very excited.

645
00:51:16,298 --> 00:51:19,518
Delivering American soldiers
to our Dear Leader would bring....

646
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:21,679
...him and his men great rewards...

647
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,458
...enough pork and beef for
perhaps two months, maybe even more.

648
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,461
Maybe a letter of commendation
from our Dear Leader.

649
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,382
[Korean]

650
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,964
You see...

651
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,383
Hwang here.
He wants me to radio my commanders...

652
00:51:42,383 --> 00:51:45,729
...to tell them
about his great discovery.

653
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,101
You see, America sees two Koreas.

654
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:54,445
We see only one.

655
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:58,782
We call her the "Land of the Morning Calm."

656
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,454
[Coughs]

657
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,223
Our Dear Leader tells us...

658
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:10,044
...soon we will reunify
under his great command.

659
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:15,299
So we wait and prepare for this day.

660
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,302
Yeah, well, that's never going to happen.

661
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,904
- No?
- No.

662
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,302
Maybe you are right.
Maybe you and I are not so different.

663
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah, well, your leader.
He's fucking crazy.

664
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,211
[Laughing]

665
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:40,700
In my country, we are killed
for saying such things about our leaders.

666
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,803
Yeah, well, in mine,
it's pretty much national sport.

667
00:52:43,803 --> 00:52:46,279
I am afraid that if our Dear Leader...

668
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:50,117
...finds that there are
Navy SEALs in the D.P.R.K...

669
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:54,121
...that would give him enough reason
for the reunification.

670
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,626
Well, that'd be really stupid.
I think so too.

671
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:04,932
I am afraid that our Dear Leader thinks that
we are more powerful than we really are.

672
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:10,237
I think people are afraid to tell him
how hungry his soldiers are...

673
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:12,815
...how old his equipment is.

674
00:53:14,183 --> 00:53:20,364
So? So I think it is better that you die
here without our Dear Leader ever knowing.

675
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,227
Don't you think so?

676
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,666
[Korean]

677
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,752
[Man Speaking Korean]

678
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:40,676
I told him to tell the villagers
to say nothing about ever seeing you.

679
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:43,304
Better, no?

680
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:50,753
You see, I am... a good chingu.
Do you know what chingu means?

681
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,655
"Friends."

682
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:56,210
Friends with common interests.

683
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,570
[Korean]

684
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:02,823
We go to my command.

685
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,484
There you will tell me what I need to know.

686
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,185
Why haven't we heard from the North Koreans?

687
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:18,814
They may still be deciding what to ask for.
There's been no increased military activity,

688
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:22,076
not at Yongjiri, D.M.Z., Yongbyon, nothing.

689
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:25,287
Likely they're looking for the Dear Leader.
He goes missing from time to time.

690
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,514
- Mr. President.
- Have you spoken to them?

691
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:31,318
Yeah. So? So, here's what
the South Koreans are saying.

692
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:34,613
If we execute the surgical strike
at the missile site...

693
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:38,309
...they believe the D.P.R.K.
will retaliate with artillery.

694
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:42,054
And their damage estimates are far
greater than the Pentagon estimates...

695
00:54:42,054 --> 00:54:43,909
...as high as one million dead.

696
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:48,786
- They're utterly misguided. They...
- Hold on, General. What do they suggest?

697
00:54:50,346 --> 00:54:53,040
I will let the general
take you through it, sir.

698
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,440
Sir, I'd just like to say up front that
we actually had this scenario ourselves...

699
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,846
...but we didn't think
you'd abide our suggesting it.

700
00:54:58,846 --> 00:55:02,817
The truth is, sir, in terms of allied
casualty projections, they're...

701
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:04,902
Well, they're extremely positive, sir.

702
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:07,856
- Let's hear the plan, General.
- Admiral.

703
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:14,345
Well, sir, it starts with an absolute
naval blockade along the 37th parallel.

704
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:18,465
We're prepared to effect that
any time tomorrow after 1200 hours.

705
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:24,108
[Vance] And then, Mr. President, the plan calls
for a combined ROK, U.S. pre-emptive first strike...

706
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:28,167
...a sudden massive and overwhelming
barrage along the entire DPRK line.

707
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:31,377
Artillery, air bases,
supply depots, army bases.

708
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:33,706
We can get half their forces while
they're asleep in their barracks.

709
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,774
We could keep their MIGs
from ever taking off.

710
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:39,011
Probably could get another 20% of their
ground force as they're approaching their tubes.

711
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:42,840
Any tubes we missed in the first
Cruise strikes and F-117 runs....

712
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,926
...the South Koreans have Patriot
batteries all along the line.

713
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,053
A second wave of sorties
90 minutes later...

714
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,222
...would end the threat
of artillery altogether.

715
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:55,102
We would make the missile sites
and the nuclear research facilities...

716
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,154
...secondary and tertiary targets.

717
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,409
Ellie. This is what
the South Koreans proposed?

718
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:03,937
If it's this or a surgical strike
which would leave the North Koreans...

719
00:56:03,937 --> 00:56:07,439
...entirely capable of a full-strength
retaliation. Then, yes.

720
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:09,617
They'd prefer pre-emptive attack.

721
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,487
It's a provocative strategy, sir,
no question.

722
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:17,783
But, well. The allied casualty
projections are the real draw.

723
00:56:17,783 --> 00:56:22,501
What are they? We could reasonably
project total allied casualties.

724
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,882
I am talking combined
U.S. and South Korean total dead.

725
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,495
1,000 to 3,000.

726
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:30,471
It'd all be over
in a matter of hours, sir.

727
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:37,277
General, what are the enemy
casualty projections?

728
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:39,277
Sir?

729
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:44,234
I truly believe our response is justified
by North Korea deploying a nuclear I.C.B.M.

730
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,312
What are the projections, General?

731
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:51,283
Somewhere between
350,000 and 500,000 dead, sir.

732
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,330
Yeah.

this surprise attack. It's....

Does this represent the wishes
of your government?

745
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,763
Mr. President,

746
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:23,511
3.5 million North Koreans have died
from starvation in the last three years.

747
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:27,231
What has your nation done
to grieve these deaths?

00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:31,069
The casualties.

749
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:35,564

you give us only evils to choose from.

could provoke a lethal counterattack.

Pyongyang initially denied
that any explosion had occurred...

...but later reversed themselves,
linking the explosion...

to accept Pyongyang's explanation...

1085
01:32:48,811 --> 01:32:52,386
...about some explosion
taking place in North Korea...

1086
01:32:52,386 --> 01:32:55,000
...my instincts told me
it was not a nuclear explosion.

1087
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,478
And as you know,
the North Koreans announced today...

1088
01:32:57,478 --> 01:33:01,170
...that they were doing some demolition
work for a hydroelectric project...

1089
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:04,590
...and they're inviting
visiting foreign officials...

1090
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,384
...especially from the United Kingdom
to visit the site.

1091
01:33:07,384 --> 01:33:11,454
However, upon their return,
the diplomats told reporters...

1092
01:33:11,454 --> 01:33:16,519
...that, according to the satellite images
they had been taken to the wrong position...

1093
01:33:16,519 --> 01:33:21,181
...about 100 kilometers
from the suspected explosion site.

1094
01:33:21,181 --> 01:33:24,715
Today, the story
took another curious turn...

1095
01:33:24,715 --> 01:33:29,687
...as the South Korean Vice Minister
of Unification, Rhee Bong-jo...

1096
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:33,744
...released a statement
claiming that there was no explosion...

1097
01:33:33,744 --> 01:33:39,291
...stating the supposed mushroom
cloud was a natural cloud formation.

1098
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:43,879
Perhaps the most troubling theory
put forth to explain the large cloud...

1099
01:33:43,879 --> 01:33:48,068
...is that a foreign state
may have incurred into North Korea...

1100
01:33:48,068 --> 01:33:51,787
...to conduct a clandestine
military operation.

1101
01:33:51,787 --> 01:33:55,878
This theory took on greater potential
for being accurate...

1102
01:33:55,878 --> 01:33:59,311
...when it was discovered today
that the explosion occurred...

1103
01:33:59,311 --> 01:34:02,648
...near the site
of Yongjiri Missile Base...

1104
01:34:02,648 --> 01:34:07,111
...a secret facility thought to have
an underground missile-firing system...

to contain...

...part of the D.P.R.K.'s

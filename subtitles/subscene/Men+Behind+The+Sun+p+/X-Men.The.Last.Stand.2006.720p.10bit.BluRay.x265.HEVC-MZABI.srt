1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,800
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,300
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,200
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,500
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,300
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,200
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,300
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,000
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Of course.

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,900
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,100
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,200
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,300
I like this one.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,800
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,700
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,500
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,100
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,800
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,000
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
One second!

32
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,700
Open this door.

33
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,500
Warren.

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Oh, God.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,900
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,900
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Bobby!

40
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,300
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,600
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,900
Logan.

45
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,500
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,100
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,600
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,100
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,700
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,400
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,500
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,700
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,300
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,500
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,200
Scott.

63
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Scott.

64
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,700
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,300
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,600
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,100
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,800
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,800
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,100
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,900
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hey, look.

74
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,300
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,200
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,600
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,300
Mr. President.

80
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,700
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,900
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,700
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,300
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,300
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,400
Raven?

91
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,100
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,900
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,100
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,100
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
In here with us.

97
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,600
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,300
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,700
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,300
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,400
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,000
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,600
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,000
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,300
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,200
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,900
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,600
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,200
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,900
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,000
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,400
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,300
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,300
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,200
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,100
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,300
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,900
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,900
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Professor?

131
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,600
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,300
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,800
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,900
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,000
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,200
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,400
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,000
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,100
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,500
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,100
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
Hank?

147
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,200
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,800
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,700
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,500
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,000
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,700
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,300
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,100
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,900
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,400
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,100
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,100
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,300
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,200
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,300
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,700
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,900
Storm.

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,900
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,100
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,100
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,700
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,200
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,500
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,000
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,200
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,700
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,700
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,000
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
No. Professor.

186
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,200
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,400
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,900
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,100
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,700
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,000
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,000
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,000
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,700
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,300
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,200
They just do it.

199
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,500
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,300
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,300
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,600
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,300
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,100
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,500
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,700
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Or us?

209
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,400
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
Back off.

211
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,100
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,700
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,700
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,700
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Do you?

216
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,600
And what can you do?

217
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,900
So you have talents?

218
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,100
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,300
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Other than you two.

221
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,500
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,500
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,300
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Shut up.

227
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
Please.

229
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,900
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,900
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,900
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,800
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,300
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,000
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,000
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,500
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,700
You'll see.

240
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,300
Jimmy.

241
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,000
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
It's OK.

246
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,300
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,400
Scott.

250
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,000
Scott.

251
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,500
Scott.

252
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,700
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,300
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,100
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,700
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Stop!

257
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Jean?

258
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
Scott.

259
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,100
How?

260
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
I don't know.

261
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
No.

264
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,800
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,500
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,300
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,100
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,500
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
I can take care of that.

271
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
What the...

272
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,800
Logan!

273
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,500
She's alive.

274
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,100
Jean.

275
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,900
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,200
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,100
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,900
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,700
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,500
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,100
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,800
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,900
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,000
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:46,200
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,600
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,300
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,900
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,900
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,000
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,600
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,800
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,300
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,600
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,700
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,600
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,600
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,000
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,700
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,200
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,600
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,900
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,300
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,600
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,700
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,800
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,700
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,400
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,000
You ready?

316
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,200
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,900
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,000
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,000
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,000
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,200
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,400
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,300
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,500
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,200
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,700
It's what you want.

327
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Warren, no!

328
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Told you so.

329
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,100
About time.

330
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,700
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,600
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,400
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,000
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,200
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,200
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,000
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,800
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,800
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,400
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
How fascinating.

342
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,700
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,700
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,000
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
No!

347
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,500
You saved me.

348
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Eric.

349
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,100
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,900
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,600
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,300
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,500
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,400
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,700
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,100
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
I have.

359
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,200
As do I.

361
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,100
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,500
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,000
Jean.

364
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,300
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,200
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,000
Are you OK?

367
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,800
Yeah.

368
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
More than OK.

369
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,000
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,600
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,200
It's OK.

372
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,600
It's OK.

373
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,900
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
Jean.

375
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,200
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,200
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,500
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,700
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,300
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,800
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Jean?

383
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,600
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,200
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
Oh, God.

387
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,500
Look at me.

388
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,500
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,400
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,400
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,900
Kill me.

392
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,800
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,200
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,600
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,400
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,000
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,700
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,400
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,400
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,600
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,000
I picked something up.

405
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,200
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,900
It's a mutant.

407
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,100
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,500
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,400
Where is she?

410
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,500
Logan.

411
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,900
What have you done?

413
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,300
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,400
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,200
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,300
It may be too late.

417
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,900
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,000
You were right, Charles.

420
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,500
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,900
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,100
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,900
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,100
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,000
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,200
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,500
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,500
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,100
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,100
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,100
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,300
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,600
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,600
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,700
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,300
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,400
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,200
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,100
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,500
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,800
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,300
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,100
That's it.

447
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,500
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,800
No, Jean.

449
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Jean!

450
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,200
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,000
Charles.

452
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,600
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
No.

454
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,200
God!

455
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,200
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,100
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,200
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,100
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,100
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,000
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,800
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,200
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,900
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,900
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,100
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,700
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,700
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,800
Kitty.

469
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Bobby.

470
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,000
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,300
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,700
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,000
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,100
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,000
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,900
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,500
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,200
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,600
Come on.

482
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,800
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,100
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,500
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,700
No.

486
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,700
Where are you going?

487
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,000
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,500
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,200
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,800
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,900
A kiss.

492
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,500
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,700
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,300
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,500
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,900
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,100
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,800
Marie.

500
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,200
Marie.

501
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:08,500
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,600
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:22,600
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,900
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,500
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,900
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,600
Jean.

508
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,700
Enough.

509
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,200
Enough.

510
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,800
You sound just like him.

511
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,900
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,100
As nature intended.

514
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:18,100
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,600
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,000
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,900
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,500
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:46,400
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,500
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,500
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,200
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:25,200
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,100
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,800
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,200
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,400
It was, son.

529
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,300
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,300
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Rogue.

532
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,900
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,500
Logan.

535
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,100
Logan.

536
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,000
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,000
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,000
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,400
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,900
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,400
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,400
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,900
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,400
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,700
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,500
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,700
Because you love her.

548
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,200
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,500
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,800
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,500
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,400
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,500
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:32,200
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,100
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,300
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,700
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,900
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,700
Make a move.

560
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,700
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,300
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,300
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,800
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,800
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,700
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,700
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,700
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,700
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,000
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,700
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:06,000
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,400
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,100
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,900
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,500
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,800
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,000
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,500
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,300
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,800
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,300
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,500
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,700
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,800
We have ours.

585
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:39,300
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:47,000
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,300
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,600
take control of the cure,

589
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,100
and destroy its source.

590
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,900
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,900
Jean.

592
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,700
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

593
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,700
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:40,300
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:53,000
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,700
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:00,300
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,000
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,500
OK.

600
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,300
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,400
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:37,000
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,400
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,200
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,700
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,900
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,500
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,800
OK.

609
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,500
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,700
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,900
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,000
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,400
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,900
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,700
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,700
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,500
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,700
I need help.

620
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,600
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,600
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:02,000
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,500
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,700
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,000
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,100
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,900
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,900
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,600
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,100
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,300
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,400
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,300
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
Are you?

635
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,600
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,300
X-Men.

637
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,500
All of us.

638
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,400
We're in.

639
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,600
Let's go.

640
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,600
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,900
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,400
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,800
We're trapped.

645
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,000
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,300
My God.

647
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,400
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,900
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,300
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,000
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,200
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,000
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,000
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,200
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,600
Fire!

656
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,200
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,200
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,600
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,500
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,400
Then God help us.

661
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,300
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,400
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,300
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,700
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,200
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,000
Finish them!

667
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,900
Not yet.

668
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,400
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,600
With pleasure.

670
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,100
Hold it!

671
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,300
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Kitty!

674
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,900
Come on.

675
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,000
Grow those back.

676
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,700
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,300
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,400
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,100
Girls.

682
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,500
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,900
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,200
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,600
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,600
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,300
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,500
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,900
No.

690
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:01,800
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,500
This way.

692
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,600
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,600
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,300
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,900
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,300
Don't. No.

697
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,900
Don't.

698
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,900
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,900
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,100
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,900
Take cover.

702
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,200
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,100
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,800
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,400
We work as a team.

706
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:58,100
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Go ahead.

709
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,300
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,500
Right.

711
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,100
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,200
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,300
You never should have left.

714
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,700
This is it.

715
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,800
Hey.

716
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,900
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,100
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,200
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,900
I'm...

720
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,600
One of them?

721
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,100
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,000
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,500
It's over.

724
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,700
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,500
No!

726
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,700
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,300
Bobby!

728
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,500
What have I done?

729
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:10,600
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,200
Go.

731
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,500
Jean!

732
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,800
Jean!

733
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,300
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,500
You would die for them?

735
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,700
No, not for them.

736
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,900
For you.

737
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,900
For you.

738
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,000
Save me.

739
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,500
I love you.

740
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,500
You're back.

741
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,300
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
I had to.

743
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,400
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,900
It's what I want.

745
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,800
Hey.

746
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,000
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,800
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,100
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:46,400
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,400
human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,100
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,700
Morning.

754
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,800
Hello, Moira.

755
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,900
Charles.

756
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000

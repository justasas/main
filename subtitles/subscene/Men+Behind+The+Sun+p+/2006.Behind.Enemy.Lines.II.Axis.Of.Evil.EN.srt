<b>...showing what we can now say</b>
<b>with certainty...</b>

42

<b>...is a three-stage, Topol-class,</b>

<b>...at the Yongjiri Missile Center--</b>

<b>We're fortunate to acquire images...</b>

<b>North Korea had prior to this...</b>

<b>over Alaska.</b>

49
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,760

55

<b>We've always assumed that North Korea</b>
<b>would never deploy a missile like this...</b>

56
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,529

<b>and inevitable military response.</b>

57
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:27,035
<b>Even test-firing a three-stage rocket</b>
<b>is a 10-year leap in their capabilities...</b>

59

94
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,483
<b>A surgical strike on the missile site.</b>
<b>Multiple cruise missile launches...</b>

<b>lf it was any other sovereign nation, sir,</b>
<b>l'd urge negotiations...</b>

<b>...but DPRK, there is just no viable</b>
<b>diplomatic option.</b>

99
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,470
<b>And if they do test that missile...</b>

100
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,270
<b>...it devastates our footing</b>

101

00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:35,016
<b>Well, sir, l think Kim's people</b>

<b>l think the general overestimates</b>
<b>my skills of diplomacy, sir.</b>

106

<b><i>...using their 11,000 artillery tubes.</i></b>

115

<b>That's possible,</b>
<b>or a more proportional response...</b>

116
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:12,428
<b>...would be Scud missile attack</b>
<b>against the research center at Taejon.</b>

117
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:15,122
<b>The South Koreans respond</b>
<b>with a strike at the DMZ--</b>

<b>Or the Pyongyang nuclear facility.</b>

119
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:20,262
<b>And the North Koreans respond</b>
<b>with their artillery.</b>

120
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:23,430
<b>We bomb them,</b>
<b>they bomb their neighbors.</b>

<b>-...in the first 24 hours of hostilities.</b>
<b>-And we'd be at war.</b>

<b>...leaving from a U.S. military base</b>
<b>in South Korea?</b>

134

<b>...walk them through lncheon, put them</b>
<b>on a commercial airliner and take off.</b>

<b>North Korea would have no grounds</b>

144
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,224

<b>Even though it wouldn't be</b>

301
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:25,451
<b>That is an actual, live,</b>

<b>What's more disturbing,</b>
<b>Mr. President...</b>

303
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,998
<b>...is they seem to be fueling this missile</b>
<b>to its highest alert level.</b>

304
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:35,434

<b>-And then how much time do we--</b>
<b>-Thirty minutes.</b>

306

309

<b>lt is for this reason the U.S. Navy</b>

00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:01,342

00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:32,705
<b>Flyboys will handle this.</b>

452
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:34,908
<b>Return to your staging area.</b>

453
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,109
<b>Sir!</b>

454
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:30,856
<b>Shultiess, you get the computer</b>
<b>and bring up a sat image of the area.</b>

455
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:34,526
<b>There's a village about a half klick</b>
<b>down the hill, wasn't on this map.</b>

456
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,604
<b>Of course there is.</b>

457
00:31:57,427 --> 00:31:59,895
<b>Nightfall, we move</b>
<b>to the top of these mountains...</b>

458
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:01,928
<b>...and then east into this area here.</b>

459
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:04,658
<b>lt's more remote</b>
<b>but it's closer to the missile site.</b>

460
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:08,566
<b>Probably gonna ask us to do BDA</b>
<b>so we might as well dig in near the site.</b>

461
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:12,071
<b>Hey, LT, look, all due respect...</b>

462
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:15,905
<b>...l didn't risk a court-martial</b>
<b>to do bomb-damage assessment...</b>

463
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,571
<b>...for a bunch of faggot-ass</b>
<b>F-117 flyboys.</b>

464
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:22,684
<b>Let's just go find that missile site</b>
<b>and blow its ass up.</b>

465
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,320
<b>You done?</b>

466
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,374
<b>Bobby, he saw us. What should we do?</b>

467
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:10,416
<b>-l got it!</b>
<b>-Check the window!</b>

468
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:12,561
<b>-Who else is here?</b>
<b>-l got her!</b>

469
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,429
<b>Cover that window! Just shut up!</b>

470
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:20,625
<b>Shut her up.</b>

471
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,373
<b>-Neil, grab them!</b>
<b>-l got it!</b>

472
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,247
<b>Bobby, get out of there!</b>

473
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,110
<b>Shultiess! Meideros! On me.</b>

474
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:01,777
<b>Neil, let's go! Come on!</b>

475
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:39,545
<b>Meideros, get us restocked!</b>

476
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:42,149
<b>Shultiess, check our six.</b>

477
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:45,617
<b>Fucker shot me right in my Kevlar.</b>

478
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:49,154
<b>Seeing how we're compromised...</b>

479
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:53,421
<b>-...can't we call in for an exfiltration?</b>
<b>-Negative on that. We're on our own.</b>

480
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,469
<b>This way is no good. Cliffs.</b>

481
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:05,866
<b>Right, we're gonna have to</b>
<b>turn around, take the fight to them.</b>

482
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,004
<b>Gonna leapfrog in pairs.</b>
<b>Meideros, with me.</b>

483
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:10,543
<b>Got you.</b>

484
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,649
<b>No different than live-fire exercise,</b>
<b>San Clemente.</b>

485
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,377
<b>Hey, the radio-frequency charts</b>
<b>are in my right thigh pocket, okay?</b>

486
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:19,215
<b>All the instructions are there too.</b>

487
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,051
<b>And l expect you to hand</b>

<b>On your command.</b>

<b>Let's go to work.</b>

<b>Come on, kid.</b>

491

<b>Bobby! How's your guy!</b>

496
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:16,124
<b>Bobby, man down!</b>

<b>Stay with me, Shultiess.</b>
<b>Stay with me.</b>

<b>Our Father, who art in heaven.</b>

<b>-Mr. Ambassador.</b>
<b>-Mr. President.</b>

<b>-l thought--</b>
<b>-Mr. President, wars are started...</b>

508
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:40,975
<b>...over misunderstandings.</b>

509
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:42,475
<b>-l don't quite--</b>
<b>-Wars.</b>

510
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:46,042
<b>This will be on South Korea's soil.</b>

511
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:50,318
<b>Your <i>USS Ronald Reagan</i></b>
<b>has made way to the Sea of Japan.</b>

512
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,978
<b>And your destroyer, the <i>USS Lassen,</i></b>
<b>is on course to the Yellow Sea.</b>

513
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:58,054
<b>You don't think North Korea could</b>
<b>misconstrue your actions...</b>

514
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:00,821
<b>...as a provocation</b>
<b>towards engagement?</b>

515
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,891
<b>-l wouldn't confuse--</b>
<b>-From your ships' movements...</b>

516
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:07,059
<b>...l assume you have seen the missile.</b>

517
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:11,936
<b>Your Navy SEALs were captured...</b>

518
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:16,015
<b>...by the DPRK Fifth Regiment</b>
<b>in Kimhyongjik.</b>

519

<b>l should say, two captured.</b>

520
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:23,518
<b>Two of your men were killed.</b>

521
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,321
<b>How did you get these?</b>

522
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:31,090
<b>Your government spends</b>
<b>billions of dollars on your satellites...</b>

523
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:35,429
<b>...all to avoid putting human intelligence</b>
<b>inside hostile territory.</b>

524
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:38,163
<b>These photos came from one soldier...</b>

525
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,797
<b>...with a $3000 camera</b>
<b>connected to a satellite phone.</b>

526
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,500
<b>They were taken four hours ago.</b>

527
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:46,647
<b>We discovered the missile</b>
<b>at Yongjiri 10 days ago.</b>

528
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,942
<b>And we've been watching them</b>
<b>assemble it in the caves.</b>

529
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,712
<b>Our Special Operations</b>
<b>Task Force 121 infiltrated the area.</b>

530
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:57,355
<b>We were wondering when you</b>
<b>were going to discover it.</b>

531
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,287
<b>Were you ever planning</b>
<b>on telling us about this grave threat?</b>

532
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:04,158
<b>Mr. Ambassador, when we</b>
<b>first discovered the missile...</b>

533
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:07,630
<b>...we had hopes for a preemptive,</b>
<b>special operations mission.</b>

534
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,896
<b>-lt required the utmost secrecy--</b>
<b>-Your mission was compromised.</b>

535
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:12,630
<b>Yes.</b>

536
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,071
<b>lt was an act of war</b>
<b>against the DPRK.</b>

537
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,838
<b>-We felt that we could--</b>
<b>-Retaliation will be against my country.</b>

538
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:27,052
<b>-How could you have such--?</b>
<b>-We're trying to preserve a fragile peace.</b>

539
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,088
<b>By attacking a sovereign country?</b>

540
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:33,686
<b>Your administration has always</b>
<b>preached regime change...</b>

541
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,988
<b>...and now you see</b>
<b>the chance to affect it.</b>

542
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:40,224
<b>All that stands in the way are the many</b>
<b>hundreds of thousands of lives...</b>

543
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,063
<b>...Korean lives,</b>
<b>that will be lost in the process.</b>

544
00:43:43,237 --> 00:43:47,173
<b>-lt won't be hundreds of thousands.</b>
<b>-That will be all, general.</b>

545
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:51,000
<b>And should you succeed, what then?</b>

546
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,908
<b>-We have no plans for--</b>
<b>-Twenty-three million...</b>

547
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,845
<b>...hungry North Koreans.</b>
<b>Where do they go?</b>

548
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,212
<b>New York? Philadelphia?</b>

549
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,285
<b>They come to Seoul.</b>

550
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:04,514
<b>They come to Seoul</b>
<b>like East Germany went to Berlin.</b>

551
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:07,422
<b>They come to Seoul</b>
<b>and destroy our economy.</b>

552
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:09,357
<b>We are not ready for this.</b>

553
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,555
<b>We did not ask for this.</b>

554
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:16,703
<b>And you. Now you give us no choice</b>
<b>but this? What of China's reactions?</b>

555
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:19,806
<b>Japan's? The United Nations'?</b>
<b>The world's reactions?</b>

556
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,599
<b>Mr. Ambassador, we assure you...</b>

557
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,073
<b>...there'll be no further</b>
<b>military action conducted...</b>

558
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,373
<b>...until South Korea</b>
<b>and the United States see eye to eye.</b>

559
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:28,879
<b>That's right.</b>

560
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:33,584
<b>Then turn your ships around.</b>

<b>-Sir?</b>

<b>-Five, ten thousand, sir.</b>

<b>Sir, it is what it is.</b>
<b>And these are good numbers.</b>

569

<b>We factored that in, sir.</b>

00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:19,558
<b>He said, ''lf you are Navy,</b>
<b>then where is your boat?''</b>

611
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:21,795
<b>Funny, huh?</b>

612
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:27,066
<b>We have a real problem, you and me.</b>

613
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,913
<b>You see, America sees two Koreas:</b>

614
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,175
<b>North and South.</b>

615
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,836
<b>l apologize, lieutenant.</b>
<b>That must be very painful.</b>

616
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,515
<b>Hwang here is very excited.</b>

617
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:18,487
<b>Delivering American soldiers</b>
<b>to our dear leader...</b>

618
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:20,853
<b>...would bring him</b>
<b>and his men great rewards.</b>

619
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:24,691
<b>Enough pork and beef for perhaps</b>
<b>two months, maybe even more.</b>

620
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:28,824
<b>Maybe a letter of commendation</b>
<b>from our dear leader.</b>

621
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:41,539
<b>You see, Hwang here, he wants me</b>
<b>to radio my commanders...</b>

622
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,581
<b>...to tell them</b>
<b>about his great discovery.</b>

623
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:51,215
<b>You see, America sees two Koreas.</b>

624
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:53,325
<b>We see only one.</b>

625
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:57,555
<b>We call her the</b>
<b>''Land of the Morning Calm.''</b>

626
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,438
<b>Our dear leader tells us...</b>

627
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:09,474
<b>...soon we will reunify</b>
<b>under his great command.</b>

628
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:14,514
<b>So we wait and prepare for this day.</b>

629
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,172
<b>Yeah, well, that's never</b>
<b>gonna happen.</b>

630
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:19,681
<b>-No?</b>
<b>-No.</b>

631
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,545
<b>Maybe you are right.</b>

632
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,521
<b>Maybe you and l are not so different.</b>

633
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,258
<b>Yeah, well, your leader,</b>
<b>he's fucking crazy.</b>

634
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:40,063
<b>ln my country, we are killed</b>
<b>for saying such things about our leaders.</b>

635
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,936
<b>Yeah, well, in mine,</b>
<b>it's pretty much national sport.</b>

636
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,203
<b>l am afraid that if our dear leader...</b>

637
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,142
<b>...finds that there are Navy SEALs</b>
<b>in the DPRK...</b>

638
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:53,280
<b>...that would give him</b>
<b>enough reason for the reunification.</b>

639
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,112
<b>Well, that'd be really stupid.</b>

640
00:52:56,023 --> 00:52:58,048
<b>l think so too.</b>

641
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:01,050
<b>l am afraid</b>
<b>that our dear leader thinks...</b>

642
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,253
<b>...that we are more powerful</b>
<b>than we really are.</b>

643
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:09,426
<b>l think people are afraid to tell him</b>
<b>how hungry his soldiers are...</b>

644
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,163
<b>...how old his equipment is.</b>

645
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,606
<b>-So?</b>
<b>-So l think it is better...</b>

646
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,906
<b>...that you die here</b>
<b>without our dear leader ever knowing.</b>

647
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,440
<b>Don't you think so?</b>

648
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:39,565
<b>l told him to tell the villagers</b>
<b>to say nothing about ever seeing you.</b>

649
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:42,699
<b>Better, no?</b>

650
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:47,635
<b>You see, l am a good <i>chingu.</i></b>

651
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,174
<b>Do you know what <i>chingu</i> means?</b>

652
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:52,036
<b>Friends.</b>

653
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:55,943
<b>Friends with common interests.</b>

654
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:01,979
<b>We go to my command.</b>

655
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,646
<b>There you will tell me</b>
<b>what l need to know.</b>

656
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,223
<b>Why haven't we heard</b>
<b>from the North Koreans?</b>

657
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,028
<b>They may still be deciding</b>
<b>what to ask for.</b>

658
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:17,898
<b>Been no increased military activity.</b>

659
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:20,972
<b>Not at Yongjiri,</b>
<b>DMZ, Yongbyon, nothing.</b>

660
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:24,474
<b>Likely they're looking for the dear leader.</b>
<b>Goes missing from time to time.</b>

661
00:54:24,644 --> 00:54:26,578
<b>-Mr. President?</b>
<b>-You've spoken to them?</b>

662
00:54:26,747 --> 00:54:28,078
<b>-Yeah.</b>
<b>-So?</b>

663
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,375
<b>So here's what</b>
<b>the South Koreans are saying:</b>

664
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,576
<b>lf we execute the surgical strike</b>
<b>at the missile site...</b>

665
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:37,246
<b>...they believe the DPRK</b>
<b>will retaliate with artillery...</b>

666
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:38,982
<b>...and their damage estimates...</b>

667
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:41,354
<b>...are far greater</b>
<b>than the Pentagon estimates.</b>

668
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,995
<b>As high as 1 million dead.</b>

669
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,893
<b>-They're utterly misguided, they--</b>
<b>-Hold on, general.</b>

670
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:48,261
<b>What do they suggest?</b>

671
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:52,402
<b>l'll let the general</b>
<b>take you through it, sir.</b>

672
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,699
<b>Sir, l'd like to say up front</b>
<b>we had this scenario ourselves.</b>

673
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,037
<b>We didn't think you'd</b>
<b>abide our suggesting it.</b>

674
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,942
<b>Truth is, sir, in terms of Allied</b>
<b>casualty projections....</b>

675
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:04,117
<b>Well, they're extremely positive, sir.</b>

676
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:07,378
<b>-Well, let's here the plan, general.</b>
<b>-Admiral?</b>

677
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:11,221
<b>Well, sir, it starts</b>
<b>with an absolute Naval blockade...</b>

678
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,416
<b>...along the 37th parallel.</b>

679
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:16,960
<b>We're prepared to affect that</b>
<b>any time tomorrow after 1200 hours.</b>

680
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,893
<b>And then, Mr. President, the plan...</b>

681
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,160
<b>...calls for a combined</b>
<b>ROK-U.S., preemptive, first strike.</b>

682
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,565
<b>A sudden, massive</b>
<b>and overwhelming barrage...</b>

683
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:27,239
<b>...along the entire DPRK line.</b>

684
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:30,433
<b>Artillery, air bases,</b>
<b>supply depots, army bases.</b>

685
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:34,738
<b>Get half the forces while they're asleep.</b>
<b>Keep their MiGs from ever taking off.</b>

686
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:38,282
<b>Another 20 percent of ground force</b>
<b>as they're approaching their tubes.</b>

687
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:41,717
<b>Any tubes we missed in the first</b>
<b>cruise strikes and F-117 runs...</b>

688
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,789
<b>...the South Koreans have</b>
<b>Patriot batteries along the line.</b>

689
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:49,093
<b>Second wave of sorties 90 minutes later</b>
<b>would end threat of artillery altogether.</b>

690
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,398
<b>We would make the missile sites...</b>

691
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:56,127
<b>...and the nuclear research facilities</b>
<b>secondary and tertiary targets.</b>

692
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:59,500
<b>Ellie, this is what</b>
<b>the South Koreans proposed?</b>

693
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:01,606
<b>lf it's this or a surgical strike...</b>

694
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:05,801
<b>...which would leave the North Koreans</b>
<b>capable of a full-strength retaliation...</b>

695
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:09,142
<b>...then, yes, they prefer</b>
<b>a preemptive attack.</b>

696
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:12,479
<b>lt's a provocative strategy,</b>
<b>sir, no question.</b>

697
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:15,815
<b>But, well, the Allied</b>
<b>casualty projections...</b>

698
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,081
<b>-...are the real draw.</b>
<b>-What are they?</b>

699
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:21,592
<b>We could reasonably project</b>
<b>total Allied casualties--</b>

700
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,752
<b>Combined U.S.</b>
<b>and South Korean total dead.</b>

701
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:26,432
<b>--one to three thousand.</b>

702
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,831
<b>lt would all be over</b>
<b>in a matter of hours, sir.</b>

703
00:56:33,173 --> 00:56:35,869
<b>General, what are the enemy</b>
<b>casualty projections?</b>

704
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,667
<b>Sir...</b>

705
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:43,111
<b>...l truly believe our response is justified</b>
<b>by North Korea deploying nuclear lCBM.</b>

706
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,477
<b>What are the projections, general?</b>

707
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:48,953
<b>Somewhere between 350</b>
<b>and 500 thousand dead...</b>

708
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:50,612
<b>...sir.</b>

709
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,052
<b>Yeah.</b>

710
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,786
<b>Cam, Ellie, my office. Right now.</b>

711
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,035
<b>This thing is totally out of hand!</b>

712
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:17,513
<b>Vance has been pushing Armageddon</b>
<b>since the beginning!</b>

713
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:22,347
<b>Oh, excuse me.</b>
<b>l've gotta use the head.</b>

714
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:27,816
<b>You know what l love most</b>
<b>about the Navy, Mr. President?</b>

715
00:57:29,396 --> 00:57:30,727
<b>What is that?</b>

716
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,499
<b>The boats go real slow.</b>

717
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,152
<b>Mr. Ambassador...</b>

718
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:10,625
<b>...this proposal,</b>
<b>this surprise attack, it's....</b>

719
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:14,031
<b>Does this represent the wishes</b>
<b>of your government?</b>

720
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,832
<b>Mr. President, 3.5 million</b>
<b>North Koreans...</b>

721
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,531
<b>...have died from starvation</b>
<b>in the last three years.</b>

722
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:26,805
<b>What has your nation done</b>
<b>to grieve these deaths?</b>

723
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,708
<b>-The casualties, the enemy casualties--</b>
<b>-Mr. President...</b>

724
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:35,046
<b>...you give us only evils</b>
<b>to choose from.</b>

<b>Come, come, come.</b>
<b>l want to show you something.</b>

<b><i>...but later reversed themselves...</i></b>

1003

1013

1014
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,612

1015
01:32:56,788 --> 01:33:00,485
<b>...that they were doing some demolition</b>
<b>work for a hydroelectric project...</b>

1016

1018

<b><i>...they had been taken</i></b>

<b><i>...about 100 kilometers</i></b>

1022
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:24,014
<b><i>Today, the story</i></b>

1023
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:28,983
<b><i>...as the South Korean Vice Minister</i></b>
<b><i>of Reunification, Rhee-bong Jo...</i></b>

01:33:29,153 --> 01:33:33,021
<b><i>...released a statement claiming</i></b>
<b><i>that there was no explosion...</i></b>

1025
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:38,493
<b><i>...stating the supposed mushroom cloud</i></b>
<b><i>was a natural cloud formation.</i></b>

1026
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:43,191
<b><i>Perhaps the most troubling theory</i></b>
<b><i>put forth to explain the large cloud...</i></b>

1027
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:47,201
<b><i>...is that a foreign state may have</i></b>

1028
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:51,171
<b><i>...to conduct a clandestine</i></b>
<b><i>military operation.</i></b>

1029
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:55,108
<b><i>This theory took on greater potential</i></b>
<b><i>for being accurate...</i></b>

1030
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:57,110
<b><i>...when it was discovered today...</i></b>

00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>The Cincinnati Accord has brought
a cease-fire to Bosnia.</i>

3
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>And it appears to be holding.
NATO forces have begun withdrawal...</i>

4
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>...which should be complete
by New Year's Day...</i>

5
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>...close to the president's
"Home by the Holidays" pledge.</i>

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>Yet as the conflict winds down,
the U.S. military remains at readiness...</i>

7
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>...eager to answer the call.</i>

8
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye.</i>

9
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:49,860
<i>Unknown rider not responding.
Unclassified bandit. Launch the alert.</i>

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,998
<i>Let's move it. We need
this craft airborne in five minutes.</i>

11
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,556
- Nose. Radome.
- Check. Secure.

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,058
- Diffuser.
- Clear.

13
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,310
- Right, left intake.
- Check.

14
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,812
- Ejection seat is safe.
- Copy.

15
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,649
- Comm, IFF.
- Up and up. Let's go.

16
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,401
- DDI, MPCD and HUD.
- Go flight.

17
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,363
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- It's green across the board.

18
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,199
- Okay for start.
- Copy.

19
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,577
- Right throttle, 15 percent.
- Copy. Go for two.

20
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,871
Two is up. Turbine is online.

21
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,374
Copy, nozzle coming to 73 percent.

22
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,876
- Good to go.
- Copy.

23
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,213
That's a NATO bird.
Stand it down.

24
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Abort, abort.</i>

25
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,844
- That's bullshit!
- Come on. Are you kidding me?

26
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>Abort. Launch is canceled.</i>

27
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,890
Come on. That's twice today.

28
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,687
Yeah, we're wound up tight today.
That's the price of peace.

29
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,691
I cannot wait for this shit to be done.

30
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,402
Oh, man.

31
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,531
Four more days.

32
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,538
You know what I read?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

33
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,876
He needs someone to fly his jets.
We ought to fly for him.

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,920
I bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

35
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,133
Or fly for a rock star.
Those guys need good pilots.

36
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:41,263
Every day we lose a band to some
shitty hack they got flying for them.

37
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:46,977
A Navy pilot could have saved Ritchie
Valens from being a one-hit wonder.

38
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,356
That kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly.

39
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,736
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

40
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:08,499
Let me ask you something.
How fast are we headed into the wind?

41
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:14,046
Chris, we're on alert. Reigart wanders
up to the tower, we're dead.

42
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,256
All right, let's do it.

43
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,092
That's the spirit.

44
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,392
- Rutherford, right here.
- Incoming!

45
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,271
You guys ready for
a little lesson in physics?

46
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,608
I'm gonna take your money this week.

47
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,402
Wind's blowing up a gale.

48
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,947
I'll bet you $20 each I catch it.

49
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,783
You'll lose a finger along with that 20.

50
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,117
This one?

51
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,455
All right. Always happy
to take an officer's money.

52
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,992
Look! It's coming back!

53
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,702
Man, that is awesome!

54
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,371
Watch out for the catwalk!

55
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,958
I got it!

56
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,514
Wilson!

57
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:56,023
<i>On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot 6. Spot 6.</i>

58
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,210
A lot of sorties for action
that's winding down, Leslie.

59
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm trying to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

60
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:25,219
You know it's important your pilots
don't stray from agreed flight zones?

61
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,556
- This treaty is fragile.
- Routes will be flown as ordered.

62
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,518
The treaty depends on it.

63
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,855
Aernout Van Lynden.
He's with Sky News.

64
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,776
- What's this?
- I invited him to report on us.

65
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,447
Give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.

66
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:50,077
I find the press to be intrusive.
It inspires showing off.

67
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,246
What's so funny?

68
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,542
You, admiral.
You're just what the conflict needs.

69
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,046
- An uncomplicated man.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

70
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,761
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the...?

71
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,098
Lookit here. Stackhouse.
I know that's not Burnett.

72
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,101
Captain, good to see you.

73
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,644
Look at you.

74
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,438
- You guys back?
- You know the routine.

75
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,776
Finished in Sarajevo.
Your admiral wanted us to pump you up.

76
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,320
Sounds like Reigart. Be prepared.

77
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,449
Better to be prepared than
caught sleeping in the field.

78
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,452
Don't forget what you're doing here.

79
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,123
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

80
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,210
Well, I'm eating Jell-O.
He's wiping his hands.

81
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,965
Everybody has a role to play.

82
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,594
I'm a Marine. We take care
of the serious business.

83
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,974
You, you're a Navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

84
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,519
You don't pick your fight.
It comes to you.

85
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,733
I get it. But at least give me
a fight I can understand.

86
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,321
Vukovar? Where did we fly
over the other day? Sreb--?

87
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,323
Srebrenica.

88
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,825
Good luck explaining to someone:

89
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,536
"Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people.

90
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,831
No, it's switched around.
Now we're helping--"

91
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,501
I mean, it's like a joke.

92
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,506
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah, I am.

93
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,345
Look at these guys.

94
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,644
That's what I'm talking about.

95
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:44,107
Everybody thinks they'll get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face.

96
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,236
Those days are over.
They are long gone.

97
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,863
I used to think I'd get to do it.

98
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,658
Now I'm eating Jell-O.
Are you gonna eat that?

99
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:57,621
- First you complain, now you want it.
- Lieutenant Burnett.

100
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,958
Admiral Reigart wants
to see you immediately.

101
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,961
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

102
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,796
Thank you.

103
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,674
He wants to give you
his daughter's number.

104
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,845
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
They looked good.

105
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,473
- I don't know anything, lieutenant.
- That is cynical.

106
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,309
Southerners usually aren't cynical.

107
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,312
I compliment how great
your alma mater looks...

108
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,899
...and you think I'm pumping you.
What does he want?

109
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,068
You'll have to see, sir.

110
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,905
Come.

111
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,911
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

112
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,748
Lieutenant Burnett.

113
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,917
Sir, about the football--

114
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:48,714
I have your letter. You're interested
in leaving the Navy.

115
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,844
- I thought it might be time to move on.
- Move on to what?

116
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,888
Sir?

117
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:01,894
You're gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

118
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,731
You've had an interesting career.

119
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,360
I remember when you came onboard.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

120
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,197
- Thank you, sir.
- Then on September 23...

121
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,826
...you received a non-punitive
letter of caution...

122
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,872
...for disorderly behavior
at the Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

123
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,168
Another letter for something
involving Chinese New Year...

124
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:32,049
...at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.
One can only imagine what that was.

125
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,808
Just out of curiosity, lieutenant,
what happened to you?

126
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,854
Sir, I signed up to be
a fighter pilot, not a cop.

127
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:51,068
I certainly didn't want to be a cop
in a neighborhood no one cares about.

128
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,071
That and the routine wore me out.

129
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,657
- The routine?
- The routine.

130
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,327
What you don't know is
that the routine...

131
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,832
...the systems checks, the drills,
the maintaining of discipline...

132
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,292
...prepare you for war.

133
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,420
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

134
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,009
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay,
you're at war on this boat. Understand?

135
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:22,391
No, sir, I do not understand.
Why don't we act like we're at war?

136
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,562
As far as I can tell,
we go out, fly around and come back.

137
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:32,568
All we're doing is pretending because
we're not fighting. We're watching.

138
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,489
Be glad you're not. With your attitude
you wouldn't last long.

139
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:41,785
I've given the Navy seven years.
I think I've served my country.

140
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,914
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

141
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,252
You have two weeks remaining.

142
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,214
You'll serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

143
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,177
I'll keep your letter.

144
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,014
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

145
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,362
- You're dismissed, mister.
- Sir.

146
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,252
O'Malley said you quit. Bullshit, right?

147
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,963
Nope. He's telling the truth.

148
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,718
You're gonna break up the band, huh?
Oh, that's good.

149
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,555
Chris, I thought you were kidding
about getting out.

150
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,434
You saying I gotta find
another navigator?

151
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:52,356
I can't do it anymore.
I'm done. I'm sorry.

152
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:09,665
<i>All hands, an air contact believed to
have originated at the North Pole...</i>

153
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,961
<i>...has been spotted</i>
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

154
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,463
It's good to hear your voice.

155
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,133
They're taking care of us great.

156
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,136
Putting up tinsel, it's very Christmassy.

157
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,306
Don't wake her.
Tell her merry Christmas.

158
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:31,144
<i>-We're disappointed we won't see you.
- You may see a lot of me soon.</i>

159
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:35,357
We understand. You got important
things to do over there.

160
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,234
Dad, I gotta go.

161
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,279
- We're very proud of you.
<i>-Dad, I gotta go.</i>

162
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,156
- All right, I love you.
<i>-Bye.</i>

163
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:55,043
Son of a bitch! He put us on
the holiday mission. Goddamn it!

164
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,504
Well, at least we get to fly.

165
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,675
During the one good meal.
It's like he doesn't like us.

166
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,219
No. You, not me. You.

167
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:08,015
<i>Merry Christmas.
On the flight deck, it's showtime.</i>

168
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:13,187
<i>Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.</i>

169
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:44,218
Wouldn't it be great to see Britney Spears?
She wants to fly the plane!

170
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,930
"Just move the stick there.
You're doing great."

171
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:37,604
<i>The Cincinnati Accord verifies Serbia's
commitment to peace in Yugoslavia.</i>

172
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,164
<i>I welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.</i>

173
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,396
Coordinates 3-0-1-5-0-6.5...

174
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:23,275
...1-1-5-0 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.

175
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,862
- You sure about that?
- Reading it right here, pal.

176
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,488
Yeah, well....

177
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,287
The Serbs must've bought some U-boats
because we're over a lake.

178
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,667
Goddamn it.

179
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:46,507
And a warm thank-you goes out
to the U.S. intelligence community.

180
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:56,016
Another useless joyride at the cost
of millions to the U.S. taxpayer.

181
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,937
Hang on. Showing activity
in 4-Alpha to our left.

182
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,689
Must be in that forested area.

183
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:07,694
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

184
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:11,823
I know, but the scope doesn't lie.
There it is. Check it out.

185
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,244
We're not supposed
to fly that section, Chris.

186
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,330
We're on recon,
so let's recon something.

187
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,834
Stack, it's probably
some locals fooling around.

188
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,546
An opportunity to test
our shiny, new digital camera.

189
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,383
Why do I listen to you?
All right, let's do it.

190
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,599
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

191
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,435
Steady at 0-3-4 and fly the director.

192
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:50,279
- IDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

193
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,074
On condition. Stand by for roll. Now.

194
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,164
Rolling digital.

195
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,719
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

196
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,231
- Won't you miss all this excitement?
- Absolutely.

197
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,000
- What is it?
- Holy shit, we're being painted!

198
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,627
What?

199
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,426
- Shit, they fired! Scoop it now!
- Copy.

200
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,221
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

201
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,014
I see a missile.

202
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:45,686
- I don't see it. Call my turn.
- Just slice left. Hard.

203
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,980
Jesus Christ.

204
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,107
Where is it?

205
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,900
Reverse right!

206
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,696
Try to break the lock!

207
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,040
Golden Eagle, Ark Angel.
We have been engaged.

208
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,795
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy. Hang on!

209
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,382
- No joy!
- Where is it, goddamn it? Where is it?

210
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,760
- Can't see shit.
- Where is he?

211
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:32,482
Jesus Christ, second missile!
Three miles and closing! Pull up!

212
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,902
I got him, I got him!

213
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,290
We need a bigger heat decoy.

214
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,258
We're screwed!

215
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,260
Missile's closing.

216
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,430
2.8. 1.8. One mile!

217
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,100
Drop those fuel tanks and pull up!

218
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,444
Good fireball!

219
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,656
Clear on top! Coming back down!

220
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:25,536
I got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

221
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,914
That's it! One down! Up we go!

222
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:36,296
- Where's the second?
- No joy. I don't have it in sight.

223
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,175
- He's back on us. Push over.
- Copy!

224
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,345
Hard left!

225
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,348
I'm going for a pass!

226
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,434
Here he comes! Head-on! Right side!

227
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,523
He clipped part of the tail!
Controls going to shit!

228
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,026
<i>-Warning, warning.</i>
- Where is it?

229
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,739
He's coming back. Arcing right.
Break right!

230
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,826
I got no turn left. The controls are shot!

231
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,162
No, break right!

232
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,380
Shit!

233
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,310
Seat eject! Eject, eject!

234
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,124
Goddamn it!

235
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,798
- A hell of a party, sir.
- I really like Christmas.

236
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,303
Sir, we've lost a bird. An F-18, feet dry.

237
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:36,226
- Ark Angel 0-6.
- Burnett and Stackhouse.

238
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,897
Damn it, I put them on a holiday
mission. Beacon activity?

239
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,690
Not yet, admiral.

240
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,611
We have a flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

241
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,322
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

242
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,994
And the red is actual.

243
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,711
Lost contact is here.

244
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,173
They're off mission. What happened?

245
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,344
If they ejected, it'll be tough
to pick up a signal.

246
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,598
- The terrain is extremely rough.
- Weather's not helping.

247
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,184
Contact Admiral Piquet, alert NATO.

248
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:21,188
Make sure we have a flash op rep
out over all U.S. national circuits.

249
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,483
Get to Admiral Donnelly. No names.

250
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,401
No names, sir.

251
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,924
Stack! Stackhouse!

252
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,051
Stack!

253
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:54,304
Are you okay?

254
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,640
Yeah.

255
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,519
- Shit, man, you okay?
- I'm okay. You look terrible.

256
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:05,566
Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.
Let me see. Oh, man.

257
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:11,113
We gotta change this.
We need a new field dressing on this.

258
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,242
Shit. Squeeze right here.

259
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:25,252
So where are we, Mr. Navigator Man?

260
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:29,256
In the mountains north of Miciovic.

261
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,426
You think they saw us eject?

262
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:37,014
We are not gonna be around to find out.

263
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,934
Reigart will wonder
what happened to his plane.

264
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:45,105
I already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

265
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,026
You think it'll work up there?

266
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:52,404
Yeah. Just get high enough.

267
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,784
All right. All right, sit tight.

268
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,788
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

269
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:06,543
Listen, I should have dodged
that second missile.

270
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,422
Yeah, you blew it
and took me down with you.

271
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:14,676
I thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

272
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,472
- You're slipping. You need to watch it.
- Son of a bitch.

273
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,865
Oh, God.

274
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,013
Oh, shit.

275
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,722
Oh, goddamn it.

276
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,854
Son of a bitch!

277
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,757
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

278
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,427
Not bombing mission, right?

279
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,557
You photograph?

280
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,322
You alone?

281
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,033
Correct.

282
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,800
No!

283
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,087
Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel 06, over.

284
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:11,260
<i>Alpha Whiskey, this is Ark Angel 06,
over. Can you read me?</i>

285
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:15,264
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's interference.

286
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,349
The homing beacon.

287
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,810
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye, aye, sir.

288
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:24,481
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo. Alpha
Whiskey directs cease buzzer on 06.

289
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:39,288
<i>Alpha Whiskey, this is Ark Angel 06,
over. Do you read?</i>

290
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,542
06, this is Alpha Whiskey.
I read you. Go ahead.

291
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,840
Ark Angel is down. Ark Angel is down
and I am on the run.

292
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,926
<i>Slow down. What is your count?</i>

293
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,476
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

294
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,980
No names over the net.

295
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,774
Confirm your last.

296
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:14,281
Minus one confirmed.
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

297
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,953
A uniformed soldier killed
your flight officer?

298
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,956
No, I'm saying they executed him.

299
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:27,085
They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

300
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,673
Calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

301
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:36,720
- How soon can your team be ready?
- Say the word, and we'll saddle up.

302
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,307
06, consult your chart.

303
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,644
Reposition to rally point 3.

304
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:49,608
<i>I read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.</i>

305
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,778
We're coming.
Make your way to the rally point.

306
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,614
<i>-Understood?</i>
- 06 copies. Out.

307
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:01,078
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye, aye, sir.

308
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,831
I need a green light to get my boy.

309
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,894
Command comes from red fighter.

310
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,566
You'll have three slicks loaded with
rockets and guns at your disposal.

311
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,152
Use advisedly.

312
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,071
I want gimbal attachments
for fast ropers.

313
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:22,075
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

314
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,870
Come.

315
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,124
What's going on down there?

316
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:33,420
We have an F-18 down in Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

317
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,633
- Who authorized a search and rescue?
- I did.

318
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:41,261
Call it off. Stand down.

319
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:45,557
Maybe I wasn't clear.
We have pilots down, one probably dead.

320
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,186
I have spoken
to Bosnian military commanders.

321
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:53,565
They say that the shoot-down
was perpetrated by renegades...

322
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,068
...trying disrupt the peace process.

323
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,779
- Of course.
- They're also claiming...

324
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,741
...that your aircraft was
way off mission.

325
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,495
If we fly in there,
the whole treaty will collapse.

326
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:10,123
Burnett says that
Serb troops murdered his pilot.

327
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,501
Is your pilot a Bosnian expert?

328
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,630
Can he tell between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

329
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:20,926
Because I can't.
And I've been posted here for 5 years.

330
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,513
If he's in danger,
he should go to the safe zone.

331
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,975
That is what he's briefed
and trained to do.

332
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:33,272
I can have your fleet commander
order you to stand down...

333
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,024
...or you can do it yourself.

334
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,192
Alpha Whiskey, this is 06. Come in.

335
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,112
06, go ahead.

336
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,199
<i>06 is at rally point three
and standing by.</i>

337
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:53,245
06, latest intel says
your current location...

338
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,124
<i>...undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.</i>

339
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:00,252
Say again your last.
I am at the rendezvous point.

340
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,090
You need to hump to a safe zone.

341
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:09,261
I set IP Cadillac, Canada 1-5...

342
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:13,849
<i>...Virginia 2-0. Read back.</i>

343
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,322
No.

344
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,283
Negative. Negative.

345
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:35,829
<i>I do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable?</i>

346
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,834
I am good to go.
I say again, I am good to go now.

347
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,920
Burnett!

348
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:53,305
06, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

349
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:57,851
<i>You've been shot down.
Life is tough. I am very sorry.</i>

350
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:02,189
But you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

351
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:05,359
Create angles between
you and your pursuers.

352
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:09,822
Use your training. Evade and survive,
and we will bring you home.

353
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,449
Do you understand?

354
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,294
06.

355
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,715
06.

356
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,930
Someone's coming.

357
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,733
We lost the signal, sir.

358
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,987
- Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

359
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,130
We're tracking him in the SCIF, sir.

360
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,923
On me.

361
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,445
At ease.

362
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:44,958
Sir, we tracked the radio signal
to somewhere in this radius.

363
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:49,796
It's pretty far away. But we think
the transmission came from here.

364
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,592
<i>314 Recycle, pair it with the I-F.</i>

365
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:58,889
This is imagery from a satellite
downlinked at a center in Stuttgart.

366
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:03,852
We've hot-wired it for heat image
and it's streaming in now.

367
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,856
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

368
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:17,741
Here we go.

369
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,465
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,114
What's going on? He's down.

371
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,533
Has he been shot?

372
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:04,037
They're almost on him.

373
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:11,211
Son of a bitch.

374
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:16,091
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

375
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:18,135
They're right on him!

376
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,402
What are they doing?

377
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,896
What's going on?

378
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,829
Has he been killed?

379
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,048
He's moving. That's him.

380
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,515
Stay on it.
Resizing wide and broadband.

381
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,434
Stay with him.

382
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,311
Plug it in with NSA.

383
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,273
- What the hell's going on?
- The door's closing.

384
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,819
- Fix it, for chrissakes!
- We're down. It's cooked.

385
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:45,240
I want intel on this.
Who's chasing him and why? Understand?

386
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,367
Yes, sir.

387
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,276
Come.

388
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:27,449
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

389
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:33,372
- I was trying to motivate him, Tom.
- Sir?

390
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,875
Burnett, in the radio room.

391
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:41,463
I was trying to motivate him.

392
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:47,970
Maybe I carried it too far.
Called him by his name. Stupid.

393
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,515
Just human, sir.

394
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,062
- Tom.
- Sir.

395
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:03,277
It's why I push them so hard.
For times like these.

396
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:12,244
May I speak freely?

397
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:17,166
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

398
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:21,962
Sir, what are we doing?
Our guy's stuck and we're sitting here.

399
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:26,508
- It's a complicated situation.
- Why isn't this all over the news?

400
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:31,722
Why isn't the president talking with
Pale to make sure he gets out safe?

401
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,976
He was off mission. Piquet has a point.

402
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:39,021
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

403
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:45,486
This kid's no idiot. If he says
he's getting shot at, I believe him.

404
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,821
What do you expect me to do?

405
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:52,493
Command says I gotta sit on my hands.
What else can I do?

406
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:58,832
Right. I forgot. It's not your call.

407
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:02,419
You're damn right it's not my call!

408
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:09,801
Apologies, sir.
Of course you can't do anything.

409
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,774
<i>It's been confirmed to us
that a U.S. combat aircraft...</i>

410
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,693
<i>...has been shot down.</i>

411
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:13,115
<i>It was hit over Miciovic in Bosnia
at around 6:00 a.m. yesterday.</i>

412
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:17,035
<i>The pilot is feared dead,
but his navigator may have survived.</i>

413
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,245
It's your son.

414
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:22,708
<i>Names are withheld, pending
notification of their next of kin.</i>

415
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,794
<i>We still don't know
who shot the F-18 down.</i>

416
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,922
<i>The Serbs control
most of southern Bosnia.</i>

417
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,508
<i>They allege insurgents are to blame...</i>

418
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,970
<i>...and say they're doing everything
to locate the crew.</i>

419
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,681
<i>It's also unclear what,
if any, impact...</i>

420
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,267
<i>...this will have
on NATO's withdrawal.</i>

421
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,493
Admiral.

422
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:46,542
We've known each other
for how long? Five years?

423
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,002
Something like that.

424
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,756
I've always commended your work
to your superiors.

425
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:55,342
I've sent you information you needed.

426
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:58,011
Thank you. I appreciate your support.

427
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,098
And this is the thanks I get?

428
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:05,310
We have one disagreement,
and you stab me in the back?

429
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:09,731
You go to the media
and make me look like an asshole.

430
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:13,443
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

431
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:19,199
Our man is down behind enemy lines.
Now, what the fuck is the problem?

432
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,745
Do you know how much damage
this may cause to the peace process?

433
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:28,083
All I know is, the American people
want their pilot back.

434
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,710
Exactly!

435
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:34,214
Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

436
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:37,384
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

437
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:42,014
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

438
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:48,228
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

439
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:56,778
You might have helped save your man
today. And I emphasize "might."

440
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:01,658
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

441
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:39,858
Shit!

442
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,616
Oh, shit.

443
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:24,273
Alpha Whiskey, this is Ark Angel.

444
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:27,734
They have a signal. It's Burnett.

445
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:32,072
Ark Angel 06, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, 06.

446
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,701
<i>I'm on course
with your last instructions...</i>

447
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:43,792
<i>...and keyed up and waiting
for you to name the fairway.</i>

448
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,087
06, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doing, son?

449
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,340
I don't know. You tell me, sir.

450
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:54,845
<i>The hard bit's over. You need
to get yourself five klicks east...</i>

451
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,973
<i>...to the sweet spot. Understood?</i>

452
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,857
Roger. The spot's friendly?

453
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:09,026
<i>Good for birds?</i>

454
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:11,528
Affirmative. Spot is friendly.

455
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:15,157
You need to get there,
stay out of trouble...

456
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:19,328
...and big mother will pick you up.
Next contact at 1700.

457
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:21,288
Roger.

458
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,301
Alpha Whiskey?

459
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:37,638
Go ahead, 06.

460
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,939
<i>Sir, I shouldn't have left Stackhouse.</i>

461
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,027
Distract him.

462
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:57,407
06, your last transmission was garbled.
Let's talk about your gear.

463
01:00:57,616 --> 01:01:00,118
<i>How's it holding up?</i>

464
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,960
My gear's good. I have a basic pack.

465
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:11,088
<i>I left some of it at the crash site.</i>

466
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:16,844
I guess I got rattled
when I ejected at Mach 3.

467
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,224
You still got your boots, cowboy?

468
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:25,769
Roger. They were tied on.

469
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,815
You've got it made.

470
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:37,489
You're an optimist, sir.
I had you figured for a grouch.

471
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:45,789
Okay, 06. Just make it to the RP.

472
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:47,332
<i>Roger.</i>

473
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,293
Will you be there, sir?

474
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:52,629
That's affirmative, son. Out.

475
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,095
He's here.

476
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:02,806
Yes, sir. I suggest we place them here.

477
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:07,853
It's open ground near the town of Haè,
well inside the safe zone.

478
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:11,190
Let's go for the extraction.

479
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:53,190
Bridge command area responsibility:
Ingress will be north, egress south.

480
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:58,070
From the position of
the radio contacts, you see...

481
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,114
...he's circled back
towards the crash site.

482
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:05,744
Call sign is Avalanche.
Authenticate: Romeo 2, X-ray.

483
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:11,333
Continue, Bulldog. Delay, cycle.
Abort is wash down.

484
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:16,630
Aircraft down is Cobalt.
Success is Ripper.

485
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:19,758
- Captain, take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

486
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:26,265
Bravo will establish a security perimeter,
then return to the helo.

487
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:29,810
This is Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

488
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:31,311
My team is ready now.

489
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:35,357
- Get Admiral Donnelly on the line.
- I have spoken with him.

490
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:38,861
I have his full support.
You will stand down.

491
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,870
<i>Chris.</i>

492
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:40,232
Hold on, hold on!

493
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:16,518
You American?

494
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,819
9 mm?

495
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,740
- Yes.
- 9 mm.

496
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:10,781
- You have water?
- Water? No water.

497
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,460
Thanks.

498
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,052
It's good.

499
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:39,184
Ice Cube.

500
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:45,691
Yeah. I like Ice Cube.
I like all hip-hop, rap music.

501
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:50,154
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

502
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:06,044
That's good. That's good.

503
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,933
You know where we're going?

504
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,437
- Haè.
- Haè. That's good. Good.

505
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,828
Jesus Christ!

506
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,708
Tell him to go!

507
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:21,912
Come out! Come out! Here.

508
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:49,273
<i>Hey, bonjour.</i>

509
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:52,025
Come on, come on. Let's go.

510
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:55,529
Hold it, hold it.
I'm an American soldier--

511
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:57,739
Shut up.

512
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:05,289
- What were you bombing?
- We were taking photographs.

513
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:08,000
Photographs of what? Of what?

514
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:11,378
Lokar is coming back again,
killing everyone.

515
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,715
It's true. He killed everyone.
Children, women.

516
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:19,428
- Buried them in the hills.
- Yes, I saw them. I saw the graves.

517
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:25,184
I saw them. I saw the bodies in the hills.

518
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:28,687
Tell him I am an American.
I am on your side.

519
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:34,735
Then you go outside. Tell them you're
American. They don't kill Americans.

520
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:39,698
Ice Cube, get over here.
Tell him we have pictures that can help--

521
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,074
Bullshit!

522
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:46,580
America say they make them sign deal.

523
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:55,047
But they already break it.
America government for shit! Now go!

524
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:43,126
Ice, hey. It's okay! It's me.

525
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,963
Come on. Come on.

526
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:03,021
- Time?
- Three minutes, sir.

527
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,408
Stop!

528
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,382
Let's go.

529
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:54,781
Reigart.

530
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:58,994
<i>Leslie, I'm afraid there's bad news.</i>

531
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:04,166
<i>Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Haè.</i>

532
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:12,216
<i>I regret to inform you that
Lieutenant Burnett is dead. I'm sorry.</i>

533
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:14,301
Thank you.

534
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:27,856
<i>It was a peace deal.
Haè was meant to be a safe haven.</i>

535
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,984
<i>Once again, that's proved an illusion.</i>

536
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:34,196
<i>In the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave...</i>

537
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:39,076
<i>...Bosnian-Serb forces said they found
the body of American navigator...</i>

538
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:43,580
<i>...Lt. Chris Burnett, whose plane
was shot down two days ago.</i>

539
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:49,586
<i>Serb authorities claim
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas...</i>

540
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:54,508
<i>...opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.</i>

541
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:57,928
<i>Serbs say one of their teams
found the body...</i>

542
01:17:58,137 --> 01:18:02,850
<i>...in a search and rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down.</i>

543
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:07,271
<i>This is bound to spoil NATO's hope
of a clean exit from the Balkans...</i>

544
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:12,651
<i>...and frustrates U.S. leaders
who are near to a complete withdrawal.</i>

545
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,655
<i>For NATO forces on the eve
of departure from this region...</i>

546
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:22,161
<i>...Burnett's death comes as another
blow at the end of a disturbing...</i>

547
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:26,582
<i>...and ultimately unsuccessful chapter
in the alliance's history.</i>

548
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:38,093
<i>Savior Six, from Gold Eagle command,
the package is not in position.</i>

549
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:41,513
<i>Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.</i>

550
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:57,613
Hey! Wait for me!

551
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:11,752
Hey! Come on! Fuck!

552
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,672
Damn it! We're right here!

553
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:19,134
You've got to be shitting me!

554
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:35,359
Son of a bitch! They killed him!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

555
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:38,904
We did nothing.

556
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,932
We're right here.

557
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:09,184
We're right....

558
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,773
What's that?

559
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:13,832
It's not safe here. We keep going.

560
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,752
No. You go.

561
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:27,387
They killed my pilot because
we took pictures of the graves.

562
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:30,682
I know where they are.
And I'm gonna get them.

563
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,976
So he didn't die for no reason.

564
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:46,073
Don't follow me. You'll be safer here.

565
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:06,922
Shit.

566
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,342
Goddamn. Why is this off?

567
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:15,472
Why is this off? Why is this...?

568
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,671
Come on.

569
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:51,884
Come on! Goddamn it!

570
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:59,349
All right. Okay, come on.

571
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:02,019
Yeah!

572
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:14,573
<i>For the information of all hands:
this ship will be relieved on station.</i>

573
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:19,244
<i>It will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.</i>

574
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:36,762
Sir, your presence is requested
in the SCIF.

575
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,263
All right.

576
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:43,310
It's the homing beacon
on the second ejection seat.

577
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:46,230
It can only be reactivated
from the seat.

578
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,941
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

579
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:54,154
You've gotta be very familiar with
our systems to reactivate that beacon.

580
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,740
- That's Burnett.
- It could be a setup.

581
01:25:56,907 --> 01:26:00,577
It's a radio transmission.
They're hearing the same music.

582
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:02,037
Sir, I agree.

583
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:08,085
We should notify NATO or contact
Donnelly for clearance before launch.

584
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:14,049
- Of course, that will take time.
- Tom, I get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

585
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:17,344
Piquet was very clear
with his objections.

586
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:19,555
- You'll lose your command.
- So be it!

587
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:24,393
I won't let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

588
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:58,237
Okay. All right.

589
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,579
Goddamn it!

590
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:47,119
Gentlemen, I want to make
one thing clear before we leave.

591
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:51,331
I intend to put you in harm's way.

592
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:55,502
Any man who doesn't wish
to join this mission...

593
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:58,172
...step away right now.

594
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:10,434
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

595
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:28,864
Two klicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

596
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:55,761
There he is. There he is.

597
01:34:13,987 --> 01:34:18,242
Come on, come on! Damn it!
What the hell is he waiting for?

598
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:24,373
Come on!

599
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:36,135
Come on! Come on, kid!

600
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:44,059
Too hot to set down.

601
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:46,228
- Going around.
- Roger.

602
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:11,712
Goddamn it!

603
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:26,059
Come on!

604
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:51,376
- Go!
- Captain. Fast rope, go get him.

605
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:53,712
He's on the right.

606
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:06,433
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

607
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,769
Come on, son! Come on!

608
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:16,485
Go!

609
01:36:34,628 --> 01:36:37,631
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

610
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:14,042
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Glenn.

611
01:37:14,251 --> 01:37:15,836
Admiral.

612
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:24,970
This is why they killed Stackhouse!

613
01:37:32,478 --> 01:37:38,567
Admiral, you're holding a letter for me.
I'd like to get it back.

614
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:41,361
I think I can find it.

1
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:12,135
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,536
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:19,207
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:23,201
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,755
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,162
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,812
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:35,592
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,492
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:42,049
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,930
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,296
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:50,533
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,312
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,713
Of course.

16
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,267
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,778
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:25,320
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:28,867
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:32,135
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,193
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,049
Oh, Charles.

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,121
I like this one.

24
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,659
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:03,367
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,100
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,920
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,363
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,883
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,992
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,294
One second!

32
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:48,360
Open this door.

33
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,118
Warren.

34
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,794
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,147
Oh, God.

36
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:12,870
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,466
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:43,688
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,500
Bobby!

40
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:03,049
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:13,800
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,893
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,176
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,933
Logan.

45
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,279
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,834
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:36,549
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,586
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,855
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,573
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,731
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,721
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,084
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,942
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:23,043
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:26,115
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,864
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,890
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,152
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:56,551
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,952
Scott. Scott.

62
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,058
Scott.

63
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,265
Scott.

64
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,311
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,795
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,851
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:18,217
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:22,755
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:28,482
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:31,652
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:33,697
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,252
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:39,297
Hey, look.

74
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:44,330
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:49,062
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,748
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,114
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,449
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:31,304
Mr. President.

80
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,410
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,730
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,316
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:46,275
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,932
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,384
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,426
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:59,425
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,012
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,252
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,849
Raven?

91
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:12,355
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,458
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,913
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,881
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,722
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:32,290
In here with us.

97
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,264
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,784
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:43,267
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,471
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,075
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,388
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:07,361
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,209
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:15,530
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,075
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,831
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,569
Dear Lord.

109
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,799
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:39,275
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:45,066
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:51,306
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:55,112
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:11:55,211 --> 00:12:01,605
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,358
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,012
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,831
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:14,240
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,899
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,745
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,112
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,692
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,544
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:37,386
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:42,055
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,800
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,899
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,402
into the body of this man?

129
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:57,129
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,073
Professor?

131
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,967
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,275
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,794
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,082
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,024
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:49,985
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:54,761
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,826
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,899
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:06,273
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,395
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:14,979
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,155
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,122
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,642
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,082
Hank?

147
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,121
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,498
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:46,280
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,893
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,101
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,170
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:59,684
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,154
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,903
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,588
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,921
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:12,961
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,744
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,192
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:23,080
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:26,146
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,935
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,827
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:38,022
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:40,196
Storm.

167
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,667
They're announcing it now.

168
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:50,694
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,762
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,779
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:15:56,908 --> 00:16:00,137
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:03,334
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:07,233
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,379
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:13,547
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:16,937
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,869
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:29,194
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,265
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:36,074
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,465
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:44,200
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,326
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,592
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,068
No. Professor.

186
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,146
They can't cure us.

187
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:04,065
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,561
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:12,232
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:17,252
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:22,625
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,692
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:32,491
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:38,214
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:41,763
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,256
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,013
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,880
They just do it.

199
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:56,900
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:02,502
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:06,313
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,517
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,027
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,978
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:21,483
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,709
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:27,811
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,298
Or us?

209
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:42,889
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,093
Back off.

211
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:49,254
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:53,701
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,618
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,430
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,506
Do you?

216
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,083
And what can you do?

217
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,287
So you have talents?

218
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:12,355
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,355
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,401
Other than you two.

221
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:24,139
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,879
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,024
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,603
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,431
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,505
Shut up.

227
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:05,089
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,788
Please.

229
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:10,536
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:16,263
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:18,338
Yeah, right.

232
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:48,523
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,856
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:55,527
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,889
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:03,363
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:07,209
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,641
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,681
You'll see.

240
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,127
Jimmy.

241
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,643
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,689
Hello there, son.

243
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:25,576
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,410
I'm sorry.

245
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,316
It's OK.

246
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,602
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,191
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:04,290
Yes, he is.

249
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,608
Scott.

250
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,746
Scott.

251
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:55,108
Scott.

252
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:59,138
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,642
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,325
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,760
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,576
Stop!

257
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,018
Jean?

258
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,031
Scott.

259
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,352
How?

260
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:19,137
I don't know.

261
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,234
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:39,298
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,147
No.

264
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,796
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:56,230
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:33,353
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:36,997
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:07,497
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:31,881
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,216
I can take care of that.

271
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,843
What the...

272
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,756
Logan!

273
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:34,183
She's alive.

274
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,515
Jean.

275
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:47,945
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:50,181
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:55,815
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,528
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:04,101
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:08,742
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:13,154
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,715
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:21,603
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:27,424
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:33,347
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:39,497
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:44,673
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:49,798
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,195
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,106
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:01,506
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:03,848
What have you done to her?

293
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:07,330
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:10,337
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:13,771
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,893
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:20,810
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,552
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:28,361
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,650
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,914
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,216
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:49,512
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:55,591
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:10,306
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:15,430
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:18,379
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,967
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,172
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:25,642
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:29,414
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:31,915
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:34,695
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:38,176
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,595
You ready?

316
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,512
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:20,931
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,922
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:29,606
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,562
Warren, calm down.

321
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,635
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:36,739
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:40,488
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:50,242
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:53,763
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:57,128
It's what you want.

327
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,508
Warren, no!

328
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:14,113
Told you so.

329
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,532
About time.

330
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:34,016
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:37,736
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:40,486
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:42,530
Read off the guest list.

334
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,716
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,827
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,461
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,078
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:10,440
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,336
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:17,739
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:20,324
How fascinating.

342
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:24,523
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,580
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,982
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:48,009
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,027
No!

347
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:16,298
You saved me.

348
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:21,671
Eric.

349
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,534
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:29,156
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,475
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:47,081
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,700
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:52,803
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:56,517
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,606
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:05,831
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,004
I have.

359
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,402
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,449
As do I.

361
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,180
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:26,342
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,662
Jean.

364
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:01,608
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:10,153
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:12,834
Are you OK?

367
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,481
Yeah.

368
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,577
More than OK.

369
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,821
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:39,237
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,586
It's OK.

372
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,323
It's OK.

373
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,940
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:46,756
Jean.

375
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,794
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,747
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,762
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,857
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:06,568
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,043
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,218
Where's Scott?

382
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,434
Jean?

383
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:26,632
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,075
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:36,321
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:49,378
Oh, God.

387
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,201
Look at me.

388
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:04,873
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,727
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,616
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,966
Kill me.

392
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,717
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,347
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:19,939
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:24,167
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,918
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:30,305
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:32,299
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:46,661
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,180
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:52,737
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:58,561
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,601
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,755
I picked something up.

405
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,893
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:12,395
It's a mutant.

407
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:16,420
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:18,793
More powerful than you.

409
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,496
Where is she?

410
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:28,393
Logan.

411
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:30,499
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:41:30,603 --> 00:41:32,578
What have you done?

413
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,689
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:44,581
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:55,878
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,888
It may be too late.

417
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:05,190
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,233
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,051
You were right, Charles.

420
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:13,417
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:16,385
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,630
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,674
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,321
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:30,339
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:34,087
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,130
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:24,420
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:43:24,524 --> 00:43:28,201
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,682
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,561
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:38,375
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:40,482
No. I want to help you.

434
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:44,611
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,536
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:49,537
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:52,066
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,952
Stay out of my head.

439
00:43:57,932 --> 00:44:01,478
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:44:07,468 --> 00:44:11,265
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:13,314
Get out of my head.

442
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:19,593
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:22,921
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,046
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,449
No! Stop it!

446
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:33,991
That's it.

447
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:16,643
Jean, let me in.

448
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,311
No, Jean.

449
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:20,353
Jean!

450
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,114
Don't let it control you.

451
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,447
Charles.

452
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:57,834
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,825
No.

454
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:18,499
God!

455
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:55,010
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:59,655
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:04,615
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:49:04,747 --> 00:49:08,293
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:12,139
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,882
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:21,412
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:26,633
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:30,155
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,995
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:41,859
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:49:41,964 --> 00:49:45,313
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:49,162
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,151
Kitty.

469
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,121
Bobby.

470
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,890
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:29,730
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,831
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,874
Yeah, me too.

474
00:50:36,012 --> 00:50:40,005
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:42,213
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:46,086
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:49,896
The first snow and all that.

478
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:55,496
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,984
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,611
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,406
Come on.

482
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:15,969
This place can be home too.

483
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,539
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:14,205
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,284
No.

486
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,188
Where are you going?

487
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:26,175
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:52:26,278 --> 00:52:28,580
Yeah, I do.

489
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,150
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:36,602
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,565
A kiss.

492
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:42,043
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:46,084
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:52:46,918 --> 00:52:49,471
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,504
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:55,581
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:52:55,718 --> 00:52:58,751
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:03,749
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,340
Marie.

500
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:08,607
Marie.

501
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:51,076
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:56,957
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:53:58,406 --> 00:54:04,570
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:12,548
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:15,995
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:18,273
Anything you can think of.

507
00:54:28,486 --> 00:54:30,493
Jean.

508
00:54:30,598 --> 00:54:32,540
Enough.

509
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:35,900
Enough.

510
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,289
You sound just like him.

511
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:43,204
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:47,229
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,175
As nature intended.

514
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:57,791
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,217
And that fight begins now.

516
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:12,127
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:15,842
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:55:15,974 --> 00:55:19,269
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:24,995
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:29,021
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:34,691
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:52,772
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,285
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:55:56,421 --> 00:56:02,051
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:07,747
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,103
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:19,363
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,436
It was, son.

529
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:28,991
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,869
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:48,316
Rogue.

532
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:51,196
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:57:00,006 --> 00:57:04,130
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,073
Logan.

535
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,667
Logan.

536
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,497
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:25,280
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:27,234
Logan. Logan.

539
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,570
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,906
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,496
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:58,308
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:00,740
She killed the professor.

544
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:04,034
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,164
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
00:58:08,262 --> 00:58:11,840
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
00:58:11,942 --> 00:58:13,916
Because you love her.

548
00:58:23,398 --> 00:58:25,984
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
00:58:26,118 --> 00:58:29,152
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
00:58:41,926 --> 00:58:44,773
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:48,290
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
00:58:48,518 --> 00:58:51,103
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:55,007
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
00:58:56,134 --> 00:59:01,469
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:04,160
I'm looking for someone.

556
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:08,221
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:13,404
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
00:59:17,413 --> 00:59:19,356
Come on, Iceman.

559
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,972
Make a move.

560
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:31,679
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:46,561
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:50,404
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:56,645
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
00:59:56,742 --> 01:00:00,484
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:00:00,582 --> 01:00:03,265
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:07,163
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:12,893
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:17,691
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:21,758
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:25,375
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:31,424
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:34,625
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:00:34,726 --> 01:00:37,246
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:40,862
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:44,349
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:48,414
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:50,524
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:04,450
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:09,117
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:15,300
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:32,933
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:40,831
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:03:42,854 --> 01:03:44,829
They have their weapons.

584
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:47,773
We have ours.

585
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:55,899
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:03:57,094 --> 01:04:03,291
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:06,527
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,735
take control of the cure,

589
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:11,140
and destroy its source.

590
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:14,783
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,074
Jean.

592
01:04:43,142 --> 01:04:46,176
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.

593
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:49,060
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:54,491
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:05:02,918 --> 01:05:06,595
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:05:06,726 --> 01:05:10,174
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:13,637
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:17,214
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:05:30,118 --> 01:05:32,060
OK.

600
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:36,611
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:05:37,702 --> 01:05:42,459
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:48,798
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:53,058
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:06:26,598 --> 01:06:30,209
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:32,699
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:48,160
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,559
OK, send them in.

608
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:55,807
OK.

609
01:06:55,941 --> 01:07:00,164
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:16,640
OK. I give up.

611
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,777
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,757
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,623
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:37,954
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,632
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:07:42,246 --> 01:07:44,221
Leave that to me.

617
01:07:49,093 --> 01:07:52,127
Storm. Storm.

618
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,880
What are you doing back here?

619
01:07:54,982 --> 01:07:56,924
I need help.

620
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,713
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:07:59,846 --> 01:08:02,563
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:07,747
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:08:07,846 --> 01:08:11,162
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,245
Let's suit up.

625
01:08:17,254 --> 01:08:21,215
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:24,166
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:29,728
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:33,603
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,156
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,531
But we lost Scott.

631
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,670
We lost the professor.

632
01:08:40,806 --> 01:08:45,563
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:48,319
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:08:48,454 --> 01:08:50,396
Are you?

635
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:53,468
Then we stand together.

636
01:08:54,726 --> 01:08:57,028
X-Men.

637
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:59,068
All of us.

638
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:07,619
We're in.

639
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,725
Let's go.

640
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:16,421
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:22,464
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,356
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:51,580
It's an earthquake.

644
01:10:55,014 --> 01:10:57,381
We're trapped.

645
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:59,298
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:13:13,446 --> 01:13:15,966
My God.

647
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,852
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,467
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,770
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:14:20,902 --> 01:14:23,652
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:14:26,181 --> 01:14:28,637
Humans and their guns.

652
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:39,940
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,547
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:00,288
Target the bridge.

655
01:15:06,598 --> 01:15:08,354
Fire!

656
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:19,426
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,496
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:48,636
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:52,386
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:15:53,254 --> 01:15:55,163
Then God help us.

661
01:16:04,614 --> 01:16:06,556
They're coming for him.

662
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:42,110
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:16:47,622 --> 01:16:49,727
You men cover the doors!

664
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:52,961
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,720
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:17:16,646 --> 01:17:19,134
Finish them!

667
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:54,559
Not yet.

668
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:11,328
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,404
With pleasure.

670
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:21,535
Hold it!

671
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:25,308
He's going for the boy!

672
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:27,553
Not if I get there first.

673
01:18:27,686 --> 01:18:29,661
Kitty!

674
01:18:39,558 --> 01:18:41,533
Come on.

675
01:18:44,582 --> 01:18:46,404
Grow those back.

676
01:18:56,646 --> 01:18:58,588
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:18:59,558 --> 01:19:02,046
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,589
Going somewhere?

679
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,510
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:42,556
Yes, I am.

681
01:19:43,398 --> 01:19:45,023
Girls.

682
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:47,361
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:50,561
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,800
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:19:52,902 --> 01:19:55,073
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:20:12,358 --> 01:20:18,075
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:20,669
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:20:20,806 --> 01:20:23,773
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:20:23,878 --> 01:20:25,056
No.

690
01:20:31,014 --> 01:20:35,553
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:39,105
This way.

692
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:43,963
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:20:47,526 --> 01:20:49,762
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:55,200
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:20:55,302 --> 01:20:57,723
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,532
Don't. No.

697
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,057
Don't.

698
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:16,900
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,810
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:50,686
It's time to end this war.

701
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,877
Take cover.

702
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,076
Get out of the way.

703
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:21,342
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,973
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:23:09,606 --> 01:23:12,421
We work as a team.

706
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:15,387
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:24,676
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:23:36,518 --> 01:23:38,460
Go ahead.

709
01:23:39,654 --> 01:23:42,075
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:23:42,214 --> 01:23:44,156
Right.

711
01:24:30,758 --> 01:24:33,693
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:36,646
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:24:47,078 --> 01:24:49,249
You never should have left.

714
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:52,478
This is it.

715
01:24:52,614 --> 01:24:54,501
Hey.

716
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,444
Make it a strike.

717
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,107
You never learn, do you?

718
01:25:11,622 --> 01:25:14,971
Actually, I do.

719
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:30,047
I'm...

720
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:32,702
One of them?

721
01:25:42,373 --> 01:25:45,570
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:26:05,734 --> 01:26:07,556
It's over, Jean.

723
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,900
It's over.

724
01:26:14,982 --> 01:26:16,891
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:32,066
No!

726
01:26:47,526 --> 01:26:50,461
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,604
Bobby!

728
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:12,284
What have I done?

729
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:26,786
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:27:26,918 --> 01:27:29,284
Go.

731
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,368
Jean!

732
01:28:17,734 --> 01:28:19,709
Jean!

733
01:28:19,846 --> 01:28:22,148
I know you're still there!

734
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,311
You would die for them?

735
01:29:10,374 --> 01:29:12,349
No, not for them.

736
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,452
For you.

737
01:29:17,382 --> 01:29:19,291
For you.

738
01:29:24,102 --> 01:29:26,076
Save me.

739
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:29,471
I love you.

740
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:07,262
You're back.

741
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,739
I'm sorry.

742
01:31:15,878 --> 01:31:17,787
I had to.

743
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:21,532
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:24,933
It's what I want.

745
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,271
Hey.

746
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:41,345
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:31:41,478 --> 01:31:44,031
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:47,166
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:51,327
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,147
human and mutant alike,

751
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:56,221
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,441
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:39:30,853 --> 01:39:32,763
Morning.

754
01:39:36,998 --> 01:39:39,616
Hello, Moira.

755
01:39:45,766 --> 01:39:47,359
Charles.

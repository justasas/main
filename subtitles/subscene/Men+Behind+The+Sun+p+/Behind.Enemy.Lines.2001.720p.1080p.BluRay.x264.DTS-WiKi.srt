1
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,842
The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia,

2
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:24,647
and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal,

3
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,551
which should be complete by New Year's Day,

4
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:30,682
close to the US president's
"Home by the holidays " pledge.

5
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,623
Yet even as the conflict winds down,

6
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:38,495
the US military remains in a high state
of readiness, eager to answer the call.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,435
Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. I've got
unknown rider not responding to coms.

8
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,369
Suspect hostile intent.

9
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:49,638
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.

10
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,752
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need
to get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

11
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,498
- Nose wheel, Radar.
- Check.

12
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:20,939
- Gun-blast diffuser.
- Clear.

13
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,272
- Right intake. Left intake.
- Check. Check.

14
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,938
- Ejection seat is safe. Arm handle.
- Copy. I show safe.

16
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:28,447
- Com IFF.
- Up and up. Let's go. Move it.

17
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,178
- DDl, MPCD and ETD.
- Go flight.

18
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:34,414
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- It's all green across the board.

19
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:36,684
- OK for start.
- Copy. OK for start.

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,352
- OK, right throttle, 15 per cent.
- Copy, 15 per cent. Go for two.

21
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,896
Two is up. ECS turbine is online.

22
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:45,091
Copy. Nozzle coming in at 73 per cent.

23
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,631
- Good to go.
- Copy. Good to go.

24
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,737
That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.

25
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,898
Cat four, abort.

26
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,307
- What?
- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?

27
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:59,437
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.

28
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:02,779
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.

29
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,778
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace.

30
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:09,584
I cannot wait for this shit to be done.

31
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,660
OK.

32
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,588
Four more days.

33
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:24,598
You know what I was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

34
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,472
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.

35
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,842
Yeah, but you know what?
I bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

36
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:36,145
Or fly for a rock star. I mean, if anybody
needs a good pilot, it's those guys.

37
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:41,052
Whenever you turn around we've lost another
band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em.

38
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:42,756
I mean, it's sad.

39
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:46,987
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens
from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.

40
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:51,122
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...

41
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:55,496
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

42
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:08,243
Let me ask you something. How fast
do you think we're headed into the wind here?

43
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,583
Chris, we're still on alert. If Reigart
wanders up to the tower, we're dead.

44
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,354
All right, let's do it.

45
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,426
That's the spirit.

46
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:27,162
- Rutherford. Right here.
- Incoming!

47
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:31,338
You guys ready for a little lesson in physics?

48
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,636
You never learn, kid.
I'm gonna take your money this week.

49
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,211
Wind's blowin' up a gale.

50
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,913
I bet you 20 bucks each
I catch it when it comes back.

51
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:44,076
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?

52
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,348
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.

53
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:24,715
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!

54
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,090
That is awesome!

55
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:29,356
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!

56
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,508
Wilson!

57
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:55,049
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.

58
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:16,204
This is a lot of sorties for an action
that's winding down, Leslie.

59
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,678
Admiral I'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

60
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:25,217
You understand how important it is that your
pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,812
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.

62
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,022
The treaty depends on it.

63
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,185
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.

64
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:41,000
- What is this?
- I invited him to report on the battle group.

65
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:45,198
I'd like you to give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.

66
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:50,672
Admiral, I find the press to be an intrusive
presence. It inspires showing off.

67
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,542
What's so funny, Admiral?

68
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:56,310
You, Admiral,
are just what the conflict needs.

69
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:00,821
- An uncomplicated man.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

70
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,957
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?

71
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,529
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.

72
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:14,000
- I know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.

73
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:17,503
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?

74
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,903
Well you know my team, we just finished up in Sarajevo,

75
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:22,772
and your Admiral wanted us
come aboard to pump you guys up.

76
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,038
Sounds like Reigart. "Be prepared. "

77
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,480
Well, it's better to be prepared
than to be caught sleepin' in the field.

78
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:32,178
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.

79
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:36,213
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

80
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:40,021
Well, I'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.

81
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,922
You know, everybody has a role to play.

82
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:48,730
See, me, I'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.

83
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:52,739
You, you're a navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

84
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:57,278
You don't get to pick your fight.
It comes to you.

85
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,270
Yeah, I get it.

86
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,543
But at least give me a fight I can understand.

87
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:07,114
Vukovar? Where's the place
we flew over the other day? Sreb...?

88
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,088
Srebrenica.

89
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,920
And good luck talkin' to someone at home
trying to explain.

90
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,688
"Today's Tuesday.
I think we're helping these people. "

91
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:19,324
"No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping... " It's like a joke.

92
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:25,270
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. I am.

93
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,171
Look at these guys.

94
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,683
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

95
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:43,985
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.

96
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:47,027
And those days are over. They are long gone.

97
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,397
I used to think I'd get a chance to do it.
Now I realize I'll be eating Jell-O.

98
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:55,361
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.

99
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,529
Lieutenant Burnett?

100
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,733
Admiral Reigart would like
to see you immediately.

101
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:03,868
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

102
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,878
Thank you.

103
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,471
Maybe he wants to give you
his daughter's phone number.

104
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,613
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good.

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,779
I don't know anything, Lieutenant.

106
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,292
Now, that is cynical.
And Southerners usually aren't that cynical.

107
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,022
Here I try give you a compliment
on how great your alma mater looks,

108
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,861
and you think I'm tryin' to pump you
for information. What does he want?

109
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,867
I guess you'll have to see, sir.

110
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,705
Come.

111
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:37,405
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

112
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,743
Lieutenant Burnett.

113
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,478
- Sir, about the football today, I know there's some confusion...
- I have your letter.

114
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:48,522
I understand you're interested
in leaving the navy.

115
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,491
Yes, sir. It's time to move on.

116
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:54,790
If you don't mind my asking,
move on to what?

117
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:55,863
Sir?

118
00:09:55,964 --> 00:10:00,424
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

119
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,733
You've had an interesting career, Lieutenant.

120
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,174
I remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

121
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,012
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd,

122
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:17,846
you received a non-punitive letter of caution

123
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:21,854
for disorderly behavior
at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

124
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:25,949
Another non-punitive letter a month later
for something involving Chinese New Year

125
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,522
at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.

126
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,292
One can only imagine what that was.

127
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,602
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant,
what happened to you?

128
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:45,902
Sir, I signed up to be a fighter pilot.
I didn't wanna be a cop.

129
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:51,577
I certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the
beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.

130
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,052
That and the routine on the ship
kinda wore me out.

131
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,453
- The routine?
- The routine.

132
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:01,284
What you don't know from experience
is that the routine, the systems checks,

133
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:06,390
the drills, the maintaining of discipline,
that's what you do to prepare for war.

134
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:10,428
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

135
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:14,872
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're
at war every time you step on this boat.

136
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:18,139
- You understand that?
- No, sir, I do not understand.

137
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,173
If we're at war, why don't somebody act like we at war?

138
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:26,344
Cos as far as I can tell, we go out,
we fly around and we come back.

139
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:32,583
Maybe we're pretending we're in the middle of the fight, but that's all
we're doing is pretending cause we're not fighting, we're watching.

140
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:37,427
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.

141
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:41,593
Sir with all due respect , I've given the navy seven good years.
I think I've served my country.

142
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:46,170
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

143
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,300
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.

144
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:54,370
You will serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

145
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:57,917
I'll keep your letter in my pocket.

146
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,455
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

147
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,498
You're dismissed, mister.

148
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:17,400
Sir.

149
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:32,117
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.
It's bullshit right? No.

150
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,552
He's tellin' the truth.

151
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,649
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?

152
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,727
Oh, that's good.

153
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,991
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, I thought
you were kidding about getting out.

154
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:47,431
You telling me I gotta find another navigator?
Is that the deal?

155
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,971
I can't do it anymore. I'm done. I'm sorry.

156
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:09,653
All hands. An air contact
believed to have originated in the North Pole

157
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:13,420
has been spotted
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

158
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,756
No, no, it's good to hear your voice. No, no.

159
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,859
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.

160
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,868
They're putting up tinsel,
and it's very Christmasy.

161
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,030
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her I said "merry Christmas. "

162
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,867
We're disappointed
that we won't be seeing you.

163
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,171
Well, you may get change to see a lot of me soon.

164
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,113
Well, we understand. You got
important things to do over there.

165
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,979
Dad, I gotta go.
I gotta get going.

166
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:40,010
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, I gotta get goin'.

167
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,783
- All right, I love you.
- Bye.

168
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,461
That son of a bitch!

169
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,898
Did you see this? He put us
on the holiday mission. Goddammit.

170
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,995
- Well, look at the bright side at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.

171
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:04,009
- It's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.

172
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:08,137
Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

173
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:13,118
Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.

174
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,709
Wouldn't it be great to look back
and there's Britney Spears?

175
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:46,617
But wait, she wants to come up to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.

176
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,460
The Cincinnati Accord verifies Serbia's
commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia.

177
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:54,948
I welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.

178
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:22,872
Coordinates 301506.51150 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.

179
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:26,649
- You sure about that?
- I'm readin' it right here, pal.

180
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,022
Yeah, well, uh...

181
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:35,623
the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats,
cos we're flyin' over a lake.

182
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,765
Goddammit.

183
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:46,465
And a warm thank you goes out to the US intelligence
community, ladies and gentlemen.

184
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:55,638
Yet another useless joyride at the cost
of mere millions to the US taxpayer.

185
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,449
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity
in section four alpha to our left.

186
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,715
Must be in that forested area.

187
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:07,317
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

188
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:11,592
Yeah, I know, I know. But the scope
doesn't lie. There it is. Let's check it out.

189
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,226
We're not supposed to fly that section.
Chris the brass'll have a shit fit.

190
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:18,430
Hey, we're on recon,
so let's recon something.

191
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,770
Stack, it's probably just
some locals fooling around.

192
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:25,642
Could be a good opportunity
to test our shiny new digital camera.

193
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:29,147
Why do I listen to you? All right, let's do it.

194
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:37,321
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

195
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:40,189
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.

196
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,900
- IDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

197
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,202
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.

198
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,813
Rolling digital.

199
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:13,485
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

200
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,980
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.

201
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:27,297
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!

202
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,390
What?!

203
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,036
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!

204
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,972
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

205
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,674
- I see a single missile tracking on us.
- I don't see it. Call my turn.

206
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,081
Slice left. Hard!

207
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,749
Jesus Christ!

208
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,948
Where is it?

209
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,025
Reverse right!

210
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,228
Try to break the lock!

211
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:06,102
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.

212
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,136
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.

213
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:15,148
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?!

214
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,740
I can't see shit! Where is he?!

215
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,864
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!

216
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:34,662
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- I got him! I got him!

217
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:48,037
We need a bigger heat decoy.

218
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,882
We're screwed!

219
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:03,195
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!

220
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,555
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!

221
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,035
Good fireball!

222
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,643
Clear on top. Coming back down.

223
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:24,417
I got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

224
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,918
That's it! One down. Up we go.

225
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,727
- Where's the second?
- No joy. I don't have it in sight.

226
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,930
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.

227
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:43,036
Hard left.

228
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:48,697
- I'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!

229
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,738
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!

230
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:56,475
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?

231
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:02,778
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break!

232
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,620
I got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!

233
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,694
Nose break, right!

234
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,130
Shit!

235
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:31,074
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!

236
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,790
Goddammit.

237
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:25,159
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, I really like Christmas.

238
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,496
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.

239
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,032
Ark Angel Zero Six.

240
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,200
Burnett and Stackhouse.

241
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,835
Goddammit. I put 'em on the holiday mission.

242
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,380
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.

243
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:45,316
We have a radar plot of flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

244
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,081
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

245
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,623
In the red is actual.

246
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,431
Lost contact is here.

247
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,935
They're off-mission. What the hell happened?

248
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,100
They checked this area. It'll be tough to
pick up a beacon signal, even from a satellite.

249
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,371
The terrain is extremely rough.

250
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,310
Damn weather's sure not helping.

251
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:17,315
Contact Admiral Piquet,
alert NATO chain of command.

252
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:21,285
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep
out over all US national circuits.

253
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:23,481
And get straight through to Admiral Donnelly.

254
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,150
- No names.
- No names, sir.

255
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:48,404
Stack! Stackhouse!

256
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,017
Stack!

257
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:54,379
Are you OK?

258
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,387
Yeah.

259
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,883
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. You look terrible.

260
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,257
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.

261
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,728
Let me see this. Oh, man.

262
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:10,066
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.

263
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,705
Shit. Squeeze right here.

264
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,880
So...

265
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,406
where are we, Mr Navigator Man?

266
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:28,446
In the mountains north of Miciovic.

267
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,954
You think they saw us eject?

268
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,723
We are not gonna be around to find out.

269
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,991
Reigart'll be curious
what happened to his $40 million plane.

270
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,264
Forget it. I already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

271
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,168
What?

272
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:49,041
You think it'll work up there?

273
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,269
Yeah. Just get high enough.

274
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,609
All right. All right, sit tight.

275
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,447
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

276
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:05,119
Listen, I should've dodged
that second missile.

277
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:10,260
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you.

278
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,696
I thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

279
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,998
I used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.

280
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,653
Oh, God.

281
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,759
Oh, shit.

282
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,093
Urgh!

283
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:06,035
Oh, goddammit.

284
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,111
Son of a bitch.

285
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:21,245
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

286
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:25,776
Not bombing mission, right?

287
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,286
You photograph?

288
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,665
You alone?

289
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,040
Correct.

290
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,556
No!

291
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,537
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.

292
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:11,081
Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?

293
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,982
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's seems to be some interference.

294
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:17,386
It's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.

295
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,720
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.

296
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:24,195
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey
directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.

297
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:39,308
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?

298
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:43,477
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

299
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:49,855
Ark Angel is down. I say again.
Ark Angel is down, and I am on the run.

300
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:52,584
Slow down. What is your count?

301
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:01,230
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

302
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,730
No names over the net.

303
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,202
Confirm your last.

304
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:10,435
Minus one. Confirmed.

305
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:14,035
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

306
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,715
Hold on son you're saying a uniformed soldier
killed your flight officer?

307
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,880
No, I'm saying they executed him.

308
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:26,857
They talked... They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

309
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,625
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

310
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:36,532
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. You said a word we're set it up all I need is a ride.

311
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:39,296
Zero Six, consult your chart.

312
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,202
Reposition to rally point three.

313
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,376
I read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.

314
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,508
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just make way to the rally point.

315
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,383
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.

316
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,759
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.

317
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,590
Let 'em know I need a green light
to go get my boy.

318
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:06,918
Command and control
comes from Red Crown.

319
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:12,760
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.

320
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:14,799
Use advisedly.

321
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,893
I want gimbal attachments
for all fast ropers.

322
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,833
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

323
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,703
Come.

324
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,108
Admiral, what's going on down there?

325
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:33,174
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

326
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,488
Who authorized a search and rescue?

327
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,491
- I did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.

328
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:45,523
Maybe I didn't make myself clear. We have
pilots down. One probably already dead.

329
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:49,398
Admiral, I have spoken personally
to Bosnian military commanders.

330
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,629
They say that the shoot-down was perpetrated

331
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:55,834
by renegade forces outside the control area
attempting to disrupt the peace process.

332
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,637
Of course they say that.

333
00:37:57,744 --> 00:38:02,443
They're also claiming, Admiral,
that your aircraft was way off-mission.

334
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:06,416
If we fly in there we create a shitstorm,
and the whole treaty will collapse.

335
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,148
Admiral, Burnett says
that Serb troops murdered his pilot.

336
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,588
Is your pilot an expert on Bosnia?

337
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:16,355
Can he distinguish between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

338
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:20,523
Because I can't, and I've been
posted here for five years.

339
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:24,562
If your man is in danger,
he should get himself into a safe zone.

340
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:27,606
That is what he's briefed and trained to do.

341
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:33,235
Listen, Leslie. I can have your fleet
commander order you to stand down,

342
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,940
or you can do it yourself.

343
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:41,496
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.

344
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,975
Zero Six, go ahead.

345
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:48,012
Zero Six is at rally point three
and standing by.

346
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:52,973
Zero Six, latest intel
says your current location

347
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:56,953
undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.

348
00:40:57,056 --> 00:41:00,025
Say again your last.
I am at the rendezvous point.

349
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:05,019
You need to hump it out to a safe zone.

350
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:09,033
I set IP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,

351
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:12,502
Virginia 2-0. Read back.

352
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:28,454
No.

353
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,021
Negative. Negative.

354
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,627
I do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup?

355
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,789
I am good to go.

356
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:40,889
I say again, I am good to go now.

357
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,900
Burnett!

358
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:53,073
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

359
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:57,610
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. I am very sorry.

360
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:02,216
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

361
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:05,347
Create some angles between
you and your pursuers.

362
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:10,122
Use your training. Use your head. Evade
and survive, and we will bring you home.

363
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:12,129
Do you understand? We will bring you home!

364
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:24,243
Zero Six?

365
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,476
Zero Six?

366
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,680
Someone's coming.

367
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:46,698
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.

368
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,734
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

369
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:07,886
We're tracking him in the SCIF, sir.

370
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:10,255
On me.

371
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:31,577
At ease.

372
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:44,952
Sir, we were able to track the emergency
radio signal to somewhere in this radius.

373
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:49,687
It's pretty far away. But we think
the pilot transmission came from here.

374
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:59,101
Now this is imagery from a Northrop Grumman relay satellite
downlinked through the Janek processing center Stuttgart.

375
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:03,608
We've hot-wired it for heat image,
and it's streaming in now.

376
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:06,735
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

377
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,448
OK, here we go.

378
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,229
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

379
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:51,319
Fuck!

380
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:56,625
What's going on? He's down.

381
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,357
He been shot?

382
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:04,033
They're almost on him.

383
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:10,767
Son of a bitch.

384
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,773
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

385
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:17,881
They're right on him!

386
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:34,933
What are they doing?

387
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,668
What's goin' on?

388
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:26,576
Has he been killed?

389
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:19,467
He's moving. That's him.

390
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:28,437
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.

391
00:47:28,547 --> 00:47:32,210
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.

392
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:34,149
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.

393
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:38,553
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for christ sakes!

394
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:40,625
We're down. It's cooked.

395
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:45,229
I want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?

396
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:47,094
Yes, sir.

397
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:21,031
Come.

398
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:26,737
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

399
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:31,666
I was trying to motivate him, Tom.

400
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:33,335
Sir?

401
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:35,845
Burnett. In the radio room.

402
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:38,644
I was...

403
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:43,984
I was trying to motivate him,
but... maybe I carried it too far.

404
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,115
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.

405
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:51,320
Just human, sir.

406
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,825
- Tom.
- Sir?

407
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:02,206
It's why I push 'em so hard.
For times like these.

408
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:13,047
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.

409
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:17,248
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

410
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:21,725
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got
a guy stuck on the ground, and we're sittin' here.

411
00:49:21,827 --> 00:49:23,795
It's a complicated situation.

412
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:26,456
Why isn't this all over the news?

413
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:31,468
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale,
or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out safe?

414
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:34,729
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.

415
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,298
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

416
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:43,373
Now, this kid might not have
the best attitude, but he's no idiot.

417
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:47,782
- He says he's gettin' shot at, I gotta believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?

418
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:52,084
Command tells me I gotta sit on my hands.
What else can I do?

419
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:55,690
Right.

420
00:49:55,794 --> 00:49:58,627
I forgot. It's not your call.

421
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,561
You're damn right it's not my call!

422
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,337
Apology, sir. Of course,
you can't do anything.

423
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,790
It's been confirmed that an American
combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet,

424
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:07,991
has been shot down over Bosnia.

425
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,434
It was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia
at around 6:00 yesterday morning.

426
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:13,061
Mr Burnett?

427
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:16,767
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator
is believed to have survived the crash site.

428
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,001
It's about your son.

429
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,476
Their names are still being withheld,
pending notification of their next of kin.

430
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:25,817
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down.

431
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:29,046
It's the Serbs who control
most of Southern Bosnia,

432
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,452
but they allege insurgents are to blame,

433
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:34,958
and say they're doing everything
to help locate the crew.

434
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:40,020
It's also unclear what, if any, impact
this incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...

435
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,722
Admiral.

436
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,558
You and I have known each other
for how long? Five years?

437
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,722
Something like that.

438
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,964
I've always commended your work
to your superior officers.

439
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,663
I've sent you information
whenever you requested it.

440
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,933
Thank you, sir. I appreciate your support.

441
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,407
And this is the thanks I get?

442
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:04,010
We have one disagreement
over how to handle a downed pilot,

443
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,911
and you stab me in the back?

444
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,747
You go to the media, to my contact,
and you make me look like an asshole.

445
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,345
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

446
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,085
Our man is down behind enemy lines!

447
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,626
Now what the fuck is the problem?!

448
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:23,727
Do you have any idea how much damage this
incident may cause to the peace process?

449
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,997
All I know, Admiral, is that the American
people want their pilot back.

450
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:32,632
Exactly! Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

451
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,603
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

452
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,208
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

453
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,281
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

454
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:54,221
You might have helped save
your man today, Reigart.

455
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,856
And I emphasize might.

456
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,734
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

457
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:39,788
Shit!

458
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,545
Shit.

459
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,766
Argh!

460
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,116
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel.

461
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,593
They've got a signal. It's Burnett.

462
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:32,031
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six.

463
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,434
I'm on course with your last instructions.

464
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:42,867
Am keyed up and waiting for your...
waiting for you to name the fairway.

465
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,939
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son?

466
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,082
I don't know. You tell me, sir.

467
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:55,920
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself,
uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.

468
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,993
Understood?

469
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,998
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.

470
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,094
Good for birds?

471
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,605
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.

472
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:16,372
You need to get there, stay out of trouble
and Big Mother will pick you up.

473
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,106
Next contact at, um...

474
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,372
1700.

475
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,450
Roger.

476
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,120
Alpha Whiskey?

477
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,490
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.

478
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,039
Sir, I shouldn't have left Stackhouse.

479
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,081
Distract him.

480
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:57,244
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was
garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.

481
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,913
How's it holding up?

482
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:08,023
The gear's good. I have a basic pack.

483
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,497
I left some of it at the crash site.

484
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:16,703
I guess I got rattled when I ejected at Mach 3.

485
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,768
You still got your boots,
haven't you, cowboy?

486
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,609
Roger. They were tied on.

487
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,678
You got it made.

488
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:37,351
You're an optimist, sir.
See, I had you figured for a grouch.

489
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,991
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.

490
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,196
Roger.

491
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,898
Are you gonna be there, sir?

492
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,474
That's affirmative, son. Out.

493
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,146
He's here.

494
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,615
Yes, sir. I suggest we place him here.

495
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:06,984
It's open ground near the town of Hac,
well inside the safe zone.

496
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,892
All right, let's go for the extraction.

497
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:54,002
.. command area responsibility.
Ingress will be north, egress south.

498
01:02:55,004 --> 01:03:01,102
From the position of the radio contacts, you can see
that he has basically circled back towards the crash site.

499
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,613
Call sign is "Avalanche. "
Authenticate: "Romeo Two, X-ray. "

500
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:11,186
Continue: "Bulldog. " Delay: "Cycle. "
Abort is "Washdown. "

501
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:15,448
Aircraft down is "Cobalt. "
Success is "Ripper. "

502
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,624
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

503
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:24,422
Bravo will establish a security perimeter, then
haul ass back to the helo on my command...

504
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,468
Admiral Reigart.

505
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:29,834
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

506
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,567
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly on the line.

507
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,441
I have spoken with Admiral Donnelly on this matter
and have his full support.

508
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,537
You will stand down.

509
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,137
Chris.

510
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,625
Hey!

511
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,140
Yeah.

512
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,362
You American?

513
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,676
Nine millimeters?

514
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,385
Nine millimeter.

515
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,487
Do you have water?

516
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,616
Water? No water.

517
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,305
Thanks.

518
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,114
It's good.

519
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,144
Ice Cube.

520
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,883
Yeah. I like Ice Cube.

521
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,188
I like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.

522
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:49,322
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

523
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,827
They said stop, freeze

524
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:56,132
I got froze up
because I'm public enemy number one

525
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,771
One, one, one, one

526
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,076
That's good. That's good, that's good.

527
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,860
You know where we're going?

528
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:20,929
Hac.

529
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,521
Hac? That's good. Good.

530
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,539
Jesus Christ!

531
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,482
Tell him to go!

532
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,084
Hey, come on! Come on!

533
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,117
Hey. Bonjour.

534
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,910
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?

535
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,582
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. I'm an American soldier
that's been shot down.

536
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,784
Shut up.

537
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,292
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking pictures, photographs.

538
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,869
Photographs of what? Of what?!

539
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,205
Lokar's come back here again,
killing everyone.

540
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:16,108
It's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children,
women... Buried them up their in the hills.

541
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:19,146
In the hills?
Yes, I saw them. I saw the graves.

542
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:25,086
Yes, I saw them. I saw the bodies in the hills.

543
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,747
Tell him. I am an American.
I am on your side.

544
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:31,758
- That's what I'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.

545
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,725
Tell them you are an American.

546
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:36,559
- They don't kill American.
- Ice Cube, tell them.

547
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,600
Tell this guy that we have
photographs that can help...

548
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:43,138
Bullshit!

549
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:45,433
America say they make them sign deal.

550
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,740
- I swear to God...
- But they already break it!

551
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,907
America government for shit! Now go!

552
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,401
Hey, hey, hey...

553
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,436
It's OK. It's me.

554
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,803
Come on.

555
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,249
Time?

556
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,256
Three minutes, sir.

557
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,135
Stop! Shh.

558
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,251
Let's go.

559
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:54,699
Reigart.

560
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,109
Leslie, I'm afraid there's bad news.

561
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:03,916
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac.

562
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,785
I regret to inform you
that Lieutenant Burnett is...

563
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:10,616
dead.

564
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,718
- I am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.

565
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:27,933
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.

566
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,342
Yet once again in Bosnia,
that's proved an illusion.

567
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,244
And in the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave,

568
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,783
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found

569
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:40,548
the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett,

570
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:43,419
whose plane was shot down two days ago.

571
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,624
The Serb authorities are claiming
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas,

572
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,394
opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.

573
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:58,161
The Serbs say the body was discovered by one of
their teams that have taken part in a combine

574
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:02,972
search-and-rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.

575
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:07,105
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's hopes
for a clean exit from the Balkans,

576
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:12,517
and frustrates US military leaders, only days
away from a complete withdrawal from Bosnia.

577
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:16,450
For NATO's forces
on the eve of their departure from this region,

578
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:20,688
the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death
comes as another dark blow

579
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:26,428
at the end of a disturbing and ultimately
unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.

580
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,666
Savior Six, Savior Six
from Gold Eagle command.

581
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,075
Be advised the package is not in position.

582
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:42,378
Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.

583
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,893
Hey!

584
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,156
Hey! Wait!

585
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,376
We're here!

586
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:12,669
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!

587
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:15,107
We're right here!

588
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,150
You've gotta be shitting me!

589
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,828
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

590
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,198
- Captain...
- We did nothing!

591
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,770
We did nothing.

592
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,592
We were right here.

593
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,162
We were right... Fuck!

594
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,637
What's that?

595
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,660
It's not safe here. We'll keep going.

596
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,137
No. You go.

597
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:27,338
They killed my pilot
because we took pictures of the graves.

598
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,041
And I know where they are.

599
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,813
And I'm gonna get 'em,
so he didn't die for no reason.

600
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,724
Don't follow me.

601
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,800
It's safer here.

602
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,734
Shit.

603
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:09,776
Goddamn. Why is this off?

604
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,648
Why is this off? Why is this...?

605
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,715
Come on.

606
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:51,751
Come on! Goddammit!

607
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,483
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.

608
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,861
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

609
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:14,067
For the information of all hands,
this ship will be relieved on station.

610
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:18,942
It will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.

611
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:38,098
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SCIF.
- All right, thank you.

612
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,937
It's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.

613
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:46,063
The only way to reactivate beacon
is from the seat, manually.

614
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,809
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

615
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:54,047
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar
with our systems to reactivate that beacon.

616
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,639
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup.

617
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:00,517
It's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.

618
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,749
Sir, I agree.

619
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:07,960
Sir, we really should notify NATO command,
or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.

620
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:13,591
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, I get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

621
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,193
Piquet was very clear with his objections, sir.

622
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,668
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it.

623
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:24,575
I'm not gonna let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

624
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:58,036
OK. All right. OK.

625
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:03,166
OK, all right.

626
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,442
Goddamn!

627
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,117
Gentlemen,

628
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:46,711
I wanna make one thing clear before we leave.

629
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,817
I intend to put you in harm's way.

630
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:57,325
Any man who doesn't wish to join
this mission, step away right now.

631
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,270
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

632
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:28,709
About two clicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

633
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,438
Argh!

634
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,380
Argh...

635
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:55,629
There he is. There he is!

636
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,979
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?

637
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,517
Come on!

638
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:35,525
Come on! Come on, kid!

639
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:45,045
It's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.

640
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:11,597
Goddammit!

641
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,542
Come on!

642
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:26,813
OK.

643
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:48,497
Go!

644
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:51,271
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.

645
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:53,573
Sir, he's on the rope.

646
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:05,457
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

647
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:08,623
Come on, son. Come on!

648
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,366
Go!

649
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:37,148
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

650
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,716
Hey, Chris.

651
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:13,793
Hey, Glen.

652
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,262
Admiral.

653
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,826
This is why they killed Stackhouse.

654
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:34,176
Admiral?

655
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:38,445
You were holding a letter for me.
I'd like to get it back.

656
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:41,211
I think I can find it.

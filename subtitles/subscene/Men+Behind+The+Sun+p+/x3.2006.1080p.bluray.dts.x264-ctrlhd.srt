1
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:14,784
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,287
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:19,414
And I would expect you, of all people,

4
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,167
would understand
my feelings on misuse of power.

5
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,337
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

6
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:30,008
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

7
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,510
You're here because I need you.

8
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:35,305
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

9
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:39,184
No. This one's special.

10
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,354
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

11
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,024
Yeah, the brochure is great.

12
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:50,028
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

13
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,530
- Illness?
- John.

14
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,866
You think your daughter is sick, Mr Grey?

15
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,745
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

16
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,247
Of course.

17
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,000
Jean, can you come down, dear?

18
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,055
We'll leave you, then.

19
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:31,069
<i>It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr Lensherr's, without our permission.</i>

20
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,781
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

21
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:38,243
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

22
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,372
Really? I doubt that.

23
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,099
Oh, Charles.

24
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,269
I like this one.

25
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,896
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

26
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,817
The question is,
will you control that power?

27
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,780
Or let it control you?

28
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,554
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

29
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,142
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

30
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:47,812
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

31
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,024
Open the door. Warren.

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,318
One second!

33
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,655
Open this door.

34
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,449
Warren.

35
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,329
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

36
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,471
Oh, God.

37
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,974
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,857
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,287
Bobby!

40
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,212
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,307
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:33,644
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,150
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,985
Logan.

45
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,491
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,202
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:53,039
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,209
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,670
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,190
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,529
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,784
<i>Simulation complete.</i>

53
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,374
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,292
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,546
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,715
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,678
Yeah, best defense is a good offense.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:52,807
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:57,353
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,455
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,958
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,252
Scott.

63
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,546
Scott.

64
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,716
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,304
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,600
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,103
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,858
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,613
They were looking for you.
You didn't show.

70
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,780
What do you care?

71
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,034
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

72
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,244
No, you didn't. The professor did.

73
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,873
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

74
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,125
Hey, look.

75
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,214
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

76
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,302
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

77
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,267
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

78
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,625
- Mr Secretary.
- Yes.

79
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:48,172
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

80
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,304
Mr President.

81
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,515
Have a seat, Hank.

82
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:02,019
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

83
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,690
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

84
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:10,861
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

85
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,698
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

86
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,243
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

87
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,413
Yes, sir. She can do that.

88
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,583
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

89
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,379
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

90
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,715
<i>Where is Magneto?</i>

91
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,384
<i>Raven?</i>

92
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:38,097
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

93
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,350
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

94
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,895
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

95
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:49,066
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

96
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,070
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

97
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,909
In here with us.

98
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,997
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

99
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,624
You don't want to play games with me?

100
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,379
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

101
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,716
You wanna know where he is?

102
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,726
Homo sapien.

103
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,318
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

104
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:35,446
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

105
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:39,450
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

106
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:43,954
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

107
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,625
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

108
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,586
It's what she stole from the FDA.

109
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,636
Dear Lord.

110
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,057
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

111
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,687
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

112
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:14,652
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

113
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,242
When an individual acquires great power,

114
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,204
the use or misuse of that power
is everything.

115
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:32,002
Will it be for the greater good or will it be
used for personal or for destructive ends?

116
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,839
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

117
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,675
Why? Because we are mutants.

118
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,553
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

119
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:45,182
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

120
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,977
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

121
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,981
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

122
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,400
without any superhuman authority behind it.

123
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:58,112
Einstein wasn't a mutant
so far as we know.

124
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:05,286
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr Moira McTaggert. Jones.

125
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:09,290
<i>The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.</i>

126
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.</i>

127
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,048
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

128
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,302
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

129
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,888
into the body of this man?

130
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:29,852
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

131
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,450
Professor?

132
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:50,581
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

133
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:00,216
The forecast was for sunny skies.

134
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,969
I'm sorry.

135
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:16,982
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

136
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,861
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

137
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,990
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

138
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:29,954
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

139
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,165
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

140
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,377
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

141
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:42,007
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

142
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,347
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

143
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,100
He took Jean's death so hard.

144
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,310
Yes, things are better out there,

145
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,481
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

146
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,235
There's something you're not telling us.

147
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,996
Hank?

148
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,248
Ororo. Charles.

149
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,753
I love what you've done with your hair.

150
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,674
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

151
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,428
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

152
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,763
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

153
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,017
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

154
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:37,688
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

155
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,232
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

156
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,152
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

157
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,904
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

158
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,366
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

159
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,535
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

160
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,456
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

161
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:59,084
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

162
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,046
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

163
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,257
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

164
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,052
They're calling it a cure.

165
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,308
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

166
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,686
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

167
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,897
Storm.

168
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,399
They're announcing it now.

169
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,908
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

170
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:34,078
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

171
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,247
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

172
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,709
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

173
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,004
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

174
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,092
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

175
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,427
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

176
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,723
<i>I proudly present the answer to mutation.</i>

177
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,185
<i>Finally, we have a cure.</i>

178
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:06,485
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

179
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:10,989
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

180
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,158
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

181
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:18,163
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

182
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,750
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

183
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:26,630
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

184
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:30,926
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

185
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,304
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

186
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,017
No. Professor.

187
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,270
They can't cure us.

188
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:47,359
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

189
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,987
Or any of us, for that matter.

190
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,868
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

191
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:01,165
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

192
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:05,836
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

193
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:11,008
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

194
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:17,014
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

195
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:23,020
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

196
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,690
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

197
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,318
Nobody is talking about extermination.

198
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:32,112
No one ever talks about it.

199
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,200
They just do it.

200
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:42,456
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

201
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:48,337
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

202
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:52,257
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

203
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,551
the extermination has already begun.

204
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:59,264
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

205
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,392
They will force their cure upon us.

206
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:08,106
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

207
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,443
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

208
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,738
Who will you stand with? The humans?

209
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,408
Or us?

210
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,420
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

211
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,673
Back off.

212
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,010
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

213
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,682
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

214
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,768
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

215
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,646
You know who you're talking to?

216
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,898
Do you?

217
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,611
And what can you do?

218
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,948
So you have talents?

219
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,118
That and more. I know you control metal.

220
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:05,289
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

221
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,541
Other than you two.

222
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,297
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

223
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,426
Could you locate one for me?

224
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:40,449
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

225
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,161
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

226
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,038
Oh, Mr President.

227
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,290
Shut up.

228
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:56,173
Why are you doing this to me? Let me
down. I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

229
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,883
Please.

230
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,845
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

231
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:07,768
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

232
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,020
Yeah, right.

233
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,385
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

234
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,804
Thank you, Dr Rae.
Not an easy mace to get to.

235
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:48,642
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

236
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,229
He is a mutant.
You understand our concern.

237
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:56,900
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

238
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,904
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.

239
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,407
And his power? What is its range?

240
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,659
You'll see.

241
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,248
Jimmy.

242
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,918
There's someone I would like you to meet.

243
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,004
Hello there, son.

244
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,090
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

245
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,224
I'm sorry.

246
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,227
It's OK.

247
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,115
You have an amazing gift.
Thank you, Jimmy.

248
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,252
Extraordinary, isn't he?

249
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,464
Yes, he is.

250
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,377
Scott.

251
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,014
Scott.

252
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,391
Scott.

253
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,646
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

254
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,190
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,026
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

256
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,529
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

257
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,448
Stop!

258
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,840
Jean?

259
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,551
Scott.

260
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,055
How?

261
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,937
I don't know.

262
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,871
I wanna see your eyes.

263
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,125
- Take these off.
- No.

264
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,046
No.

265
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,924
Trust me. I can control it now.

266
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,768
Open them. You can't hurt me.

267
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,390
- What happened?
- No clue.

268
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:42,143
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

269
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,967
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

270
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,409
I can't see a damn thing.

271
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,911
I can take care of that.

272
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,263
What the...

273
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,758
Logan!

274
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,307
She's alive.

275
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,021
Jean.

276
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:58,738
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

277
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,074
The only explanation of Jean's survival

278
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:06,329
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

279
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,833
Is she gonna be OK?

280
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:15,588
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.

281
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:20,468
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

282
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:25,014
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

283
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,684
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

284
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:33,857
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

285
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:39,904
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

286
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:46,035
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

287
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:52,459
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

288
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:57,881
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

289
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:03,219
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

290
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,764
or the Phoenix furiously struggling
to be free.

291
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,809
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

292
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:15,440
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

293
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,901
What have you done to her?

294
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:21,571
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

295
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,657
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

296
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,244
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

297
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:32,540
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

298
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,585
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

299
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,255
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

300
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:43,426
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.

301
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:47,972
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

302
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,608
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

303
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:02,111
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

304
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,490
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

305
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:11,913
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.

306
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,178
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

307
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:32,517
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

308
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,645
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

309
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,314
Good. Bring him in.

310
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,650
Are you sure you want to start with him?

311
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,278
I think it's important. Yes.

312
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,156
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

313
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,701
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

314
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,662
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

315
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:56,332
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

316
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,878
You ready?

317
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:33,161
The transformation can be a little jarring.

318
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,877
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

319
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,837
It'll all be over soon.

320
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:49,886
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

321
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,888
Warren, calm down.

322
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,098
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

323
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:57,310
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

324
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:01,314
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

325
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,324
Warren, it's a better life.

326
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,119
- It's what we all want.
- No.

327
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,539
It's what you want.

328
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,086
Warren, no!

329
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,911
Told you so.

330
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,012
About time.

331
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,599
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

332
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:03,519
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

333
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,355
Without him, they have nothing.

334
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,524
Read off the guest list.

335
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,863
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

336
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,032
This one robbed seven banks.

337
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:26,042
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

338
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,837
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

339
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:37,553
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

340
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,641
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

341
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,228
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

342
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,897
How fascinating.

343
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:52,235
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

344
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:56,405
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

345
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,420
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

346
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,759
I think he'll make a fine addition
to our army.

347
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,928
No!

348
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,289
You saved me.

349
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,794
Eric.

350
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,966
I'm sorry, my dear.

351
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,594
You're not one of us any more.

352
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:08,311
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

353
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:18,321
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

354
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,073
Policy is being made without me,
Mr President.

355
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,327
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

356
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:28,164
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

357
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,041
That was an isolated incident.

358
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:33,502
You have to understand
those mutants were a real threat.

359
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:37,882
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

360
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:40,217
I have.

361
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,138
And I worry about how democracy survives

362
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,849
when one man can move cities
with his mind.

363
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,018
As do I.

364
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,982
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

365
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:59,362
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

366
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,808
Jean.

367
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,148
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

368
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:44,907
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

369
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,868
Are you OK?

370
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,664
Yeah.

371
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,918
More than OK.

372
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,766
Logan, you're making me blush.

373
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,271
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

374
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,860
It's OK.

375
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,293
It's OK.

376
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,584
- Wait.
- No.

377
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,674
Jean.

378
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,844
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

379
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:32,014
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

380
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,187
The professor said you might be different.

381
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,525
He would know, wouldn't he?

382
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:46,362
What? You think he's not in your head too?

383
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,950
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

384
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,540
Where's Scott?

385
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,003
Jean?

386
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:07,216
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

387
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:11,303
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

388
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,393
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

389
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,906
Oh, God.

390
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,250
Look at me.

391
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:47,131
Stay with me. Talk to me.

392
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,091
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

393
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,051
Focus. Focus, Jean.

394
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,598
Kill me.

395
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,434
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

396
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,144
- Don't say that.
- Please.

397
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,771
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

398
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,276
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

399
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:10,070
It'll be all right. We can help you.

400
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,657
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

401
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,743
I don't want to fix it.

402
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:30,799
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

403
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,386
I told you they would draw first blood.

404
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,056
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

405
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:43,145
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

406
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,398
Come. We have an army to build.

407
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:51,654
I picked something up.

408
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,990
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

409
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:57,534
It's a mutant.

410
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:01,789
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

411
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,166
More powerful than you.

412
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:09,129
Where is she?

413
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,218
Logan.

414
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,428
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

415
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,681
What have you done?

416
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:26,063
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

417
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:31,193
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

418
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:42,955
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

419
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,041
It may be too late.

420
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,589
- Wait for me here.
- What?

421
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,842
I need to see Jean alone.

422
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,720
You were right, Charles.

423
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:01,223
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

424
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,268
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

425
00:44:04,435 --> 00:44:06,603
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

426
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,856
So, shall we go inside?

427
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,610
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

428
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:18,866
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

429
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:22,745
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

430
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,913
Nobody gets inside.

431
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:15,214
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

432
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:17,466
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do.

433
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,134
You have a home and a family.

434
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:22,805
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

435
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,850
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

436
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,812
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

437
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,980
No. I want to help you.

438
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:36,318
Help me? What's wrong with me?

439
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,320
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

440
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:41,448
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

441
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:44,159
For your own good, Jean.

442
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:47,121
Stay out of my head.

443
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,836
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

444
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:04,054
Look at me, Jean. I can help you.
Look at me.

445
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,140
Get out of my head.

446
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,729
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

447
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:16,191
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

448
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:20,529
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

449
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,990
No! Stop it!

450
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,703
That's it.

451
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:12,164
Jean, let me in.

452
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,520
No, Jean.

453
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:18,772
Jean!

454
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,875
Don't let it control you.

455
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,636
Charles.

456
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,374
My dear. Come with me.

457
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,099
No.

458
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,770
God!

459
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,975
We live in an age of darkness.

460
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:04,813
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

461
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:09,985
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

462
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:13,822
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

463
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,826
A world he tried to heal.

464
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:21,621
A mission he never saw accomplished.

465
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:27,502
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

466
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:32,841
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

467
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,511
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

468
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,515
And when we were alone,
he gave us a family.

469
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:48,815
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

470
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:52,360
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

471
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:56,490
And that's a vision of a world united.

472
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,557
Kitty.

473
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,602
Bobby.

474
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:30,565
- You OK?
- Yeah.

475
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:38,740
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

476
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:42,953
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

477
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,121
Yeah, me too.

478
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:49,417
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

479
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,670
You have Rogue and I have...

480
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,799
You know, I just miss home.

481
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,761
The first snow and all that.

482
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:05,600
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

483
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,144
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

484
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:10,939
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

485
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,691
Come on.

486
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,122
This place can be home too.

487
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,331
Thank you for this, Bobby.

488
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,766
You need a lift, kid?

489
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:30,018
No.

490
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,105
Where are you going?

491
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:38,193
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid of your powers,

492
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,236
afraid to get close to anybody.

493
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:42,697
Yeah, I do.

494
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:47,535
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

495
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:51,122
A hug. A handshake.

496
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,208
A kiss.

497
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:56,878
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

498
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,049
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

499
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,636
Just be sure it's what you want.

500
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,723
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

501
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,934
To go upstairs and unpack?

502
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,270
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

503
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:19,401
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

504
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,069
Marie.

505
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,489
Marie.

506
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:08,783
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

507
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:14,956
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

508
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,127
And I thought to myself,
"Why would Charles

509
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:22,922
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

510
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:31,139
I can manipulate the metal in this,

511
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:34,809
but you, you can do anything.

512
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,228
Anything you can think of.

513
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,866
Jean.

514
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,118
Enough.

515
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:55,538
Enough.

516
00:56:57,874 --> 00:57:00,126
You sound just like him.

517
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:03,171
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

518
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:07,342
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

519
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:10,345
As nature intended.

520
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:18,353
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

521
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,981
And that fight begins now.

522
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:33,284
She shouldn't be here with us.

523
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:37,205
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

524
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:40,750
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

525
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:46,714
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

526
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:50,885
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

527
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:56,891
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

528
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,702
So what now? What do we do?

529
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:19,330
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

530
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:25,336
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

531
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:31,259
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

532
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,933
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

533
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,438
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

534
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,607
It was, son.

535
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:53,448
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

536
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:57,452
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

537
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,635
Rogue.

538
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,638
Hey, Rogue.

539
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:30,151
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

540
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,667
Logan.

541
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,335
Logan.

542
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:49,170
- Logan.
- Jean?

543
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:52,173
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

544
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,175
Logan. Logan.

545
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:56,594
- Logan.
- Stop.

546
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:59,055
Logan. Logan. Logan.

547
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,578
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

548
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:26,541
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

549
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,085
She killed the professor.

550
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,547
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

551
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,884
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

552
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,722
Why can't you just let her go?

553
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,890
Because you love her.

554
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:55,445
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

555
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,781
So if you're with us, then be with us.

556
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,089
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

557
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:18,760
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

558
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:21,721
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

559
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:25,683
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

560
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:32,440
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

561
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:35,234
I'm looking for someone.

562
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:39,572
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

563
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:44,952
I figured she'd want the cure.
She's pathetic.

564
01:01:49,082 --> 01:01:51,125
Come on, Iceman.

565
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,921
Make a move.

566
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:03,971
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

567
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:19,487
<i>Today's attack was only our first salvo.</i>

568
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:23,491
<i>So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.</i>

569
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:29,997
<i>Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.</i>

570
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:34,001
<i>And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...</i>

571
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,838
<i>Join us or stay out of our way.</i>

572
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:41,008
<i>Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.</i>

573
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:45,263
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

574
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:51,894
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

575
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:56,190
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

576
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,861
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

577
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:06,200
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

578
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,537
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

579
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:12,290
Let's go. Keep it moving.

580
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:16,043
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

581
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,714
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

582
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:24,010
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

583
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:26,137
Absolutely no metal.

584
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:40,735
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

585
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:45,573
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

586
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:51,913
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

587
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:15,389
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

588
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,689
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

589
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,943
They have their weapons.

590
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:31,030
We have ours.

591
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:39,413
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

592
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:47,088
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

593
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,508
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

594
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:52,802
take control of the cure,

595
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:55,304
and destroy its source.

596
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:59,141
And then nothing can stop us.

597
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:16,158
Jean.

598
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:31,841
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

599
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:34,885
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

600
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:39,598
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

601
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:53,154
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

602
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,907
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

603
01:07:57,074 --> 01:08:00,494
And you stood there and let him die?

604
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:04,165
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

605
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:19,805
OK.

606
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:24,518
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr President.

607
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:30,566
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

608
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:37,198
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

609
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:41,535
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

610
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,989
Approaching target dead ahead.

611
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,910
Set for 360-degree incursion.

612
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:39,009
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

613
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:45,766
OK, send them in.

614
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:47,017
OK.

615
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:51,605
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

616
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,789
OK. I give up.

617
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,042
Sorry, Mr Secretary, it was a decoy.

618
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:15,087
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

619
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:27,516
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

620
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:30,978
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

621
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:34,773
So how are we supposed to get there?
Cos I don't swim.

622
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,568
Leave that to me.

623
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:45,743
Storm. Storm.

624
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,662
What are you doing back here?

625
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,748
I need help.

626
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:53,667
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

627
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,670
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

628
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,506
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go.

629
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:02,009
They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

630
01:11:02,176 --> 01:11:05,596
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

631
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:07,848
Let's suit up.

632
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,604
Hard to believe this once fit me.

633
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,065
If Magneto gets that cure,
we can't stop him.

634
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,193
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

635
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:25,032
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

636
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:29,036
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

637
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:31,705
I'm not gonna lie to you.

638
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,124
But we lost Scott.

639
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,377
We lost the professor.

640
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:41,382
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

641
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:44,385
I'm not gonna let that happen.

642
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,553
Are you?

643
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:49,765
Then we stand together.

644
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:53,394
X-Men.

645
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,646
All of us.

646
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:04,530
We're in.

647
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:06,740
Let's go.

648
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:13,706
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

649
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:20,045
But are you ready to do what
you need to do when the time comes?

650
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,635
Dad, what's going on?

651
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:53,013
It's an earthquake.

652
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,977
We're trapped.

653
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:06,104
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

654
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:23,413
My God.

655
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:51,525
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

656
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:10,877
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

657
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:14,381
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

658
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:33,984
In chess, the pawns go first.

659
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,156
Humans and their guns.

660
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:50,917
Plastic. They've learned.

661
01:17:57,132 --> 01:17:59,885
That's why the pawns go first.

662
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:12,272
Target the bridge.

663
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,572
Fire!

664
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:32,250
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

665
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:56,149
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

666
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:02,656
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

667
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:06,618
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

668
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:09,454
Then God help us.

669
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:21,341
They're coming for him.

670
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,043
Don't ever do that again.

671
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:06,303
You men cover the doors!

672
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:09,639
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

673
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:28,158
Traitors to their own cause.

674
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:37,000
Finish them!

675
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,870
Not yet.

676
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:31,388
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

677
01:21:31,555 --> 01:21:33,640
With pleasure.

678
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:42,148
Hold it!

679
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:45,986
He's going for the boy!

680
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:48,321
Not if I get there first.

681
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:50,532
Kitty!

682
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,961
Come on.

683
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,008
Grow those back.

684
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:20,770
Don't you know who I am?

685
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:24,357
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

686
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:57,891
Going somewhere?

687
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,397
You're the guy that invented the cure,
right?

688
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:06,566
Yes, I am.

689
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,110
Girls.

690
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:11,571
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

691
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:14,908
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

692
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,243
Calm down. Calm down.

693
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,621
Everything's gonna be OK.

694
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:42,394
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

695
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,272
Oh, you get the point.

696
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:49,484
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

697
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:50,944
No.

698
01:23:57,075 --> 01:24:01,871
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

699
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:05,500
This way.

700
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:10,463
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

701
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,553
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

702
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,308
I'm the wrong guy
to play hide-and-seek with.

703
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,811
Who's hiding, dickhead?

704
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:38,324
Don't. No.

705
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,869
Don't.

706
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:44,831
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

707
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,001
Do we look like we need your help?

708
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:20,200
It's time to end this war.

709
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,963
Take cover.

710
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,258
Get out of the way.

711
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:52,106
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

712
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:53,733
Go! Go! Go!

713
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:44,117
We work as a team.

714
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:48,413
Best defense is a good offense.

715
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:56,921
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

716
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,604
Go ahead.

717
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:16,316
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

718
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:18,484
Right.

719
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:10,078
You're in over your head, Bobby.

720
01:28:10,244 --> 01:28:13,206
Maybe you should go back to school.

721
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,219
You never should have left.

722
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:29,722
This is it.

723
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:31,808
Hey.

724
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:34,894
Make it a strike.

725
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:48,074
You never learn, do you?

726
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:53,246
Actually, I do.

727
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:08,845
I'm...

728
01:29:09,012 --> 01:29:11,723
One of them?

729
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:25,111
This is what they want for all of us.

730
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:47,925
It's over, Jean.

731
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:52,597
It's over.

732
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:57,643
No! Don't shoot!

733
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,325
No!

734
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:32,637
Everybody get out of there!

735
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,356
Bobby!

736
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:55,535
What have I done?

737
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:10,591
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

738
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:13,136
Go.

739
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:18,391
Jean!

740
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:05,771
Jean!

741
01:32:05,938 --> 01:32:08,274
I know you're still there!

742
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,448
You would die for them?

743
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,618
No, not for them.

744
01:33:01,911 --> 01:33:03,996
For you.

745
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:08,000
For you.

746
01:33:12,964 --> 01:33:15,007
Save me.

747
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,094
I love you.

748
01:34:57,902 --> 01:35:00,446
You're back.

749
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,330
I'm sorry.

750
01:35:09,497 --> 01:35:11,540
I had to.

751
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:15,419
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

752
01:35:16,462 --> 01:35:18,964
It's what I want.

753
01:35:31,185 --> 01:35:32,853
Hey.

754
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:36,023
Good to see you, buddy.

755
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:38,818
<i>With the thanks of a grateful nation</i>

756
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:42,154
<i>I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,</i>

757
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:46,450
<i>and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,</i>

758
01:35:46,617 --> 01:35:49,370
<i>human and mutant alike,</i>

759
01:35:49,537 --> 01:35:51,622
<i>Dr Hank McCoy.</i>

760
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:56,919
Way to go, fur ball.

761
01:43:45,596 --> 01:43:47,639
Morning.

762
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:54,813
Hello, Moira.

763
01:44:01,153 --> 01:44:02,738
Charles.

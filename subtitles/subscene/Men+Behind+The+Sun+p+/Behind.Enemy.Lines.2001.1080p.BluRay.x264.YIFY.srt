00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,992
(reporter) The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia,

2
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:24,797
and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal,

3
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:27,701
which should be complete by New Year's Day,

4
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:30,832
close to the US president's
"Home by the holidays " pledge.

5
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,773
Yet even as the conflict winds down,

6
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:38,645
the US military remains in a high state
of readiness, eager to answer the call.

7
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,585
(radio) Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. l've
got unknown rider not responding to coms.

8
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,519
Suspect hostile intent.

9
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:49,788
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.

10
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:02,902
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need to
get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

11
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,648
- Nose wheel.
- Check.

12
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,089
- Gun-blast diffuser.
- Clear.

13
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,422
- Right intake. Left intake.
- Check. Check.

14
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,088
- Ejection seat is safe. Arm handle.
- Copy. l show safe.

15
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,597
- Com lFF.
- Up and up. Let's go. Move it.

16
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,328
- DDl, MPCD and ETD.
- Go flight.

17
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:34,564
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- Lt's all green across the board.

18
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,834
- OK for start.
- Copy. OK for start.

19
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:40,502
- OK, right throttle, 15 per cent.
- Copy, 15 per cent. Go for two.

20
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:43,046
Two is up. ECS turbine is online.

21
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,241
Copy. Nozzle coming in at 73 per cent.

22
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:47,781
- Good to go.
- Copy. Good to go.

23
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:50,887
That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.

24
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,048
Cat four, abort.

25
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:56,457
- What?
- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?

26
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,587
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.

27
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:02,929
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,928
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace.

29
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,734
I cannot wait for this shit to be done.

30
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,810
OK.

31
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,738
Four more days.

32
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:24,748
You know what l was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

33
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,622
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.

34
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,992
Yeah, but you know what?
I bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

35
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:36,295
Or fly for a rock star. l mean, if anybody
needs a good pilot, it's those guys.

36
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,202
Whenever you turn around we've lost another
band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em.

37
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:42,906
I mean, it's sad.

38
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:47,137
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens
from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.

39
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:51,272
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...

40
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:55,646
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

41
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:08,393
Let me ask you something. How fast
do you think we're headed into the wind?

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,733
Chris, we're still on alert. lf Reigart
wanders up to the tower, we're dead.

43
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,504
All right, let's do it.

44
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,576
That's the spirit.

45
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:27,312
- Rutherford. Right here.
- Lncoming!

46
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:31,488
You guys ready for a
little lesson in physics?

47
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,786
You never learn, kid.
I'm gonna take your money this week.

48
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:37,361
Wind's blowin' up a gale.

49
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,063
I bet you 20 bucks each
l catch it when it comes back.

50
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:44,226
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?

51
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:47,498
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.

52
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,074
( "What'd l Say" by Ray Charles)

53
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,162
Hey, mama, don't you treat me wrong

54
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,199
Come and love your daddy all night long

55
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:22,440
All right now...

56
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:24,865
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!

57
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,240
That is awesome!

58
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:29,506
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!

59
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:33,106
Well, tell me what'd l say, yeah

60
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,812
Tell me what'd l say right now

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,548
Tell me what'd l say

62
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,749
Tell me what'd l say right now

63
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,227
Tell me what'd l say

64
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,221
Tell me what'd l say...

65
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,658
Wilson!

66
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:55,199
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.

67
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:16,354
This is a lot of sorties for an action
that's winding down, Leslie.

68
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,828
I'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

69
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:25,367
You understand how important it is that your
pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?

70
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,962
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.

71
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,172
The treaty depends on it.

72
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:35,335
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.

73
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:41,150
- What is this?
- L invited him to report on the battle group.

74
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:45,348
L'd like you to give him a tour of the
ship. Show him how everything works.

75
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:50,822
Admiral, l find the press to be an intrusive
presence. lt inspires showing off.

76
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,692
What's so funny, Admiral?

77
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:56,460
You, Admiral,
are just what the conflict needs.

78
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,971
- An uncomplicated man.
- L'll take that as a compliment.

79
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,107
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?

80
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,679
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.

81
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:14,150
- L know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.

82
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:17,653
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?

83
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:20,053
Well, we just finished up in Sarajevo,

84
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,922
and your Admiral wanted us
to pump you guys up.

85
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,188
Sounds like Reigart. "Be prepared."

86
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,630
Well, it's better to be prepared
than to be caught sleepin' in the field.

87
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:32,328
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.

88
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,363
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

89
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,171
Well, l'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.

90
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,072
You know, everybody has a role to play.

91
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:48,880
See, me, l'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.

92
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:52,889
You, you're a navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

93
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,428
You don't get to pick your fight.
It comes to you.

94
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,420
Yeah, l get it.

95
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,693
But at least give me a
fight l can understand.

96
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:07,264
Vukovar? Where's the place
we flew over the other day? Sreb...?

97
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,238
Srebrenica.

98
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,070
And good luck talkin' to someone at home:

99
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:14,838
"Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people."

100
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:19,474
"No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping..." lt's like a joke.

101
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,420
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. l am.

102
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,491
(shouting)

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,321
Look at these guys.

104
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,833
See, that's exactly what l'm talking about.

105
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:44,135
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.

106
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:47,177
And those days are over.
They are long gone.

107
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,547
I used to think l'd get a chance to do it.
Now l realize l'll be eating Jell-O.

108
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:55,511
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.

109
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,679
Lieutenant Burnett?

110
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:00,883
Admiral Reigart would like
to see you immediately.

111
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:04,018
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

112
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,028
Thank you.

113
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,621
Maybe he wants to give you
his daughter's number.

114
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,763
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good.

115
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,929
I don't know anything, Lieutenant.

116
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,442
Now, that is cynical. And Southerners
usually aren't that cynical.

117
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:22,172
I give you a compliment
on how great your alma mater looks,

118
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,011
and you think l'm tryin' to pump you
for information. What does he want?

119
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,017
I guess you'll have to see, sir.

120
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,855
- (knock at door)
- Come.

121
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,555
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

122
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,893
Lieutenant Burnett.

123
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,628
- Sir, about the football today, l know...
- l have your letter.

124
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:48,672
I understand you're interested
in leaving the navy.

125
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,641
Yes, sir. lt's time to move on.

126
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,940
If you don't mind my asking,
move on to what?

127
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,013
Sir?

128
00:09:56,114 --> 00:10:00,574
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

129
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,883
You've had an interesting
career, Lieutenant.

130
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,324
I remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

131
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:14,162
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd,

132
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:17,996
you received a non-punitive
letter of caution

133
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:22,004
for disorderly behavior
at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

134
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:26,099
Another letter a month later
for something involving Chinese New Year

135
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:28,672
at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.

136
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,442
One can only imagine what that was.

137
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:41,752
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant,
what happened to you?

138
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:46,052
Sir, l signed up to be a fighter pilot.
I didn't wanna be a cop.

139
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:51,727
I certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the
beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.

140
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:54,202
That and the routine on the ship
kinda wore me out.

141
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,603
- The routine?
- The routine.

142
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:01,434
What you don't know from experience
is that the routine, the systems checks,

143
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:06,540
the drills, the maintaining of discipline,
that's what you do to prepare for war.

144
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:10,578
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

145
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:15,022
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're
at war every time you step on this boat.

146
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,289
- You understand that?
- No, sir, l do not understand.

147
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,323
If we're at war, why don't we act like it?

148
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:26,494
Cos as far as l can tell, we go out,
we fly around and we come back.

149
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:32,733
Maybe we're pretending we're in the fight,
but we're not fighting, we're watching.

150
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:37,577
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.

151
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:41,743
Sir, l've given the navy seven good years.
I think l've served my country.

152
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:46,320
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

153
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:50,450
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.

154
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:54,520
You will serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

155
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,067
L'll keep your letter in my pocket.

156
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,605
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

157
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,648
You're dismissed, mister.

158
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,550
Sir.

159
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,267
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.

160
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,702
He's tellin' the truth.

161
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,799
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?

162
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,877
Oh, that's good.

163
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:44,141
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, l thought
you were kidding about getting out.

164
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:47,581
You telling me l gotta find another
navigator? ls that the deal?

165
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:51,121
I can't do it anymore. l'm done. l'm sorry.

166
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:09,803
(PA system) All hands. An air contact
believed to have originated in the North Pole

167
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:13,570
has been spotted
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

168
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:16,906
No, no, it's good to hear your voice.
No, no.

169
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:20,009
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.

170
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:23,018
They're putting up tinsel,
and it's very Christmasy.

171
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,180
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her l said "merry Christmas."

172
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,017
We're disappointed
that we won't be seeing you.

173
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,321
Well, you may get to see a lot of me soon.

174
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:35,263
Well, we understand. You got
important things to do over there.

175
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,129
Dad, l gotta go.

176
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,160
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, l gotta get goin'.

177
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:42,933
- All right, l love you.
- Bye.

178
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,611
That son of a bitch!

179
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,048
Did you see this? He put us
on the holiday mission. Goddammit.

180
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:59,145
- Well, at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.

181
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:04,159
- Lt's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.

182
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,298
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

183
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:08,287
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

184
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,268
Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.

185
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,966
He's got a brand-new car

186
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:20,810
Looks like a Jaguar

187
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,840
lt's got leather seats

188
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,585
lt's got a CD player...

189
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:31,211
("player" echoing)

190
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,859
Wouldn't it be great to look back
and there's Britney Spears?

191
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:46,767
But wait, she wants to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.

192
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,619
We'll start over again

193
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,730
Grow ourselves new skin

194
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,861
Get a house in Devon

195
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:23,196
Drink cider from a lemon

196
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,610
(TV) The CincinnatiAccord verifies Serbia's
commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia.

197
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:55,098
I welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.

198
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:23,422
Coordinates 3 0 1 5 0 6.5 1 1 5 0
confirmed. Sectors are all concurrent.

199
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:26,799
- You sure about that?
- L'm readin' it right here, pal.

200
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,172
Yeah, well, uh...

201
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:35,773
the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats,
cos we're flyin' over a lake.

202
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,915
Goddammit.

203
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:46,615
And a warm thank you to the US intelligence
community, ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:55,788
Yet another useless joyride at the cost
of mere millions to the US taxpayer.

205
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,599
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity
in section four alpha to our left.

206
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,865
Must be in that forested area.

207
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:07,467
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

208
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:11,742
Yeah, l know, l know. But the scope doesn't
lie. There it is. Let's check it out.

209
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,376
We're not supposed to fly that section.
The brass'll have a shit fit.

210
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:18,580
Hey, we're on recon,
so let's recon something.

211
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,920
Stack, it's probably just
some locals fooling around.

212
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:25,792
Could be a good opportunity
to test our shiny new digital camera.

213
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:29,297
Why do l listen to you?
All right, let's do it.

214
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:37,471
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

215
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,339
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.

216
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,050
- LDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

217
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:53,352
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.

218
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,963
Rolling digital.

219
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,238
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

220
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,635
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

221
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:58,585
(jet flying overhead)

222
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:07,130
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.

223
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:27,447
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!

224
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,540
What?!

225
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,186
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!

226
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,122
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

227
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:42,824
- L see a single missile tracking on us.
- L don't see it. Call my turn.

228
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,231
Slice left. Hard!

229
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,899
Jesus Christ!

230
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,098
Where is it?

231
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,175
Reverse right!

232
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,378
Try to break the lock!

233
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,252
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.

234
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,286
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.

235
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:15,298
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?!

236
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,890
I can't see shit! Where is he?!

237
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:31,014
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!

238
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:34,812
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- L got him! l got him!

239
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:41,955
(yells)

240
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,187
We need a bigger heat decoy.

241
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:58,032
We're screwed!

242
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:03,345
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!

243
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,705
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!

244
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,185
Good fireball!

245
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,793
Clear on top. Coming back down.

246
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:24,567
I got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

247
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,068
That's it! One down. Up we go.

248
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,877
- Where's the second?
- No joy. l don't have it in sight.

249
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,080
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.

250
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,186
Hard left.

251
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,847
- L'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!

252
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,888
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!

253
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:56,625
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?

254
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:02,928
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break!

255
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,770
I got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!

256
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,844
Nose break, right!

257
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:18,280
Shit!

258
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:31,224
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!

259
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:16,940
Goddammit.

260
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,231
(Christmas song plays)

261
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:25,309
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, l really like Christmas.

262
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,646
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.

263
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,182
Ark Angel Zero Six.

264
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,350
Burnett and Stackhouse.

265
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,985
Goddammit. l put 'em on
the holiday mission.

266
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,530
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.

267
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:45,466
We have a radar plot of flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

268
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,231
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

269
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,773
In the red is actual.

270
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:02,581
Lost contact is here.

271
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:06,085
They're off-mission.
What the hell happened?

272
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:10,250
It'll be tough to pick up a beacon signal,
even from a satellite.

273
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,521
The terrain is extremely rough.

274
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,460
Damn weather's sure not helping.

275
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:17,465
Contact Admiral Piquet,
alert NATO chain of command.

276
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:21,435
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep
out over all US national circuits.

277
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,631
And get through to Admiral Donnelly.

278
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,300
- No names.
- No names, sir.

279
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:48,554
Stack! Stackhouse!

280
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,167
Stack!

281
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:54,529
Are you OK?

282
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:56,537
Yeah.

283
00:25:57,007 --> 00:26:00,033
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm OK. You look terrible.

284
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,407
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.

285
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:04,878
Let me see this. Oh, man.

286
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:10,216
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.

287
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,855
Shit. Squeeze right here.

288
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,030
So...

289
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:24,556
where are we, Mr Navigator Man?

290
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,596
In the mountains north of Miciovic.

291
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,104
You think they saw us eject?

292
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,873
We are not gonna be around to find out.

293
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,141
Reigart'll be curious
what happened to his $40 million plane.

294
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:44,414
Forget it. l already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

295
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,318
What?

296
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:49,191
You think it'll work up there?

297
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,419
Yeah. Just get high enough.

298
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:56,759
All right. All right, sit tight.

299
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:01,597
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

300
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,269
Listen, l should've dodged
that second missile.

301
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:10,410
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you.

302
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:12,846
I thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

303
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:18,148
I used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.

304
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:36,803
Oh, God.

305
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,451
(cheering)

306
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,909
Oh, shit.

307
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,692
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

308
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,243
Urgh!

309
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,185
Oh, goddammit.

310
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:12,261
(muttering) Son of a bitch.

311
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:21,395
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

312
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,926
Not bombing mission, right?

313
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,436
You photograph?

314
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:39,715
(soldiers laugh)

315
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,815
You alone?

316
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:48,190
Correct.

317
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:46,706
No!

318
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:54,256
(whistles)

319
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:04,687
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.

320
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:11,231
(garbled over static) Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?

321
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:15,132
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's some interference.

322
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,536
It's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.

323
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,870
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.

324
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:24,345
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey
directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.

325
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,472
(beeping)

326
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,018
(beeping stops)

327
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:39,458
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?

328
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:40,897
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

329
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:43,627
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

330
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:50,005
Ark Angel is down. l say again.
Ark Angel is down, and l am on the run.

331
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:52,734
Slow down. What is your count?

332
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:01,380
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

333
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,880
No names over the net.

334
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,352
Confirm your last.

335
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,585
Minus one. Confirmed.

336
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:14,185
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

337
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,865
You're saying a uniformed soldier
killed your flight officer?

338
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:23,030
No, l'm saying they executed him.

339
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:27,007
They talked... They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

340
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,775
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

341
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:36,682
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. All l need is a ride.

342
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,446
Zero Six, consult your chart.

343
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,352
Reposition to rally point three.

344
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:49,526
I read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.

345
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,658
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just get to the rally point.

346
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:55,533
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.

347
00:35:57,473 --> 00:36:00,909
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.

348
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,740
Let 'em know l need a green light
to go get my boy.

349
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:07,068
Command and control
comes from Red Crown.

350
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:12,910
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.

351
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:14,949
Use advisedly.

352
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:18,043
I want gimbal attachments
for all fast ropers.

353
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:21,983
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

354
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,853
- (knock on door)
- Come.

355
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:29,258
Admiral, what's going on down there?

356
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:33,324
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

357
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,638
Who authorized a search and rescue?

358
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:40,641
- L did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.

359
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:45,673
Maybe l didn't make myself clear. We have
pilots down. One probably already dead.

360
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:49,548
Admiral, l have spoken personally
to Bosnian military commanders.

361
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:51,779
They say the shoot-down was perpetrated

362
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:55,984
by renegade forces
attempting to disrupt the peace process.

363
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:57,787
Of course they say that.

364
00:37:57,894 --> 00:38:02,593
They're also claiming, Admiral,
that your aircraft was way off-mission.

365
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:06,566
If we fly in there we create a shitstorm,
and the whole treaty will collapse.

366
00:38:06,669 --> 00:38:10,298
Admiral, Burnett says
that Serb troops murdered his pilot.

367
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:12,738
Is your pilot an expert on Bosnia?

368
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:16,505
Can he distinguish between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

369
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:20,673
Because l can't, and l've been
posted here for five years.

370
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,712
If your man is in danger,
he should get himself into a safe zone.

371
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:27,756
That is what he's briefed
and trained to do.

372
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:33,385
Listen, Leslie. l can have your fleet
commander order you to stand down,

373
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:36,090
or you can do it yourself.

374
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,646
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.

375
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:45,125
Zero Six, go ahead.

376
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:48,162
Zero Six is at rally point three
and standing by.

377
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:53,123
Zero Six, latest intel
says your current location

378
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:57,103
undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.

379
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,175
Say again your last.
I am at the rendezvous point.

380
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:05,169
You need to hump it out to a safe zone.

381
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:09,183
I set lP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,

382
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:12,652
Virginia 2-0. Read back.

383
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:28,604
No.

384
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:32,171
Negative. Negative.

385
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:35,777
I do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup?

386
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,939
I am good to go.

387
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:41,039
I say again, l am good to go now.

388
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,050
Burnett!

389
00:41:47,523 --> 00:41:53,223
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

390
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:57,760
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. l am very sorry.

391
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:02,366
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

392
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,497
Create some angles between
you and your pursuers.

393
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:10,272
Use your training. Use your head. Evade
and survive, and we will bring you home.

394
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:12,279
Understand? We will bring you home!

395
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:14,481
(shouting)

396
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,393
Zero Six?

397
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,626
Zero Six?

398
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:34,830
Someone's coming.

399
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,138
(frequency static)

400
00:42:44,914 --> 00:42:46,848
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.

401
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:49,884
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

402
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:08,036
We're tracking him in the SClF, sir.

403
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:10,405
On me.

404
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:31,727
At ease.

405
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:45,102
Sir, we were able to track the emergency
radio signal to somewhere in this radius.

406
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:49,837
It's pretty far away. But we think
the pilot transmission came from here.

407
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:59,251
This is imagery from a Northrop Grumman relay
satellite downlinked through Stuttgart.

408
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:03,758
We've hot-wired it for heat image,
and it's streaming in now.

409
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:06,885
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

410
00:44:16,505 --> 00:44:18,598
OK, here we go.

411
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,379
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

412
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:40,091
(shouts in Serbo-Croatian)

413
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:51,469
Fuck!

414
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:56,775
What's going on? He's down.

415
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:59,507
He been shot?

416
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:04,183
They're almost on him.

417
00:45:08,824 --> 00:45:10,917
Son of a bitch.

418
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,923
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

419
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,031
(Reigart) They're right on him!

420
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:35,083
What are they doing?

421
00:45:52,368 --> 00:45:55,201
(issues orders)

422
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:10,818
What's goin' on?

423
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:26,726
Has he been killed?

424
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:19,617
He's moving. That's him.

425
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:28,587
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.

426
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:32,360
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.

427
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:34,299
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.

428
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:38,703
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for chrissakes!

429
00:47:38,807 --> 00:47:40,775
We're down. lt's cooked.

430
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:45,379
I want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?

431
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:47,244
Yes, sir.

432
00:48:19,281 --> 00:48:21,181
- (knock at door)
- Come.

433
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:26,887
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

434
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,816
I was trying to motivate him, Tom.

435
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:33,485
Sir?

436
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:35,995
Burnett. ln the radio room.

437
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:38,794
I was...

438
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:44,134
l was trying to motivate him,
but... maybe l carried it too far.

439
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,265
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.

440
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:51,470
Just human, sir.

441
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,975
- Tom.
- Sir?

442
00:48:58,454 --> 00:49:02,356
It's why l push 'em so hard.
For times like these.

443
00:49:10,933 --> 00:49:13,197
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.

444
00:49:13,302 --> 00:49:17,398
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

445
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,875
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got
a guy on the ground, and we're sittin' here.

446
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:23,945
It's a complicated situation.

447
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:26,606
Why isn't this all over the news?

448
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:31,618
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale,
or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out?

449
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:34,879
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.

450
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,448
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

451
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:43,523
Now, this kid might not have
the best attitude, but he's no idiot.

452
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:47,932
- He says he's gettin' shot at, l believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?

453
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:52,234
Command tells me l gotta sit on my hands.
What else can l do?

454
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:55,840
Right.

455
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:58,777
I forgot. lt's not your call.

456
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:01,711
You're damn right it's not my call!

457
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,487
Apology, sir. Of course,
you can't do anything.

458
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,940
(TV) lt's been confirmed that an American
combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet,

459
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:08,141
has been shot down over Bosnia.

460
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,584
It was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia
at around 6:00 yesterday morning.

461
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:13,211
Mr Burnett?

462
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:16,917
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator
is believed to have survived.

463
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:18,151
It's about your son.

464
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,626
Their names are being withheld,
pending notification of their next of kin.

465
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:25,967
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down.

466
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:29,196
It's the Serbs who control
most ofsouthern Bosnia,

467
00:51:29,304 --> 00:51:31,602
but they allege insurgents are to blame,

468
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:35,108
and say they're doing everything
to help locate the crew.

469
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:40,170
It's also unclear what, if any, impact this
incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...

470
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,872
Admiral.

471
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:46,708
You and l have known each other
for how long? Five years?

472
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:48,872
Something like that.

473
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:53,114
L've always commended your work
to your superior officers.

474
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:55,813
L've sent you information
whenever you requested it.

475
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,083
Thank you, sir. l appreciate your support.

476
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,557
And this is the thanks l get?

477
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:04,160
We have one disagreement
over how to handle a downed pilot,

478
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,061
and you stab me in the back?

479
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:09,897
You go to the media, to my contact,
and you make me look like an asshole.

480
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:13,495
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

481
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,235
Our man is down behind enemy lines!

482
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:18,776
Now what the fuck is the problem?!

483
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,877
Do you have any idea how much damage this
incident may cause to the peace process?

484
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:28,147
All l know, Admiral, is that the American
people want their pilot back.

485
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:32,782
Exactly! Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

486
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:37,753
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

487
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:42,358
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

488
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:47,431
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

489
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:54,371
You might have helped save
your man today, Reigart.

490
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,006
And l emphasize might.

491
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:01,884
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

492
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,363
(distant clanking)

493
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,573
(child's laughter echoing)

494
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,154
(echoing laughter continues)

495
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,775
(adult voice)

496
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,338
(truck engine starts)

497
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:39,938
Shit!

498
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:45,975
(men shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

499
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:29,695
Shit.

500
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:50,916
Argh!

501
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:24,266
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel.

502
00:59:24,377 --> 00:59:25,435
(knock at door)

503
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:27,743
They've got a signal. lt's Burnett.

504
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:32,181
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six.

505
00:59:32,285 --> 00:59:35,584
I'm on course with your last instructions.

506
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:37,956
(breathing heavily)

507
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:43,017
Am keyed up and waiting for your...
waiting for you to name the fairway.

508
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:47,089
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son?

509
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,232
I don't know. You tell me, sir.

510
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:56,070
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself,
uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.

511
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,143
Understood?

512
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:07,148
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.

513
01:00:07,253 --> 01:00:09,244
Good for birds?

514
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,755
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.

515
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:16,522
You need to get there, stay out of trouble
and Big Mother will pick you up.

516
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:18,256
Next contact at, um...

517
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:19,522
1700.

518
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:21,600
Roger.

519
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:35,270
Alpha Whiskey?

520
01:00:36,048 --> 01:00:37,640
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.

521
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:46,189
Sir, l shouldn't have left Stackhouse.

522
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:52,231
Distract him.

523
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:57,394
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was
garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.

524
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,063
How's it holding up?

525
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:08,173
The gear's good. l have a basic pack.

526
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:10,647
I left some of it at the crash site.

527
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:16,853
I guess l got rattled
when l ejected at Mach 3.

528
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:22,918
You still got your boots,
haven't you, cowboy?

529
01:01:23,029 --> 01:01:25,759
Roger. They were tied on.

530
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,828
You got it made.

531
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,501
You're an optimist, sir.
See, l had you figured for a grouch.

532
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:45,141
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.

533
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:47,346
Roger.

534
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:50,048
Are you gonna be there, sir?

535
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,624
That's affirmative, son. Out.

536
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:00,296
He's here.

537
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:02,765
Yes, sir. l suggest we place him here.

538
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:07,134
It's open ground near the town of Hac,
well inside the safe zone.

539
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:11,042
All right, let's go for the extraction.

540
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:54,152
(Reigart) ..command area responsibility.
Ingress will be north, egress south.

541
01:02:55,154 --> 01:03:01,252
From the radio contacts, you can see he has
basically circled back towards the crash site.

542
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,763
Call sign is "Avalanche."
Authenticate: "Romeo Two, X-ray."

543
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:11,336
Continue: "Bulldog." Delay: "Cycle."
Abort is "Washdown."

544
01:03:12,071 --> 01:03:15,598
Aircraft down is "Cobalt."
Success is "Ripper."

545
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:19,774
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

546
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:24,572
Bravo will establish a perimeter, then
haul ass back to the helo on my command...

547
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:26,618
Admiral Reigart.

548
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,984
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

549
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:32,717
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly.

550
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:36,591
I have spoken with Admiral Donnelly
and have his full support.

551
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,687
You will stand down.

552
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,945
( "The Wanderer" by Dion on radio)

553
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,287
(Stackhouse, whispering) Chris.

554
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:24,629
( "The Wanderer" continues)

555
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:35,775
Hey!

556
01:05:50,629 --> 01:05:52,290
Yeah.

557
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:16,512
You American?

558
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:22,223
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

559
01:06:24,029 --> 01:06:25,826
Nine millimeters?

560
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,535
Nine millimeter.

561
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,637
Do you have water?

562
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,766
Water? No water.

563
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,455
Thanks.

564
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,264
It's good.

565
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,294
Ice Cube.

566
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:42,033
Yeah. l like lce Cube.

567
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,338
I like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.

568
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:49,472
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

569
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:51,977
(raps) They said stop, freeze

570
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:56,282
l got froze up
because l'm public enemy number one

571
01:07:56,555 --> 01:07:58,921
One, one, one, one

572
01:08:02,428 --> 01:08:05,226
That's good. That's good, that's good.

573
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:20,010
You know where we're going?

574
01:08:20,112 --> 01:08:21,079
Hac.

575
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,671
Hac? That's good. Good.

576
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,689
Jesus Christ!

577
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:44,632
Tell him to go!

578
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,234
Hey, come on! Come on!

579
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,267
Hey. Bonjour.

580
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:52,060
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?

581
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:55,732
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. l'm an American
soldier that's been shot down.

582
01:09:55,841 --> 01:09:57,934
Shut up.

583
01:09:58,544 --> 01:10:00,944
(speaking Serbo-Croatian)

584
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:05,442
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking photographs.

585
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:08,019
Photographs of what? Of what?!

586
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,355
Lokar's come back here again,
killing everyone.

587
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:16,258
It's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children,
women... Buried them up in the hills.

588
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:19,296
In the hills?
Yes, l saw them. l saw the graves.

589
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:25,236
Yes, l saw them. l saw
the bodies in the hills.

590
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:27,897
Tell him. l am an American.
I am on your side.

591
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:31,908
- That's what l'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.

592
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,875
Tell them you are an American.

593
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,709
- They don't kill American.
- Lce Cube, tell them.

594
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,750
Tell this guy that we have
photographs that can help...

595
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:43,288
Bullshit!

596
01:10:43,388 --> 01:10:45,583
America say they make them sign deal.

597
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:51,890
- L swear to God...
- But they already break it!

598
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:55,057
America government for shit! Now go!

599
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:09,979
(heavily distorted breathing)

600
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,170
(static)

601
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:01,154
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

602
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,193
(gunfire continues)

603
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,551
Hey, hey, hey...

604
01:15:40,652 --> 01:15:42,586
lt's OK. lt's me.

605
01:15:44,156 --> 01:15:45,953
Come on.

606
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:01,399
Time?

607
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:03,406
Three minutes, sir.

608
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,285
Stop! Shh.

609
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:17,715
(distant helicopter)

610
01:16:28,467 --> 01:16:30,401
Let's go.

611
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,779
(phone rings)

612
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:54,849
Reigart.

613
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,259
(Piquet) Leslie, l'm
afraid there's bad news.

614
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:04,066
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac.

615
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,935
I regret to inform you
that Lieutenant Burnett is...

616
01:17:09,674 --> 01:17:10,766
dead.

617
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,868
- L am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.

618
01:17:24,022 --> 01:17:28,083
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.

619
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:31,492
Yet once again in Bosnia,
that's proved an illusion.

620
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:34,394
And in the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave,

621
01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:36,933
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found

622
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:40,698
the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett,

623
01:17:40,805 --> 01:17:43,569
whose plane was shot down two days ago.

624
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:49,774
The Serb authorities are claiming
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas,

625
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:53,544
opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.

626
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:58,311
(CNN reporter) The Serbs say the body
was discovered by one of their teams

627
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:03,122
in a search-and-rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.

628
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:07,255
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's
hopes for a clean exit from the Balkans,

629
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:12,667
and frustrates US military leaders, only
days away from a withdrawal from Bosnia.

630
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:16,600
(Sky reporter) For NATO's forces
on the eve of their departure,

631
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:20,838
the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death
comes as another dark blow

632
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:26,578
at the end ofa disturbing and ultimately
unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.

633
01:18:33,325 --> 01:18:35,816
Savior Six, Savior Six
from Gold Eagle command.

634
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:38,225
Be advised the package is not in position.

635
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:42,528
Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.

636
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:54,043
Hey!

637
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:56,306
Hey! Wait!

638
01:19:06,558 --> 01:19:08,526
We're here!

639
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:12,819
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!

640
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:15,257
We're right here!

641
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:18,300
You've gotta be shitting me!

642
01:19:30,282 --> 01:19:32,978
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

643
01:19:33,084 --> 01:19:35,348
- Captain...
- We did nothing!

644
01:19:37,589 --> 01:19:38,920
We did nothing.

645
01:20:04,683 --> 01:20:06,742
We were right here.

646
01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:09,312
We were right... Fuck!

647
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:14,787
What's that?

648
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:12,810
It's not safe here. We'll keep going.

649
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,287
No. You go.

650
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:27,488
They killed my pilot
because we took pictures of the graves.

651
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:29,191
And l know where they are.

652
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,963
And l'm gonna get 'em,
so he didn't die for no reason.

653
01:21:41,713 --> 01:21:43,874
Don't follow me.

654
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,950
It's safer here.

655
01:24:05,223 --> 01:24:06,884
Shit.

656
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:09,926
Goddamn. Why is this off?

657
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,798
Why is this off? Why is this...?

658
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:39,687
(bird squawking)

659
01:24:45,897 --> 01:24:47,865
Come on.

660
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:51,901
Come on! Goddammit!

661
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:58,633
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.

662
01:24:59,577 --> 01:25:02,011
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

663
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:14,217
(PA) For the information of all hands,
this ship will be relieved on station.

664
01:25:14,325 --> 01:25:19,092
It will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.

665
01:25:33,811 --> 01:25:38,248
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SClF.
- All right, thank you.

666
01:25:38,349 --> 01:25:40,010
(beeping)

667
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,087
lt's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.

668
01:25:43,187 --> 01:25:46,213
The only way to reactivate it
is from the seat, manually.

669
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,959
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

670
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:54,197
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar
with our systems to reactivate that beacon.

671
01:25:54,298 --> 01:25:56,789
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup.

672
01:25:56,901 --> 01:26:00,667
It's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.

673
01:26:00,772 --> 01:26:02,899
Sir, l agree.

674
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:08,110
Sir, we really should notify NATO command,
or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.

675
01:26:08,212 --> 01:26:13,741
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, l get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

676
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:17,343
Piquet was very clear
with his objections, sir.

677
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:19,818
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it.

678
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:24,725
I'm not gonna let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

679
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,186
OK. All right. OK.

680
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:03,316
OK, all right.

681
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:07,592
Goddamn!

682
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:18,005
(explosion in distance)

683
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:43,267
Gentlemen,

684
01:28:43,835 --> 01:28:46,861
l wanna make one thing
clear before we leave.

685
01:28:48,339 --> 01:28:50,967
I intend to put you in harm's way.

686
01:28:52,276 --> 01:28:57,475
Any man who doesn't wish to join
this mission, step away right now.

687
01:29:07,758 --> 01:29:10,420
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

688
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:28,859
About two clicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

689
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,100
(helicopters approaching)

690
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,889
(beeping)

691
01:32:54,585 --> 01:32:55,609
(yells)

692
01:32:59,223 --> 01:33:00,588
Argh!

693
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:17,530
Argh...

694
01:33:20,978 --> 01:33:23,503
(rumbling)

695
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:39,062
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

696
01:33:53,811 --> 01:33:55,779
(Reigart) There he is. There he is!

697
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:17,129
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?

698
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,667
Come on!

699
01:34:33,684 --> 01:34:35,675
Come on! Come on, kid!

700
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,195
It's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.

701
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,747
Goddammit!

702
01:35:24,134 --> 01:35:25,692
Come on!

703
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:26,963
OK.

704
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:48,647
Go!

705
01:35:48,759 --> 01:35:51,421
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.

706
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:53,723
Sir, he's on the rope.

707
01:36:02,706 --> 01:36:05,607
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

708
01:36:07,044 --> 01:36:08,773
Come on, son. Come on!

709
01:36:15,219 --> 01:36:16,516
Go!

710
01:36:34,738 --> 01:36:37,298
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

711
01:37:09,807 --> 01:37:11,866
Hey, Chris.

712
01:37:11,975 --> 01:37:13,943
Hey, Glen.

713
01:37:14,445 --> 01:37:15,412
Admiral.

714
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:23,976
This is why they killed Stackhouse.

715
01:37:32,529 --> 01:37:34,326
Admiral?

716
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:38,595
You were holding a letter for me.
L'd like to get it back.

717
01:37:39,336 --> 01:37:41,361
I think l can find it.

718
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:01,253
( "The Rescue Blues " by Ryan Adams)

719
01:38:20,077 --> 01:38:23,774
And everybody wants to see you suffer

720
01:38:27,084 --> 01:38:30,679
They know that you need the pain so much

721
01:38:34,191 --> 01:38:40,289
They throw you up a rope
when you're too high to cruise, baby...

722
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:43,797
Lord, you lose, lady

723
01:38:45,469 --> 01:38:48,905
Then they charge you with the rescue blues

724
01:38:53,811 --> 01:38:56,803
The rescue blues

725
01:39:06,223 --> 01:39:09,454
And everybody wants to see you fall

726
01:39:13,163 --> 01:39:17,429
That's why they always love
to get you high, high

727
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:25,901
And everybody knows
you need the pain so much, lady

728
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:29,105
Keep in touch, baby

729
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:35,242
Just don't charge me
with your rescue blues

730
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:38,548
Oh, oh

731
01:39:39,756 --> 01:39:42,281
Rescue blues

1
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,419
You love me a lot...

2
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,490
So so.

3
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,249
Give me a beer and a brandy...

4
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,370
Who are your parents, kid...

5
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,850
RUJITZA is.

6
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,219
You're Zivina's child?

7
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,255
Fuck him.

8
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,251
He was my coach...

9
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,815
You look like him...

10
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,898
Your mum looks like him...

11
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,614
A proper lassie...

12
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,572
Known you when you were little.

13
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,016
Because you are old.

14
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,897
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS

15
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,411
AND THREE DAYS,

16
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,848

SWEET, SWEET MOTHER

18

TO COME OUT OF JAIL.

19
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,128
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS

20
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,416
AND THREE DAYS NOW,

21
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,574

TO BRAID MAY HAIR.

24
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,614
I'VE BEEN ILL,

25
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,612
AND I'VE BEEN HEALTHY,

26
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,135
I'VE HAD MOONLIGHT,

27
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,413
I'VE HAD BRIGHT SUN

28
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,219
NEVER HAD MY

29
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,815
SWEET, SWEET MOTHER.

30
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,970
GLANCING AT MY BREASTS?

31
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,132
GLANCING AT THEM, YOU OLD BASTARD?

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,298
DON'T YOU LAY A FINGER ON ME,

33

MY SWEET MOTHER

34
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,017
WILL COME FOR ME,

35
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,419
NO ONE HERE

36
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,617
WILL EVER HARM ME,

37
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,419
SHE WILL WATCH OVER ME,

38
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,298
MY SWEET MOTHER.

39
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,811
THERE'LL BE BEER

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,859
MY HAIR WILL BE NEATLY BRAIDED,

43
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,296
I WILL BE A GIRL

44
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,895
WELL LOVED.

45
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,335
A coffee, some fine food,
Couldn't give a fuck.

46
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,377
A sweet fruit juice, a healthy life
style, staring at the telly,

47
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,888
Couldn't give a flying fuck. O yes.

48
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,294
What do you have in store
for me, day?

49
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,810
...a load of shit, that's what...

50
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,334
,, Not Working Today!"

51
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,574
,, Singles Acomodation Hostel"

52
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,090
A fine peace of meat, I tell you

53
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,179
Such a fucking fine one!

54
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,939
The things that you brought, wow!
She comes over today

55
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,500
And flowers on top!

56
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,659
- The child's asleep.
- Good.

57
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,093
Let's have a wee drink.

58
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,219
No.

59
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,053
What's the fuck Beli?

60
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,495
You pussy!

61
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,089
Just a wee drink, mate.

62
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,097
Not me.

63
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,009
Suck it.

64
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,939
Huso, my old buddy,

65
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,170
You should see my son in law

66
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,970
No cock on him. Oh, yeah.

67
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,739
Get off,

68
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,774
Have a drink of water,
eat something.

69
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,458
Have a drink of water,

70
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,259
It has to be nice when she arrives,
Go to bed.

71
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,939
Aw,

72
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,931
You broke my arm, you pussy.

73
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,056
Morning love.

74
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,412
Eat shit, get the fuck out,
Shame on you, you cunt.

75
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,135
You screwed up the welcome party?

76
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,376
The whore's coming out today.

77
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,979
I got the dog from downstairs.

78
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,574
Just picture that King,

79
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,294
She comes over to take my house,

80
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,335
- See what I mean?
- Yes...

81
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,090
She comes, and bam,

82
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,333
The dog swallows her.

83
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,339
She won't yake your house?! It's just
about fit for you and the dog.

84
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,419
Why whould she take it?

85
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,809
I'd give anything for Zivina's baby,

86
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,538
Anything, no doubt.

87
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,939
But the whore should die.

88
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,738
Die and rot, the whore,
Murdering my brother like that.

89
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,648
She murdered him, hey!

90
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,099
And when the day goes by,

91
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,694
And when the night has passed,

92
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,296
I'm on my way to my grave,

93
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,577
I'm on my way to my grave.

94
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,616
And when the flowers bloom,

95
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,651
When clouds all swell with rain,

96
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,017
I'm on my way to my grave,

97
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,376
I'm on my way to my grave.

98
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,009
And even though I'm young,

99
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,612
I'm on my way to my grave,

100
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,016
For I have no one,

101
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,778
No one to walk with me...

102
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,410
...all the way there

103
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,139
,, TO HIS BELOVED COACH ZIVINA.
THE KING."

104
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,700
Oh! How cold the soil is,

105
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,137
and I so long...

106
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,450
...for everything I don't have,

107
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,335
I don't have

108
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,299
I'm gonna work and work,

109
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,775
walk all the way to my grave,

110
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,496
if only...

111
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,574
...I had someone to walk me there.

112
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,498
Oh come my darling,

113
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,419
come now,

114
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,379
let's start our walk to the grave,

115
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,255
for I have no one,

116
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,098
no one,

117
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,289
to walk me there.

118
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,615
Are you hungry, dad?

119
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,499
Have you eaten?

120
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,499
You haven't, it shows...

121
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,728
I have, I have...

122
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,732
Don't fool me, love,
Eat something.

123
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,008
I've eaten.

124
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,538
You're such good girls,

125
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,498
My little birds...

126
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,175
Everything's the same at King's.

127
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,656
Give us a tenner if you go there.

128
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,498
I will.

129
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,738
She should go for a walk...

130
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,896
- Should I give her some money?
- Well, yes.

131
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,331
Granny's little bastard...

132
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,612
I wanna go somewhere.

133
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,612
No way!

134
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,575
It was my treat, shithead.

135
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,573
First time ever,
and I should kiss your arse.

136
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,092
Kiss it.

137
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,890
I have a house,

138
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,215
Around a house.

139
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,539
I have a pair of eyes,

140
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,100
Through the gate,

141
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,489
I have some bread

142
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,255
Around the bread.

143
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,615
I have a house,

144
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,612
Around the house.

145
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,379
I have flowers

146
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,530
Of all colours,

147
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,009
I have a drink,

148
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,931
Around the drink.

149
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,819
I have myself

150
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,259
And things to wear,

151
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,059
It's only you,

152
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,972
That I don't have.

153
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,659
Only my eyes

154
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,979
I do not have,

155
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,539
Arms I don't have

156
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,008
To hold me close,

157
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,489
No one to sing

158
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,939
My song for me,

159
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,249
Like long ago,

160
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,258
So long ago.

161
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,650
Arms I don't have

162
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,179
To hold me tight,

163
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,579
No one to sing

164
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,048
My song for me,

165
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,219
It's only you,

166
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,699
I do not have,

167
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,009
To look at me,

168
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,933
In the morning light.

169
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,330
Ah, Zivina,

170
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,613
My sweet brother...

171
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,099
You should see your daughter.
She's all grown up now.

172
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,134
King's so good
With your brother.

173
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,058
King is a proper man.

174
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,289
And I'm piece of shit.

175
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,090
He heard you. Cut the bullshit.

176
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,251
Ah, pal...

177
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,015
Everyone likes to live.

178
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,731
Well, he likes it too...
Just look at him...

179
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,776
Give my little brother a drink.

180
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,098
And the girl with him too...

181
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,490
Uncle's little beauty.

182
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,578
Uncle's pissed himself!

183
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,490
What are you laughing at?

184
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,090
You aren't even able to piss.

185
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,019
You'll piss inwards,
In your mouth,

186
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,209
You'll piss through your mouth.

187
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,139
That's how you look after
Your brother's child...

188
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,052
I look after her, and you're a whore.

189
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,300
Zivina, my brother
should have killed you,

190
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,779
Not the other way around.

191
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,859
My brother's six feet under,

192
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,976
And the whore walks in the sun.

193
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,536
Looking good, King...

194
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,653
You've got a fab watchdog here,

195
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,331
A fab one!

196
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,250
Home.

197
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,500
Let go!

198
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,771
A little something...

199
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,499
Do you do anything kid?

200
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,491
A little.

201
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,011
Don't.

202
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,849
You're not dangerous.

203
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,978
- You're not like your mother.
- What do you know?

204
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,297
The whole town knows.

205
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,533
Your father Zivina could carry bricks
In his shoes all day long,

206
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,259
And yet she did him in
With a butcher knife,

207
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,619
Your mother's vicious.

208
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,373
Zivina was beating her,
She beat him up once and for all.

209
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,253
Shut up...

210
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,779
I want to be with you.

211
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,530
- You're pretty.
- I'm ill. Get off, will you.

212
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,058
What do you want anyway?

213
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,898
Bugger off...

214
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,337
Put it away.

215
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,139
Bedtime...

216
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,451
Wow!

217
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,459
Someone's made some money abroad...

218
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,094
You look as if you were
on a holiday...

219
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,410
There's white on you head, King.

220
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,578
I'm just as I was.

221
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,171
Pour me something special...

222
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,852
I'm pouring...

223
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,299
What will you do now?

224
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,099
All sorts of things.

225
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,375
Good for you...

226
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,690
I love you, you know.

227
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,331
I don't love anyone.

228
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,329
Good for you.

229
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,095
Pour me some more...

230
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,977
I'm pouring...

231
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,089
Don't you need me?

232
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,771
You're all alone, King.

233
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,298
You're not getting any younger.

234
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,859
You're beautiful, Ruzica,
you make me hard,

235
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,328
Come over whenever you like.

236
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,859
That is it, Duchess.
Have you forgotten?

237
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,696
Cry when no one can see you.

238
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,774
Who was the one to visit you?

239
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,538
You were.

240
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,329
Who was the one waiting for you?

241
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,292
You were.

242
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,496
Just this one time, Ruzica,

243
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,978
Just this one time.
I'll never wait for you again.

244
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,257
Never again.

245
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,853
Why do you make me cross
Beli, you doll?

246
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,976
You've been making me
cross my whole life,

247
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,055
You snot.

248
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,851
Go on...

249
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,689
Doing great, doing great...

250
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,171
Don't, dont... Get up!

251
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,096
Let's go, let's go, let's go...

252
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,251
Go on, go on...

253
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,858
If I must have a life,

254
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,891
Why don't I have a mother?

255
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,295
Why don't I have a father?

256
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,015
Why are my sisters evil?

257
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,015
Why are my brothers beasts?

258
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,575
My mother is the gutter,

259
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,093
My father's the filthy stream.

260
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,977
My grandpa is the old sky,

261
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,456
My grandma is the long road.

262
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,493
If I bathe in a clear stream

263
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,092
Maybe, I'll come out young.

264
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,532
Someone might have me...

265
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,177
...for a wife.

266
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,818
Someone might have me...

267
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,934
...for a mother.

268
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,531
I don't like my mother,

269
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,893
I don't like the gutter.

270
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,818
What are you sitting there for?

271
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,779
I'm done cleaning.

272
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,532
Look at that...

273
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,892
What...

274
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,816
You've worked for a month,
You're only screwing things up.

275
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,133
What do you think life is about?

276
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,051
Did they leave together?

277
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,537
Did they?

278
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,297
Noooo!

279
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,779
What are you doing here?

280
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,008
What are you looking at, shitpot?

281
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,297
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Don't tell me what to do, bitch!

282
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,059
I am not a bitch. You are a bitch.

283
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,419
I should've strangled you
When you were a pound of meat.

284
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,379
I should've given you away.

285
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,979
I should've thrown you away.

286
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,899
I let you suckle on me,
for a whole year, bitch.

287
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,892
And now you turn into a monster.

288
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,372
Why are you sad?

289
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,896
My mother doesn't love me.

290
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,488
Who?

291
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,689
Me.

292
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,771
I don't know of anyone
Loved by his mother.

293
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,779
Your mother didn't love you?

294
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,974
You will.

295
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,935
No I won't.

296
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,930
My father might've loved me.

297
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,535
- Are you letting him have some pussy?
- Shut up.

298
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,699
She won't...

299
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,977
...you have to take it.

300
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,138
Shut up.

301
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,299
No one's throwing you out,
Better off staying with your folks.

302
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,337
Mine threw me out over
and over again...

303
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,012
Some bride.

304
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,170
Shut up, you.

305
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,651
God willing.

306
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,850
What do you want?

307
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,697
I'm bored.

308
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,292
I'm off to town...

309
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,611
Stay with me.

310
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,975
I'm going...

311
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,898
...for everyone to see me.

312
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,570
For whom to see you?

313
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,214
See if I give a fuck.

314
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,530
Shall I sleep here?

315
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,098
Go on.

316
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,890
Tell me something nice.

317
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,253
No.

318
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,333
Hope you die if you don't love me.

319
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,530
Hope to die.

320
01:07:59,100 --> 01:07:59,976
Go there.

321
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,849
Here?

322
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,055
There.

323
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,414
You're looking at me, my love...

324
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,100
You're looking at me
And I'm thinking,

325
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,819
I'll die if you stop,
I'll die if you carry on.

326
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,334
I'd like to go with you...

327
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,368
...to the white world.

328
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,214
Here's a world for you...

329
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,533
Where is he?

330
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,409
Well,

331
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,936
You see,

332
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,250
He can take and mount that thing

333
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,816
And go where he pleases...

334
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,738
That...

335
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:31,938
Haven't seen my child
for six bleeding days.

336
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,848
You're used to longer than that.

337
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,811
You used to have a cock once, too.

338
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,174
It is what it is.

339
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,772
Look at how soiled she got here.

340
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,739
Fucking little fool.

341
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,859
She was a beautiful baby, dad?

342
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,859
You were a more beautiful one,
If you ask me.

343
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,578
She was bald.

344
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,293
Bald.

345
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,368
Did you love my dad?

346
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,488
Fuck off kid.

347
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,015
And my mother, did you love her?

348
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,811
As if you know what a mother is.

349
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,859
Did Zivina beat my mother?

350
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,259
Did mum and dad love each other?

351
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,739
Stop bugging me.

352
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,137
You want me to leave.

353
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,376
I want a break, baby doll,
I need some air.

354
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,255
You do like me.

355
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,491
Don't get boring.

356
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,015
- Did you get tired of me?
- What's the fuck to you?

357
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,776
I'm having a baby.

358
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:40,975
What?!

359
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,377
I'm having a child.
You stupid or what?!

360
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,134
Watch your mouth when you're
talking to me, you little scum!

361
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,819
If my father were alive today,
He'd fuck your dead mother.

362
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,138
My head hurts more and more
Ever since I laid my eyes on you.

363
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,257
Wait, I want to tell you something.

364
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,138
Both you and that slut of yours,
Can go fuck yourselves.

365
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,649
Let me tell you something.

366
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,693
I've been looking at you
my whole life.

367
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,452
I've looked after you my whole life
and you betray me.

368
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:11,619
You're nowhere to be found when there's
grief, only when there is fun...

369
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,736
- I didn't know...
- You come here now?!

370
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,215
I didn't know it...

371
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,770
I wish you were dead...

372
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,615
I'm not well.

373
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:53,216
You know how to fuck. Yet you
don't know how to buy a condom.

374
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,419
You're so stupid.

375
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,297
Shut up.

376
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,218
I'll be blind as a cock.

377
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,219
Blind as a cock...

378
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,895
Look,

379
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,294
That's not how King will do it.

380
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,373
- What do you want?
- A word with you.

381
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,059
I want to tell you.
I fucked it all up.

382
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,860
It's what it is,
I'm sick Duchess.

383
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:03,849
I'll go blind and then I'll die.
Nothing more.

384
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,456
Just a little while longer.

385
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:18,499
I want to make Rosa my wife.

386
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,578
Why her?

387
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,249
I'm fond of her.

388
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:33,731
She's pregnant with me.
That's why I sent her away.

389
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,770
You're gonna be a grandmother!

390
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,092
You're gonna be a grandfather.

391
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,058
What did you just say?

392
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,614
You're gonna be a grandfather.

393
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,375
What are you saying?

394
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,299
Rosa is your child.

395
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,930
She's got nothing to do with Zivina.

396
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,775
Zivina knew.

397
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,773
He set out to kill you.

398
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,288
That's when I...

399
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:18,657
He gave her an ugly look, too...

400
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,048
...ugly...

401
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:59,375
What do you want me
to tell you, King?

402
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,374
Thanks for the chocolate,

403
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,137
You needn't have bothered.

404
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,699
Does he take care of her?

405
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,498
I couldn't give
a cunt's fart about that.

406
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,652
But thanks for chocolate.

407
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:21,217
All is gone, King, huh?

408
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,899
Is it hard... Huh?

409
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:29,379
It's always been like that for me.

410
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,292
Always hard.

411
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:51,337
By the crystal mountain stream...

412
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:08,335
There laid the woods and the greens.

413
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:23,373
And a worried maiden there,

414
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:39,571
Was speaking through her tears

415
01:27:55,140 --> 01:28:00,976
Come back to me, my gallant hero,

416
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:15,974
come, so valiant and young

417
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,536
It's on your chest...

418
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:32,056
...on your chest, that I will die.

419
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:40,455
Your chest, all on fire.

420
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:51,256
We were born on the same year,

421
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,733
I used to carry your schoolbag.

422
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,170
My sister was raped,

423
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,619
My mother I never knew.

424
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,212
I was a child,

425
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,297
Grew up right then.

426
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:14,411
No one dared lay a finger on you.

427
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:20,578
You're the only one
who ever loved me.

428
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,133
Came to my house, ate and drank,

429
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:30,453
you're the only one
who ever loved me,

430
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,573
I'll wait for you in hell,

431
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:41,653
I'll take you by the hand,

432
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:47,529
That's where I will kiss you,

433
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:52,493
That's where I will...

434
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,371
...kiss you.

435
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:16,055
I'll go out for a while
And then I'll be back.

436
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,939
I'll be waiting.

437
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,609
Who's that?

438
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,176
Me, who else?

439
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,059
Check it out,

440
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,297
I got new tires.

441
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,059
And the heaters, and the handles...

442
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:30,335
A hundred horsepowers...

443
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,012
Can ride it to the end of the world.

444
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:07,339
I banged on, oh mother,

445
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:10,339
I toiled, oh father,

446
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:13,619
The pit took my days of youth,

447
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:16,771
The life took my days of joy,

448
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,779
Worked in foreign lands, oh mother,

449
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,977
Strangers'lands they were, oh father,

450
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:28,695
Bought a crazy horse
With greasy tires on it,

451
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,379
I own a pub, a great big pub,
Where people can rejoice.

452
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:40,372
The road was kissing me,

453
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,333
And the merry skies.

454
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,779
Now my old age is lonely, oh mother,

455
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:58,773
My old age is blind, oh mother.

456
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:05,059
I will never fly no more,

457
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:08,177
I will never kiss no more,

458
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:11,179
I will never fly no more,

459
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,299
No more,

460
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,972
Never, no more.

461
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:18,734
I am the King,

462
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:23,370
Got me a daughter,

463
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,738
I am the King,

464
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:31,210
Got me a loving wife,

465
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,616
I am the King.

466
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:39,010
I banged on, oh mother,

467
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:42,139
I toiled, oh father,

468
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:45,337
The pit took my days of youth,

469
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,378
The life took my days of joy.

470
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:52,413
I am the King,

471
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,294
Who's got no eyes,

472
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,813
I am the King,

473
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:03,611
Who's got no nothing,

474
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,172
I am the King.

475
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,179
I'll never fly no more,

476
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:25,419
No more will I set eyes
on my loving daughter,

477
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:28,219
no more will I kiss my beloved wife.

478
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:32,099
A curse on the pit, oh mother,
A curse on life, oh father,

479
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,019
A curse on the king.

480
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,819
Who's gonna hear how I feel,
Who's gonna hear me cry,

481
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,859
Who's the King gonna cry to?

482
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:41,932
The King flees like a doe,
The King cries like a pussy,

483
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,897
The King is no more,

484
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,173
No more.

485
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:49,094
I am the King,

486
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,493
Who's got no eyes,

487
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:56,100
I'm the King,

488
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,056
Who's got no nothing,

489
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,859
I'm the King.

490
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,415
I know your scent.

491
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,619
What do we do now?

492
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:01,578
I'll let you have her.
Come tomorrow.

493
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:06,779
She must not know.

494
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,099
No.

495
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,939
Why won't you kiss me?

496
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,253
You're the only one I love.

497
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,779
I've been waiting for you
to stop being angry.

498
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,816
Kiss, I can't wait anymore.

499
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:49,493
- I'll never kiss you again.
- Why not?

500
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,779
You must kiss me.

501
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,735
No.

502
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,252
You have to!

503
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:08,851
- No.
- Please!!!

504
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,651
Mum...

505
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:51,049
Give me your hand...

506
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:53,569
Now the other...

507
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:07,739
You go with Beli now. You know.

508
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:10,937
Go on, mother loves you.

509
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,379
Go on, Beli, you doll,
That's how it is.

510
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:21,258
If you love Ruzica, love her child
and her grandchild too.

511
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,978
Go on...

512
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,017
Go on...

513
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,291
Go on!!!

514
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:27,129
Alen Musovic - KING
- 1966-2009

515
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:59,699
We'll come to you, where you are,

516
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,332
To your festive tables,

517
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:07,453
To your shiny gardens,

518
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:13,898
We'll come to you, where you are,

519
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:17,613
Where you swine are fattened,

520
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,653
Where your gold is flowing,

521
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:24,297
We'll come to you, where you are,

522
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,370
We'll be saying, here we are.

523
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:34,138
We will drink from your eyes,

524
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:40,098
We will eat from your stash,

525
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:46,855
With golden spoons.

526
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:51,176
When the night falls,

527
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,969
When beloved night falls,

528
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:04,493
Our sad eyes won't show,

529
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,339
Our bare feet won't show.

530
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,498
We'll do it tomorrow,

531
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,454
And the day after tomorrow,

532
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:22,289
And then we will fall down,

533
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:26,128
We will fall down in rows.

534
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:32,929
Nothing will remain, oh!

535
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,929
The merchants will trade on,

536
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:41,289
The high and mighty
will stick to their kin,

537
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:45,449
There will be winter in spring.

538
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:51,216
The gutter is our mother,

539
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:55,810
Misery our sister.

540
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:02,896
Hunger rubs against her,

541
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,129
Our brother is the blade.

542
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:13,095
Blue sky is our father,

543
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:17,699
Blue sky so far away,

544
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:20,089
And the earth will kiss us,

545
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:23,219
Long into the night,

546
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:25,575
Closing our eyes,

547
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:30,253
Closing our eyes.

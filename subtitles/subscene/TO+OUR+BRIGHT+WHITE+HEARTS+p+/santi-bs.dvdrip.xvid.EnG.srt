1
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,151
It's mine.

2
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,344
-Get down.
-You're not allowed!

3
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,784
-Good day, Mr. Phipps.
-You're not allowed!

4
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,049
Get down.

5
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,487
You'll have no supper if you keep that up.

6
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,828
-Hello, Joy.
-Hello.

7
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,902
-Is all well?
-Very good. Thank you.

8
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,170
-Hello.
-Hello.

9
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,206
-Good morning, Joy.
-Hello.

10
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,103
-Sorry.
-Welcome.

11
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,443
Where is Mr. Keats?

12
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,411
I'm afraid he is not joining us.

13
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,881
He's in Mr. Brown's half of the house.

14
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,779
Hello.

15
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,609
Hello.

16
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:14,125
The very well stitched Little Miss Brawne
in all her detail.

17
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,627
Good morning.

18
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,862
What is this? What have I done?
How have I offended?

19
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,435
I don't shake hands with the enemy.

20
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,471
An enemy? What have I done to you?

21
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:33,306
You do nothing to me or for me,
and that's how I'd prefer to keep it.

22
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,105
What?

23
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,751
Your offense is to my fashion, Mr. Brown.

24
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,818
Oh, dear.

25
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,387
To which I'm ''so helplessly slavish.''

26
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,423
I have been ill-quoted.

27
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,959
''Her obsession
with flounce and cross-stitch''?

28
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,289
Cross-stitch? Miss Brawne,

29
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,798
-I don't even know what that means.
-For goodness' sake. Baiting, baiting.

30
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,269
I feel the same about your poems,
Mr. Brown.

31
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,200
I know nothing of what they mean.

32
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,831
They puff smoke, dissolve,
leaving nothing but irritation.

33
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,503
Fanny, take this tea to Mr. Keats.
He is in very poor spirits.

34
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,008
Mr. Keats is composing
and does not want disturbing.

35
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,820
It's my finding in the business of disturbing,
you're the expert.

36
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,856
Fanny, why not speak to one of us
you hold in higher favor?

37
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,186
I'm praising him!

38
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,260
-Fanny.
-Please, Fanny.

39
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,694
I'm wanting to know what you shall say
about Mr. Keats.

40
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,494
I've been waiting two weeks
that I may enjoy your opinion.

41
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,001
I cannot look upon him without smiling.

42
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:36,167
And he is quick with his thoughts,
though now they are mostly sad.

43
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,900
His brother Tom's not at all better.

44
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,409
Very diminished.

45
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,109
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

46
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,175
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

47
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,276
-Is there no other family member?
-No. The parents are both dead.

48
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:53,454
There is only a much younger sister
and a brother who lives in America.

49
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,031
Come in.

50
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,111
You like jokes, Mr. Keats?

51
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,771
I like jokes.

52
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,410
Mr. Brown, I warn you,
does not like my jokes.

53
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,018
He complains I care for nothing but fashion.

54
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,293
Would you like biscuits?

55
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,195
You've come to spy.

56
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,061
Spy?

57
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,739
How will you describe me? My character?

58
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,267
I am not the least interested
in your character.

59
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,047
My jacket, then? Or my pantaloons?

60
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,688
You need a new jacket,
that's what I would say.

61
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,158
Is that all?

62
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,123
It should be of velvet, blue velvet.

63
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,637
Tell me, Miss Brawne,
how can you be so sure?

64
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,601
Well, all I wear,
I've sewn and designed myself.

65
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,643
I'm often told
I am clever to exception about design.

66
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,308
I originated the pleats on my dress,
which are charming...

67
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,217
Has she annoyed you sufficiently?
She has done brilliant well with me.

68
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,987
Men's room, out.

69
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,324
Poets got to do a bit of writing.

70
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,491
My stitching has more merit and admirers
than your two scribblings put together.

71
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,364
Goodbye, minxstress.

72
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,871
And I can make money from it.

73
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,399
Yes?

74
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,176
Have you got John Keats' poem book...

75
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,643
<i>-Endymion?
-Endymion, yes.</i>

76
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,307
Yes, I've not heard much good about it.

77
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,386
I've not sold one and took 20.

78
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,149
My sister has met the author,
and she wants to read it for herself

79
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,387
to see if he is an idiot or not.

80
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,950
Unwrap it.

81
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,537
Read it.

82
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,180
''A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

83
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,518
''Pass into nothingness, but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep

84
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,094
''Full of sweet dreams, and health
and quiet breathing''

85
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,120
-Stop.
-''Therefore, on...''

86
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,065
''Yes, in spite of all

87
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,375
''Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits''

88
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,380
I'd love to speak with Mr. Keats.

89
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:08,730
''A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

90
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,569
''Pass into nothingness''

91
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,007
<i>You've read Endymion.</i>

92
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,975
I wanted to adore it.

93
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,912
-But you hated it?
-I can't say.

94
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,017
Are you frightened to speak truthfully?

95
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,387
-Never.
-Well, tell me then.

96
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,456
No. I'm not clever with poetry.

97
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
Well, neither, it seems, am I.

98
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,272
-Still I have some hope for myself.
-I think hope useful.

99
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,343
-But...
-Hope and results are different.

100
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,113
One doesn't necessarily create the other.

101
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,349
Would practice help?

102
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,784
It might.
I wasn't always able to stitch so well.

103
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,090
This is the first frock
in all of Woolwich or Hampstead

104
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,256
to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.

105
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,697
Isn't that an identical one behind you?

106
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,114
My card's completely full.

107
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,521
But you don't dance, Mr. Keats.
I love to dance.

108
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,691
I don't feel like dancing.

109
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,494
Is your brother still ill?

110
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,893
He's no better.

111
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,832
My father was ill
for as long as I can remember.

112
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,870
He died when I was still very young.

113
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,305
Excuse me.

114
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,607
Miss Brawne, may I?

115
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,720
Mama!

116
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,327
Fanny has cut my ribbon,
and she never asked.

117
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,232
What are you doing, Fanny?

118
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,700
Trying to bring some comfort
to a dying man.

119
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,136
What dying man?
Where are you taking them?

120
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,904
I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats' brother
anything that's not perfect.

121
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,856
It's me. Miss Brawne.

122
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,190
I have something to deliver to Mr. Keats.

123
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,162
Leave it at the door.

124
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,233
-Is he not there?
-We're working, Miss Brawne.

125
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,340
I have something for your brother, Mr. Keats.

126
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,647
Invite her in. Brown!

127
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,922
You disgusting ape.

128
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,864
Be careful as you enter the ape's cage.

129
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,961
Sit next to me, Miss Brawne.

130
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,639
My prospects in the world feel very faint.

131
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,508
This room is so poorly cared for.

132
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,316
Please try one.

133
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,886
I'm anxious they'll cause him to choke.

134
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,987
No! Try another and I swear I shall bite you.

135
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,256
Take care. She has sharp teeth.

136
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,698
She has sunk her fangs into my poor poem
and shook it apart.

137
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,869
<i>I am very sorry I couldn't love
your Endymion completely, Mr. Keats.</i>

138
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,232
Perhaps I did not say,

139
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,277
but I thought the beginning of your poem
something very perfect.

140
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,676
But don't leave us. You can see for yourself,
nothing is happening.

141
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,221
All we do is lie about the room all day,
begging for inspiration.

142
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,985
Please, tell me what I should do.

143
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:27,828
Miss Brawne,
we monkeys just want a little company.

144
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,436
Well, I gave him the biscuits.

145
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,336
Mr. Brown kept...

146
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,479
If we've finished tiffing,
come and say hello to Tom.

147
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,885
It might cheer him.

148
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,654
We'll have to ask Mama.

149
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,313
-No, we don't, Toots.
-Yes, we do.

150
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,958
Isn't that so, Samuel?

151
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,094
We have to stick together.

152
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,756
I'm going. You'll have to come with me.

153
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,166
Would you like to go by the pond
or through the woods?

154
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,902
I've explored all these paths, which are more
in number than your eyelashes.

155
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,878
My eyelashes?

156
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:25,751
You know, it amazes me
you can sit opposite Mr. Brown all day.

157
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,621
I've never heard him say one thing of wit.
Not one.

158
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,198
-You favor wit?
-I rate it the highest.

159
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,637
-You like the fashionables?
-Yes, I do.

160
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,844
Men who say things that make you start
without making you feel?

161
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,536
Things that are amusing.

162
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,639
I know these dandies.

163
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:57,014
They have a mannerism in their very eating
and drinking, their handling of a decanter.

164
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,422
You are making an attack on me?

165
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,959
No, I am defending
Mr. Brown's generous, good heart.

166
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,524
By attacking myself.

167
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,936
Forgive me.

168
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,235
I've been too long at my brother's sickbed.

169
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,848
Can we not still appreciate clever humor?

170
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,054
Thank God! He's been calling out for you.

171
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,928
Come in.

172
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,994
John.

173
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,135
-I didn't... I didn't...
-Tom.

174
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,073
-What?
-Tom, get back into bed.

175
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,305
-I don't know. I was having this dream.
-It's all right. I'm here now.

176
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,377
-I'm here.
-Where have you been, John?

177
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,815
-I just... I was worried.
-Calm now. Calm.

178
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,820
It's all right. I'm here.

179
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,589
It's so hot in this bed.

180
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,060
I was so scared for a while.

181
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,159
-Calm down.
-I just panicked.

182
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,730
I want to go. I want to leave. It smells.

183
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,934
Or I'II cut your hair in the night.

184
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,343
-Good evening, John.
-Young man, how are you?

185
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,038
Good evening.

186
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,241
Well, Keats,
I hope you've not forgotten your bassoon.

187
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,283
Of course not. It's in my waistcoat pocket.

188
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,421
-Hello, Mr. Keats.
-Hello, Minx.

189
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,911
How's Tom?

190
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,955
Gentlemen of the orchestra,
just through here.

191
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,957
Ladies, straight ahead, please. Thank you.

192
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,083
Hurry on, gentlemen.

193
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,355
Is he showing any signs of improvement?

194
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,863
Don't ask me of Tom, Minx.

195
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,833
The only good I can do
is say how I love him.

196
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,669
Hurry on, gentlemen.

197
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,073
Shall we open the claret?

198
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,612
<i>Someone submitted anonymously
to The Examiner a most exquisite sonnet</i>

199
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,358
composed on the subject of whether
Love itself could be the 10th muse. Severn!

200
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,425
-Come on.
-En garde!

201
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,652
Right.

202
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,494
That's my sword, you brute.

203
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,157
Love the 10th muse?

204
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,238
It's full of the most perfect allusions
and really beautifully realized.

205
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,533
I thought at first it might be one of yours.

206
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,367
<i>We were just telling Mrs. Brawne
of John Keats' review in Blackwood's.</i>

207
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
Was it so very bad?

208
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,316
''No man could have profaned and vulgarized

209
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:48,449
''every association in the manner which has
been adopted by this 'son of promise.'''

210
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,963
Did they not admire the opening?
It was perfect. Even I could know that.

211
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,432
-Do you Like poetry, Miss Brawne?
-No.

212
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,264
Poems are a strain to work out.

213
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,435
John, we are talking, or are about to talk,

214
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,807
<i>of your defense
of Mr. Keats' poem Endymion.</i>

215
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,038
Yes.

216
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,613
''I have clung
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen

217
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,722
''Or felt but a great dream! O I have been

218
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,689
''Presumptuous against Love
against the sky

219
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,524
''Against all elements, against the tie
Of mortals each to each''

220
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,894
The rhythm is beautiful and unique.

221
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,627
There are rhymes, but not on the beat.
They're quiet, but binding.

222
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,761
And the repetitions set you up to fly.

223
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,537
''I have clung
To nothing, lov’d a nothing, nothing seen''

224
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,236
And here you come out
''Or felt but a great dream!''

225
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,401
It's beautiful.

226
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,708
Well, there are immaturities,
but there are also immensities,

227
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,578
and that is what they didn't say.

228
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,912
It was said. You said it, Brother.

229
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,348
Thank you.

230
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,921
Very bravely.

231
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,691
Ladies, the Hampstead Heathens
are about to begin.

232
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,456
-Reynolds?
-I thought I'd been expelled.

233
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,089
No. I think not. You're very much needed.

234
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,484
Mr. Keats is dead.

235
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,091
Mr. Keats is dead. So young.

236
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,835
Is it Tom?

237
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:37,517
I woke with the strange sensation
of someone holding my hand.

238
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,590
I opened my eyes, and there was John.

239
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,720
I knew immediately what had happened,
and then he said,

240
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:50,597
''Tom died at 8:00, quietly and without pain.''

241
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,466
Of course, he can't go on living there,

242
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,478
so I have invited Mr. Keats
to come and stay with me.

243
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,546
Well, we do have a Long schedule of visits.

244
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,447
I don't want to interfere with your city plans,

245
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,349
but you are most welcome
to have dinner with us.

246
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,480
-Minx? Are you unwell?
-We have provided and set the table.

247
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,954
No, no, no, not at all.

248
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,151
-I've never seen you so quiet.
-I would appreciate it.

249
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,825
We do have some city business.

250
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,429
She sewed it all night Long.

251
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,541
It's a pillow slip.

252
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,552
Then I will rest Tom's head upon it.

253
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,498
Keats, the Reynolds are expecting us.

254
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,524
I'II catch you up. Thank you.

255
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,637
Invite me again, alone.

256
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,069
Come for Christmas.

257
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,810
Yes, please do join us, Mr. Keats, please.

258
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:20,290
But Marianne Reynolds invited us
for Christmas. Remember?

259
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,950
You were there when she said it.
They're having musicians.

260
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,618
I am sorry to spoil things.

261
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,527
Not at all. Wherever Mr. Keats is happy,
we're happy for him.

262
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,533
-Thank you, Mrs. Brawne.
-But why can't he be happy with us?

263
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,963
Perhaps Mr. Brown wants
Mr. Keats all to himself.

264
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:39,067
I am merely remembering to Mr. Keats
a previous engagement.

265
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,405
Miss Brawne, I thought we were conversing.

266
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,558
''Dear Mrs. Brawne.
May I yet join you for Christmas?

267
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,671
''I have not the health
nor the heart to be anywhere

268
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,104
''but with a family such as your own.
John Keats.''

269
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,714
Thank you.

270
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,540
I was wondering this morning
if you're sleeping in my bed.

271
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,210
Pardon?

272
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,877
You see, I believe you are.

273
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,252
We rented Mr. Brown's half of the house
this summer

274
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,655
while you were journeying in Scotland.

275
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,488
Which room do you sleep in?

276
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,521
The one overlooking the back garden.

277
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,496
That was my bed.

278
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,598
For proof, pull it from the wall

279
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,502
and by the pillow, you will find a figure
I drew with pin holes.

280
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,233
Is the figure you?

281
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,905
It's a fairy princess.

282
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,049
-Should I be feeding her?
-She refuses to eat.

283
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,551
Would you teach me poetry?

284
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,730
I'd... I'd Like to understand it.

285
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,493
I don't know how to begin.

286
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,398
<i>And it's three to the right.</i>

287
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,831
Two, three. Three to the left.

288
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,565
Two, three.

289
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,350
And down. And keep it going.

290
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,844
So that's the English drawing room.

291
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,955
And this is something
that I saw in Scotland.

292
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,993
They kick,

293
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,465
and they jump,

294
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,903
and they twirl it,

295
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,073
and they sweat it,
and they tattooed the floor Like mad!

296
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,422
What about a poem?

297
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,288
-Yes. Please, Mr. Keats.
-A short one.

298
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,264
''When I have fears that I may cease to be

299
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,197
''Before my pen has glean'd
my teeming brain

300
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,472
''Before high-piled books, in charact'ry

301
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,942
''Hold Like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain

302
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,522
''When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face

303
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,694
''Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance''

304
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,967
-I do apologize. I've gone blank.
-You're tired.

305
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,737
Should you Like some sweet?

306
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,505
Shall we have coffee and sweet?

307
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,389
Come through to our side.

308
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,138
I've come for my poetry class.

309
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,617
Your poetry class?

310
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:54,186
Poetry classes!
Keats, are we teaching poetry today?

311
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,489
I hope I don't disturb.

312
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,530
Take a seat.

313
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,764
Have a look at that.

314
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,902
A poet is not at all poetical.

315
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,675
He is the most un-poetical thing
in existence.

316
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,381
He has no identity.

317
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,554
He is continually filling some other body,
the sun, the moon.

318
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,659
I cannot restrain my credibility longer.

319
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,262
Miss Brawne,
is this really you or are you acting?

320
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,393
-It's really me.
-Is it?

321
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,861
Charles, I have a pupil.

322
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,397
-Desist or depart.
-Apologies.

323
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,725
My modest hope is that the cost
of the lesson will not be the poet.

324
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,888
The cost of the lesson is that Mr. Keats
will forthwith discuss poetry with me.

325
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,258
You don't mean to read the poems?

326
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,527
Until I know all the poets and poems
in the world,

327
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,933
since I've nothing to do,
as you so many times have noted.

328
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,903
I bow to your ambition.

329
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,552
Now he's gone, I shall find it easier to talk.

330
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,166
Can you say something
of the craft of poetry?

331
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,239
Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham.

332
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,139
If poetry does not come as naturally
as leaves to a tree,

333
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,248
then it had better not come at all.

334
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,452
I am mistaken.

335
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,917
I am not sure I can teach you.

336
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,327
Was I too rude? I... I can apologize.

337
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:19,530
I'm not sure I have
the right feelings towards women.

338
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,337
I'm suspicious of my feelings.

339
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,706
Do you not Like me?

340
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,746
I'm attracted to you without knowing why.

341
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,680
AII women confuse me, even my mother.

342
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,230
I yearn to be ruined by shrews
and saved by angels,

343
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,961
and in reality,
I've only ever really loved my sister.

344
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,906
I'm annoyed by my sister
as often as I Love her.

345
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,571
I still don't know how to work out a poem.

346
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,483
A poem needs understanding
through the senses.

347
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,581
The point of diving in a lake

348
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,453
is not immediately to swim to the shore

349
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:22,623
but to be in the Lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water.

350
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,330
You do not work the lake out.

351
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,067
It is an experience beyond thought.

352
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:37,639
Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

353
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,883
I Love mystery.

354
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,786
I found your fairy princess
on the wall in my room.

355
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,352
And you could make her out?

356
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,122
She wears a butterfly frock.

357
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,828
Shall we continue?

358
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,775
Mr. Keats is very brilliant.

359
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,123
I'm not sure he really likes me.

360
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,923
He prefers Toots and Samuel, even our cat,
who he is always petting to death.

361
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,931
Mr. Keats knows he cannot Like you.

362
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,297
He has no Living and no income.

363
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,989
Mr. Keats isn't here.

364
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:04,200
He said to tell you he had a sore throat
and thought it best to stay on in Chichester.

365
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,531
Samuel, hello.

366
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,832
You don't believe me. Come in.

367
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,101
Come in.

368
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,742
There, no Keats.

369
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,083
Tell us, what Chaucer did you read?

370
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,153
AII of it.

371
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,717
<i>Also, Mr. Spenser,
Mr. Milton, and The Odyssey.</i>

372
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,157
That's a lot to read in one week.

373
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,297
<i>What did you think of The Odyssey?</i>

374
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,629
Thank you.

375
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:45,108
I am yet partway through it,
but I have read all Mr. Keats has written.

376
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,071
Have you?

377
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,321
''Out went the taper as she hurried in

378
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,924
''Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died

379
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,288
''She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin

380
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,867
''To spirits of the air, and visions wide''

381
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,961
<i>And... And what, Miss Brawne,
did you make of Paradise Lost?</i>

382
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,140
-I... I liked it.
-Did you?

383
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,876
You didn't find Milton's rhymes
a little pouncing?

384
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,405
No.

385
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,544
-Did you not?
-Not very.

386
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,133
Is it the material of her dress that makes
Miss Brawne's eyes so amber-Like?

387
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,065
Yes, they are golden.

388
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,903
-Amber almost.
-Yes, yes.

389
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,237
What color are yours, Mr. Brown?

390
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,309
Mine?

391
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,349
-Suitcase brown.
-Fanny!

392
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,953
Did you see Mr. Brown? He was amazed.

393
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,663
Well, all those authors in just one week
is a bit incredible.

394
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,929
I know.

395
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,772
But he sees I'm serious.
And I will read them.

396
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,350
Fanny, it's a letter.

397
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,392
I think it's a valentine.

398
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,550
''Darling Valentine, I am not sure
if you should have a kiss

399
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:14,420
''for your amber enchantress eyes
or a whipping.

400
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,792
''Yours, the Suitcase.''

401
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,612
Fanny,

402
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,056
Mr. Keats is behaving very oddly.

403
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,158
Should I invite him inside?

404
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,544
-Mr. Brown sent you a Valentine?
-I think it was a joke.

405
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,986
Keats! Keats! John, wait.

406
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,796
-John.
-I was away but 10 days, Brown,

407
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,925
with you encouraging me
to stay on and get well.

408
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,263
-John, easy.
-Now,

409
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,702
you write Miss Brawne a valentine card.
Are you lovers?

410
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,068
-John.
-Is that the truth?

411
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,369
-Easy.
-You sent a card, Charles!

412
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,205
You have the income to marry,
where I have not.

413
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,505
Did you accept him, Miss Brawne?

414
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,740
John, I sent that valentine...

415
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,645
It was only a jest.

416
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,016
For whom? I'm not laughing.
Miss Brawne is not Laughing!

417
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:56,684
John, I wrote the valentine to amuse Fanny,
who makes a religion of flirting.

418
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:57,953
John, she's what?
A poetry scholar one week

419
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,462
-and, what, a military expert the next?
-You disgust me.

420
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:06,696
It is a game. It is a game to her.
She collects suitors. John... John...

421
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,637
There is a holiness to the heart's affections.
Know you nothing of that?

422
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,884
Believe me, it's not pride!

423
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,006
You're in Love with Mr. Brown?

424
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,483
Why don't you speak?

425
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,955
She can't speak because she only knows
how to flirt and sew.

426
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,487
Isn't that right?

427
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:17,797
Yes, and read all Milton,
whose rhymes do not pounce, Miss Brawne,

428
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,933
because there are none!

429
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,469
John, there are one or two of her kind

430
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,343
in every fashionable drawing room
of this city,

431
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,817
gasping over skirt lengths.

432
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,117
I'm sorry.
We can have a poetry Lesson tomorrow.

433
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,251
No! I want to dance and flirt,

434
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:42,593
talk of flounces and ribbons
till I find my old happiness and humor.

435
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,410
What if the dwarf were to die in Act 2?

436
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,779
And then we could introduce
the princess sooner.

437
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,421
The princess.

438
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,624
Perhaps Act 3 could begin with a tempest.

439
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,827
What else do you think?

440
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,785
We're going to live next door.

441
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,448
The Dilkes are moving to Westminster,
and we get six months half rent!

442
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,554
So we'll be in the same house.
We can all play football.

443
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,660
It's a great economy for Mama.

444
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,159
But only if you Like.

445
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,566
Have we broken for the day, Keats?

446
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,099
Keats!

447
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,013
-Throw the rope up.
-Excuse me, miss.

448
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,182
There should be another one of them.

449
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,522
But if the princess has already abandoned
the dwarf,

450
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,027
I mean, cannot we keep his Love speech?

451
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,057
We have to change it.
Find another place for it.

452
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,632
-We could give the Love speech to...
-Look out!

453
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,702
Sorry, right in the face.

454
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,845
Brown? Brown!

455
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,715
Oh, no!

456
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,151
-What was that, Toots?
-Oh, no!

457
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,501
If Mr. Keats and myself
are strolling in a meadow,

458
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,701
lounging on a sofa or staring into a wall,
do not presume we're not working.

459
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,079
Doing nothing is the musing of the poet.

460
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:16,177
Are these musings what we common people
know as thoughts?

461
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,719
Thoughts, yes, but of a weightier nature.

462
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,849
Sinking thoughts?

463
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,123
Not really, Miss Brawne. Musing,
making one's mind available to inspiration.

464
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,528
Mr. Brown?

465
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,334
As in amusing?

466
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,572
Mr. Brown, our thoughts are all very simple,

467
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,869
so you never need worry
about interrupting us.

468
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,207
And we should be happy
if you would join us for dinner on any day.

469
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,193
Can I choose which bed?

470
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,867
Mr. Keats.

471
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,888
They're sniffing all the flowers in the garden
to try and find the best scent.

472
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,521
Mr. Keats is being a bee.

473
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,864
Thank you.

474
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,165
Fanny!

475
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,269
Come in.

476
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,335
I need your help.

477
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,629
Lie to me.
Tell me you did not dance last night.

478
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,072
I did not sit down a single tune.

479
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,635
You can see the truth in my slippers,
completely scuffed.

480
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,739
I don't know how I could have prevented it.

481
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,818
I don't want to sit and wait under the trees
while you talk.

482
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,615
-I want to go and play on the swing.
-AII right.

483
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:44,225
-Lovely.
-I'm not! Don't go lower. Go higher. Higher.

484
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,623
No. A bit Lower.

485
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,914
I had such a dream last night.

486
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,985
I was floating above the trees

487
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,791
with my lips connected
to those of a beautiful figure

488
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,164
for what seemed Like an age.

489
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,597
Flowery treetops sprang up beneath us,

490
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,572
and we rested on them
with the lightness of a cloud.

491
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,611
Who was the figure?

492
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,263
I must have had my eyes closed,
because I can't remember.

493
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,467
And yet, you remember the treetops.

494
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,134
Not so well as I remember the Lips.

495
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,852
Whose lips? Were they my lips?

496
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,887
Fanny?

497
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:13,776
Fanny?

498
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,382
Fanny?

499
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,213
Fanny!

500
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,517
<i>Mr. Brown bet I couldn't find
the nightingale's nest.</i>

501
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,254
<i>There is no nest and no bet.</i>

502
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,166
That one over there.

503
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,497
You couldn’t have seen it in a tree.
They don't nest in trees.

504
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,105
I know what I saw. It was a nightingale.

505
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,926
''Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest

506
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:19,695
''In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay''

507
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,271
See, here, there are tears.

508
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,838
You're so far ahead of me and above me.

509
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,010
Brown, I'm amazed.

510
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:47,320
Your writing is the finest thing in my life.

511
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,903
You wrote this, Little hand, did you do it?

512
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,086
As one who truly loves you,

513
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,246
I must warn you kindly
of a trap that you are walking into, John.

514
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:19,123
If you are going to speak of Miss Brawne,
we have never agreed and cannot agree.

515
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:23,562
For one or two of your ''slippery blisses,''
you'll lose your freedom permanently.

516
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,329
You will be slaving at medicine
15 hours a day and for what?

517
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,395
To keep Mrs. Keats in French ribbon.

518
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,206
I cherish your talent. I truly do.

519
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,782
Then allow me my happiness,
for I am writing again.

520
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,014
<i>''My heart aches,
and a drowsy numbness pains</i>

521
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,606
<i>''My sense, as though of hemlock
I had drunk</i>

522
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,351
<i>''Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</i>

523
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,458
<i>''One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk</i>

524
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:30,761

But being too happy in thine happiness</i>

525
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,495
<i>''That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees</i>

526
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,204

What?

539
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:53,612
Have you told Miss Brawne
of our summer holiday, or shall I?

540
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,051
Not as yet.

541
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:08,021
Mr. Brown is doing his summer rental,
so we both have to Leave.

542
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,103
We're meeting up on the Isle of Wight
for some undisturbed writing and carousing.

543
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,351
Mrs. Brawne, may I speak to Fanny, please?

544
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,152
No, I will not speak to him.

545
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,990
Fanny, I was going to tell you.

546
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,635
Fanny, I have no money.

547
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,968
In fact, I am in debt.

548
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,881
I must earn. I must write and make a Living.

549
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,250
If I fail, though I hate to think on it,

550
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:07,186
then I must make way so another may marry
and adore you as I wish to.

551
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:13,489
No! I will not be adored ever again
by you or by anyone!

552
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,264
I hate you!

553
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,581
Anything?

554
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,159
No. Nothing.

555
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,394
Nothing.

556
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,038
Fanny, will you check my stitch?
It's an open-work seam.

557
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,110
God.

558
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,311
No, Toots. I don't care a damn for stitches!

559
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,166
-No letter?
-Not today.

560
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,309
Am I in Love?

561
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,651
Is this Love?

562
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,528
I shall never tease about it again.

563
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,993
So sore I believe one could die of it.

564
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,532
<i>''My dearest lady,</i>

00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,474

did not weigh so upon me.</i>

571
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:06,533

not very cruel to have so entrammelled me,</i>

572
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,735

573
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,911
<i>''For myself, I know not how to express
my devotion to so fair a form.</i>

a fairer word than fair.</i>

576

<i>''Three such days with you
I could fill with more delight</i>

577
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,893

578
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,602
I Love you.

579
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,867
I Love you, Toots.

''Bedewed with pleasures.''

602
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:49,022
-There's no air.
-No, Mama, they Love the heat.

603
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,292
We're going to lose them.

604
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:56,428
Listen, ''I Love you more in that I believe
you've Liked me for my own sake.

01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,480
Mama, don't be cross.

608
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,454
When I don't hear from him,
it's as if I've died,

609
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,996
as if the air is sucked out from my lungs

610
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,158
and I am Left desolate,
but when I receive a Letter,

611
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:30,466
I know our world is real.
It's the one I care for.

612
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,076
Watch the butterfly.

613
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,512
Well, move it.

614
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,456
-Fanny wants a knife.
-What for?

615
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,623
To kill herself.

616
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,871
It's all over.

617
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,902
I have such a short letter after all this time.

618
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,375
No, Topper!

619
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,083
Saying he was in London, in London,

620
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,251
and couldn’t bring himself to visit
for fear it would burn him up!

621
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:30,020
He's made no fortune and is ashamed of it.

622
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:34,728
If only he knew how Little I, even you,
care for that now.

623
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,345
You missed that one.

624
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,191
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,903
Mama asked me to welcome you home
and introduce you to Miss O'Donoghue,

626
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,977
our new maid who may also do for you.

627
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,910
Please, sir, call me Abigail or Abby.

628
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,715
Very well. Be sure you do not enter
if the door is closed.

629
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,045
Yes, sir.

630
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,460
Mr. Keats is not coming back.
He has gone to Live in London.

631
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,633
Please tell Mr. Keats that we Brawnes
have kept safe all his things.

632
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:59,015
Mr. Brown has said that
I could learn to read still.

633
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,318
I said to him, ''Sure, what would I read?''

634
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:08,259
And he said, ''Abigail, even the Bible
is not so dull as you might believe.''

635
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:13,494
And that in the Songs of Solomon,
there are some bits so juicy,

636
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,161
they'd make even a churchman blush.

637
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:20,204
And he said that when I get down
to the reading myself,

638
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:23,642
I'II see he tells not one word of a lie.

639
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,061
Hello, Toots.

640
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,069
Hello, Mr. Keats.

641
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,475
Hello, Miss Brawne.

642
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:10,486
Mother? We found it.
Fanny had the key, Like I thought.

643
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,140
What do you need for London?

644
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,408
Your vest has no lining.

645
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,609
And your coat

646
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,725
has a small hole.

647
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,525
I could mend it so you wouldn’t see it.

648
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:32,268
<i>''My sweet girl,
I am living today in yesterday.</i>

649
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,274
<i>''I was in a complete fascination all day.</i>

650
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,303
<i>''I feel myself at your mercy.</i>

651
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,416
<i>''Write me ever so few lines and tell me</i>

652
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,985
<i>''you will never forever be less kind to me
than yesterday.</i>

653
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,752
<i>''You dazzled me.</i>

654
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:51,189
<i>''There is nothing in the world
so bright and delicate.</i>

655
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,792
<i>''You have absorbed me.</i>

656
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,889
<i>''I have a sensation at the present moment
as if I was dissolving. ''</i>

657
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,922
Fanny, Mrs. Dilke is telling me that

658
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:25,059
Mr. Keats is proposing
to move in next door again,

659
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,889
and she wants to know
if I have any objections.

660
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,759
Of course you don't.

661
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,498
Mr. Brown is Mr. Keats' best friend.
Why would we object?

662
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:40,132
Fanny, Mr. Dilke and I are worried

663
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:44,474
that such close connection
may prove restrictive for you.

664
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:45,903
No.

665
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,675
Mr. Keats can't afford to marry.

666
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,217
His situation is really quite hopeless,

667
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,759
and if he is next door,
how will you meet anyone else?

668
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,895
How will you go to dances?

669
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,926
But you are engaged?

670
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,158
It's his mother's ring.
It's not an engagement ring.

671
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,269
You were not to wear it.

672
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,337
I wear it on the finger next door.

673
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,529
Do not even discuss it.

674
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:15,633
You taught me to Love. You never said
only the rich, only a thimbleful.

675
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,080
Attachment is such a difficult thing to undo.

676
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,690
''Pillowed upon
my fair love's ripening breast

677
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,687
''To feel forever its soft swell and fall

678
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,764
''Awake forever in a sweet unrest

679
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:27,305
''Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath''

680
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,647
That's new.

681
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,487
From which poem?

682
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:42,948
Yours.

683
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,496
''Bright star,

684
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,374
''would I were steadfast as thou art

685
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,945
''Not in Ione splendor hung aloft the night''

686
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,750
Why do you say ''not''?

687
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,223
''Not in Ione splendor''?

688
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:25,456
You fear I am not steadfast because
I oblige Mama by going to a dance?

689
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,768
Don't tease, Fanny.

690
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,670
Why are you Laughing?

691
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,007
I shall tell her I am unwell.

692
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:43,681
No, go.

693
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,313
Go.

694
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:51,756
Go.

695
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,921
Good Irish Abigail,

696
01:13:56,064 --> 01:14:01,127
who never did fail to make a scone
as good as a swan.

697
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,407
Would you Like some jam with that, sir?

698
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,807
Please.

699
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:17,946
Delicious.

700
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,252
Fanny! Come in. It's turned cold.

701
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,362
Mr. Keats has gone to London with no coat.

702
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:09,861
John, have you had wine?

703
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,537
I was severely chilled.

704
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,776
I was on the outside of the coach,

705
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,718
but now I don't feel it.

706
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,685
Abigail!

707
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,558
Abigail! Get up, dress yourself.
We need a doctor.

708
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,998
Abigail, bring the water.

709
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,459
I need a basin and a towel.

710
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:43,998
And glasses, I need glasses.

711
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,835
-Let me help. I can...
-Stand back, stand back.

712
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:19,198
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne,

713
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,606
but I've managed him
and said that she had gone into town.

714
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,342
But I have not.

715
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,812
I am speaking of keeping Mr. Keats calm.

716
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,418
This is a deception I will not join.

717
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,020
No, no, it is not a deception.

718
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:38,284
I am simply determined
to preserve the Life of my friend.

719
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,853
You would have it that
I kill Mr. Keats with affection.

720
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,294
-Fanny!
-Perhaps you will.

721
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,925
Apparently, there is nothing I can do to
persuade you of the gravity of the situation,

722
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,699
but Keats is in my care
and all visits will follow my regime

723
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,102
or they will not happen at all.

724
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:57,644
Please, we Brawnes will do whatever we can
to restore Mr. Keats to health.

725
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,321
I was wondering where you were.

726
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:20,597
I have been waiting
to be with you the whole day.

727
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,835
Last night there was a...

728
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,481
There was a great rush of blood,

729
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:39,714
such that I thought that I would suffocate.

730
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:47,227
And I said to Mr. Brown,
''This is unfortunate.''

731
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,857
My thoughts were of you.

732
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:26,557
<i>''My sweet creature, when I send this round,
I shall be in the front parlor,</i>

733
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,727
<i>''watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden.</i>

734
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,539
<i>''When I look back upon the ecstasies
in which I have passed some days</i>

735
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,739
<i>''and the miseries in their turn,</i>

736
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:45,285
<i>''I wonder the more at the beauty
which has kept up the spell so fervently.</i>

737
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:50,284
<i>''How horrid was the chance of slipping
into the ground instead of into your arms.</i>

738
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,324
<i>''The difference is amazing, love. ''</i>

739
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,993
-Go on! Go on, now!
-No, Brown. Brown. Brown.

740
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,703
I get anxious if I don't see her.

741
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,572
Why not bed her?

742
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,276
She'd do whatever you wished.

743
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,148
It might relieve your condition.

744
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,759
<i>''Do not take the trouble of writing much.</i>

745
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:40,170
<i>''Merely send me my good night
to put under my pillow. John Keats. ''</i>

746
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,750
<i>''Let me no longer detain you
from going to town.</i>

747
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,391
<i>''There may be no end
to this imprisoning of you.</i>

748
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:37,427
<i>''Perhaps you had better not come
before tomorrow evening.</i>

749
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:43,095
<i>''You know our situation. I am recommended
not even to read poetry, much less write it.</i>

750
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,833
<i>''I wish I had even a little hope.</i>

751
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,574
<i>''I cannot say forget me,</i>

752
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,275
<i>''but I would mention that
there are impossibilities in the world. ''</i>

753
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:44,825
John, why do you say ''impossibilities''?

754
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,428
I have coughed blood again.

755
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,176
I fear the disease has the upper hand

756
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,940
and I will not recover.

757
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,409
I can't Leave you.

758
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,384
I have such clear hope
for your new book of poems.

759
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,592
John, they are more beautiful than
any I have read of Mr. Coleridge,

760
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,962
Mr. Wordsworth, even Lord Byron.

761
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,206
''O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms

762
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,243
''Alone and palely loitering?

763
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:39,620
''The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
And no birds sing''

764
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,390
''I met a lady in the meads

765
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,660
''Full beautiful, a faery's child

766
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:57,067
''Her hair was Long, her foot was light

767
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,100
''And her eyes were wild

768
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,635
''I set her on my pacing steed

769
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:09,750
''And nothing else saw all day Long

770
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:17,320
''For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery's song''

771
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,825
''She found me roots of relish sweet

772
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,656
''And honey wild, and manna dew

773
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:33,234
''And sure in language strange she said
'I Love thee true'''

774
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,675
''She took me to her elfin grot''

775
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:41,009
''And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore''

776
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:46,685
''And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

777
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:51,223
''And there she lulled me asleep

778
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,721
''And there I dream'd, ah! woe betide!

779
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,493
''The latest dream I ever dream'd

780
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,468
''On the cold hill side''

781
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:15,442
Abigail?

782
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:24,118
Here it is.
Mr. Brown said to give it to you tomorrow,

783
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,851
but I'II not wait.

784
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,064
He is the most cruel,

785
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,797
dead-hearted man in this entire world.

786
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,438
Oh, my God!

787
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,704
Oh, my God, I wish I were dead.

788
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,507
I am boiling with fury.

789
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,015
John, you must not convulse again.

790
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:55,987
Abigail is with child,
but to whom, out of fear or shame,

791
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,523
she would not say.

792
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,553
We, Brown, must find out who it is,
and when we have his name,

793
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:06,098
then butcher or baker,
he shall face up to his indecency.

794
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,671
-Will you call her?
-It's not necessary.

795
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,810
She has me believe I'm the father.

796
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,607
My God, I had no notion of a Love affair.

797
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,714
There was none,
or I must have slept through it.

798
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:35,988
With what ease you help yourself.

799
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,690
I have agreed to pay for the child.

800
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:45,505
And the worst thing is
I can't keep this place.

801
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,436
I have to start my summer rental early.

802
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:54,981
And I feel wretched turning you out
while you are so unwell,

803
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:58,344
but, John, I can't do anything else.

804
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,452
I'm overloaded with debt.

805
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,283
Don't concern yourself.

806
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,025
-I shall manage.
-Stupid. Stupid.

807
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:20,438
In what stumbling ways a new soul is begun.

808
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:23,734
I'd very much value your opinion, Mr. Keats,

809
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:27,507
<i>on a new painting of mine,
The Cave of Despair. I was...</i>

810
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,243
If you are suggesting he won't survive
another winter in England,

811
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,749
then we must do something.

812
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:34,411
Gentlemen, I think we should hear
Dr. Bree on the issue of climate

813
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:35,749
for Keats' health.

814
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,791
Well, a move to a gentler climate
is essential.

815
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,922
I would recommend Italy.

816
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,053
-Rome?
-Rome is good.

817
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:47,368
-Does he want to go to Rome?
-Well, he has to go.

818
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:50,198
He won't Live through another winter
in England.

819
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,600
How do you feel about Italy, John?

820
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:59,212
I do think there is an issue of finance.

821
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,809
Could we not, between us,
start a fund or a coIIection?

822
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:09,355
It seems possible.

823
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,921
Of course, he'll need a traveling companion.
Brown, you’ll go?

824
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,622
Absolutely, absolutely.

825
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:21,496
Someone must go.
I'm not sure I shall be able.

826
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:24,264
-Is that a ''no''?
-Miss. Miss.

827
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:38,817
I can help find a room for the summer,
John, if you want.

828
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,183
Sammy, walk behind.

829
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,863
I want to go to Italy with you.

830
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,996
We can marry, and I'II go with you.

831
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:56,668
My friends talk of going to Italy,
but I have so Little money.

832
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:58,635
Spare a penny, sir?

833
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:01,241
I can barely afford
these Kentish Town rooms.

834
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:03,576
Farewell me here.

835
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:04,678
Why?

836
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:08,840
We don't do linen.

837
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:18,925
AII right, I'm coming!

838
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,603
Mr. Hunt can't have meant this room.

839
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,454
I told you not to come.

840
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,284
Go now.

841
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:56,562
Go.

842
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,600
Please start.

843
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,034
-Please start.
-Where's Fanny?

844
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,107
Thank you.

845
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:11,001
She's not eating.

846
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,150
Are you all right?

847
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,725
How Long has Mr. Keats been away?

848
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,165
Five weeks.

849
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,963
Perhaps it is for the best.

850
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,700
Whose best?

851
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:48,313
I thought it might be a relief to be separated
when the circumstances are so difficult.

852
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:53,483
You all wish I would give up, but I can't.

853
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:57,148
Even if I wanted to, I cannot.

854
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,627
John!

855
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,440
Keep away from me if you do not Love me,

856
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:50,442
if you have not a crystal conscience
this past month.

857
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:52,769
Oh, my Love.

858
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:02,947
I thought my heart was breaking.

859
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,927
Mama! Mama!

860
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,629
Mr. Keats?

861
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,134
Toots, the door.

862
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,274
Take care.

863
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:29,281
John. John?

864
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:36,019
Thank you.

865
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,360
-Was there any blood?
-No.

866
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,327
Is he staying here?

867
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,726
Yes, yes. Tonight.

868
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,273
Well, I need to examine the patient.

869
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,849
May he stay tomorrow?
Till he Leaves for Italy?

870
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,723
But you are not even officiaIIy engaged.

871
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,984
Can't we be?

872
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,094
There is no end to this.

873
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,463
Next, you’ll want to marry
then travel to Rome.

874
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:24,864
I should never have moved into this house.

875
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:25,995
I have let this happen.

876
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,630
Just until Italy.

877
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,771
You are already the source
of so much gossip.

878
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:36,042
Well then, Let us be engaged.

879
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,250
Toots.

880
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,503
Have you been eating rosebuds again?

881
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:35,832
So where do your cheeks get their blush?

882
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:46,949
<i>I confirmed your ship,
the Maria Crowther, sailing for Naples.</i>

883
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:48,479
When does she Leave?

884
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:49,918
-In 10 days.
-So soon?

885
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,081
Autumn is coming.

886
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:54,716
I'm afraid if you delay
there'll be less and less reason to hope.

887
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,461
Then there's no putting it off.

888
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:01,526
I must march against the battery.

889
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:03,466
Allow me to pour you another, Mr. Severn.

890
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:05,435
Really? Well, perhaps I might just tip it back.

891
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,837
-Is his passage fully paid for?
-Yes, yes.

892
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,567
Everything's taken care of.

893
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:14,877
What if something should happen
to Mr. Keats

894
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:20,181
or even to you, in a foreign country?

895
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,049
How would you survive?

896
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:27,923
It shouldn’t be Severn. He barely knows him.

897
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:30,493
Where is that fool Mr. Brown
when he is needed?

898
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:32,599
And why hasn't he written?

899
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:37,499
I found a goose for Mr. Keats' Last dinner.

900
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,600
Don't say ''Last.''

901
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:54,614
...two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. And one, two, three.

902
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:57,087
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

903
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,159
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

904
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:07,325
Toots?

905
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:12,300
Mr. Keats?

906
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,101
One, two, three...

907
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,879
-She's gone.
-What happened there?

908
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:34,323
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

909
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:35,793
Very good.

910
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:44,092
And don't come back.
There's no autumn around here.

911
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:45,999
Careful.

912
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:50,267
Are you all right?

913
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:54,604
Shall we sit down?

914
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,367
Mrs. Brawne, that's for you.

915
01:36:58,345 --> 01:36:59,903
It's beautiful.

916
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:02,882
My dear, mad boy.

917
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:05,375
Is it successful?

918
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:09,287
There were two very positive reviews,
by friends,

919
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:14,593
and six mainly positive and four hostile.

920
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:19,022
I don't know, is that successful?

921
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,600
Yes, extremely so.

922
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:24,336
So they're selling well?

923
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:32,670
Come back. Live with us.

924
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:35,014
Marry our Fanny.

925
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:53,229
I Love you.

926
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:03,636
We should say our goodbyes now.

927
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,051
Shall we awake

928
01:38:27,635 --> 01:38:29,762
and find all this is a dream?

929
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:35,400
There must be another Life.

930
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:38,739
We can't be created
for this kind of suffering.

931
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:54,560
I doubt that we will see each other again
on this earth.

932
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,301
Then why are you leaving?

933
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:06,763
Why must you go?

934
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:10,542
Because my friends have paid my way.

935
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,205
It is a hopeless hope,
but how can I refuse them?

936
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:16,043
Say you are too ill.

937
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,953
We have woven a web, you and I,

938
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,915
attached to this world

939
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,824
but a separate world of our own invention.

940
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,860
We must cut the threads, Fanny.

941
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:33,658
No.

942
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:36,096
No.

943
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:40,736
I can't.

944
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,307
I never will.

945
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:56,381
You know I would do anything.

946
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,526
I have a conscience.

947
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:26,484
-Let's pretend I will return in spring.
-You will return.

948
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:40,757
We will Live in the country.

949
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,737
Close to Mama.

950
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:51,075
And our bedroom will Look out
onto a Little apple orchard

951
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:54,737
and, beyond that, a mountain in a mist.

952
01:40:56,683 --> 01:41:00,847
We can make a garden
where every sort of wildflower grows.

953
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:07,159
And we will go to bed
while the sun is still high.

954
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:13,723
And when it becomes dark,
the moon will shine through the shutters.

955
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:25,235
And I will hold you close
and kiss your breasts,

956
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,948
your arms, your waist.

957
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:36,887
Everywhere.

958
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:50,563
Touch has a memory.

959
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:54,235
I know it.

960
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:27,136
Not a word.

961
01:43:09,616 --> 01:43:12,949
Mama, Mr. Brown's baby has red hair.

962
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,610
Hello!

963
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,017
You beautiful boy.

964
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:22,118
Hello. Well done. Well done.

965
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:24,060
Hello.

966
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:26,599
It is so nice to meet you.

967
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:32,871
You've seen the baby?

968
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:37,172
Looks Like Abigail.

969
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:45,180
John's reached Naples.

970
01:43:46,853 --> 01:43:48,821
They quarantined his ship.

971
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:55,023
He wrote that he made more puns
out of desperation in two weeks

972
01:43:55,162 --> 01:43:57,790
than he had in any year of his Life.

973
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:04,331
I should have Liked to have been there
to have heard them.

974
01:44:04,938 --> 01:44:08,499
You could have, had you gone.

975
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,347
It's not that simple,

976
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:23,546
with a baby and my funds reduced.

977
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:30,729
And then there is this issue
of the snow and the Alps.

978
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:32,825
And lack of will.

979
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:42,970
Shall I say it aloud?

980
01:44:43,977 --> 01:44:45,376
Will that satisfy you?

981
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,947
Shall I say it?

982
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:54,119
I have failed John Keats.

983
01:44:54,855 --> 01:44:56,755
I failed John Keats.

984
01:44:58,392 --> 01:45:01,520
I failed John Keats!

985
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:04,763
I failed him! I failed him!

986
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:12,663
I did not know until now how tightly
he'd wound himself around my heart.

987
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:25,874
It's for you, Mama. It's from Italy.

988
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:44,097
It's from Mr. Keats.

989
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:48,069
He says, ''It looks Like a dream.''

990
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:10,920
Start again.

991
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,058
It's cold out.

992
01:47:50,363 --> 01:47:51,295
How are you all?

993
01:47:51,431 --> 01:47:54,559
We're all quite well enough,
but how is Mr. Keats?

994
01:47:55,202 --> 01:48:00,003
Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me

995
01:48:02,008 --> 01:48:03,999
as I know it is to you.

996
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:08,074
Mr. Keats has died.

997
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,380
I received an account from Severn,

998
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:18,155
and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.

999
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,289
Shall I just read it?

1000
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:38,433
''Friday, the 23rd of February.

1001
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:43,179
<i>''At four in the afternoon, Keats called me,</i>

1002
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:47,753
<i>'''Severn, Severn, lift me up for I am dying.</i>

1003
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:50,522
<i>'''I shall die easy.</i>

1004
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:55,325
<i>'''Don't be frightened.
Thank God it has come. '</i>

1005
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:02,228
<i>''At one point, a cold, heavy sweat broke out
over his whole body, and he whispered,</i>

1006
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:07,500
<i>'''Don't breathe on me. It comes like ice. '</i>

1007
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:10,733
<i>''Keats died imperceptibly. ''</i>

1008
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:12,275
No more.

1009
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:39,899
Oh, God.

1010
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:46,042
Oh, God. John!

1011
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:52,243
Mama!

1012
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:01,625
Mama!

1013
01:50:02,996 --> 01:50:06,022
I... I can't breathe.

1014
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:09,597
Mama!

1015
01:50:22,682 --> 01:50:24,377
Mama!

1016
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:34,681
Sammy! Samuel!

1017
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,604
''Bright star,

1018
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:07,850
''would I were steadfast as thou art

1019
01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:14,621
''Not in Ione splendor hung aloft the night

01:52:16,362 --> 01:52:21,095
''And watching, with eternal lids apart

01:52:35,615 --> 01:52:39,073
''Of pure ablution

01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:55,233

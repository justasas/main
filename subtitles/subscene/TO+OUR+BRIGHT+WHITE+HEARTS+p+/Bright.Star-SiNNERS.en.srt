1
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,451
It's mine.

2
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,644
-Get down.
-You're not allowed!

3
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,084
-Good day, Mr. Phipps.
-You're not allowed!

4
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,349
Get down.

5
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,787
You'll have no supper if you keep that up.

6
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,126
-Hello, Joy.
-Hello.

7
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,196
-Is all well?
-Very good. Thank you.

8
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:51,462
-Hello.
-Hello.

9
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:53,496
-Good morning, Joy.
-Hello.

10
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,391
-Sorry.
-Welcome.

11
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:58,728
Where is Mr. Keats?

12
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,694
I'm afraid he is not joining us.

13
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,161
He's in Mr. Brown's half of the house.

14
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,057
Hello.

15
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:06,885
Hello.

16
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:12,396
The very well stitched Little Miss Brawne
in all her detail.

17
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:14,895
Good morning.

18
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,125
What is this? What have I done?
How have I offended?

19
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,696
I don't shake hands with the enemy.

20
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:26,727
An enemy? What have I done to you?

21
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:31,558
You do nothing to me or for me,
and that's how I'd prefer to keep it.

22
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,354
What?

23
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,996
Your offense is to my fashion, Mr. Brown.

24
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,062
Oh, dear.

25
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,629
To which I'm "so helplessly slavish."

26
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,662
I have been ill-quoted.

27
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:47,195
"Her obsession
with flounce and cross-stitch"?

28
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,523
Cross-stitch? Miss Brawne,

29
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:53,028
-I don't even know what that means.
-For goodness' sake. Baiting, baiting.

30
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,497
I feel the same about your poems,
Mr. Brown.

31
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,426
I know nothing of what they mean.

32
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:01,053
They puff smoke, dissolve,
leaving nothing but irritation.

33
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,719
Fanny, take this tea to Mr. Keats.
He is in very poor spirits.

34
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,221
Mr. Keats is composing
and does not want disturbing.

35
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:14,029
It's my finding in the business of disturbing,
you're the expert.

36
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:17,062
Fanny, why not speak to one of us
you hold in higher favor?

37
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:18,391
I'm praising him!

38
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,463
-Fanny.
-Please, Fanny.

39
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:23,893
I'm wanting to know what you shall say
about Mr. Keats.

40
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,690
I've been waiting two weeks
that I may enjoy your opinion.

41
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,195
I cannot look upon him without smiling.

42
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,356
And he is quick with his thoughts,
though now they are mostly sad.

43
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,086
His brother Tom's not at all better.

44
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,593
Very diminished.

45
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,292
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

46
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,356
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

47
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:46,453
-Is there no other family member?
-No. The parents are both dead.

48
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:51,625
There is only a much younger sister
and a brother who lives in America.

49
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:04,190
Come in.

50
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,264
You like jokes, Mr. Keats?

51
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,921
I like jokes.

52
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,556
Mr. Brown, I warn you,
does not like my jokes.

53
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,162
He complains I care for nothing but fashion.

54
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,428
Would you like biscuits?

55
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,326
You've come to spy.

56
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,190
Spy?

57
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:39,862
How will you describe me? My character?

58
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,386
I am not the least interested
in your character.

59
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:52,158
My jacket, then? Or my pantaloons?

60
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,792
You need a new jacket,
that's what I would say.

61
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,260
Is that all?

62
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:04,221
It should be of velvet, blue velvet.

63
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,728
Tell me, Miss Brawne,
how can you be so sure?

64
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:15,688
Well, all I wear,
I've sewn and designed myself.

65
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,727
I'm often told
I am clever to exception about design.

66
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:23,387
I originated the pleats on my dress,
which are charming...

67
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:32,287
Has she annoyed you sufficiently?
She has done brilliant well with me.

68
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,056
Men's room, out.

69
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,390
Poets got to do a bit of writing.

70
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,553
My stitching has more merit and admirers
than your two scribblings put together.

71
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:44,422
Goodbye, minxstress.

72
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:45,928
And I can make money from it.

73
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,421
Yes?

74
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:23,195
Have you got John Keats' poem book...

75
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,658
<i>-Endymion?
-Endymion, yes.</i>

76
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,319
Yes, I've not heard much good about it.

77
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,395
I've not sold one and took 20.

78
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,152
My sister has met the author,
and she wants to read it for herself

79
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,388
to see if he is an idiot or not.

80
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:07,924
Unwrap it.

81
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,489
Read it.

82
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,124
"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

83
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:43,457
"Pass into nothingness, but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep

84
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:47,029
"Full of sweet dreams, and health
and quiet breathing"

85
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:49,053
-Stop.
-"Therefore, on..."

86
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,987
"Yes, in spite of all

87
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,292
"Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits"

88
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,259
I'd love to speak with Mr. Keats.

89
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:06,585
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

90
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,423
"Pass into nothingness"

91
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:09,859
<i>You've read Endymion.</i>

92
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,823
I wanted to adore it.

93
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:18,755
-But you hated it?
-I can't say.

94
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,855
Are you frightened to speak truthfully?

95
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:27,222
-Never.
-Well, tell me then.

96
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:31,287
No. I'm not clever with poetry.

97
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,255
Well, neither, it seems, am I.

98
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:40,094
-Still I have some hope for myself.
-I think hope useful.

99
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:46,159
-But...
-Hope and results are different.

100
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,925
One doesn't necessarily create the other.

101
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,158
Would practice help?

102
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:56,589
It might.
I wasn't always able to stitch so well.

103
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,889
This is the first frock
in all of Woolwich or Hampstead

104
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,053
to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.

105
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,489
Isn't that an identical one behind you?

106
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,890
My card's completely full.

107
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:30,292
But you don't dance, Mr. Keats.
I love to dance.

108
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,459
I don't feel like dancing.

109
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,258
Is your brother still ill?

110
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,655
He's no better.

111
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:43,590
My father was ill
for as long as I can remember.

112
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:47,624
He died when I was still very young.

113
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,057
Excuse me.

114
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,356
Miss Brawne, may I?

115
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,459
Mama!

116
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:09,060
Fanny has cut my ribbon,
and she never asked.

117
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,960
What are you doing, Fanny?

118
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,425
Trying to bring some comfort
to a dying man.

119
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,859
What dying man?
Where are you taking them?

120
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:23,622
I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats' brother
anything that's not perfect.

121
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,554
It's me. Miss Brawne.

122
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,886
I have something to deliver to Mr. Keats.

123
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:49,854
Leave it at the door.

124
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,921
-Is he not there?
-We're working, Miss Brawne.

125
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:57,024
I have something for your brother, Mr. Keats.

126
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,327
Invite her in. Brown!

127
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:13,590
You disgusting ape.

128
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,527
Be careful as you enter the ape's cage.

129
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,620
Sit next to me, Miss Brawne.

130
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:26,294
My prospects in the world feel very faint.

131
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:32,157
This room is so poorly cared for.

132
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,960
Please try one.

133
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,528
I'm anxious they'll cause him to choke.

134
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,621
No! Try another and I swear I shall bite you.

135
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,887
Take care. She has sharp teeth.

136
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,325
She has sunk her fangs into my poor poem
and shook it apart.

137
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:58,492
<i>I am very sorry I couldn't love
your Endymion completely, Mr. Keats.</i>

138
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:00,852
Perhaps I did not say,

139
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:04,893
but I thought the beginning of your poem
something very perfect.

140
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:12,285
But don't leave us. You can see for yourself,
nothing is happening.

141
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:15,826
All we do is lie about the room all day,
begging for inspiration.

142
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:18,588
Please, tell me what I should do.

143
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:25,424
Miss Brawne,
we monkeys just want a little company.

144
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,022
Well, I gave him the biscuits.

145
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:38,918
Mr. Brown kept...

146
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,057
If we've finished tiffing,
come and say hello to Tom.

147
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:45,461
It might cheer him.

148
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:47,228
We'll have to ask Mama.

149
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,884
-No, we don't, Toots.
-Yes, we do.

150
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,528
Isn't that so, Samuel?

151
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,661
We have to stick together.

152
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm going. You'll have to come with me.

153
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:04,722
Would you like to go by the pond
or through the woods?

154
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,454
I've explored all these paths, which are more
in number than your eyelashes.

155
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,427
My eyelashes?

156
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:23,289
You know, it amazes me
you can sit opposite Mr. Brown all day.

157
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,154
I've never heard him say one thing of wit.
Not one.

158
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,727
-You favor wit?
-I rate it the highest.

159
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:37,161
-You like the fashionables?
-Yes, I do.

160
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:43,362
Men who say things that make you start
without making you feel?

161
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,052
Things that are amusing.

162
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,151
I know these dandies.

163
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:54,520
They have a mannerism in their very eating
and drinking, their handling of a decanter.

164
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,924
You are making an attack on me?

165
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:03,456
No, I am defending
Mr. Brown's generous, good heart.

166
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,019
By attacking myself.

167
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,424
Forgive me.

168
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,720
I've been too long at my brother's sickbed.

169
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,327
Can we not still appreciate clever humor?

170
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,517
Thank God! He's been calling out for you.

171
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,388
Come in.

172
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:43,451
John.

173
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,590
-I didn't... I didn't...
-Tom.

174
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,526
-What?
-Tom, get back into bed.

175
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:51,754
-I don't know. I was having this dream.
-It's all right. I'm here now.

176
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,823
-I'm here.
-Where have you been, John?

177
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:58,257
-I just... I was worried.
-Calm now. Calm.

178
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:00,260
It's all right. I'm here.

179
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:03,027
It's so hot in this bed.

180
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,494
I was so scared for a while.

181
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,591
-Calm down.
-I just panicked.

182
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,160
I want to go. I want to leave. It smells.

183
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,360
Or I'II cut your hair in the night.

184
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,758
-Good evening, John.
-Young man, how are you?

185
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,451
Good evening.

186
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,652
Well, Keats,
I hope you've not forgotten your bassoon.

187
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,692
Of course not. It's in my waistcoat pocket.

188
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,828
-Hello, Mr. Keats.
-Hello, Minx.

189
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,316
How's Tom?

190
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,358
Gentlemen of the orchestra,
just through here.

191
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,358
Ladies, straight ahead, please. Thank you.

192
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:40,483
Hurry on, gentlemen.

193
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:42,753
Is he showing any signs of improvement?

194
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,258
Don't ask me of Tom, Minx.

195
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,225
The only good I can do
is say how I love him.

196
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:50,059
Hurry on, gentlemen.

197
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,458
Shall we open the claret?

198
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,986
<i>Someone submitted anonymously
to The Examiner a most exquisite sonnet</i>

199
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:11,727
composed on the subject of whether
Love itself could be the 10th muse. Severn!

200
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:12,793
-Come on.
-En garde!

201
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,018
Right.

202
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,856
That's my sword, you brute.

203
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:21,516
Love the 10th muse?

204
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:24,594
It's full of the most perfect allusions
and really beautifully realized.

205
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,887
I thought at first it might be one of yours.

206
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,716
<i>We were just telling Mrs. Brawne
of John Keats' review in Blackwood's.</i>

207
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,521
Was it so very bad?

208
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:40,656
"No man could have profaned and vulgarized

209
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:45,784
"every association in the manner which has
been adopted by this 'son of promise."'

210
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:51,292
Did they not admire the opening?
It was perfect. Even I could know that.

211
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,757
-Do you Like poetry, Miss Brawne?
-No.

212
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,586
Poems are a strain to work out.

213
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,754
John, we are talking, or are about to talk,

214
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:05,122
<i>of your defense
of Mr. Keats' poem Endymion.</i>

215
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,352
Yes.

216
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:12,920
"I have clung
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen

217
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:16,026
"Or felt but a great dream! O I have been

218
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,990
"Presumptuous against Love
against the sky

219
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:22,821
"Against all elements, against the tie
Of mortals each to each"

220
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,189
The rhythm is beautiful and unique.

221
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:27,919
There are rhymes, but not on the beat.
They're quiet, but binding.

222
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:31,050
And the repetitions set you up to fly.

223
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:34,822
"I have clung
To nothing, lov’d a nothing, nothing seen"

224
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,519
And here you come out
"Or felt but a great dream!"

225
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:38,683
It's beautiful.

226
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:40,987
Well, there are immaturities,
but there are also immensities,

227
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:42,855
and that is what they didn't say.

228
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,187
It was said. You said it, Brother.

229
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,622
Thank you.

230
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:48,193
Very bravely.

231
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,956
Ladies, the Hampstead Heathens
are about to begin.

232
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,719
-Reynolds?
-I thought I'd been expelled.

233
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,350
No. I think not. You're very much needed.

234
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,657
Mr. Keats is dead.

235
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,253
Mr. Keats is dead. So young.

236
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:47,987
Is it Tom?

237
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:34,622
I woke with the strange sensation
of someone holding my hand.

238
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,692
I opened my eyes, and there was John.

239
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:41,818
I knew immediately what had happened,
and then he said,

240
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:47,689
"Tom died at 8:00, quietly and without pain."

241
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:55,550
Of course, he can't go on living there,

242
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:59,558
so I have invited Mr. Keats
to come and stay with me.

243
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:03,622
Well, we do have a Long schedule of visits.

244
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:05,521
I don't want to interfere with your city plans,

245
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,421
but you are most welcome
to have dinner with us.

246
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,550
-Minx? Are you unwell?
-We have provided and set the table.

247
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,023
No, no, no, not at all.

248
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,217
-I've never seen you so quiet.
-I would appreciate it.

249
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,889
We do have some city business.

250
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,484
She sewed it all night Long.

251
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,586
It's a pillow slip.

252
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,592
Then I will rest Tom's head upon it.

253
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,526
Keats, the Reynolds are expecting us.

254
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,549
I'II catch you up. Thank you.

255
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:59,657
Invite me again, alone.

256
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:02,086
Come for Christmas.

257
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:12,817
Yes, please do join us, Mr. Keats, please.

258
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:17,292
But Marianne Reynolds invited us
for Christmas. Remember?

259
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,949
You were there when she said it.
They're having musicians.

260
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,616
I am sorry to spoil things.

261
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,522
Not at all. Wherever Mr. Keats is happy,
we're happy for him.

262
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,525
-Thank you, Mrs. Brawne.
-But why can't he be happy with us?

263
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,951
Perhaps Mr. Brown wants
Mr. Keats all to himself.

264
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:36,050
I am merely remembering to Mr. Keats
a previous engagement.

265
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:39,385
Miss Brawne, I thought we were conversing.

266
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:00,517
"Dear Mrs. Brawne.
May I yet join you for Christmas?

267
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,627
"I have not the health
nor the heart to be anywhere

268
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,056
"but with a family such as your own.
John Keats."

269
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:21,652
Thank you.

270
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,452
I was wondering this morning
if you're sleeping in my bed.

271
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:51,118
Pardon?

272
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,782
You see, I believe you are.

273
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:56,155
We rented Mr. Brown's half of the house
this summer

274
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:58,556
while you were journeying in Scotland.

275
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:00,387
Which room do you sleep in?

276
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,417
The one overlooking the back garden.

277
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,390
That was my bed.

278
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,487
For proof, pull it from the wall

279
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:13,388
and by the pillow, you will find a figure
I drew with pin holes.

280
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:15,117
Is the figure you?

281
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:17,786
It's a fairy princess.

282
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,924
-Should I be feeding her?
-She refuses to eat.

283
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,420
Would you teach me poetry?

284
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,592
I'd... I'd Like to understand it.

285
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:40,352
I don't know how to begin.

286
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,255
<i>And it's three to the right.</i>

287
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:44,685
Two, three. Three to the left.

288
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:46,417
Two, three.

289
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,192
And down. And keep it going.

290
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,682
So that's the English drawing room.

291
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:04,789
And this is something
that I saw in Scotland.

292
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,819
They kick,

293
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,286
and they jump,

294
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:21,720
and they twirl it,

295
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,885
and they sweat it,
and they tattooed the floor Like mad!

296
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,225
What about a poem?

297
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:40,087
-Yes. Please, Mr. Keats.
-A short one.

298
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:49,054
"When I have fears that I may cease to be

299
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:54,981
"Before my pen has glean'd
my teeming brain

300
00:27:57,693 --> 00:28:00,250
"Before high-piled books, in charact'ry

301
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:04,716
"Hold Like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain

302
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:10,290
"When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face

303
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,457
"Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance"

304
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,717
-I do apologize. I've gone blank.
-You're tired.

305
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,485
Should you Like some sweet?

306
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,251
Shall we have coffee and sweet?

307
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,088
Come through to our side.

308
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,816
I've come for my poetry class.

309
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,291
Your poetry class?

310
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,853
Poetry classes!
Keats, are we teaching poetry today?

311
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,150
I hope I don't disturb.

312
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,189
Take a seat.

313
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:03,419
Have a look at that.

314
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,552
A poet is not at all poetical.

315
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:13,320
He is the most un-poetical thing
in existence.

316
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,022
He has no identity.

317
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:21,191
He is continually filling some other body,
the sun, the moon.

318
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:25,292
I cannot restrain my credibility longer.

319
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,890
Miss Brawne,
is this really you or are you acting?

320
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,017
-It's really me.
-Is it?

321
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:36,483
Charles, I have a pupil.

322
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:40,015
-Desist or depart.
-Apologies.

323
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:59,324
My modest hope is that the cost
of the lesson will not be the poet.

324
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,483
The cost of the lesson is that Mr. Keats
will forthwith discuss poetry with me.

325
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,850
You don't mean to read the poems?

326
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:08,117
Until I know all the poets and poems
in the world,

327
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:10,521
since I've nothing to do,
as you so many times have noted.

328
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,489
I bow to your ambition.

329
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,125
Now he's gone, I shall find it easier to talk.

330
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:40,723
Can you say something
of the craft of poetry?

331
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:45,791
Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham.

332
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,685
If poetry does not come as naturally
as leaves to a tree,

333
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,792
then it had better not come at all.

334
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,987
I am mistaken.

335
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,447
I am not sure I can teach you.

336
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,854
Was I too rude? I... I can apologize.

337
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:16,052
I'm not sure I have
the right feelings towards women.

338
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:21,853
I'm suspicious of my feelings.

339
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,219
Do you not Like me?

340
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,254
I'm attracted to you without knowing why.

341
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:37,181
AII women confuse me, even my mother.

342
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:45,722
I yearn to be ruined by shrews
and saved by angels,

343
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,450
and in reality,
I've only ever really loved my sister.

344
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,389
I'm annoyed by my sister
as often as I Love her.

345
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,049
I still don't know how to work out a poem.

346
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,958
A poem needs understanding
through the senses.

347
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:09,050
The point of diving in a lake

348
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,917
is not immediately to swim to the shore

349
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:19,082
but to be in the Lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water.

350
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,784
You do not work the lake out.

351
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:27,517
It is an experience beyond thought.

352
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:34,083
Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

353
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,323
I Love mystery.

354
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:44,219
I found your fairy princess
on the wall in my room.

355
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,783
And you could make her out?

356
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,551
She wears a butterfly frock.

357
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:53,252
Shall we continue?

358
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,182
Mr. Keats is very brilliant.

359
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,524
I'm not sure he really likes me.

360
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:24,316
He prefers Toots and Samuel, even our cat,
who he is always petting to death.

361
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,320
Mr. Keats knows he cannot Like you.

362
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,682
He has no Living and no income.

363
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,351
Mr. Keats isn't here.

364
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,557
He said to tell you he had a sore throat
and thought it best to stay on in Chichester.

365
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,886
Samuel, hello.

366
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:05,184
You don't believe me. Come in.

367
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:07,451
Come in.

368
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,086
There, no Keats.

369
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,421
Tell us, what Chaucer did you read?

370
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,490
AII of it.

371
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:26,048
<i>Also, Mr. Spenser,
Mr. Milton, and The Odyssey.</i>

372
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:30,484
That's a lot to read in one week.

373
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,621
<i>What did you think of The Odyssey?</i>

374
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:34,951
Thank you.

375
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:41,424
I am yet partway through it,
but I have read all Mr. Keats has written.

376
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:43,385
Have you?

377
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,625
"Out went the taper as she hurried in

378
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:58,223
"Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died

379
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:03,582
"She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin

380
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:07,157
"To spirits of the air, and visions wide"

381
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:11,247
<i>And... And what, Miss Brawne,
did you make of Paradise Lost?</i>

382
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:15,422
-I... I liked it.
-Did you?

383
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:21,152
You didn't find Milton's rhymes
a little pouncing?

384
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:22,679
No.

385
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,814
-Did you not?
-Not very.

386
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,391
Is it the material of her dress that makes
Miss Brawne's eyes so amber-Like?

387
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,318
Yes, they are golden.

388
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,152
-Amber almost.
-Yes, yes.

389
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,485
What color are yours, Mr. Brown?

390
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,556
Mine?

391
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:01,584
-Suitcase brown.
-Fanny!

392
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,180
Did you see Mr. Brown? He was amazed.

393
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,885
Well, all those authors in just one week
is a bit incredible.

394
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,150
I know.

395
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,989
But he sees I'm serious.
And I will read them.

396
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:34,552
Fanny, it's a letter.

397
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,590
I think it's a valentine.

398
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:05,721
"Darling Valentine, I am not sure
if you should have a kiss

399
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:10,586
"for your amber enchantress eyes
or a whipping.

400
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:16,952
"Yours, the Suitcase."

401
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:39,749
Fanny,

402
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:45,188
Mr. Keats is behaving very oddly.

403
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:49,285
Should I invite him inside?

404
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:05,655
-Mr. Brown sent you a Valentine?
-I think it was a joke.

405
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:12,091
Keats! Keats! John, wait.

406
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,887
-John.
-I was away but 10 days, Brown,

407
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,014
with you encouraging me
to stay on and get well.

408
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,350
-John, easy.
-Now,

409
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:31,787
you write Miss Brawne a valentine card.
Are you lovers?

410
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:33,151
-John.
-Is that the truth?

411
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,450
-Easy.
-You sent a card, Charles!

412
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,284
You have the income to marry,
where I have not.

413
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:38,583
Did you accept him, Miss Brawne?

414
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,815
John, I sent that valentine...

415
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:44,717
It was only a jest.

416
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:48,084
For whom? I'm not laughing.
Miss Brawne is not Laughing!

417
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,748
John, I wrote the valentine to amuse Fanny,
who makes a religion of flirting.

418
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,015
John, she's what?
A poetry scholar one week

419
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:57,521
-and, what, a military expert the next?
-You disgust me.

420
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,750
It is a game. It is a game to her.
She collects suitors. John... John...

421
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:06,687
There is a holiness to the heart's affections.
Know you nothing of that?

422
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:20,920
Believe me, it's not pride!

423
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,022
You're in Love with Mr. Brown?

424
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:53,486
Why don't you speak?

425
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:59,951
She can't speak because she only knows
how to flirt and sew.

426
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,479
Isn't that right?

427
00:41:07,824 --> 00:41:13,779
Yes, and read all Milton,
whose rhymes do not pounce, Miss Brawne,

428
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:15,913
because there are none!

429
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,447
John, there are one or two of her kind

430
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:21,318
in every fashionable drawing room
of this city,

431
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,788
gasping over skirt lengths.

432
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:31,082
I'm sorry.
We can have a poetry Lesson tomorrow.

433
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:34,213
No! I want to dance and flirt,

434
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:38,551
talk of flounces and ribbons
till I find my old happiness and humor.

435
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:56,350
What if the dwarf were to die in Act 2?

436
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,715
And then we could introduce
the princess sooner.

437
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,356
The princess.

438
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:04,556
Perhaps Act 3 could begin with a tempest.

439
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,753
What else do you think?

440
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,688
We're going to live next door.

441
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:36,348
The Dilkes are moving to Westminster,
and we get six months half rent!

442
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,451
So we'll be in the same house.
We can all play football.

443
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,553
It's a great economy for Mama.

444
00:42:45,957 --> 00:42:47,048
But only if you Like.

445
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,453
Have we broken for the day, Keats?

446
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,981
Keats!

447
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,888
-Throw the rope up.
-Excuse me, miss.

448
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:06,052
There should be another one of them.

449
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:13,385
But if the princess has already abandoned
the dwarf,

450
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,887
I mean, cannot we keep his Love speech?

451
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:19,913
We have to change it.
Find another place for it.

452
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:23,484
-We could give the Love speech to...
-Look out!

453
00:43:27,423 --> 00:43:29,548
Sorry, right in the face.

454
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:34,686
Brown? Brown!

455
00:43:36,224 --> 00:43:37,553
Oh, no!

456
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:41,985
-What was that, Toots?
-Oh, no!

457
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:57,319
If Mr. Keats and myself
are strolling in a meadow,

458
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:02,514
lounging on a sofa or staring into a wall,
do not presume we're not working.

459
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,888
Doing nothing is the musing of the poet.

460
00:44:07,924 --> 00:44:11,981
Are these musings what we common people
know as thoughts?

461
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,518
Thoughts, yes, but of a weightier nature.

462
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,646
Sinking thoughts?

463
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:23,915
Not really, Miss Brawne. Musing,
making one's mind available to inspiration.

464
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:26,317
Mr. Brown?

465
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,122
As in amusing?

466
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:33,354
Mr. Brown, our thoughts are all very simple,

467
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,649
so you never need worry
about interrupting us.

468
00:44:35,824 --> 00:44:38,984
And we should be happy
if you would join us for dinner on any day.

469
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:02,946
Can I choose which bed?

470
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:38,584
Mr. Keats.

471
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:31,552
They're sniffing all the flowers in the garden
to try and find the best scent.

472
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,181
Mr. Keats is being a bee.

473
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,517
Thank you.

474
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:46,813
Fanny!

475
00:46:47,756 --> 00:46:48,915
Come in.

476
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:50,979
I need your help.

477
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:18,246
Lie to me.
Tell me you did not dance last night.

478
00:47:19,356 --> 00:47:21,685
I did not sit down a single tune.

479
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:26,244
You can see the truth in my slippers,
completely scuffed.

480
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:28,346
I don't know how I could have prevented it.

481
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,422
I don't want to sit and wait under the trees
while you talk.

482
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,216
-I want to go and play on the swing.
-AII right.

483
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:39,820
-Lovely.
-I'm not! Don't go lower. Go higher. Higher.

484
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,217
No. A bit Lower.

485
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:08,481
I had such a dream last night.

486
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:12,547
I was floating above the trees

487
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,350
with my lips connected
to those of a beautiful figure

488
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,719
for what seemed Like an age.

489
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:24,148
Flowery treetops sprang up beneath us,

490
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:28,119
and we rested on them
with the lightness of a cloud.

491
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,148
Who was the figure?

492
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:55,782
I must have had my eyes closed,
because I can't remember.

493
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,981
And yet, you remember the treetops.

494
00:49:01,656 --> 00:49:03,645
Not so well as I remember the Lips.

495
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:12,354
Whose lips? Were they my lips?

496
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:55,346
Fanny?

497
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,221
Fanny?

498
00:50:15,456 --> 00:50:16,820
Fanny?

499
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:21,646
Fanny!

500
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:31,879
<i>Mr. Brown bet I couldn't find
the nightingale's nest.</i>

501
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,614
<i>There is no nest and no bet.</i>

502
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:40,520
That one over there.

503
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:42,848
You couldn’t have seen it in a tree.
They don't nest in trees.

504
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:45,454
I know what I saw. It was a nightingale.

505
00:52:07,022 --> 00:52:10,250
"Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest

506
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:15,014
"In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay"

507
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:18,587
See, here, there are tears.

508
00:52:22,522 --> 00:52:25,147
You're so far ahead of me and above me.

509
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:33,311
Brown, I'm amazed.

510
00:52:36,088 --> 00:52:42,612
Your writing is the finest thing in my life.

511
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:54,183
You wrote this, Little hand, did you do it?

512
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,354
As one who truly loves you,

513
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:09,511
I must warn you kindly
of a trap that you are walking into, John.

514
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:14,383
If you are going to speak of Miss Brawne,
we have never agreed and cannot agree.

515
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:18,817
For one or two of your "slippery blisses,"
you'll lose your freedom permanently.

516
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:22,580
You will be slaving at medicine
15 hours a day and for what?

517
00:53:23,155 --> 00:53:25,643
To keep Mrs. Keats in French ribbon.

518
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,449
I cherish your talent. I truly do.

519
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,021
Then allow me my happiness,
for I am writing again.

520
00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:07,221
<i>"My heart aches,
and a drowsy numbness pains</i>

521
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:10,809
<i>"My sense, as though of hemlock
I had drunk</i>

522
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:14,550
<i>"Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</i>

523
00:54:14,688 --> 00:54:17,654
<i>"One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk</i>

524
00:54:20,721 --> 00:54:25,949
<i>"'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
But being too happy in thine happiness</i>

525
00:54:26,588 --> 00:54:29,679
<i>"That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees</i>

526
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:34,383

"In such an ecstasy!"

538
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:42,678
What?

539
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:48,717
Have you told Miss Brawne
of our summer holiday, or shall I?

540
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:54,150
Not as yet.

541
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:03,111
Mr. Brown is doing his summer rental,
so we both have to Leave.

542
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:10,186
We're meeting up on the Isle of Wight
for some undisturbed writing and carousing.

543
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,416
Mrs. Brawne, may I speak to Fanny, please?

544
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:31,214
No, I will not speak to him.

545
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,049
Fanny, I was going to tell you.

546
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,684
Fanny, I have no money.

547
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:49,012
In fact, I am in debt.

548
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:54,919
I must earn. I must write and make a Living.

549
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:58,285
If I fail, though I hate to think on it,

550
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:02,217
then I must make way so another may marry
and adore you as I wish to.

551
00:57:02,354 --> 00:57:08,514
No! I will not be adored ever again
by you or by anyone!

552
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:14,283
I hate you!

553
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:38,576
Anything?

554
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:40,152
No. Nothing.

555
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,380
Nothing.

556
00:57:53,854 --> 00:57:57,014
Fanny, will you check my stitch?
It's an open-work seam.

557
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:58,085
God.

558
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:01,283
No, Toots. I don't care a damn for stitches!

559
00:58:23,954 --> 00:58:26,113
-No letter?
-Not today.

560
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:35,247
Am I in Love?

561
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:40,583
Is this Love?

562
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,453
I shall never tease about it again.

563
00:58:53,388 --> 00:58:55,910
So sore I believe one could die of it.

564
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:34,410
<i>"My dearest lady,</i>

565
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:38,349

00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:55,120

did not weigh so upon me.</i>

571
00:59:57,554 --> 01:00:01,384

not very cruel to have so entrammelled me,</i>

572
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:04,583

573
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:10,753

a fairer word than fair.</i>

<i>"Three such days with you
I could fill with more delight</i>

577
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:31,714

578
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:38,416
I Love you.

579
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,677
I Love you, Toots.

"Bedewed with pleasures."

602
01:02:41,153 --> 01:02:43,711
-There's no air.
-No, Mama, they Love the heat.

603
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:45,978
We're going to lose them.

604
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,109
Listen, "I Love you more in that I believe
you've Liked me for my own sake.

"I have met with women whom I really think
would Like to be married to a poem,

Mama, don't be cross.

608
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,112
When I don't hear from him,
it's as if I've died,

609
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:17,651
as if the air is sucked out from my lungs

610
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:20,809
and I am Left desolate,
but when I receive a Letter,

611
01:03:20,953 --> 01:03:25,113
I know our world is real.
It's the one I care for.

612
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,717
Watch the butterfly.

613
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:33,151
Well, move it.

614
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:51,077
-Fanny wants a knife.
-What for?

615
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:53,242
To kill herself.

616
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,484
It's all over.

617
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:04,510
I have such a short letter after all this time.

618
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:06,980
No, Topper!

619
01:04:13,553 --> 01:04:16,678
Saying he was in London, in London,

620
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,843
and couldn’t bring himself to visit
for fear it would burn him up!

621
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:24,607
He's made no fortune and is ashamed of it.

622
01:04:24,753 --> 01:04:29,311
If only he knew how Little I, even you,
care for that now.

623
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:47,909
You missed that one.

624
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,751
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:07,447
Mama asked me to welcome you home
and introduce you to Miss O'Donoghue,

626
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:10,518
our new maid who may also do for you.

627
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:13,448
Please, sir, call me Abigail or Abby.

628
01:05:14,419 --> 01:05:17,250
Very well. Be sure you do not enter
if the door is closed.

629
01:05:17,419 --> 01:05:18,578
Yes, sir.

630
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:30,981
Mr. Keats is not coming back.
He has gone to Live in London.

631
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,148
Please tell Mr. Keats that we Brawnes
have kept safe all his things.

632
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,513
Mr. Brown has said that
I could learn to read still.

633
01:05:54,086 --> 01:05:56,813
I said to him, "Sure, what would I read?"

634
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:02,748
And he said, "Abigail, even the Bible
is not so dull as you might believe."

635
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:07,978
And that in the Songs of Solomon,
there are some bits so juicy,

636
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,642
they'd make even a churchman blush.

637
01:06:11,419 --> 01:06:14,681
And he said that when I get down
to the reading myself,

638
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,116
I'II see he tells not one word of a lie.

639
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,517
Hello, Toots.

640
01:06:49,953 --> 01:06:51,509
Hello, Mr. Keats.

641
01:06:53,252 --> 01:06:54,912
Hello, Miss Brawne.

642
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:04,913
Mother? We found it.
Fanny had the key, Like I thought.

643
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:23,548
What do you need for London?

644
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,781
Your vest has no lining.

645
01:08:04,486 --> 01:08:05,974
And your coat

646
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,080
has a small hole.

647
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:18,877
I could mend it so you wouldn’t see it.

648
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:26,613
<i>"My sweet girl,
I am living today in yesterday.</i>

649
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:30,615
<i>"I was in a complete fascination all day.</i>

650
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:33,641
<i>"I feel myself at your mercy.</i>

651
01:08:33,785 --> 01:08:35,751
<i>"Write me ever so few lines and tell me</i>

652
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:39,317
<i>"you will never forever be less kind to me
than yesterday.</i>

653
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,081
<i>"You dazzled me.</i>

654
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:45,515
<i>"There is nothing in the world
so bright and delicate.</i>

655
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:49,114
<i>"You have absorbed me.</i>

656
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:53,207
<i>"I have a sensation at the present moment
as if I was dissolving. "</i>

657
01:09:11,286 --> 01:09:15,218
Fanny, Mrs. Dilke is telling me that

658
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:19,351
Mr. Keats is proposing
to move in next door again,

659
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:22,178
and she wants to know
if I have any objections.

660
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,046
Of course you don't.

661
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:28,780
Mr. Brown is Mr. Keats' best friend.
Why would we object?

662
01:09:30,885 --> 01:09:34,409
Fanny, Mr. Dilke and I are worried

663
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:38,746
that such close connection
may prove restrictive for you.

664
01:09:39,186 --> 01:09:40,174
No.

665
01:09:41,453 --> 01:09:44,941
Mr. Keats can't afford to marry.

666
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:48,480
His situation is really quite hopeless,

667
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:52,018
and if he is next door,
how will you meet anyone else?

668
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:54,152
How will you go to dances?

669
01:09:55,919 --> 01:09:57,180
But you are engaged?

670
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,410
It's his mother's ring.
It's not an engagement ring.

671
01:09:59,552 --> 01:10:01,518
You were not to wear it.

672
01:10:01,652 --> 01:10:03,584
I wear it on the finger next door.

673
01:10:03,718 --> 01:10:04,775
Do not even discuss it.

674
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:09,874
You taught me to Love. You never said
only the rich, only a thimbleful.

675
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:14,317
Attachment is such a difficult thing to undo.

676
01:12:00,885 --> 01:12:03,817
"Pillowed upon
my fair love's ripening breast

677
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:09,808
"To feel forever its soft swell and fall

678
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:14,880
"Awake forever in a sweet unrest

679
01:12:17,118 --> 01:12:21,414
"Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath"

680
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:28,749
That's new.

681
01:12:32,118 --> 01:12:33,584
From which poem?

682
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,041
Yours.

683
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,577
"Bright star,

684
01:12:52,018 --> 01:12:54,450
"would I were steadfast as thou art

685
01:12:57,151 --> 01:13:00,015
"Not in Ione splendor hung aloft the night"

686
01:13:07,084 --> 01:13:08,812
Why do you say "not"?

687
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,281
"Not in Ione splendor"?

688
01:13:14,552 --> 01:13:19,507
You fear I am not steadfast because
I oblige Mama by going to a dance?

689
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:24,814
Don't tease, Fanny.

690
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:28,712
Why are you Laughing?

691
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:34,043
I shall tell her I am unwell.

692
01:13:36,418 --> 01:13:37,714
No, go.

693
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:41,342
Go.

694
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:45,781
Go.

695
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:49,941
Good Irish Abigail,

696
01:13:50,084 --> 01:13:55,142
who never did fail to make a scone
as good as a swan.

697
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:03,414
Would you Like some jam with that, sir?

698
01:14:03,552 --> 01:14:04,812
Please.

699
01:14:10,717 --> 01:14:11,944
Delicious.

700
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:23,239
Fanny! Come in. It's turned cold.

701
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,346
Mr. Keats has gone to London with no coat.

702
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:03,807
John, have you had wine?

703
01:15:05,285 --> 01:15:08,479
I was severely chilled.

704
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:13,712
I was on the outside of the coach,

705
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:18,649
but now I don't feel it.

706
01:15:19,285 --> 01:15:20,614
Abigail!

707
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,482
Abigail! Get up, dress yourself.
We need a doctor.

708
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:32,915
Abigail, bring the water.

709
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:35,374
I need a basin and a towel.

710
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:37,910
And glasses, I need glasses.

711
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:40,744
-Let me help. I can...
-Stand back, stand back.

712
01:16:08,551 --> 01:16:13,075
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne,

713
01:16:13,218 --> 01:16:16,479
but I've managed him
and said that she had gone into town.

714
01:16:16,884 --> 01:16:18,214
But I have not.

715
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:21,680
I am speaking of keeping Mr. Keats calm.

716
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:24,284
This is a deception I will not join.

717
01:16:24,451 --> 01:16:26,883
No, no, it is not a deception.

718
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:32,142
I am simply determined
to preserve the Life of my friend.

719
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:34,708
You would have it that
I kill Mr. Keats with affection.

720
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:37,147
-Fanny!
-Perhaps you will.

721
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:41,773
Apparently, there is nothing I can do to
persuade you of the gravity of the situation,

722
01:16:41,918 --> 01:16:45,543
but Keats is in my care
and all visits will follow my regime

723
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,945
or they will not happen at all.

724
01:16:47,084 --> 01:16:51,482
Please, we Brawnes will do whatever we can
to restore Mr. Keats to health.

725
01:17:08,118 --> 01:17:10,141
I was wondering where you were.

726
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:14,412
I have been waiting
to be with you the whole day.

727
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:19,645
Last night there was a...

728
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,282
There was a great rush of blood,

729
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:33,510
such that I thought that I would suffocate.

730
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:41,016
And I said to Mr. Brown,
"This is unfortunate."

731
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:45,641
My thoughts were of you.

732
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:20,306
<i>"My sweet creature, when I send this round,
I shall be in the front parlor,</i>

733
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:24,472
<i>"watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden.</i>

734
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:32,276
<i>"When I look back upon the ecstasies
in which I have passed some days</i>

735
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,474
<i>"and the miseries in their turn,</i>

736
01:18:34,617 --> 01:18:39,015
<i>"I wonder the more at the beauty
which has kept up the spell so fervently.</i>

737
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:44,009
<i>"How horrid was the chance of slipping
into the ground instead of into your arms.</i>

738
01:18:45,818 --> 01:18:48,045
<i>"The difference is amazing, love. "</i>

739
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:57,705
-Go on! Go on, now!
-No, Brown. Brown. Brown.

740
01:18:58,617 --> 01:19:00,412
I get anxious if I don't see her.

741
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,272
Why not bed her?

742
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,973
She'd do whatever you wished.

743
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,843
It might relieve your condition.

744
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:29,439
<i>"Do not take the trouble of writing much.</i>

745
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:33,845
<i>"Merely send me my good night
to put under my pillow. John Keats. "</i>

746
01:20:19,683 --> 01:20:22,377
<i>"Let me no longer detain you
from going to town.</i>

747
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:26,014
<i>"There may be no end
to this imprisoning of you.</i>

748
01:20:27,817 --> 01:20:31,045
<i>"Perhaps you had better not come
before tomorrow evening.</i>

749
01:20:31,184 --> 01:20:36,707
<i>"You know our situation. I am recommended
not even to read poetry, much less write it.</i>

750
01:20:38,317 --> 01:20:40,442
<i>"I wish I had even a little hope.</i>

751
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,179
<i>"I cannot say forget me,</i>

752
01:20:45,284 --> 01:20:48,875
<i>"but I would mention that
there are impossibilities in the world. "</i>

753
01:21:33,716 --> 01:21:38,375
John, why do you say "impossibilities"?

754
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:42,974
I have coughed blood again.

755
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:52,712
I fear the disease has the upper hand

756
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,472
and I will not recover.

757
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:58,939
I can't Leave you.

758
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,908
I have such clear hope
for your new book of poems.

759
01:22:07,349 --> 01:22:10,111
John, they are more beautiful than
any I have read of Mr. Coleridge,

760
01:22:10,249 --> 01:22:13,477
Mr. Wordsworth, even Lord Byron.

761
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,714
"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms

762
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:24,747
"Alone and palely loitering?

763
01:22:28,183 --> 01:22:33,116
"The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
And no birds sing"

764
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,880
"I met a lady in the meads

765
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,143
"Full beautiful, a faery's child

766
01:22:46,249 --> 01:22:50,545
"Her hair was Long, her foot was light

767
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,575
"And her eyes were wild

768
01:22:56,616 --> 01:22:59,104
"I set her on my pacing steed

769
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,215
"And nothing else saw all day Long

770
01:23:05,516 --> 01:23:10,778
"For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery's song"

771
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:14,279
"She found me roots of relish sweet

772
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:19,105
"And honey wild, and manna dew

773
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:26,676
"And sure in language strange she said
'I Love thee true"'

774
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,113
"She took me to her elfin grot"

775
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:34,443
"And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore"

776
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:40,113
"And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

777
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:44,647
"And there she lulled me asleep

778
01:23:46,049 --> 01:23:49,140
"And there I dream'd, ah! woe betide!

779
01:23:50,716 --> 01:23:52,909
"The latest dream I ever dream'd

780
01:23:57,082 --> 01:23:58,878
"On the cold hill side"

781
01:24:07,683 --> 01:24:08,842
Abigail?

782
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:17,509
Here it is.
Mr. Brown said to give it to you tomorrow,

783
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,240
but I'II not wait.

784
01:24:21,483 --> 01:24:23,449
He is the most cruel,

785
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:29,176
dead-hearted man in this entire world.

786
01:24:30,383 --> 01:24:31,814
Oh, my God!

787
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:37,075
Oh, my God, I wish I were dead.

788
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:40,874
I am boiling with fury.

789
01:24:41,016 --> 01:24:43,380
John, you must not convulse again.

790
01:24:44,516 --> 01:24:49,346
Abigail is with child,
but to whom, out of fear or shame,

791
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:50,880
she would not say.

792
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:55,905
We, Brown, must find out who it is,
and when we have his name,

793
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:59,447
then butcher or baker,
he shall face up to his indecency.

794
01:25:02,116 --> 01:25:05,014
-Will you call her?
-It's not necessary.

795
01:25:08,283 --> 01:25:11,147
She has me believe I'm the father.

796
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:15,939
My God, I had no notion of a Love affair.

797
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:24,038
There was none,
or I must have slept through it.

798
01:25:26,715 --> 01:25:29,307
With what ease you help yourself.

799
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:32,006
I have agreed to pay for the child.

800
01:25:33,882 --> 01:25:38,814
And the worst thing is
I can't keep this place.

801
01:25:40,116 --> 01:25:42,741
I have to start my summer rental early.

802
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:48,281
And I feel wretched turning you out
while you are so unwell,

803
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:51,640
but, John, I can't do anything else.

804
01:25:52,383 --> 01:25:53,746
I'm overloaded with debt.

805
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,575
Don't concern yourself.

806
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:00,313
-I shall manage.
-Stupid. Stupid.

807
01:26:10,882 --> 01:26:13,712
In what stumbling ways a new soul is begun.

808
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:17,005
I'd very much value your opinion, Mr. Keats,

809
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:20,774
<i>on a new painting of mine,
The Cave of Despair. I was...</i>

810
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:23,507
If you are suggesting he won't survive
another winter in England,

811
01:26:23,682 --> 01:26:25,012
then we must do something.

812
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:27,671
Gentlemen, I think we should hear
Dr. Bree on the issue of climate

813
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,008
for Keats' health.

814
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:32,047
Well, a move to a gentler climate
is essential.

815
01:26:32,949 --> 01:26:34,176
I would recommend Italy.

816
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:36,305
-Rome?
-Rome is good.

817
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:40,615
-Does he want to go to Rome?
-Well, he has to go.

818
01:26:40,749 --> 01:26:43,442
He won't Live through another winter
in England.

819
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:49,838
How do you feel about Italy, John?

820
01:26:49,982 --> 01:26:52,447
I do think there is an issue of finance.

821
01:26:56,582 --> 01:27:00,037
Could we not, between us,
start a fund or a coIIection?

822
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,580
It seems possible.

823
01:27:05,582 --> 01:27:09,140
Of course, he'll need a traveling companion.
Brown, you’ll go?

824
01:27:09,283 --> 01:27:10,839
Absolutely, absolutely.

825
01:27:10,982 --> 01:27:14,709
Someone must go.
I'm not sure I shall be able.

826
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:17,474
-Is that a "no"?
-Miss. Miss.

827
01:27:28,615 --> 01:27:32,013
I can help find a room for the summer,
John, if you want.

828
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:37,373
Sammy, walk behind.

829
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:43,048
I want to go to Italy with you.

830
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:46,178
We can marry, and I'II go with you.

831
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:49,846
My friends talk of going to Italy,
but I have so Little money.

832
01:27:49,982 --> 01:27:51,811
Spare a penny, sir?

833
01:27:51,949 --> 01:27:54,414
I can barely afford
these Kentish Town rooms.

834
01:27:55,315 --> 01:27:56,747
Farewell me here.

835
01:27:56,882 --> 01:27:57,848
Why?

836
01:28:00,415 --> 01:28:02,006
We don't do linen.

837
01:28:09,148 --> 01:28:12,081
AII right, I'm coming!

838
01:28:30,182 --> 01:28:31,739
Mr. Hunt can't have meant this room.

839
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:40,581
I told you not to come.

840
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:44,407
Go now.

841
01:28:48,749 --> 01:28:49,680
Go.

842
01:28:54,348 --> 01:28:55,712
Please start.

843
01:28:58,949 --> 01:29:00,141
-Please start.
-Where's Fanny?

844
01:29:00,282 --> 01:29:01,213
Thank you.

845
01:29:02,582 --> 01:29:04,104
She's not eating.

846
01:29:18,749 --> 01:29:20,237
Are you all right?

847
01:29:24,248 --> 01:29:26,806
How Long has Mr. Keats been away?

848
01:29:26,948 --> 01:29:28,244
Five weeks.

849
01:29:30,015 --> 01:29:32,038
Perhaps it is for the best.

850
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:34,773
Whose best?

851
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:41,379
I thought it might be a relief to be separated
when the circumstances are so difficult.

852
01:29:42,282 --> 01:29:46,544
You all wish I would give up, but I can't.

853
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:50,205
Even if I wanted to, I cannot.

854
01:30:35,615 --> 01:30:36,638
John!

855
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:40,447
Keep away from me if you do not Love me,

856
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:43,446
if you have not a crystal conscience
this past month.

857
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:45,770
Oh, my Love.

858
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,938
I thought my heart was breaking.

859
01:30:57,981 --> 01:31:00,913
Mama! Mama!

860
01:31:03,282 --> 01:31:04,611
Mr. Keats?

861
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:07,114
Toots, the door.

862
01:31:13,848 --> 01:31:15,246
Take care.

863
01:31:19,382 --> 01:31:22,246
John. John?

864
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:28,977
Thank you.

865
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:34,313
-Was there any blood?
-No.

866
01:31:36,548 --> 01:31:38,276
Is he staying here?

867
01:31:39,614 --> 01:31:41,671
Yes, yes. Tonight.

868
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,214
Well, I need to examine the patient.

869
01:31:58,115 --> 01:32:01,774
May he stay tomorrow?
Till he Leaves for Italy?

870
01:32:02,248 --> 01:32:04,645
But you are not even officiaIIy engaged.

871
01:32:05,382 --> 01:32:06,904
Can't we be?

872
01:32:09,215 --> 01:32:11,010
There is no end to this.

873
01:32:11,614 --> 01:32:14,376
Next, you’ll want to marry
then travel to Rome.

874
01:32:15,182 --> 01:32:17,773
I should never have moved into this house.

875
01:32:17,915 --> 01:32:18,903
I have let this happen.

876
01:32:19,048 --> 01:32:20,536
Just until Italy.

877
01:32:23,148 --> 01:32:26,671
You are already the source
of so much gossip.

878
01:32:26,815 --> 01:32:28,940
Well then, Let us be engaged.

879
01:33:10,015 --> 01:33:11,106
Toots.

880
01:33:21,915 --> 01:33:23,346
Have you been eating rosebuds again?

881
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,670
So where do your cheeks get their blush?

882
01:33:35,514 --> 01:33:39,776
<i>I confirmed your ship,
the Maria Crowther, sailing for Naples.</i>

883
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,304
When does she Leave?

884
01:33:41,481 --> 01:33:42,742
-In 10 days.
-So soon?

885
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:43,904
Autumn is coming.

886
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:47,535
I'm afraid if you delay
there'll be less and less reason to hope.

887
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:50,277
Then there's no putting it off.

888
01:33:52,247 --> 01:33:54,338
I must march against the battery.

889
01:33:54,481 --> 01:33:56,276
Allow me to pour you another, Mr. Severn.

890
01:33:56,414 --> 01:33:58,243
Really? Well, perhaps I might just tip it back.

891
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:00,643
-Is his passage fully paid for?
-Yes, yes.

892
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:02,371
Everything's taken care of.

893
01:34:05,414 --> 01:34:07,676
What if something should happen
to Mr. Keats

894
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:12,975
or even to you, in a foreign country?

895
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:15,840
How would you survive?

896
01:34:17,481 --> 01:34:20,709
It shouldn’t be Severn. He barely knows him.

897
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:23,276
Where is that fool Mr. Brown
when he is needed?

898
01:34:23,414 --> 01:34:25,380
And why hasn't he written?

899
01:34:27,047 --> 01:34:30,275
I found a goose for Mr. Keats' Last dinner.

900
01:34:33,815 --> 01:34:35,371
Don't say "Last."

901
01:34:43,247 --> 01:34:47,373
...two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. And one, two, three.

902
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:49,844
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

903
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:52,912
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

904
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,071
Toots?

905
01:35:03,815 --> 01:35:05,041
Mr. Keats?

906
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,841
One, two, three...

907
01:35:11,214 --> 01:35:13,612
-She's gone.
-What happened there?

908
01:35:22,314 --> 01:35:27,042
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

909
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:28,511
Very good.

910
01:35:33,347 --> 01:35:36,801
And don't come back.
There's no autumn around here.

911
01:35:37,548 --> 01:35:38,707
Careful.

912
01:35:41,414 --> 01:35:42,970
Are you all right?

913
01:35:45,814 --> 01:35:47,303
Shall we sit down?

914
01:36:46,947 --> 01:36:49,004
Mrs. Brawne, that's for you.

915
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:52,537
It's beautiful.

916
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:55,513
My dear, mad boy.

917
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:58,003
Is it successful?

918
01:36:58,514 --> 01:37:01,911
There were two very positive reviews,
by friends,

919
01:37:03,314 --> 01:37:07,212
and six mainly positive and four hostile.

920
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,636
I don't know, is that successful?

921
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,212
Yes, extremely so.

922
01:37:15,547 --> 01:37:16,945
So they're selling well?

923
01:37:22,713 --> 01:37:25,271
Come back. Live with us.

924
01:37:26,147 --> 01:37:27,612
Marry our Fanny.

925
01:37:44,513 --> 01:37:45,809
I Love you.

926
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:56,206
We should say our goodbyes now.

927
01:38:13,114 --> 01:38:14,602
Shall we awake

928
01:38:20,181 --> 01:38:22,305
and find all this is a dream?

929
01:38:26,847 --> 01:38:27,938
There must be another Life.

930
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,273
We can't be created
for this kind of suffering.

931
01:38:43,181 --> 01:38:47,079
I doubt that we will see each other again
on this earth.

932
01:38:53,413 --> 01:38:55,811
Then why are you leaving?

933
01:38:57,747 --> 01:38:59,269
Why must you go?

934
01:39:00,613 --> 01:39:03,045
Because my friends have paid my way.

935
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:06,704
It is a hopeless hope,
but how can I refuse them?

936
01:39:06,847 --> 01:39:08,540
Say you are too ill.

937
01:39:10,547 --> 01:39:13,445
We have woven a web, you and I,

938
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:17,403
attached to this world

939
01:39:18,547 --> 01:39:21,308
but a separate world of our own invention.

940
01:39:22,113 --> 01:39:24,341
We must cut the threads, Fanny.

941
01:39:25,047 --> 01:39:26,137
No.

942
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:28,573
No.

943
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:33,208
I can't.

944
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,776
I never will.

945
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:48,838
You know I would do anything.

946
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,973
I have a conscience.

947
01:40:15,046 --> 01:40:18,910
-Let's pretend I will return in spring.
-You will return.

948
01:40:31,146 --> 01:40:33,169
We will Live in the country.

949
01:40:36,713 --> 01:40:38,144
Close to Mama.

950
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:43,477
And our bedroom will Look out
onto a Little apple orchard

951
01:40:44,613 --> 01:40:47,135
and, beyond that, a mountain in a mist.

952
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:53,239
We can make a garden
where every sort of wildflower grows.

953
01:40:55,647 --> 01:40:59,545
And we will go to bed
while the sun is still high.

954
01:41:02,113 --> 01:41:06,102
And when it becomes dark,
the moon will shine through the shutters.

955
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,603
And I will hold you close
and kiss your breasts,

956
01:41:19,946 --> 01:41:23,310
your arms, your waist.

957
01:41:27,913 --> 01:41:29,243
Everywhere.

958
01:41:41,246 --> 01:41:42,905
Touch has a memory.

959
01:41:45,313 --> 01:41:46,574
I know it.

960
01:42:18,146 --> 01:42:19,442
Not a word.

961
01:43:01,879 --> 01:43:05,209
Mama, Mr. Brown's baby has red hair.

962
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,868
Hello!

963
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,272
You beautiful boy.

964
01:43:11,346 --> 01:43:14,368
Hello. Well done. Well done.

965
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:16,309
Hello.

966
01:43:16,879 --> 01:43:18,845
It is so nice to meet you.

967
01:43:23,213 --> 01:43:25,111
You've seen the baby?

968
01:43:27,146 --> 01:43:29,407
Looks Like Abigail.

969
01:43:35,612 --> 01:43:37,407
John's reached Naples.

970
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:41,045
They quarantined his ship.

971
01:43:42,013 --> 01:43:47,241
He wrote that he made more puns
out of desperation in two weeks

972
01:43:47,379 --> 01:43:50,005
than he had in any year of his Life.

973
01:43:53,345 --> 01:43:56,539
I should have Liked to have been there
to have heard them.

974
01:43:57,146 --> 01:44:00,703
You could have, had you gone.

975
01:44:09,813 --> 01:44:11,540
It's not that simple,

976
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:15,735
with a baby and my funds reduced.

977
01:44:17,512 --> 01:44:22,911
And then there is this issue
of the snow and the Alps.

978
01:44:23,345 --> 01:44:25,005
And lack of will.

979
01:44:33,412 --> 01:44:35,139
Shall I say it aloud?

980
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:37,543
Will that satisfy you?

981
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:43,108
Shall I say it?

982
01:44:44,345 --> 01:44:46,277
I have failed John Keats.

983
01:44:47,013 --> 01:44:48,911
I failed John Keats.

984
01:44:50,546 --> 01:44:53,671
I failed John Keats!

985
01:44:54,013 --> 01:44:56,911
I failed him! I failed him!

986
01:44:59,245 --> 01:45:04,803
I did not know until now how tightly
he'd wound himself around my heart.

987
01:45:14,546 --> 01:45:18,000
It's for you, Mama. It's from Italy.

988
01:45:34,512 --> 01:45:36,205
It's from Mr. Keats.

989
01:45:37,945 --> 01:45:40,173
He says, "It looks Like a dream."

990
01:47:01,612 --> 01:47:02,941
Start again.

991
01:47:37,611 --> 01:47:39,043
It's cold out.

992
01:47:42,345 --> 01:47:43,276
How are you all?

993
01:47:43,412 --> 01:47:46,536
We're all quite well enough,
but how is Mr. Keats?

994
01:47:47,179 --> 01:47:51,975
Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me

995
01:47:53,978 --> 01:47:55,967
as I know it is to you.

996
01:47:58,379 --> 01:48:00,038
Mr. Keats has died.

997
01:48:02,611 --> 01:48:05,339
I received an account from Severn,

998
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:10,109
and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.

999
01:48:12,511 --> 01:48:14,239
Shall I just read it?

1000
01:48:26,912 --> 01:48:30,367
"Friday, the 23rd of February.

1001
01:48:31,812 --> 01:48:35,108
<i>"At four in the afternoon, Keats called me,</i>

1002
01:48:35,245 --> 01:48:39,677
<i>"'Severn, Severn, lift me up for I am dying.</i>

1003
01:48:40,511 --> 01:48:42,443
<i>"'I shall die easy.</i>

1004
01:48:43,878 --> 01:48:47,242
<i>"'Don't be frightened.
Thank God it has come. '</i>

1005
01:48:48,978 --> 01:48:54,138
<i>"At one point, a cold, heavy sweat broke out
over his whole body, and he whispered,</i>

1006
01:48:55,745 --> 01:48:59,404
<i>"'Don't breathe on me. It comes like ice. '</i>

1007
01:49:01,112 --> 01:49:02,634
<i>"Keats died imperceptibly. "</i>

1008
01:49:02,845 --> 01:49:04,175
No more.

1009
01:49:30,078 --> 01:49:31,771
Oh, God.

1010
01:49:34,578 --> 01:49:37,908
Oh, God. John!

1011
01:49:42,978 --> 01:49:44,103
Mama!

1012
01:49:52,112 --> 01:49:53,475
Mama!

1013
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:57,868
I... I can't breathe.

1014
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:01,439
Mama!

1015
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:16,204
Mama!

1016
01:51:23,244 --> 01:51:26,438
Sammy! Samuel!

1017
01:51:52,344 --> 01:51:54,333
"Bright star,

1018
01:51:55,777 --> 01:51:59,574
"would I were steadfast as thou art

1019
01:52:02,144 --> 01:52:06,338

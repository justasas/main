1
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,570
Tropical
storm warnings are now in effect

2
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,172
for all of
the Gulf Coast.

3
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,157
We're looking at a strong Category
3, so board up those windows

4
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,109
and get ready
for a wild ride.

5
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,094
Folks, there are emergency
shelters being set up in King County

6
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,662
and Scarborough County.

7
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,090
Howie!

8
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,959
Johnny Gavineau.

9
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,261
You got the permit?

10
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:47,764
Yes, I do.

11
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,383
This is against
my better judgment.

12
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,154
Okay. Let's get to it.

13
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,823
Yeah, I gotta
get back to the coast.

14
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,477
There's a hurricane coming.

15
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,083
I got property there. I gotta
get the place battened down.

16
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
Never touch the cage.

17
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,914
Was he trained?

18
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,801
Trained how? Jump
through a hoop on fire?

19
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,019
He can do that?

20
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:44,989
No.

21
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,709
Well, does he just sit
there and look pretty?

22
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,847
I thought he
was a circus cat.

23
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,782
Circus don't want him.

24
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,540
Look, I'm starting
a safari ranch.

25
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,559
This is my
main attraction.

26
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,379
I need, you know,
a scary animal.

27
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,032
Scary?

28
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,785
Yeah. That's what
the tourists pay to see.

29
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,404
I don't think this
cat's scary enough.

30
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,156
I'm not paying top dollar for an
animal that doesn't scare anyone

31
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,542
and doesn't know
any tricks.

32
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,912
Now, maybe if
I'm paying less,

33
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,799
say, $5,000 less...

34
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:38,157
Mr. Gavineau, the only
reason we are talking

35
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:42,429
is because last month this
cat attacked a circus horse

36
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,499
while 300 of
your tourists

37
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,683
ran screaming
for their lives.

38
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,605
Chased her down,
did he?

39
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,060
Went 16 feet over a cage.

40
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,130
Passed 11 other horses
just to get to this one.

41
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,016
Silver Dollar
was her name.

42
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,635
He broke her spine
so that she couldn't move,

43
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:08,772
and then
he ate her alive.

44
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:13,176
You ever heard a horse
scream, Mr. Gavineau?

45
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,467
You want to know why
he went after that one?

46
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,855
Because

47
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,924
she was the pretty one.

48
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,995
And you're right,
Mr. Gavineau.

49
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,698
This cat,

50
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,535
he's not scary.

51
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,572
He's evil.

52
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,480
This is a waste of time
and my gas money.

53
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,237
I'll take it!

54
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,291
Plus your expenses.

55
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,599
Cat hasn't eaten
in two weeks.

56
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,268
That's how you show him
who's boss.

57
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:16,606
And when you move him, you
roll the cage with this.

58
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,734
Safari park, huh?

59
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:33,473
Well, good luck
with that.

60
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,662
Good luck with that.

61
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,706
Man makes his own luck!

62
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,510
Isn't that right,
Lucifer?

63
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,782
Tom, you there?

64
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,111
Tom.

65
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,867
Tom, come on.

66
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,703
Remember? I told you they
have fish here. You love fish.

67
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,223
They have all... Come look
at this. Come look at this.

68
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,110
See, look. Come here.
They have yellow fish.

69
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,663
Blue fish, purple fish.

70
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:50,166
I think they even
have clown fish.

71
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,426
Tom, come on. You're
gonna be happy here.

72
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,346
Mom would have loved
this place. Okay?

73
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,198
It took me
a long time to find it.

74
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,135
I know you understand.

75
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,972
This is your home now. You
cannot come to college with me.

76
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,558
Hey.

77
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,246
Please do not
screw this up.

78
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,388
So, you've been
living with your stepfather,

79
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,110
but you've
taken care of Tom

80
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,612
since your mother
passed away.

81
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,917
And after college,

82
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,353
will you once again
be taking on Tom's care?

83
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,254
Yes.
No red.

84
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:47,940
That depends on,
of course,

85
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,392
what's best for Tom
at that point.

86
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:52,996
I have custodianship, so I
will be checking in on him.

87
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:55,398
Sorry,
he does not like red.

88
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,971
Well, then let's
get things settled.

89
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,158
Tom, would you like to say
goodbye to your sister?

90
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:20,607
So, I'm gonna take off.

91
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,613
I'll see you in a couple
of weeks, all right?

92
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:34,587
No! No touch!
No! No, no!

93
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,839
No!
I'm so sorry.

94
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,677
I got his stuff out.
He likes this...

95
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,762
He likes this
God's eye and...

96
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,414
When he's walking,
he might need it.

97
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,337
Tom,
I want you to be calm.

98
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,124
Good.
Can you sit down for me?

99
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,743
Can you do that for me?

100
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,828
Can you sit down,
please?

101
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,151
Good.

102
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,553
Thank you.

103
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,523
You know,
who Tom is now

104
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,292
is pretty much who Tom
is always going to be.

105
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,578
People can sacrifice
their entire lives

106
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,114
taking care of
an autistic child.

107
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,383
Don't feel guilty
if you can't.

108
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,345
There seems
to be a problem.

109
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,098
Your check is being denied
due to insufficient funds?

110
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:39,319
No, that's... That's not
right. That little...

111
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,689
Do you have
another resource?

112
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,740
No.

113
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,610
What about
your stepfather?

114
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,329
No. There's money in there.

115
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,100
This is Mr. Fenton.

116
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,735
Hi, Mr. Fenton,
this is Kelly Taylor.

117
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,069
Hi, Kelly.
How are you?

118
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,790
Could you check the balance
of my account for me?

119
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,760
Your stepfather withdrew all
the money from that account.

120
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,977
It's closed.

121
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,747
When?
Yesterday.

122
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,918
So...

123
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,220
He said he was
changing your house

124
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,839
into some sort
of safari ranch?

125
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,058
I hope that's
not a surprise.

126
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,509
Yeah, I don't...

127
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:22,178
I don't really care about the
animal thing. That money was for Tom.

128
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:25,682
Kelly, sounds like you should
take this up with Johnny.

129
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,116
Thank you.

130
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,894
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

131
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,295
Okay!

132
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,566
Let's go! Unhitch it!

133
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,714
Hey, .hombres,

134
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,315
I understand that
the power of hurricanes

135
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,884
has almost doubled
in the past 30 years.

136
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,603
Now, whether that has
to do with global warming

137
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,238
doesn't much
matter to me,

138
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,607
but what does matter is getting
this place battened down. Now.

139
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,041
Hey!

140
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,558
Get me a rag!
Here, here, here. Shit!

141
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,443
I want you to keep
pressure on it, okay?

142
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:03,613
Like this.
Now, listen to me.

143
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,281
I want you to go to the
clinic down the road.

144
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,484
Okay. All right? They'll
take care of you.

145
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,369
They will not
deport you.

146
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,406
Now go.

147
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,709
And fast! He's gonna
lose that finger!

148
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:22,115
God damn it! I just said
unhitch me. We're staying here.

149
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:28,404
Get this place
boarded up!

150
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,239
Johnny!

151
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,393
Where are you?

152
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,271
What is this?

153
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:38,975
Johnny?

154
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,129
Where did the freezer
come from, huh?

155
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:51,614
Hey!

156
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,201
What the hell are you doing?
That's a carnivore in there.

157
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:03,676
You understand?

158
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,811
Now, go back in the
house where it's safe.

159
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,966
Out here, not safe.

160
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,668
In the house, safe.

161
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,424
Now, go on. Run.

162
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,225
Hey! Where's my money?

163
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,393
What money?

164
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,129
My bank account.
You closed it.

165
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,698
Wait a second.
That's not your money.

166
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:43,533
Of course it is.

167
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,702
I went to the bank, I asked if
there were any other accounts,

168
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:48,338
they said just one,
co-signed by your mother,

169
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:50,306
so I took it out...
So, you stole it.

170
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,174
You doing drugs?
What?

171
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,943
Because drugs will damage
both the hippocampus

172
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,311
and the amygdala
portions of the brain.

173
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:57,012
That's where we
process memory.

174
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,515
Your memory's
a little foggy here.

175
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:07,089
I have to remind you that
your mom didn't leave a will.

176
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,941
She did.
Hey.

177
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,393
She wanted me to take care
of Tom. That's what she said.

178
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:12,879
Written on
a Post-it note.

179
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,630
Wasn't a Post-it note.

180
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,984
She wrote her wishes

181
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,236
for the future of you and
your brother on a note.

182
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:27,442
Nobody's happy your mom
swallowed a bottle of pills.

183
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,444
I also have
to point out,

184
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,780
in the absence of
any other information,

185
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,901
the money, this house,
goes to me.

186
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,387
Now, I don't know, if she'd
have wanted it any different,

187
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:38,755
she might have
written another Post-it.

188
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:42,608
Just don't do that.
Don't talk about her.

189
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,530
Look, I don't care what you
bought. I need what's left.

190
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,421
That's gonna be
a problem.

191
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,124
What?

192
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,795
I don't have it.

193
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,080
How? How could you
not have it?

194
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,866
You just got it out
yesterday, right?

195
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,601
I bought a tiger.

196
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,837
You're crazy.

197
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:14,957
People are gonna pay to stay
here, they want the real deal.

198
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,592
A Bengal tiger
is the real deal.

199
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,244
That money was for Tom,
for his care,

200
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,978
so that I could know
that he was all right.

201
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:24,200
Kelly, you don't have to put your
plans aside to help your brother.

202
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,288
Just leave Tom with me.

203
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,452
Damn it, Jose!
I said use the big screw!

204
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:50,259
Eat.

205
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:52,728
It's 5:30.

206
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,862
Want eat.

207
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:56,732
Right.

208
00:22:58,928 --> 00:22:59,961
No!

209
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:03,682
No, no, no, no, no!

210
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,620
Look. Okay? There.

211
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,755
Okay, let's go.

212
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,007
Come on.

213
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,354
So, what are we
gonna watch today?

214
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:26,872
Want to try
something different?

215
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,859
Oprah? Ellen?

216
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,778
A little
History Channel?

217
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,929
Arrgh, matey!
Arrgh.

218
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,315
The Taylors.

219
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:40,185
Fascinating viewing,
even after the 785th time.

220
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,505
Arrgh.

221
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,390
Kelly, come closer.

222
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,877
I see my
8-year-old boy today.

223
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,879
We got
an 8-year-old pirate.

224
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:58,020
There's two, Tommy,
three, four, five,

225
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,526
couple more, six, my pirate,
seven, eight candles.

226
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,895
Let's light
those candles, Tommy!

227
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,681
Oh, it's a little
windy out here.

228
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,834
We got two.
We got two!

229
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,137
Make a wish and
blow them out.

230
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:21,694
Happy birthday, my good
boy. I love you so much.

231
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,964
I just want you to be
happy. Come on, nestle close.

232
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,500
This is Tom Lewis.

233
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,870
Hi, Mr. Lewis,
this is Kelly Taylor.

234
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,571
Hey, Kelly.
How's it going?

235
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,206
I'm glad I caught you.

236
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,376
Are you on campus already?
Is everything okay?

237
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,128
There's been a hitch.

238
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:42,314
Okay. What's going on?

239
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,034
Yeah, I'm just... I'm
gonna need a few months

240
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,669
to take care of
some family business,

241
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,955
and I'm just gonna
start second semester.

242
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,975
Kelly, you've deferred the
scholarship twice already.

243
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:55,193
This is about
your brother, right?

244
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,197
You're not his mother.
He has a stepfather.

245
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,332
Now, you need to make
the right choice here.

246
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,036
Otherwise, I am giving this
money to someone who needs it.

247
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,139
Mr. Lewis, I need it.

248
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,874
Okay, that's what
I want to hear,

249
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,909
because I am
really not kidding.

250
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,879
Kelly, if you don't show up,
there's nothing I can do.

251
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,981
That scholarship is gone.

252
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,467
Do you understand?

253
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,818
I understand.

254
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,456
This is
a big step for you,

255
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,058
but look how hard
you've worked for this.

256
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,928
Kelly, I really believe
you're making the right choice.

257
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,197
Thank you. Me, too.

258
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,731
Okay. See you soon.

259
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,071
Stop it, Tom.

260
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,774
I just need a minute.

261
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:50,048
This is my mad face, do
you understand? Stop it.

262
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,202
Don't touch!

263
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,068
Hey! Where did
you get this, huh?

264
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,955
This is Mom's.
Why have I not seen this?

265
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,243
What is this?

266
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,377
Have you taken
any of these, Tom?

267
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,147
Tell me right now.
Have you?

268
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,574
Seconal. Christ,
Mom, what weren't you on?

269
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:17,486
God.

270
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,197
Hey, Tom.
Time to go to bed.

271
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,158
After a
night of watching and waiting,

272
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,943
say good morning to
Hurricane Isabel.

273
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,300
Storm made landfall just
after 5:00 this morning.

274
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,819
We're talking
120-mile-per-hour winds

275
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,237
coming in
off the Gulf Coast.

276
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,739
If you're in
Montgomery County,

277
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,741
you are not in danger,
but don't worry.

278
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,476
We'll be here with
you the whole way...

279
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,259
Outstanding choice.

280
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,789
Hello?

281
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,706
Tom?

282
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,327
Damn it!

283
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,292
Tom, wake up.

284
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,061
Tom!

285
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,130
This is serious.

286
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:14,532
Tom, wake up.

287
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:33,451
Damn it.

288
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,428
You have reached
Montgomery County Emergency Services.

289
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:36,164
We are currently
experiencing a hurricane.

290
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,532
Please enter
your phone number,

291
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,167
and we'll call you
as soon as we...

292
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,333
Give me another.

293
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,543
Tom.

294
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,321
Where the fuck
have you been?

295
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,783
Come with me.

296
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:09,257
Come on.

297
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:34,432
Jesus.

298
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:38,235
Tom.

299
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:42,340
The tiger is
in the house.

300
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:03,744
Come on,
play the quiet game.

301
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:06,281
It's the quiet game.
Quiet game.

302
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,552
Come on. Come on.
Quiet game.

303
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:16,524
Come on, come on,
come on.

304
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,145
Come on,
you piece of shit!

305
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,386
Damn it!

306
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,991
Let's go!

307
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,610
Come on!

308
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:50,578
Eat now. Eat.

309
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,133
Eat! Eat breakfast now!

310
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:00,270
Eat now! Eat!

311
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,592
Eat! Eat!

312
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:10,314
Want to eat!
Want eat!

313
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,319
Eat!

314
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,403
Want it!

315
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:17,805
Your breakfast.

316
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,038
Get dressed.

317
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:08,605
Yes,
stay in your room.

318
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:48,946
Tom.
Get dressed.

319
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,604
No touch. No touch.

320
00:50:57,604 --> 00:50:58,873
I'm touching your shirt.

321
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:01,843
No touch. No touch.

322
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:03,878
Look,
I'm not touching you.

323
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,300
No touch.

324
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,768
No touch.
Come here.

325
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:59,700
Get out of there. Get
out of there. Get out!

326
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,754
What is this?
Enough with Mom!

327
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:16,517
Want her? Have her.

328
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:43,941
Where's the gun?

329
00:55:48,996 --> 00:55:51,348
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

330
00:55:58,906 --> 00:56:00,124
Okay.

331
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:08,265
Move. Move.

332
00:56:10,252 --> 00:56:11,568
Damn it!

333
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:32,973
Please let there be
a way out of this.

334
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:40,080
Show me the way out,
please, God.

335
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,315
Let there be
a way out of this.

336
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:26,243
What?

337
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,335
You bastard.

338
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,930
Are you out of
your mind?

339
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:52,836
It's in a cage.

340
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,605
It's not like it would be wandering
around the whole property.

341
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,341
How the hell are you gonna
keep this thing under control?

342
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,860
Starve it.

343
00:58:01,763 --> 00:58:02,863
How's that?

344
00:58:02,863 --> 00:58:04,698
You have
to starve them.

345
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:06,133
Hasn't eaten
in two weeks.

346
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:08,785
That's how you show a cat
who's boss.

347
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,971
And that's you?

348
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:13,707
I'm just trying to make
a go of it here, Maurice.

349
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,525
Uh-huh.

350
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,778
When Kelly goes to college,
and she will.

351
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:20,213
You know how
young people are.

352
00:58:21,316 --> 00:58:23,950
Who's gonna
take care of that boy?

353
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,452
Well, you...

354
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:28,322
You've been a godsend
to those kids, Johnny.

355
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:38,215
KELLY: It's gotta be here.
Where is it? Where is it?

356
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,869
No! No touching!

357
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:39,343
I think we can go through the
laundry room, okay? You understand?

358
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,011
Let me go first.

359
00:59:44,516 --> 00:59:46,016
Be very quiet.

360
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:23,486
No.

361
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:27,224
No, no.

362
01:01:31,305 --> 01:01:32,539
Come on,
we gotta go.

363
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:33,507
No, stay!

364
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,481
Oh, my God.

365
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:33,412
So sorry
Mom left you, Tom.

366
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,316
She left me, too.

367
01:05:39,921 --> 01:05:41,821
I'm sorry she did that.

368
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,599
But I'm not gonna
leave you, Tommy.

369
01:05:54,902 --> 01:05:58,137
We're gonna get out
of here, right now.

370
01:05:58,137 --> 01:06:01,507
And wherever I go,
you are coming with me.

371
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:06,379
No touch.

372
01:06:08,733 --> 01:06:10,000
No touch.

373
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:39,245
Don't move.

374
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:24,951
Go to the laundry room.

375
01:08:41,685 --> 01:08:43,553
Go back. Go back.

376
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,476
We'll go around.

377
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:43,889
Get in the freezer.

378
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:46,792
I know you understand me.
Get in the freezer.

379
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:12,385
Easy.

380
01:11:12,385 --> 01:11:14,470
All right.
It's okay.

381
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,656
Tom, it's okay.
It's okay.

382
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:21,360
It's okay. It's okay.
Now, breathe slowly.

383
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,130
Just breathe.

384
01:11:35,576 --> 01:11:37,677
Here's what's
gonna happen.

385
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:42,448
You're just
gonna fall asleep.

386
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:45,601
That's not so bad, huh?
I bet you're real tired.

387
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:52,091
Just close your eyes
and go to sleep.

388
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,263
Tommy, come on.

389
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:11,220
Come on.

390
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:38,541
Boy, Phil's
was a madhouse.

391
01:14:39,944 --> 01:14:44,096
Everyone was there,
even Lindsay Bosier.

392
01:14:53,057 --> 01:14:55,024
Tossing back
hurricanes.

393
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:04,750
Eight months pregnant. You'd
think she'd have more sense.

394
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,020
Some people, right?

395
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:15,461
Tom doesn't understand
what happened here.

396
01:15:17,064 --> 01:15:18,715
He can't tell anyone.

397
01:15:22,452 --> 01:15:24,553
So, you gonna
let us go?

398
01:15:29,543 --> 01:15:32,278
You're not the only one
who wanted out.

399
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,814
Your mother was
gonna leave me.

400
01:15:38,685 --> 01:15:40,253
You killed her.

401
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,441
Kelly...

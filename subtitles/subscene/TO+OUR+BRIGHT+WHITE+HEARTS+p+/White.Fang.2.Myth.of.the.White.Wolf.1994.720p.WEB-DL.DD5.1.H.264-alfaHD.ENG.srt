00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,867
Dear Henry,

2
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:28,912
All I can think about
is White Fang and Alaska.

3
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:35,919
Alex, Belinda and I continue the repairs
on the hotel and will reopen soon.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,838
I apologize again for leaving
you in the lurch, but...

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,965
after seeing the destruction
caused by the earthquake...

6
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:45,011
I now understand why they
were so desperate for my help.

7
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,931
In truth, though,
my heart is with White Fang,

8
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:50,892
and I will return to the claim
as soon as possible.

9
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,894
Thanks again
for taking care of him.

10
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,063
Or, is he taking care of you?

11
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,857
<i>By the time this letter
reaches you,

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,903
<i>the ice will have thawed, and you will
have survived your first Alaskan winter.

13
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,906
<i>Did you stand it all right?

14
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,870
<i>Spring is a great time
for adventures with White Fang.

15
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,039
Let him run, Henry.
Let him guide you.

16
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,041
He always knows the way.

17
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:19,921
Your friend,
Jack.

18
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,848
<i>White Fang!

19
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,818
<i>White Fang!

20
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,820
<i>Wait up, boy.

21
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,822
White Fang.

22
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,021
What the--

23
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,829
Sorry, boy.

24
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,791
Guess it's potatoes again
tonight.

25
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,800
C'mon, boy.
C'mon.

26
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,853
Atta boy, Fang.

27
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,781
Come on,
get a drink.

28
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,820
<i>Hey!
You lookin'for somethin'?

29
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,990
Hey! Howdy-hey there, boy.
. Name is Halverson.

30
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,993
<i>Lloyd Halverson.

31
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,831
I-I hate the name, so you
can just use what you like.

32
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:29,003
Now the, wolf here,
I recollect him vividly..

33
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:32,882
I don't believe I know you,
though.

34
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:37,929
<i>Where's...Where's the other boy?
What's-his-name?

35
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,973
You tell me.

36
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,978
Jack! Hey?

37
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,898
Jack...Conroy!

38
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,942
<i>Right?
Jack Conroy?

39
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,903
Always did have me a...

40
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:57,031
<i>mind for names,
all the good it done me.

41
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,994
<i>Jack went back to San Francisco
about a year ago this time.

42
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,872
Is he...
he your brother?

43
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:08,043
Friend. He left me in charge
of his claim.

44
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,839
Yeah, me and Jack,
we, set a spell.

45
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:16,843
What...two, three years back,
when I was passin' through.

46
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,928
I been west of here.

47
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,015
Bellied up at least a dozen digs.
The whole country's been...

48
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,060
picked clean.

49
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,938
<i>Sad to see.
What's your name?

50
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:32,817
Henry.
Henry Casey.

51
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,071
You...You here
all by yourself??

52
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:41,785
Well, Henry.

53
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:45,789
How do I know you ain't killed that
other boy and just took over yourself?

54
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,084
Move on, Mister!

55
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:53,880
No! Hold on, boy, hold on. I never--
Hold your water. I'm-- I'm leavin'.

56
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:56,841
Get outta here!

57
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,886
- Get a hold of him!
- He does what he wants.

58
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,971
Just don't move real fast.

59
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,024
<i>I know what you're thinkin'.

60
00:07:55,024 --> 00:08:00,071
You're thinking how you're gonna
spend your share. Am I right?

61
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,944
My little pals.

62
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,073
Too many of you.

63
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:46,868
Gotta get you to Dawson.
Soon.

64
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,883
What is it, boy?

65
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:25,782
Damn!

66
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,028
Yeow!

67
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,920
Down boy! Down!

68
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:27,886
Agh!

69
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:33,850
Get this trap
off my butt, boy!

70
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,894
Or shoot me where I lie.

71
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,860
A-A!

72
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,906
<i>There'll be more
comin'through.

73
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,992
Gotta get that gold to a bank.

74
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,082
Whatta ya say we...
drag out that raft?

75
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:59,834
Float on into Dawson?

76
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,003
We need supplies.

77
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:05,048
You up for it?

78
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,802
Okay.

79
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,804
We leave in the morning.

80
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:58,810
<i>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

81
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,813
on earth as it is in heaven.

82
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,816
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our--

83
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,907
I mourn the passing
of your father, Moses.

84
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,910
I'll pray for you
in your time to lead.

85
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:19,873
Thank you for sharing your food.
I'll return the favor.

86
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,042
<i>We expect nothing
in return, god-man.

87
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,962
Get away from there.
Come on. Go, go, go.

88
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,009
- No, no.
- To refuse is an insult.

89
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,018
There is something of yours
I want.

90
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:44,814
<i>Your soul, Moses.
Your soul.

91
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:48,902
- Safe trip back.
- <i>You wonder why God's punishing you?

92
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:52,030
We've done nothing
to anger your god.

93
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,033
And yet your people
are starving.

94
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,077
There must be a reason
for that.

95
00:12:57,118 --> 00:13:01,915
My grandfather spoke often of the time
when the caribou would disappear,

96
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:07,087
a time when the thunder
in the earth would be followed
by the coming of the wolf.

97
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:12,008
If we are patient, we will be instructed
how to restore the balance.

98
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:16,012
These are stories, Moses.
You cannot live your life by that.

99
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:22,852
In your book,
there are stories.

100
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,855
If you care for your people,

101
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,858
you'll take them to live with
your relatives on the island.

102
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,906
You wear the same collar
as the one before you,

103
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,950
but your words are hollow.

104
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:39,953
Reverend Michael
underestimated the situation.

105
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,956
Why let this suffering
continue?

106
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:47,961
Move your people
before it's too late.

107
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,004
It is good
you have a concern.

108
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:54,092
Thank you.

109
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,022
<i>Lily.

110
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:34,067
Lily.

111
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:38,822
You came to me in my dream,
you and the wolf.

112
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,908
<i>You showed me the way.

113
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,828
You will leave in the morning.

114
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:49,958
- Where am I going, Uncle?
- <i>To bring back the wolf.

115
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,085
He will lead us
to the caribou.

116
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:57,799
- Where will I look?
- He'll find you.

117
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,065
C'mon, boy. Boat's sailin'.

118
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,862
C'mon!

119
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:22,907
<i>What is it?

120
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,909
It's safe.

121
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,871
Look.

122
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,083
Don't you wanna go?

123
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,051
<i>Come on, boy.

124
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:44,846
Come on, boy.
Come on..

125
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,932
Good boy.

126
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:53,021
Relax. Relax. This is the easy part.

127
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:01,905
When the sun burst across the
horizon, it swept away the dark.

128
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:04,824
That's when Ice Woman,
your namesake,

129
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,994
led her people away from the ice
that crushed the villages.

130
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,996
This is her crest.

131
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,833
It will shield you
from danger.

132
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,045
Don't be fooled
by what you see.

133
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,089
The wolf is a powerful being.

134
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,925
He might not be visible to you.

135
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:24,969
He can change shape.

136
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,806
He might not be a wolf.

137
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,810
When I do find the wolf,

138
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:35,063
- what should I do with it?
- You will know.

139
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,840
Hold on, boy.
It'll be okay.

140
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,811
This look familiar, White Fang?

141
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,940
The water seems high.

142
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:21,985
Movin' right along, boy.

143
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:32,996
Hang on, boy!

144
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,859
<i>Stay low!
Stay low, White Fang.

145
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:17,082
Hang on! Hang on.

146
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,969
Hang on.

147
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,021
White Fang!

148
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,869
<i>White Fang!

149
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,874
<i>White Fang!

150
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,075
Who are you?

151
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:29,913
Lily.

152
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:33,041
Where are we goin'?

153
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,960
To my village.

154
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,924
Did you see a wolf?

155
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:47,931
Did he go
in the water?

156
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:51,017
Did he
come back up?

157
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:55,939
Where is he?

158
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:02,904
Me?

159
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:05,907
I don't understand....

160
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,078
Did he--
Did he get out?

161
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,801
White Fang.

162
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,979
My gold!
I lost my gold!

163
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,815
- Sit down.
- No, no, no! We have to go back!

164
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:41,985
- Be still!
- It's got to be somewhere
in this damn river!

165
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,993
I have
nothing left.

166
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,963
She's here!
She's arriving!

167
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:05,008
To the water!

168
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,886
The canoe is arriving.

169
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,928
What's that all about?

170
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,971
You.

171
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:03,066
<i>Wait!

172
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,835
Who is this,
Lily?

173
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,878
This is the one, Uncle.

174
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:27,924
- This boy.
- I saw the change.

175
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:31,886
<i>The wolf went under the water.
The boy came back up.

176
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,889
No, no. Now wait.
Just a minute.

177
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,809
No one changed
into anything.

178
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,895
The wolf was my friend.
I lived with him.

179
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,939
And I lost him
in the river.

180
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,942
You live with the wolf?

181
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,903
Yes, sir.

182
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:56,036
This is very good.
Welcome to our village.

183
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,831
I am Moses Joseph,
chief of the Haidas.

184
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,044
Henry Casey.
San Francisco.

185
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:08,965
Henry Casey.
Casey Henry.

186
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:11,885
Funny name.

187
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:13,887
Thank you.

188
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,889
Come.

189
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:42,892
At the time of my
grandfather's grandfather,

190
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:46,938
our mother, the earth, shook,

191
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,901
and part of the mountain
you call Devil's Thumb broke off.

192
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:56,030
<i>Many of our people died,
but in return,

193
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:58,992
the Creator gave us
the caribou.

194
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:03,872
<i>Each year they come to us
from Devil's Thumb.

195
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:09,002
<i>For this reason, we respect
the mountain and do not go there.

196
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,965
For two years now,
the caribou have not returned.

197
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,885
Eight hunters went to find them.

198
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:18,887
They, too, have vanished.

199
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,890
<i>Without the caribou...

200
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,810
<i>the balance in our lives
is gone.

201
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:30,065
Without this balance,
my people...

202
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:32,901
<i>slowly starve,

203
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:37,989
<i>die, move away.

204
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:41,868
<i>If my dream showed me
the way of this god-man,

205
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,954
I would ask my people
to move.

206
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,793
<i>But the dream
told of the wolf...

207
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,795
that would lead us
to the caribou.

208
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:55,882
<i>And now, Henry Casey,
you are here.

209
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,928
Me?

210
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,102
Got the wrong man, sir.

211
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,064
<i>I'm not much of a hunter.
I'm more of a miner.

212
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:16,111
That is very interesting.

213
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,947
Really.

214
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:24,828
That wolf your niece
saw me with...

215
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:27,831
<i>was a pet.

216
00:32:27,872 --> 00:32:30,875
He's the hunter.

217
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,879
He was something.

218
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,924
But he's gone now.

219
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:42,095
He could be alive inside you.
The wolf has the power to change.

220
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:44,848
Into me.

221
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:51,020
I guess that's okay
to believe, sir,

222
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:53,022
but I don't.

223
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,068
I'm no wolf.

224
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,906
<i>I'm a man.

225
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:07,829
That's all.

226
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:30,018
This boy is free to leave
when he wishes.

227
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,065
Thank you.

228
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:39,986
I need supplies. I need to wire
San Francisco for some money.

229
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:42,781
There must be
a town near here.

230
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:44,866
When you are ready,
we can show you the way.

231
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:49,829
If it's all right with you, I'll stay
here tonight. I'll leave in the morning.

232
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:54,876
Good idea. Katrin can show you
where to lay down.

233
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,961
Sleep now, Casey Henry.

234
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:04,052
- We can talk again tomorrow.
- Okay.

235
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:07,806
He's a nice old guy?

236
00:34:09,015 --> 00:34:12,018
Old guy is my father.

237
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,063
- Who are you in his house?
- I didn't mean anything.

238
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:18,900
<i>Henry, this way.

239
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,919
White Fang.

240
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:46,970
I should have known.
You don't see.

241
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:49,973
I didn't ask you
to bring me here.

242
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:56,938
- I sang the healing song for you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

243
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,107
I gave you back your life.

244
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:05,947
Do you believe that stuff?

245
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,828
All you believe in
is your gold.

246
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:18,835
I'm grateful
what you did for me.

247
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:25,884
But I'm not gonna go to some
godforsaken place to hunt caribou.

248
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:27,969
We thought you were the wolf.

249
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,848
Sorry.

250
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:36,853
The wolf is a great hunter
with a warrior's heart.

251
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:39,856
You are like every other
white man.

252
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:04,798
Follow the river.
Before dark you will come to it.

253
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,892
- Major.
- You shouldn't be here.

254
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,019
I told you not to--

255
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,856
<i>Follow me.

256
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:06,025
- Yes, sir. 
- Let's go.

257
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:29,883
<i>Morning! Hi, there.

258
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:46,941
<i>I figured
the best thing to do is keep movin'.

259
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:50,862
<i>At least I wouldn't
be eatin'their food.

260
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,947
<i>Then Lily,

261
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:55,867
the Indian girl--

262
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:59,954
She walked me to the stream
and pointed me here.

263
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:03,958
Why didn't you stay
and help them?

264
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,922
Why? I'll tell you why.
You're Indian, right?

265
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:16,805
I thought so. So you probably
understand them a bit better than I do.

266
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:19,933
They believe...
s-strange things up there.

267
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:22,936
Like their dreams.

268
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,063
They need help.

269
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:31,903
I thought I saw some soldiers
while I was comin' in.
Where are they quartered?

270
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:34,864
The army's in Dawson.

271
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:36,908
No, I just saw them.

272
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:41,955
You just saw somebody
passin' through.

273
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,083
<i>So now you'll go home...

274
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,002
and forget these people
who helped you.

275
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:52,966
If I thought
I could help them, I would.

276
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:56,845
- They think you can.
- They think I'm the white wolf.

277
00:38:57,887 --> 00:38:59,848
Maybe you are.

278
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:25,040
That's him, Uncle.
That's the wolf.

279
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,837
<i>The other half. It's a good sign.

280
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,841
Good sign.

281
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:06,998
Don't be afraid, my brother.
Don't be afraid.

282
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:24,034
Sad, isn't it?

283
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:23,820
I'm goin' back.

284
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:09,949
Gentlemen.

285
00:44:11,034 --> 00:44:13,036
Was there any mail for me yesterday,
Mr. Hale?

286
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:16,915
- One for Rev. Michael.
- I'll take that.

287
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:18,917
How long you figure?

288
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:22,879
Telegram will be there
in two, three days at the most.

289
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:26,007
<i>Of course, when your money comes back
is another story.

290
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,051
<i>At least a week, maybe more.

291
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:32,013
Can I get some credit?
I'm leavin' for the village tomorrow.

292
00:44:32,055 --> 00:44:34,849
<i>I was hopin'to
take some food out there.

293
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:38,061
Sorry, kid. No credit.

294
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:41,981
I'll pay for it, Mr. Heath.
Give him what he wants.

295
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:44,859
<i>All right.

296
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:49,864
I'm Leland Drury.

297
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:54,828
- Henry Casey.
- I couldn't help but overhear.

298
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,080
I go to the village often.
Their suffering is hard to ignore.

299
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,041
<i>I have some mules
that know the way,

300
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,877
if you'd care to use one.

301
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:05,880
Yeah, thanks.

302
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,049
You're savin' me a trip.

303
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:16,933
Walks like a soldier.

304
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,019
Protestant.

305
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:27,021
You understand the problem.
I want him out of the way!

306
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:29,858
Do it now!

307
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:31,943
<i>All right.

308
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:37,861
This is for you.

309
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:47,954
Why would I wear this?

310
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:51,833
I don't know.
I thought it would look pretty.

311
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,877
Pretty like a white girl?

312
00:49:56,004 --> 00:50:00,967
No. Tell you what.
Don't wear it.

313
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:04,012
See if I care.
Here, give it back.

314
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:09,017
<i>What do I have to do?
Look, I'm here!

315
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,061
And I came back
to find those caribou,

316
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:13,855
<i>whether you
believe me or not.

317
00:50:13,897 --> 00:50:15,940
<i>Maybe one of these days
when this is all over,

318
00:50:15,982 --> 00:50:18,068
you'll realize I'm not as worthless
as you think I am.

319
00:50:18,818 --> 00:50:21,905
Henry Casey.

320
00:50:21,946 --> 00:50:23,990
- <i>He was here looking for you.
- Who was?

321
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:26,826
The wolf.

322
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:31,956
- White Fang? He's alive?
- Yeah.

323
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:35,085
- Are you sure it was him?
- Same wolf.

324
00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:40,048
- Well, where is he? Where'd he go?
- Be patient. He will find you.

325
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:45,929
Lily. Go find Katrin.
Tonight we do the ceremony.

326
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,878
<i>Mr. Heath?

327
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:29,889
He's just a boy, Leland.

328
00:51:29,973 --> 00:51:32,767
That boy could ruin
everything.

329
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:37,981
Do I have to do
everything myself?

330
00:51:52,912 --> 00:51:54,956
I shouldn't be down here.

331
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:57,042
Let the wolf
inside you free.

332
00:52:52,013 --> 00:52:54,099
That's White Fang.

333
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,018
Go. Go.

334
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:33,888
White Fang?

335
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:42,897
Wait here.

336
00:53:56,828 --> 00:53:58,830
White Fang?

337
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,877
Is that you, boy?

338
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,844
White Fang.

339
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:17,891
Hyeh! Hah!

340
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:24,981
White Fang!

341
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,955
White Fang!
Come on, boy!

342
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:47,837
You found a friend.

343
00:54:50,006 --> 00:54:52,050
Wow.

344
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:54,928
<i>Henry Casey!

345
00:54:57,013 --> 00:54:59,015
Moses.

346
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:02,018
Wanna come, boy?

347
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:09,818
Okay.

348
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:11,861
That's okay.

349
00:55:18,034 --> 00:55:22,038
You missed me. I knew it.

350
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:52,819
The White Wolf.

351
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,959
These belonged
to my brother.

352
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:13,048
For the hunt.

353
00:56:14,924 --> 00:56:17,927
I was wrong about you.

354
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:21,890
That's okay, Lily.

355
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,019
Sleep well...

356
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:29,064
White Wolf.

357
00:56:33,818 --> 00:56:35,904
She likes me.

358
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:38,948
She likes me, boy.

359
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:46,831
This is <i>tishlinjao.

360
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:50,001
Devil's Club juice
and saltwater.

361
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:53,963
For three days you will fast
and drink only this.

362
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:58,009
To hunt is a sacred act.

363
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:01,763
You must purify your body
to be worthy of the kill.

364
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:03,973
Your mind must be clear
of all else,

365
00:57:04,015 --> 00:57:06,976
<i>no distractions.

366
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:16,069
<i>You care for Lily.

367
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:18,071
Yes, sir, I do.

368
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:21,032
Lily does not
yield so easily.

369
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:24,869
- She's tough.
- <i>All Haida women are like this,

370
00:57:24,953 --> 00:57:26,913
but Lily learned
when she was very young.

371
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:30,792
- Why's that?
- Already death has
visited her three times.

372
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:35,004
Her mother, her father,
her brother.

373
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:39,092
<i>All taken by the smallpox,
white man's plague.

374
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:42,971
<i>So Lily has found
her strength.

375
00:57:43,012 --> 00:57:44,973
It is out of your hands,
White Wolf.

376
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:49,894
Haida women do the choosing, and
the sun will set on top of my head...

377
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:52,021
before Lily yields.

378
00:57:52,063 --> 00:57:54,023
Put her out of your mind.

379
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,067
That's not
gonna be so easy.

380
00:57:58,027 --> 00:58:00,822
Drink this.

381
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:07,954
<i>All the way.
Drink it all the way down.

382
00:58:07,996 --> 00:58:09,998
More.

383
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,042
<i>There you go.

384
00:59:06,096 --> 00:59:08,056
That's a nice shot.

385
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:11,976
Hello!

386
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,020
Who's out there?

387
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:19,025
Who's out there?

388
00:59:23,822 --> 00:59:25,073
Was that you?

389
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:36,960
I can teach you.

390
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,880
Gently.

391
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:47,804
There's nothing else
in the world...

392
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:49,931
but you, this arrow
and the tree.

393
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:51,975
And you are all one.

394
00:59:54,102 --> 00:59:56,062
Let it go.

395
01:00:12,996 --> 01:00:16,916
<i>We have the wolf.
Why do we need the boy?

396
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,960
<i>They're one and the same.

397
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:20,962
<i>In the dream, it was a wolf.

398
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:23,965
- <i>Dreams have many shapes.
- But--

399
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:27,886
I know. I know.
This is very hard on you, son.

400
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:30,972
<i>Be patient.
Your time will come.

401
01:00:32,015 --> 01:00:34,017
<i>Your time will come.

402
01:00:55,955 --> 01:00:58,958
Grandfather's bow.

403
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:04,839
- I couldn't take this, sir.
- You will need it.

404
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,013
Let Peter and Lily
come with me.

405
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:15,058
Women don't hunt.

406
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:16,976
Why?

407
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,854
Old ways.

408
01:01:21,106 --> 01:01:24,067
But, Peter,
can't he go?

409
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:26,945
He's ready;
you know it.

410
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:29,948
I will speak
to the holy man.

411
01:02:00,937 --> 01:02:02,897
How do I look?

412
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:46,024
You can go on the mountain.
You can hunt.

413
01:03:01,998 --> 01:03:05,835
Uncle, in the pack,
it is the female wolf who runs down--

414
01:03:05,835 --> 01:03:09,005
- Lily, you can't go.
- But I am better than Peter
with a bow. You know this.

415
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:12,050
- Stop. My head aches.
- Who found the White Wolf?

416
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:15,887
He found you.

417
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,058
Moses.

418
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,102
What else
did he see?

419
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:25,855
One will not return.

420
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:33,905
Where you come from
there are no women?

421
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:35,990
You don't see them.
Only men.

422
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:39,828
No, no. There's women.
Beautiful women.

423
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:41,830
They're just too soft
for livin' up here.

424
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:43,998
- So you want a Haida girl.
- I want Lily.

425
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,042
My cousin's a princess.

426
01:03:46,042 --> 01:03:48,044
Doesn't matter to me.

427
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:52,006
We don't buy presents.

428
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:55,009
If you want to tell a Haida girl
you care for her,

429
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:58,763
you come up behind her,
put your chin on her shoulder,

430
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:01,057
and you talk softly
in her ear.

431
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,101
That's it?

432
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:06,104
- And she'll understand?
- Or break your nose.

433
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:11,943
You don't choose a Haida woman.
She chooses you.

434
01:04:15,822 --> 01:04:17,073
Man.

435
01:04:43,975 --> 01:04:46,895
<i>A miner's pack.

436
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:56,863
<i>My grandfather's pole.

437
01:04:56,905 --> 01:05:00,825
It tells of
a great Haida chief.

438
01:05:01,993 --> 01:05:03,995
Bear clan.

439
01:05:06,081 --> 01:05:08,917
<i>His father, the Wolf.

440
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:15,965
Mother.

441
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:21,054
Calm Woman With Fish.

442
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,895
Raven.

443
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:32,816
My father.

444
01:05:34,984 --> 01:05:39,781
To be remembered by a pole
is a great honor.

445
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:46,830
<i>In my clan, there have been
many chiefs and warrior women.

446
01:05:46,913 --> 01:05:49,791
I carry all of them
inside of me,

447
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,836
even those
yet to be born.

448
01:05:52,836 --> 01:05:54,879
And they carry me.

449
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:59,008
We belong
only to each other.

450
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:03,012
And no one can
take that away from us.

451
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:05,014
Do you understand?

452
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:10,103
Since I've been here,
I've even felt that way myself.

453
01:06:10,854 --> 01:06:13,815
You know,
part of something.

454
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:18,987
I've never felt
more at home anywhere.

455
01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:22,866
When you go back
to your world,

456
01:06:22,907 --> 01:06:25,827
I hope you won't forget.

457
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:28,997
I'll never
forget you, Lily.

458
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,042
I won't forget you,
White Wolf.

459
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:36,004
The river delivered you
at my feet.

460
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:42,010
Lily,

461
01:06:42,052 --> 01:06:44,054
there's gotta
be a way.

462
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:49,976
What do you
want me to do?

463
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,812
Tell me. I'll do it.

464
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:55,815
- It's not possible.
- I wanna be with you.

465
01:06:55,857 --> 01:06:58,818
- Don't talk like that.
- I want us to be together.

466
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,864
I'm LilyJoseph.
My grandfather was a chief.

467
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:04,908
I will marry
one of my own.

468
01:07:04,908 --> 01:07:06,910
I wanna make this
my home.

469
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:10,872
I wanna learn your language.
I wanna be a part of this with you.

470
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:12,916
- That will change.
- No, it won't.

471
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:16,836
- You'll change.
- I'm not gonna change
how I feel about you.

472
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,880
You'll leave.

473
01:07:18,922 --> 01:07:21,883
It's not possible.

474
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:24,052
- Lily.
- No.

475
01:07:24,094 --> 01:07:26,054
Lily, please.

476
01:07:27,889 --> 01:07:29,849
It's not...

477
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:31,893
possible.

478
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:35,021
Believe me?

479
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:42,070
Believe me.

480
01:08:27,073 --> 01:08:29,951
Get dressed, you pig.

481
01:08:29,993 --> 01:08:33,830
- What for?
- We're going to the village.

482
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:50,013
He brought us here.

483
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:52,974
A good sign.
Devil's Thumb.

484
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:03,943
<i>Beyond the mountain
you will find the path.

485
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:07,030
<i>Follow it.
It will lead you to the caribou.

486
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:18,958
Morning, Moses.

487
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:23,088
Walk with me, Henry.

488
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:25,090
Have some good news.

489
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,801
Yeah, what's that?

490
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:30,804
Friend of mine's shipping
a load of gold to Fort Tongass.

491
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:34,808
He needs someone to help
that we can trust. It pays $1,000.

492
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:38,853
That's enough to get you home and
then some, but you have to leave today.

493
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:42,816
I can't do that.
I gave Moses my word.

494
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:45,819
Tomorrow White Wolf leads a hunt
to Devil's Thumb.

495
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:47,904
White Wolf?

496
01:09:47,946 --> 01:09:49,989
Henry Casey.

497
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:56,871
I'm losing my patience
with you, Henry.

498
01:09:56,955 --> 01:10:00,083
These people might think
you're something special,
but I know you're not.

499
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:03,837
<i>Now, I'm warning you,
don't go back up that mountain.

500
01:10:03,878 --> 01:10:05,839
<i>Warning me?

501
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,007
What kind of
religion are you?

502
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:10,969
The same as you, boy.

503
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:14,806
I don't know who you are
or what you want with these people,

504
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:16,850
but I know
it ain't right.

505
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:19,936
So why don't you pack up your things
and get outta here?

506
01:10:19,978 --> 01:10:24,023
Don't show off at my expense.

507
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:27,026
It'll come back
and haunt you.

508
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:30,989
<i>I said get outta here!

509
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:46,046
I'll pray for you.

510
01:10:59,976 --> 01:11:01,936
Get the men ready.

511
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:04,814
The boy's going
up the mountain.

512
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:18,995
I brought you food.

513
01:11:19,037 --> 01:11:20,955
Lily, I--

514
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:23,833
You were in my dreams.

515
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:26,086
- <i>But that is where it must stop.
- Why?

516
01:11:26,836 --> 01:11:30,965
Because of who I am,
and who you are.

517
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,803
That is the way it is.

518
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:21,057
Are you prepared to die?

519
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:24,018
Nobody's gonna die.

520
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,938
You must be ready.

521
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:30,817
When I die, I will
come back as a raven,

522
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:32,819
live in the forest
behind the village,

523
01:12:32,902 --> 01:12:35,864
make so much noise, no one
will be able to sleep.

524
01:13:11,983 --> 01:13:14,903
White man's tricks.

525
01:14:05,995 --> 01:14:08,873
I must cut him down.

526
01:14:22,846 --> 01:14:24,806
What is it, boy?

527
01:14:28,935 --> 01:14:30,937
Peter!

528
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,881
I could always
outrun a horse.

529
01:14:57,922 --> 01:15:01,968
- <i>Peter, no.
- Find the caribou.

530
01:15:02,052 --> 01:15:04,012
Peter!

531
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:20,028
Peter.

532
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:52,871
Where's Peter?

533
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,873
He went that way.

534
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:57,000
Lily, you should
go get help.

535
01:16:57,042 --> 01:17:00,003
No. We stay together.

536
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:05,884
I'm goin' with him.

537
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,046
You found 'em, boy,
just like Moses said.

538
01:18:37,934 --> 01:18:40,019
Look.

539
01:18:40,061 --> 01:18:42,856
<i>That's why the caribou
haven't returned.

540
01:18:42,897 --> 01:18:45,066
<i>That wall
is blocking the pass.

541
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,950
Come on.

542
01:18:53,992 --> 01:18:56,911
Let's go find out
who built it.

543
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,832
Are you okay?

544
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:44,834
Where are we?

545
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,798
Looks like the air shaft
of a mine.

546
01:19:56,054 --> 01:19:58,848
Does your family
know this is here?

547
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:01,810
This is a gold mine,
Lily.

548
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:04,813
- You know what that means?
- Money.

549
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:07,982
Lots of money. That's why
they wanna keep you away from here.

550
01:20:08,024 --> 01:20:12,946
<i>We gotta get outta here,
get some help.

551
01:20:12,987 --> 01:20:15,824
The caribou will turn
and not come back.

552
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:18,827
- We can't help that.
- We need to knock down that wall.

553
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:21,955
- We need dynamite.
- Miners have dynamite.

554
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:07,834
Now!

555
01:21:37,864 --> 01:21:40,075
Come on.

556
01:21:40,784 --> 01:21:42,994
The hunters.

557
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:47,040
- This way.
- <i>That's Heath.

558
01:21:54,881 --> 01:21:57,926
<i>Come on! Get going!

559
01:22:02,972 --> 01:22:04,933
Back to work!

560
01:22:05,975 --> 01:22:08,019
Back!

561
01:22:09,938 --> 01:22:13,066
Stop! Or I'll put a bullet
between your eyes!

562
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,781
Is that you, Henry?

563
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,044
<i>Congratulations.

564
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:36,047
You're the first one
to get through.

565
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:38,049
Get back!

566
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:40,969
You sound
very sinister, Henry.

567
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:44,848
<i>You and I,
we have the same religion.

568
01:22:44,931 --> 01:22:46,891
Gold.

569
01:22:46,933 --> 01:22:50,812
Who are you? I sure as hell know
you're not a preacher.

570
01:22:50,854 --> 01:22:55,817
No. I'm just another
greedy American, just like yourself.

571
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:58,903
- I'm not like you.
<i>- Come on now, Henry.

572
01:23:00,864 --> 01:23:03,992
You, if anyone,
should understand.

573
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:07,871
All this gold.

574
01:23:09,914 --> 01:23:11,916
They aren't miners.

575
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:13,918
They never came up here.

576
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,005
- <i>Who would it hurt?
- Who?

577
01:23:17,047 --> 01:23:20,967
You starved these people
and stole from them at the same time.

578
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:22,969
<i>That's not the way
I planned it.

579
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,847
I thought they'd move.

580
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:28,975
You're sick, Mister.
And you'll burn in hell.

581
01:23:29,059 --> 01:23:31,019
Harsh words, Henry.

582
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:33,855
Very harsh words.

583
01:23:33,897 --> 01:23:36,983
But I'm not gonna let you
turn on your own people.

584
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:41,029
I'm prepared to offer you a piece of
everything we take out of this mine...

585
01:23:41,071 --> 01:23:43,865
<i>from here on in.

586
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:45,867
What do ya say?

587
01:23:45,909 --> 01:23:47,952
It's not yours to give.

588
01:23:47,994 --> 01:23:50,872
- Well, sure it is, Henry.
- Get back!

589
01:23:50,914 --> 01:23:52,916
Do we have a deal?

590
01:23:58,963 --> 01:24:01,007
Get him!

591
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:03,885
Get him!<i>

592
01:24:03,927 --> 01:24:06,805
Get him!<i>

593
01:24:45,093 --> 01:24:47,929
Come on!

594
01:24:47,971 --> 01:24:50,807
- Lily!
- Go on, White Wolf!

595
01:24:51,975 --> 01:24:54,894
Go! Go!

596
01:25:50,033 --> 01:25:52,827
Leland! Leland!

597
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:54,829
Let the boy go.

598
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:57,082
He's probably halfway
to Dawson by now to get help.

599
01:25:57,832 --> 01:26:00,043
He's got dynamite.
He'll blow the wall.

600
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,922
- Get the girl.
- What?

601
01:26:03,963 --> 01:26:05,965
Get the girl!

602
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,931
Come with me.

603
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,035
Okay.

604
01:27:11,948 --> 01:27:14,909
I got him!

605
01:27:56,868 --> 01:27:59,079
Henry! We're
leaving now, Henry!

606
01:28:01,831 --> 01:28:04,000
Put her in the wagon!

607
01:28:12,008 --> 01:28:15,804
<i>Come on! Come on!

608
01:29:00,974 --> 01:29:03,977
Come on!

609
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:28,001
White Fang!

610
01:29:28,043 --> 01:29:32,881
- White Wolf!
- Peter! Wait!

611
01:29:43,892 --> 01:29:45,894
Peter!

612
01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:51,900
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

613
01:30:54,796 --> 01:30:56,881
<i>Henry!

614
01:30:57,966 --> 01:30:59,968
Untie me!

615
01:31:02,846 --> 01:31:04,889
I can't get it!

616
01:31:39,883 --> 01:31:41,926
That's my gold.

617
01:31:41,968 --> 01:31:44,095
That's my gold.

618
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:12,082
<i>Here, boy!

619
01:32:12,832 --> 01:32:15,919
White Fang!<i>

620
01:32:16,002 --> 01:32:18,046
Here, boy!

621
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,851
White Fang!

622
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,081
Moses.

623
01:33:35,081 --> 01:33:37,834
It's done.

624
01:33:38,877 --> 01:33:40,837
Peter.

625
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:47,969
<i>They couldn't catch my son.
They shot him in the back.

626
01:33:51,848 --> 01:33:53,808
No.

627
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:57,812
That's impossible.
He was just running with me.

628
01:33:57,854 --> 01:33:59,898
Right beside me.

629
01:34:01,066 --> 01:34:03,860
Peter loved to run.

630
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,834
Sleep.

631
01:34:19,876 --> 01:34:22,003
I will watch him.

632
01:34:55,036 --> 01:34:57,038
<i>Lily!

633
01:35:22,897 --> 01:35:25,024
White Fang!
Come here, boy.

634
01:35:25,066 --> 01:35:28,027
<i>Come here.

635
01:35:31,865 --> 01:35:34,034
Here, boy.

636
01:35:34,075 --> 01:35:37,037
Hey, boy, how you
feelin'? Okay?

637
01:35:54,095 --> 01:35:56,097
Thank you.

638
01:36:02,896 --> 01:36:05,065
That's Peter.

639
01:36:08,818 --> 01:36:10,779
Just like he promised.

640
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:26,002
Lily, would you stop?

641
01:36:26,044 --> 01:36:29,005
What is it?
What's wrong?

642
01:36:35,804 --> 01:36:37,097
<i>My gold.

643
01:36:39,808 --> 01:36:41,810
You found it.

644
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:44,979
Now you can go.

645
01:36:46,815 --> 01:36:48,817
I don't wanna go.

646
01:36:50,902 --> 01:36:52,862
Lily.

647
01:36:53,947 --> 01:36:55,907
Lily!

648
01:36:59,828 --> 01:37:01,830
<i>Where will you go now?

649
01:37:01,871 --> 01:37:03,873
I don't know yet.

650
01:37:03,957 --> 01:37:05,917
Where's home?

651
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:07,919
San Francisco.

652
01:37:07,961 --> 01:37:10,004
But there's nothing
there for me.

653
01:37:10,046 --> 01:37:12,006
Not anymore.

654
01:37:12,048 --> 01:37:16,094
Nothing? Not even
for a man with gold?

655
01:37:16,845 --> 01:37:18,972
Nothing
I'm interested in.

656
01:37:19,013 --> 01:37:21,015
Nothing I want.

657
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:37,991
If you see Lily--

658
01:37:52,839 --> 01:37:56,051
Thank you, Moses.
For everything.

659
01:37:59,888 --> 01:38:02,015
It was you
who did the giving.

660
01:38:03,058 --> 01:38:05,060
May the Great Spirit...

661
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:07,062
and all the spirits...

662
01:38:07,103 --> 01:38:09,898
keep you and protect you.

663
01:38:09,898 --> 01:38:12,025
You are a human being...

664
01:38:12,067 --> 01:38:15,904
of courage and of honor.

665
01:38:15,904 --> 01:38:18,823
When we speak of you,

666
01:38:18,865 --> 01:38:22,869
it will be with pride.

667
01:38:36,966 --> 01:38:40,053
Henry, come back in the spring!

668
01:39:04,911 --> 01:39:07,914
White Fang!
Come on, boy!

669
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,959
Come on, boy!

670
01:39:16,881 --> 01:39:20,009
Let's go, boy.
Come on, let's go!

671
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:44,034
White Wolf!

672
01:39:50,957 --> 01:39:52,959
White Wolf!

673
01:39:55,962 --> 01:39:57,964
White Wolf.

674
01:39:59,924 --> 01:40:01,926
I choose you.

675
01:40:38,046 --> 01:40:41,007
I choose you, Henry Casey.

676
01:41:46,072 --> 01:41:48,783
Hey, White Fang!

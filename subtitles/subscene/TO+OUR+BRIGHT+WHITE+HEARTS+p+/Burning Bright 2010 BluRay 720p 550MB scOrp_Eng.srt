þ

15
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,570
Tropical storm warnings
are now in effect

16
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,172
for all of
the Gulf Coast.

17
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,157
We're looking at
a strong Category 3, so board up those windows

18
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,109
and get ready
for a wild ride.

19
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,094
Folks,
there are emergency shelters being set up in King County

20
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,662
and Scarborough County.

21
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,090
Howie!

22
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,959
Johnny Gavineau.

23
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,261
You got the permit?

24
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:47,764
Yes, I do.

25
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,383
This is against
my better judgment.

26
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,154
Okay. Let's get to it.

27
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,823
Yeah, I gotta
get back to the coast.

28
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,477
There's a hurricane coming.

29
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:23,083
I got property there.
I gotta get the place battened down.

30
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
Never touch the cage.

31
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,914
Was he trained?

32
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,201
Trained how?
Jump through a hoop
on fire?

33
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,319
He can do that?

34
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,606
No.

35
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:50,209
Well, does he
just sit there and look pretty?

36
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,847
I thought he
was a circus cat.

37
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,982
Circus don't want him.

38
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,540
Look, I'm starting
a safari ranch.

39
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,559
This is my
main attraction.

40
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,879
I need, you know,
a scary animal.

41
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,032
Scary?

42
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,785
Yeah. That's what
the tourists pay to see.

43
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,404
I don't think this
cat's scary enough.

44
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,156
I'm not paying top dollar
for an animal that doesn't scare anyone

45
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,542
and doesn't know
any tricks.

46
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,912
Now, maybe if
I'm paying less,

47
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,799
say, $5,000 less...

48
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:38,157
Mr. Gavineau,
the only reason we are talking

49
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:42,429
is because last month
this cat attacked
a circus horse

50
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,499
while 300 of
your tourists

51
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,683
ran screaming
for their lives.

52
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,605
Chased her down,
did he?

53
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,060
Went 16 feet over a cage.

54
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,130
Passed 11 other horses
just to get to this one.

55
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:03,016
Silver Dollar
was her name.

56
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,635
He broke her spine
so that she couldn't move,

57
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,772
and then
he ate her alive.

58
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:13,176
You ever heard
a horse scream, Mr. Gavineau?

59
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,467
You want to know why
he went after that one?

60
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,855
Because

61
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,924
she was the pretty one.

62
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,995
And you're right,
Mr. Gavineau.

63
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,698
This cat,

64
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,535
he's not scary.

65
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,572
He's evil.

66
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:50,880
This is a waste of time
and my gas money.

67
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,237
I'll take it!

68
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,791
Plus your expenses.

69
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,599
Cat hasn't eaten
in two weeks.

70
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,268
That's how you show him
who's boss.

71
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:16,606
And when you move him, you roll the cage
with this.

72
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,734
Safari park, huh?

73
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:33,473
Well, good luck
with that.

74
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,662
Good luck with that.

75
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,706
Man makes his own luck!

76
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,510
Isn't that right,
Lucifer?

77
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,782
Tom, you there?

78
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,111
Tom.

79
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,867
Tom, come on.

80
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,703
Remember? I told you they have fish here.
You love fish.

81
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,223
They have all...
Come look at this.  Come look at this.

82
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,110
See, look. Come here.
They have yellow fish.

83
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,663
Blue fish, purple fish.

84
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,166
I think they even
have clown fish.

85
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,826
Tom, come on.
You're gonna be happy here.

86
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,346
Mom would have loved
this place. Okay?

87
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,198
It took me
a long time to find it.

88
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,135
I know you understand.

89
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,972
This is your home now.
You cannot come to college with me.

90
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,558
Hey.

91
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,646
Please do not
screw this up.

92
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:28,388
So, you've been living with
your stepfather,

93
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,110
but you've
taken care of Tom

94
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:36,612
since your mother
passed away.

95
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,917
And after college,

96
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,353
will you once again
be taking on Tom's care?

97
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,654
Yes.
No red.

98
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:47,940
That depends on,
of course,

99
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,392
what's best for Tom
at that point.

100
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,996
I have custodianship,
so I will be checking in on him.

101
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,398
Sorry,
he does not like red.

102
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,971
Well, then let's
get things settled.

103
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,158
Tom, would you like
to say goodbye to your sister?

104
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:20,607
So, I'm gonna take off.

105
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,613
I'll see you in
a couple of weeks, all right?

106
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:34,587
No! No touch!
No! No, no!

107
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,839
No!
I'm so sorry.

108
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:38,674
I've got...

109
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,677
I got his stuff out.
He likes this...

110
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,762
He likes this
God's eye and...

111
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,414
When he's walking,
he might need it.

112
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,337
Tom
I want you to be calm.

113
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,124
Good.
Can you sit down for me?

114
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,743
Can you do that for me?

115
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:58,828
Can you sit down,
please?

116
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,151
Good.

117
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,553
Thank you.

118
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,523
You know,
who Tom is now

119
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,292
is pretty much who Tom
is always going to be.

120
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,578
People can sacrifice
their entire lives

121
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:18,114
taking care of
an autistic child.

122
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,383
Don't feel guilty
if you can't.

123
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,345
There seems
to be a problem.

124
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:35,098
Your check is being denied
due to insufficient funds?

125
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:39,319
No, that's...
That's not right.
That little...

126
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,689
Do you have
another resource?

127
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,740
No.

128
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,610
What about
your stepfather?

129
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,329
No. There's money in there.

130
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,100
This is Mr. Fenton.

131
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,735
Hi, Mr. Fenton,
this is Kelly Taylor.

132
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:57,069
Hi, Kelly.
How are you?

133
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,790
Could you check the balance
of my account for me?

134
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,760
Your stepfather
withdrew all the money from that account.

135
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,477
It's closed.

136
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,747
When?
Yesterday.

137
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,918
So...

138
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,220
He said he was
changing your house

139
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,839
into some sort
of safari ranch?

140
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,058
I hope that's
not a surprise.

141
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,509
Yeah, I don't...

142
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,178
I don't really care about the animal thing.
That money was for Tom.

143
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,682
Kelly, sounds like
you should take this up with Johnny.

144
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,116
Thank you.

145
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,894
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

146
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,295
Okay!

147
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,566
Let's go! Unhitch it!

148
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,714
Hey, .hombres,

149
00:14:57,782 --> 00:14:59,315
I understand that
the power of hurricanes

150
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:01,884
has almost doubled
in the past 30 years.

151
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,603
Now, whether
that has to do with global warming

152
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,238
doesn't much
matter to me,

153
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:08,607
but what does matter
is getting this place battened down. Now.

154
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,041
Hey!

155
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:47,414
Shit!

156
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,558
Get me a rag!
Here, here, here. Shit!

157
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,443
I want you to keep
pressure on it, okay?

158
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,613
Like this.
Now, listen to me.

159
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,281
I want you to
go to the clinic down the road.

160
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:07,484
Okay.
All right? They'll take care of you.

161
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,369
They will not
deport you.

162
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,406
Now go.

163
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,709
And fast!
He's gonna lose that finger!

164
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:22,115
God damn it!
I just said unhitch me. We're staying here.

165
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,404
Get this place
boarded up!

166
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,239
Johnny!

167
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,393
Where are you?

168
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,271
What is this?

169
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:38,975
Johnny?

170
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,129
Where did the freezer
come from, huh?

171
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,482
Hey!

172
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,201
What the hell are you doing?
That's a carnivore in there.

173
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:03,676
You understand?

174
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,811
Now, go back in the house
where it's safe.

175
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,966
Out here, not safe.

176
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,668
In the house, safe.

177
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,424
Now, go on. Run.

178
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,225
Hey! Where's my money?

179
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:37,993
What money?

180
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,129
My bank account.
You closed it.

181
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:41,698
Wait a second.
That's not your money.

182
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,533
Of course it is.

183
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,702
I went to the bank, I asked if there were
any other accounts,

184
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,338
they said just one,
co-signed by your mother,

185
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:50,306
so I took it out...
So, you stole it.

186
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:52,174
You doing drugs?
What?

187
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:53,943
Because drugs will damage
both the hippocampus

188
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,311
and the amygdala
portions of the brain.

189
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,012
That's where we
process memory.

190
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,515
Your memory's
a little foggy here.

191
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:07,089
I have to remind you that your mom
didn't leave a will.

192
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:08,941
She did.
Hey.

193
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,393
She wanted me to
take care of Tom. she said.

194
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,879
Written on
a Post-it note.

195
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,630
Wasn't a Post-it note.

196
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,984
She wrote her wishes

197
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,236
for the future of you and your brother
on a note.

198
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:27,442
Nobody's happy your mom swallowed
a bottle of pills.

199
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,444
I also have
to point out,

200
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,780
in the absence of
any other information,

201
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,901
the money, this house,
goes to me.

202
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,387
Now, I don't know, if she'd have
wanted it any different,

203
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,755
she might have
written another Post-it.

204
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:42,608
Just don't do that.
Don't talk about her.

205
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:48,530
Look, I don't care what you bought.
I need what's left.

206
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:55,421
That's gonna be
a problem.

207
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,124
What?

208
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,795
I don't have it.

209
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,080
How? How could you
not have it?

210
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:06,866
You just got it out
yesterday, right?

211
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,601
I bought a tiger.

212
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,837
You're crazy.

213
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:14,957
People are gonna
pay to stay here, they want the real deal.

214
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,592
A Bengal tiger
is the real deal.

215
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,244
That money was for Tom,
for his care,

216
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,978
so that I could know
that he was all right.

217
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:24,200
Kelly, you don't have to
put your plans aside to help your brother.

218
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,288
Just leave Tom with me.

219
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:43,452
Damn it, Jose!
I said use the big screw!

220
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:50,259
Eat.

221
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:52,728
It's 5:30.

222
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:53,862
Want eat.

223
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:56,732
Right.

224
00:22:58,928 --> 00:22:59,961
No!

225
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:03,682
No, no, no, no, no!

226
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,620
Look. Okay? There.

227
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,755
Okay, let's go.

228
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,007
Come on.

229
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,354
So, what are we
gonna watch today?

230
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:26,872
Want to try
something different?

231
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,859
Oprah? Ellen?

232
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:31,778
A little
History Channel?

233
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,929
Arrgh, matey!
Arrgh.

234
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,315
The Taylors.

235
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:40,185
Fascinating viewing,
even after the 785th time.

236
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:44,390
Kelly, come closer.

237
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:48,877
I see my
8-year-old boy today.

238
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,879
We got
an 8-year-old pirate.

239
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:58,020
There's two, Tommy,
three, four, five,

240
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:03,526
couple more, six,
my pirate, seven, eight candles.

241
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:05,895
Let's light
those candles, Tommy!

242
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,681
Oh, it's a little
windy out here.

243
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,834
We got two.
We got two!

244
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,137
Make a wish and blow them out.

245
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:21,694
Happy birthday, my good boy.
I love you so much.

246
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,964
I just want you to be happy.
Come on, nestle close.

247
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,500
This is Tom Lewis.

248
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,870
Hi, Mr. Lewis,
this is Kelly Taylor.

249
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,571
Hey, Kelly.
How's it going?

250
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,206
I'm glad I caught you.

251
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,376
Are you on campus already?
Is everything okay?

252
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,528
There's been a hitch.

253
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,314
Okay.
What's going on?

254
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:46,034
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm gonna need a few months

255
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,669
to take care of
some family business,

256
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,955
and I'm just gonna
start second semester.

257
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:52,975
Kelly, you've deferred
the scholarship twice already.

258
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,193
This is about
your brother, right?

259
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,197
You're not his mother.
He has a stepfather.

260
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,332
Now, you need to make
the right choice here.

261
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,036
Otherwise, I am giving this money
to someone who needs it.

262
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,139
Mr. Lewis, I need it.

263
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:08,874
Okay, that's what
I want to hear,

264
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,909
because I am
really not kidding.

265
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,879
Kelly, if you don't show up,
there's nothing I can do.

266
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,981
That scholarship is gone.

267
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,467
Do you understand?

268
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,818
I understand.

269
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,456
This is
a big step for you,

270
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,058
but look how hard
you've worked for this.

271
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,928
Kelly, I really believe
you're making the right choice.

272
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,197
Thank you. Me, too.

273
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,731
Okay. See you soon.

274
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:39,071
Stop it, Tom.

275
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,774
I just need a minute.

276
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:50,048
This is my mad face, do you understand?
Stop it.

277
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,202
Don't touch!

278
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,500
Hey! Where did
you get this, huh?

279
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,355
This is Mom's.
Why have I not seen this?

280
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,243
What is this?

281
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,377
Have you taken
any of these, Tom?

282
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,147
Tell me right now.
Have you?

283
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,574
Seconal. Christ,
Mom, what weren't you on?

284
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:17,486
God.

285
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,697
Hey, Tom.
Time to go to bed.

286
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,158
After a night of
watching and waiting,

287
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,943
say good morning to
Hurricane Isabel.

288
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,300
Storm made landfall
just after 5:00 this morning.

289
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,819
We're talking
120-mile-per-hour winds

290
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:45,237
coming in
off the Gulf Coast.

291
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:46,739
If you're in
Montgomery County,

292
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:48,741
you are not in danger,
but don't worry.

293
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:51,476
We'll be here with
you the whole way...

294
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,359
þ

295
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,659
Outstanding choice.

296
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,789
Hello?

297
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,706
Tom?

298
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,327
Damn it!

299
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,292
Tom, wake up.

300
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,061
Tom!

301
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,130
This is serious.

302
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:14,532
Tom, wake up.

303
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,451
Damn it.

304
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,428
You have reached Montgomery County
Emergency Services.

305
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:36,164
We are currently
experiencing a hurricane.

306
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,532
Please enter
your phone number,

307
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,167
and we'll call you
as soon as we...

308
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,333
Give me another.

309
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,543
Tom.

310
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,321
Where the fuck
have you been?

311
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,783
Come with me.

312
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:09,257
Come on.

313
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:34,932
Jesus.

314
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:38,235
Tom.

315
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:42,840
The tiger is
in the house.

316
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:03,744
Come on,
play the quiet game.

317
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:06,281
It's the quiet game.
Quiet game.

318
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,552
Come on. Come on.
Quiet game.

319
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:16,524
Come on, come on,
come on.

320
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,145
Come on,
you piece of shit!

321
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:27,345
þ

322
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,386
Damn it!

323
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,991
Let's go!

324
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,610
Come on!

325
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:50,578
Eat now. Eat.

326
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,133
Eat! Eat breakfast now!

327
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:00,270
Eat now! Eat!

328
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,592
Eat! Eat!

329
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:10,314
Want to eat!
Want eat!

330
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,319
Eat!

331
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,403
Want it!

332
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:17,805
Your breakfast.

333
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,038
Get dressed.

334
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:08,605
Yes,
stay in your room.

335
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:48,946
Tom.
Get dressed.

336
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,604
No touch. No touch.

337
00:50:57,672 --> 00:50:58,873
I'm touching your shirt.

338
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:01,843
No touch. No touch.

339
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,878
Look,
I'm not touching you.

340
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:26,300
No touch.

341
00:51:26,368 --> 00:51:27,768
No touch.
Come here.

342
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,304
Get out of there. Get out of there.
Get out!

343
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,754
What is this?
Enough with Mom!

344
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:17,715
Want her? Have her.

345
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,463
Where's the gun?

346
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,867
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

347
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:00,940
Where are you?

348
00:56:07,412 --> 00:56:08,778
Move. Move.

349
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,080
Damn it!

350
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:48,572
You could do that for the rest of your life
couldn't you?

351
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:18,062
Do you know where I'm supposed
to be right now Tom?

352
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:21,562
Right this minute...

353
00:57:22,062 --> 00:57:24,561
I'm supposed to be unpacking...

354
00:57:25,662 --> 00:57:28,561
Pretending that I like my roomate.

355
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:33,060
Supposed to be...

356
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:39,260
Staying up all night studying for my philosophy midterm
smoking French cigarettes.

357
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:46,558
Meeting some great guy...

358
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:55,156
Who can look at me and say...

359
00:57:56,257 --> 00:58:00,455
"You're funny"...
"You're smart"...

360
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:06,154
"And you know what?"...

361
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:10,554
"I think that I'm in love with you."

362
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:15,153
That's where I'm supposed to be right now Tom.

363
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:46,153
þ

364
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:51,553
þ

365
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:54,833
þ

366
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:54,341
What?

367
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,341
þ

368
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,841
þ

369
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,138
You bastard.

370
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:22,915
Please let there be
a way out of this.

371
00:59:26,087 --> 00:59:29,220
Show me the way out,
please, God.

372
00:59:29,288 --> 00:59:32,554
Let there be
a way out of this.

373
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,449
This Sucks.

374
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:54,448
But, it's not such a bad way to go.

375
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:59,347
As soon as he bites me...

376
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:02,747
My sympathetic nervous system
will put me into a state of shock...

377
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:04,647
I'll pass out.

378
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:06,847
Before I know I'm drowning from internal bleeding...

379
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:08,348
I'll be dead.

380
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:21,445
I'ts gotta be in here, where is it?..
Where is it?

381
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:23,745
Come on, come on

382
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,456
Are you out of
your freaking mind?

383
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:26,527
It's in a cage.

384
01:01:27,399 --> 01:01:29,713
It's not like it would be
wandering around the whole property.

385
01:01:29,777 --> 01:01:33,465
How the hell are you
gonna keep this thing under control?

386
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:35,004
Starve it.

387
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:37,143
How's that?

388
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:38,223
You have to starve them.

389
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:40,201
Hasn't eaten in two weeks.

390
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:42,800
That's how you show a cat
who's boss.

391
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,300
And that's you?

392
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:49,341
I'm just trying to make
a go of it here, Maurice.

393
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,732
When Kelly goes to college,
and she will.

394
01:01:53,806 --> 01:01:56,359
She's young,
you know how they are.

395
01:01:57,049 --> 01:02:00,000
Who's gonna
take care of that boy?

396
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:01,611
Well...

397
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:05,107
Since Katie died, you've been a godsend
to those kids, Johnny.

398
01:02:06,907 --> 01:02:08,107
I Just...

399
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,706
It's not like it's the first time she's tried it.

400
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:18,505
I shou.. I shoul.. I.. I..
I Just..

401
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:24,304
That's all right,
you just watch your step.

402
01:02:30,503 --> 01:02:34,401
Everything's gonna be fine,
you'll see.

403
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:38,301
He's a beautiful creature

404
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:56,040
I think we can go through
the laundry room, okay? You understand?

405
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,761
Let me go first.

406
01:03:01,376 --> 01:03:02,924
Be very quiet.

407
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,877
No.

408
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:44,533
No, no.

409
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:48,812
Come on,
we gotta go.

410
01:04:48,882 --> 01:04:50,710
No, stay!

411
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:18,154
Oh, my God.

412
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:50,294
So sorry
Mom left you, Tom.

413
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,189
She left me, too.

414
01:08:56,408 --> 01:08:58,369
I'm sorry she did that.

415
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:09,287
But I'm not gonna
leave you, Tommy.

416
01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:14,600
We're gonna get out
of here, right now.

417
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:19,276
And wherever I go,
you are coming with me.

418
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:22,803
No touch.

419
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,937
No touch.

420
01:09:54,496 --> 01:09:56,206
Don't move.

421
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:12,841
Go to the laundry room.

422
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:31,630
Go back. Go back.

423
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:26,619
We'll go around.

424
01:14:29,077 --> 01:14:30,568
Get in the freezer.

425
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:33,562
I know you understand me.
Get in the freezer.

426
01:14:58,081 --> 01:14:59,863
Easy.

427
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:02,214
All right.
It's okay.

428
01:15:02,284 --> 01:15:04,370
Tom, it's okay.
It's okay.

429
01:15:07,078 --> 01:15:09,022
It's okay. It's okay.
Now, breathe slowly.

430
01:15:10,842 --> 01:15:12,679
Just breathe.

431
01:15:23,487 --> 01:15:25,054
Here's what's gonna happen.

432
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:28,977
You're just gonna fall asleep.

433
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:33,829
That's not so bad, huh?
I bet you're real tired.

434
01:15:36,672 --> 01:15:40,923
Just close your eyes
and go to sleep.

435
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,675
Tommy, come on.

436
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,153
Come on.

437
01:18:23,638 --> 01:18:26,832
Boy, Phil's was a madhouse.

438
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:32,362
Everyone was there, even Lindsay Bosier.

439
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:43,635
Tossing back
hurricanes.

440
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:53,968
Eight months pregnant.
You'd think she'd have more sense.

441
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:55,442
Some people, right?

442
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:03,318
Tom doesn't understand
what happened here.

443
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,075
He can't tell anyone.

444
01:19:07,231 --> 01:19:11,297
So, you gonna
let us go?

445
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:19,066
You're not the only one
who wanted out.

446
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,994
Your mother was
gonna leave me.

447
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:28,093
You killed her.

448
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,645
Kelly...

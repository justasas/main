1
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,380
I'm in a rut.
Nothing thrills me any more.

2
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:40,148
I can't even think of a reason to
get off the bed in the morning.

3
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,459
- Really?
- My life is so pathetic.

4
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:46,349
I've seen that Behind the Music
with Leif Garrett 18 times.

5
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,748
- Hey, Leif. It's been a while.
- Too long, man.

6
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,798
I'm so sorry about everything, man. I'm so...

7
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,799
Ready for a bombshell? You saved my life.

8
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,837
But... but I was driving. I...

9
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:04,757
I was on a road to destruction, man. The
accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive.

10
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,717
Can we turn off the cameras, dude?

11
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,269
It's... it's like I'm, I don't know,
trapped in my own life.

12
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,373
Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly
focused.

13
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:17,255
Try thinking about others.
Why don't you do some volunteer work?

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,730
That makes sense.
Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.

15
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:22,867
You still have 13 more minutes.

16
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,590
Oh. Do I? Hm.

17
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:31,014
I, uh, I notice you got a new receptionist.
Nice little body on her, huh?

18
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:33,236
That's my daughter.

19
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:37,582
We could probably call this an early day,
huh?

20
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,461
Attention, everyone.

21
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:46,205
Due to several complaints and
two deaths related to worker fatigue,

22
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,597
I have decided to throw
a company picnic this Saturday.

23
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,251
- How you gettin' to the picnic?
- I don't know. I don't have a ride.

24
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:59,036
Hey, John, you got a two-seater. Hey, Derek,
maybe you go with John, huh? Huh?

25
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:01,509
For the last time, I'm not gay.

26
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,802
- Thanks anyway.
- We'll get him.

27
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,629
Here. Right this way. Watch your step.

28
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,167
OK. They're in the woods.

29
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,544
The camera keeps on moving.

30
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:18,598
Uh, I think they're lookin' for some witch or
something. I don't know. I wasn't listening.

31
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:22,243
Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening.

32
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,585
Something about a map.

33
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,797
Nothing's happening.

34
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:30,124
It's over. A lot of people
in the audience look pissed.

35
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,631
Now, remember, Chris, we have to
work together so that our steps...

36
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:48,612
This is my favourite event:
Catch the greased-up deaf guy.

37
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,231
Go!

38
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:54,091
You're never gonna catch me!
You're wastin' your time!

39
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:57,768
Forget about it! Go do somethin' else!

40
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,634
See y'all next year!

41
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:06,141
- King me.
- I don't want to play any more.

42
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:09,766
The pain. I can't live like this, Brian.

43
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,310
I need you to pull the plug.

44
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,745
I-I can't. I...

45
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:18,664
Be my angel and set me free.

46
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,021
Please.

47
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,842
Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it!

48
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:32,303
I... But... You...

49
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:35,719
Nurse! This dog is trying to kill me! Nurse!

50
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:39,938
You are twisted, lady. You hear me?
You are screwed up in the head.

51
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:45,944
The winner of our final contest
will receive a very special prize.

52
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,224
A week's paid vacation!

53
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:53,793
Did you hear that? Oh, God,
please let it be a fart contest.

54
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,456
These are tranquilliser darts.

55
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,479
I have enough here to take down
Robert Downey Jr.

56
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:02,481
Robert Downey...

57
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:06,676
The last one left standing wins.
Let the game begin.

58
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,049
- All right!
- Run for your life, Peter!

59
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,135
Look at him. He runs like a Welshman.

60
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,338
Doesn't he? Doesn't he run like a Welshman?

61
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,353
- Hey, Brian.
- Hi, Joe.

62
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,104
Bonnie making chicken Marsala?

63
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:33,573
No. She made that three nights ago.
Wow! That's some nose you've got!

64
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:36,152
Yeah. One time it almost
got me a spokesman deal.

65
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,331
"Follow your nose. "
"Follow your nose. " "Follow your nose. "

66
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,276
Oh, I'm sorry. No, that was good.

67
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:48,174
I-I just didn't think you were
gonna go so cartoony with it.

68
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,571
- How would you read it?
- Oh, I don't know.

69
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:56,463
I was thinkin' of doin' it, you know, good.
Like an actor. But your way's good too.

70
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:59,382
We could use a nose like that at the precinct.

71
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,253
Really?

72
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:08,198
I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter.
One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.

73
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:11,967
I don't wanna feed Grandma bacon
while she's in the bathtub.

74
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,033
Peter, are you OK?

75
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,604
Mr Weed, I think Peter needs a doc...

76
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:28,108
We have a winner!

77
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,150
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

78
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,780
No drugs. She's good. He's clean.

79
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,135
That's it, except for the flight crew.

80
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:42,908
Hey, Brian. What's with
the Johnny Law routine?

81
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,658
Say hello to our newest narc. He's a natural.

82
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:49,047
Oh, yeah? How good are you?

83
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:54,383
You're back from Manila. You ate lumpia,
then you made love to two Filipino women.

84
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:57,517
- And a man.
- You mean three Filipino women.

85
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,445
No-o-o-o-o!

86
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,832
Wait a second. Got something.

87
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,500
This could be the real deal, boys. Let's do it!

88
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,237
Don't move, dirtbag!

89
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:38,819
It's coke! Yes! All right! We got 'em! This is
great. This is the rush I've been lookin' for.

90
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,319
Good work, Brian.
Uh, you still got a little, uh...

91
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:46,255
Oh. Oh, thanks.

92
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,569
Where shall we go for your week off?

93
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:56,698
We could all go to Purgatory
like we did last year.

94
00:06:56,864 --> 00:07:01,744
This isn't bad. It's not that good,
but it's not that bad.

95
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,027
- It's so-so.
- Yeah. More or less.

96
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:10,715
Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs,
does that make you a schnozage?

97
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:14,824
- Did you stay up all night writing that?
- I got to bed around 2.30.

98
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:17,544
You know the street value of that cocaine?

99
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:23,929
Let's see. Four and a half kilos
uncut Nicaraguan. 1.7 mil, that area?

100
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:27,068
Uh, yeah. That's... that's... that's right.

101
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:28,908
You guys, Brian's famous!

102
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,978
- You're a hero!
- Way to go!

103
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:36,421
Oh, come on, stop it, you guys. It's nothing.
Oh, Lois, your toast is ready.

104
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,242
Wow! Oh, my!

105
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,708
- Uh, Meg's using a new conditioner.
- He's right! That's amazing!

106
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:47,291
- Time to change Stewie.
- Preposterous. I haven't... There it is.

107
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:49,192
All right!

108
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,197
Stop the car.

109
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,902
Over there.

110
00:07:57,466 --> 00:08:00,226
Everybody freeze! This is a bust!

111
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:03,022
Brian, this is a Sunday-school class.

112
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:07,052
The hell it is. Pure Bogotá bullion.
This is a drug ring.

113
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:11,054
- But these are just kids.
- Oh, yeah? What's your name?

114
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:14,013
- Ricky.
- They're not kids. They're midgets.

115
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,288
Filthy drug-peddling midgets.

116
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,217
Oh, my God!

117
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,853
Look out, Brian!

118
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,434
- Nice work!
- You're a credit to the force.

119
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:47,813
Additional generic cop compliment, Brian.

120
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:52,107
Thanks. But the real hero here is God
for blessing me with this nose.

121
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,560
And a few other equally amazing
appendages.

122
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:03,061
- I better take this cocaine down to Evidence.
- Oh, I'll... I'll do that.

123
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:06,275
I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.

124
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:14,544
So it's settled. We're takin'
a cruise to the Bahamas.

125
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,689
Ah, this is gonna be great.

126
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:21,211
And look. It says we have our
choice of cabins - port or starboard.

127
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:26,274
Ha! Listen to me!
I sound like an old salt!

128
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:31,069
I must say, I've always
dreamed of a life at sea.

129
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,232
"I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy

130
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:40,507
"And your record will stand as proof

131
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:43,115
"Be it galley or freighter,
I'm an expert navigator

132
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,300
"And you're also a world-class poof

133
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:50,105
"My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the
street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue

134
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,780
"Well, despite your point of view
I can thrill a girl or two

135
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,685
"But I'd rather get it on with you

136
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,876
Ha-ha-ha!

137
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,420
Sorry to be tardy to the party.

138
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:09,103
Wow, Brian! Have you lost weight?
You gotta tell me your secret.

139
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,411
Here's a hint - put down the fork! Face!

140
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,982
So, how was your day?

141
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:18,883
Un-freakin'-believable. First we
nailed a bastard who had the gall

142
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,120
to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll.
Her doll!

143
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:27,728
Where's the line any more? I got news for ya.
It-it's not even on the radar screen.

144
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:30,391
The days of decency
and virtue are gone. Bam!

145
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:35,614
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud
puddle. One day you see your reflection in it,

146
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:39,504
and the next day it's a damn oil spot
on your cracked driveway

147
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,336
staring back at you, mocking you.
Blah! Blah! Blah!

148
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:48,327
Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit
of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.

149
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,853
You know what I haven't had in a while?
Big League Chew.

150
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:57,454
So take it from me - McGriffin, the drug dog.

151
00:10:57,607 --> 00:11:01,847
If you really wanna get high,
it's as easy as being yourself.

152
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:08,024
Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...
Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.

153
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:12,831
Hey, kids! You know why I'm happy?

154
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:18,659
Cos I'm free of S... T... Ds!

155
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:26,733
- That McGriffin guy was so cool!
- Totally. I'm never doing drugs now.

156
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,691
Ahhhhh.

157
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,485
Got milk?

158
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:37,845
Before you go on a cruise,
you gotta build up a base tan.

159
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:42,808
But I heard that if you use tanning beds,
you could get something called melanoma.

160
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:47,688
Oh, that's just fancy talk
for sexified. Now, climb in.

161
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:57,259
- Hey, what kinda tanning booth is this?
- Those aren't tanning booths.

162
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,619
- That row is time machines.
- Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?

163
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:06,231
Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's
a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.

164
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,937
Oh, look, my very own lion!

165
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,119
Oh, my God!

166
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,468
Must've got the wrong hat.

167
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,737
And now, here's something
we hope you'll really like.

168
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:27,867
There's no smokin' in the terminal.

169
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:31,229
There's worse things than nicotine.
And I'm gonna find 'em.

170
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:36,805
Patience. It took St Patrick more
than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.

171
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:40,589
- Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
- OK.

172
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,776
- Open it!
- Agh! Let me go!

173
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,221
Help! Help!

174
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:49,118
Where's the stash? I'll do
a freakin' body-cavity search.

175
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,275
- Argh! Argh!
- Sir, we apologise.

176
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,518
There's no easy way to say this.
You have a drug problem.

177
00:12:55,687 --> 00:13:00,247
A drug problem? What's this really about?
Jealousy? Am I stealin' your thunder?

178
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,037
- Give me your badge.
- Fine!

179
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:05,703
By the way, Horowicz, you should
show Joe your impression of him.

180
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:10,531
Oh, well... It's not as good as my
Irish cop. It's just a little thing I...

181
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:15,965
"I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up
for it by having a very strong upper body. "

182
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,821
Well, I do say that.

183
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:26,411
The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're
gettin' in the mood for our cruise.

184
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:30,994
Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sittin' out there
on a boat yammerin' to himself.

185
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:33,455
He doesn't even know I'm watching him.

186
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,815
Ah, splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.

187
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,683
- Everybody, this is Tina.
- What happened to you?

188
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,517
Less questions and more shut-the-hell-up.

189
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:48,589
Just because you can't feel your teeth
doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.

190
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,033
Hello. I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.

191
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,328
So, what? She's, like,
your mom or somethin'?

192
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,612
Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to
wipe the dried blood from under your nose?

193
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:08,068
- Here's the channel Lois doesn't know about.
- Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

194
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:11,767
Wait. That man seems to have
suffered a serious snakebite.

195
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,230
Brian, would you please ask
your new friend to leave now?

196
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:18,607
Oh, sorry. Things gettin'
too real for the Stepford wife?

197
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:22,141
And look at you two - Quasimodo and
Lumpy.

198
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,881
I leave more personality in
tightly-coiled piles on the lawn.

199
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,710
Oh, do me! Do me next!

200
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:30,659
Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.

201
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,220
- Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?
- Your family has something to say.

202
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,359
Brian, I know I don't speak up much,

203
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,039
and it's really hard for me to
talk about my feelings, but...

204
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,868
Let's start with someone
more interesting. Peter?

205
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,910
Ever since your addiction,
you've been a jerk.

206
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,619
I miss the old days
when you were my sidekick.

207
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:04,061
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was
made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.

208
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,818
Uh, yeah, yeah.

209
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,571
Uh... yeah.

210
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,758
Yeah. Eeh. Yeah.

211
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,205
Brian, how about a little tie music?

212
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:17,064
"Peter's tie, Peter's tie

213
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,457
"That's because Peter's the guy!

214
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:25,113
All right. That's it. A little tie music.

215
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,779
Heh-hee!

216
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,522
Yeah!

217
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:33,229
Look, you-you guys got it
all wrong. I-I-I... I wa...

218
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:36,061
Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone!

219
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,690
Oh, God, I need help!

220
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,554
I guess now we know what kind of dog he is.

221
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,388
A melan-collie.

222
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:50,503
Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I should have said "Chi-wah-wah".

223
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,598
I don't have to impress you.

224
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,104
Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois.

225
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:02,843
But why do we have to cancel our cruise
just cos the dog's a cokehead?

226
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:07,833
We're not going on vacation while Brian's
in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.

227
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:09,073
Aw, man!

228
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,876
I'll make it up to you.
My cousin works at Club Med.

229
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,718
Holy crap! Look at this place.

230
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:23,341
This is where God would come
if he had to stop doin' blow.

231
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,846
- They have tennis courts!
- And a full spa!

232
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,663
Wow! No wonder people do drugs!

233
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:31,935
Good luck, Brian. I just know
you're gonna get clean.

234
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:37,186
Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with
all these mineral baths and jacuzzis.

235
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:41,237
Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun
and everyone wets themselves.

236
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:45,075
I give you gold and I get squat.
I'll be in the car.

237
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,321
That was a very productive first day, Brian.

238
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,914
Our goal here is to find your X factor -

239
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:55,216
the element in your life
that made you turn to drugs.

240
00:16:55,388 --> 00:17:01,028
Just having some time away to sort things
out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.

241
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,607
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:08,319
I'm on vacation. Oh, and if
anyone asks, I'm also on smack.

243
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:15,275
Peter, this is a detox clinic.
You can't vacation here.

244
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:18,505
Why not? This place is
way better than a cruise.

245
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,751
I whipped this speedfreak's ass
at horseshoes today.

246
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:25,001
This isn't a vacation for me.
I'm tryin' to get healthy.

247
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,769
Yeah, OK. All right.

248
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,596
Hey, softball this afternoon.

249
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:32,591
Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant
teenagers from across the lake.

250
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,843
OK, come on, everyone. Exercise
is an important part of recovery.

251
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,479
Just work with the resistance of the water.
Ten more reps. And one. And two.

252
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:44,666
And three.

253
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,219
Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

254
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,289
Trade you this for your cupcake.

255
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,425
What? It was just Carpet Fresh.
I'm on your side.

256
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:10,611
I've been observing your behaviour. I don't
think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.

257
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,540
Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips.
In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.

258
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,656
I'll be keeping my eye on you.
What's your name?

259
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,055
Uh, my-my name? Uh...

260
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,310
Uh... uh... uh...

261
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,078
Pea... uh... uh... uh...

262
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:31,418
Tear... uh...

263
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,094
Uh... Griffin.

264
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,306
Yeah. Yeah. Peter Griffin.

265
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,433
Oh, crap.

266
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:43,376
I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess
with the pregnant teens across the lake?

267
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,438
I can't. Group therapy.

268
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:50,995
I saw one of those - more borin' than when
I was a security guard for George Harrison.

269
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:12,644
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Quiet down up there!

270
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,476
You wacky Beatle.

271
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:19,706
I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing
one session wouldn't be the end of the world.

272
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,879
There you go.

273
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:24,296
- What do you think they put in the bug juice?
- Bugs?

274
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:27,417
No, they don't! Come on.

275
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:29,181
Shut up.

276
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:54,392
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
14 premature births.

277
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:58,131
Sorry. I don't usually let Peter
talk me into this kinda stuff.

278
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,679
You have a pre-existing relationship
with this degenerate?

279
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,340
A degenerate, am I?

280
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,722
Well, you are a fastizio.

281
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:08,378
See? I can make up words too, sister.

282
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:11,884
- Well, I think we've found your X factor.
- You mean Peter?

283
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:16,985
His behaviour is a negative influence on you.
With your intelligence and sensitivity...

284
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:20,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
I made my own mistakes. All right?

285
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,480
This man took me into his home
and treated me like family.

286
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:26,605
- He's my best friend.
- And look where you've ended up.

287
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,687
You know, I think my therapy
here is complete.

288
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:32,649
I came here to get clean
and I did. So goodbye.

289
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:38,527
Brian, it's moments like this that make me
sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.

290
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,373
"He was all coked up and we were choked up

291
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:49,751
"But now we're happy Brian's home,
cha-cha-cha!

292
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:53,126
I am serious, Lois.
You could be in show business.

293
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:56,002
- Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
- No.

294
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,212
- Chris, how are ya?
- I'm glad...

295
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,579
All right!

296
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:04,153
Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me,
you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.

297
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,538
Joe, if I've learned anything
from my experience,

298
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,750
it's that we're all responsible
for our own destiny.

299
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:15,197
- And that's why I'm leaving.
- Leavin'? You can't leave.

300
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,975
I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.

301
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,924
Aw!

302
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,319
Somebody say something.

303
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:25,767
Brian, wait!

304
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,004
Hold on a second.

305
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,180
Airport, please.

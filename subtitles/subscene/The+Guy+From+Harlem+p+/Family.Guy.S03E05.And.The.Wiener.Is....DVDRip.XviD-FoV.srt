1
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:05,707
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:08,907
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:12,387
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:15,307
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:18,387
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:23,107
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,787
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:29,907
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:37,787
Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired
figure skater with the horse teeth,

10
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,107
the one who got what she had coming.

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,507
Nice figure eight, Mom.

12
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:51,107
Ha! All right!

13
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:53,907
OK, Bonnie. One, two, three, push!

14
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:58,706
Oh! Ah! Whoa!

15
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:05,706
My God! I can walk! It's a mira...!

16
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,906
- Sorry, Dad.
- Just get the chair.

17
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:15,386
Good shot.
Made my brown eye blue with that one.

18
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:19,906
- Yeah. Next one's coming for your head!
- Oh, no! No, help! Oh, help!

19
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:23,906
- What the hell?
- Now is the winter of your discontent!

20
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:28,106
You wanna race? On your mark, get set, go!

21
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,906
First to where
that Pakistani girl fell through the ice

22
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:33,706
after coming to the States
for her severely burned face

23
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:37,986
she got when the man she refused to marry
dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!

24
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:41,506
Yes! Yes! In your face! In your face!

25
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:44,106
In my face! In my face!

26
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:48,586
Ahh! No! Acid girl! It's acid girl! Ahh!

27
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:55,986
- James Woods High! Whoo!
- Hey, guys.

28
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,906
- What do you want?
- I'm trying out for cheerleading.

29
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,586
Peter Rabbit would be wise
to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.

30
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,706
Why don't you try the flag girls squad?

31
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,786
Are you trying out for flag girl?

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,186
Yes! I win again, Andy.

33
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:26,106
One more before
the missus notices I'm not on the couch.

34
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,306
Too late!

35
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:34,906
Hey, careful, Quagmire.
Don't get too close to that thing.

36
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,185
Did I just get laid?

37
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,505
- Nice game, Peter.
- I'm on a roll.

38
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:43,985
- I whipped Chris on the ice today.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

39
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,585
It's only a matter of time
before he beats you.

40
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:51,705
What? I'm better than him at everything:
Sports, video games, even magic tricks.

41
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:57,505
- Ha-ha. Got your nose.
- Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.

42
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:03,985
Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.

43
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:07,105
Face it, sooner or later
you'll have to pass the torch.

44
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,505
I remember the first time
Kevin beat me. I was so proud,

45
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:14,385
I gave him a little congratulatory
punch in the arm. Then another.

46
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:18,705
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went
to live with a foster family for a while...

47
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,905
- It's inevitable.
- Don't feel bad.

48
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,105
I think I know why your son beat you.

49
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:26,905
Apparently, you're
a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.

50
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:32,385
Which is good, cos I finally have someone
to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.

51
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,785
Does it feel good
on your new budding bosoms?

52
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,905
- It sure does...
- Get the hell off me!

53
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,985
Rudolph, we figured out
what makes your nose red.

54
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:46,705
- Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails?
- No, it's a tumour.

55
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:49,185
You mean like
a magical Christmas tumour?

56
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:53,385
No, a malignant tumour, the base of which
is lodged deep within your brain.

57
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:58,385
- Oh. Like a happy special...
- You're going to die.

58
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,105
Hey, everybody, guess what I am.

59
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,305
The end result of a drunken backseat
gropefest and a broken prophylactic?

60
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:09,705
- I'm on the flag girl squad!
- Oh, honey, congratulations.

61
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:13,705
- Hey, Chris. I bet you can't do this.
- I bet I can!

62
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,385
We perform at all the football games.
I'm practically a cheerleader!

63
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,385
That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful?

64
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:24,984
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see
your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.

65
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:26,104
You're on!

66
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,904
So, you're a flag girl. That's great, Meg.

67
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:31,304
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:35,184
Now you can be somewhere else
when the boys don't call.

69
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:40,504
- All right. Salt shaker up the nose.
- I got pepper.

70
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:44,704
Ha-ha! Yes! I win!

71
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,784
- That was fun, Dad!
- I'm the man!

72
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:49,504
Yeah! Ahh!

73
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:55,584
Lois, go get the medical dictionary
and look up "fork" and "lung. "

74
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,784
- Why?
- Time's a factor, Lois.

75
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:06,904
Say, Meg, looking sharp.
You want to go out after the game tonight?

76
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:10,384
Neil, I'm a flag girl now.
I'm way too cool to be seen with you.

77
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:14,984
Really? Not even
if I smoke this corncob pipe?

78
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:26,384
Are we all ready to cheer
at the game tonight?

79
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:29,704
"We?" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?

80
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:32,904
Yeah. This morning my mom
was, like, "Don't forget your lunch",

81
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:36,104
and I'm all "I'm a flag girl now,
I won't forget my lunch",

82
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:39,104
and she's all
"Don't forget your halftime routine. "

83
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:43,584
Moms! Hey, maybe we could all,
like, hang out after the game.

84
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:45,704
Go, team!

85
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,104
Uncool people are like animals.

86
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:50,984
You want to go feed
the science club after school?

87
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,984
Look at me.

88
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:06,783
Look at me, I'm smoking.
Dog, dog, look, look...

89
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:10,903
Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer.
It constricts the blood vessels...

90
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:13,703
- Shut up.
- The dog just told me to shut up.

91
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:16,703
I demand to know
what you plan to do about this. Hey!

92
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:20,103
- Hey! The dog just told me...
- Be quiet, Stewie.

93
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:25,103
- Freezing my nips off out here.
- Oh, look, there's Meg.

94
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:29,103
Meg! Meg! Meg!

95
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,183
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi, Meg.

96
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,303
Here we go.

97
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:51,383
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.

98
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:54,183
- They've held hands all night.
- I mean Meg.

99
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,903
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.

100
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:03,983
- Oh! This meat stinks something fierce!
- This'll knock her down a couple notches.

101
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:18,183
Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how
these kids celebrate these days!

102
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:26,103
What do you got? What do you got?
Huh? Huh? Come on.

103
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:29,703
- Come on, ref. That's charging.
- Your feet were moving. No foul.

104
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,983
No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call!
And I know something about stupid calls.

105
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:36,983
Hello?

106
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:41,983
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at
the office and they're making me stay late.

107
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,583
Caller ID says you're
calling from the kitchen.

108
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:48,102
- In fact, I can see you.
- Can you see me now?

109
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:49,902
- No.
- Now I'm at the office.

110
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:53,902
Score's tied, next basket wins.
You might finally beat your old man.

111
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:56,582
"Old man"? I'm the white Larry Bird.

112
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:59,702
What do you got?
What do you got? Huh? Come on!

113
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:03,302
- Your mother and I are getting a divorce!
- You are?

114
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:06,182
Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.

115
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,582
Yes!

116
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:11,302
Son, you played good,
but your dad is still number one.

117
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:16,982
- Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.
- Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?

118
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:19,502
Oh, my God! That's not your leg!

119
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,702
- What's wrong, honey?
- I'll tell you:

120
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:33,182
I try to make love to you
and you think about Chris.

121
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:37,702
- Is there something you need to tell me?
- Thanks to you, our son has a huge wang.

122
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:40,302
- Thanks to me?
- He didn't get it from me.

123
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:43,102
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

124
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,582
All right, stand back, Lois.

125
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,582
Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.

126
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,782
How did this happen?
I'm supposed to be the man of the house.

127
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:56,102
- You must be ashamed of me.
- Oh, Peter.

128
00:08:56,182 --> 00:09:00,302
I care as much about the size of your penis
as you care about the size of my breasts.

129
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,382
Oh, my God!

130
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,982
You can't let those awful kids get to you.

131
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:11,302
They won't. I'm never
going back to that school again.

132
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:16,502
- Dad, could you help me with my algebra?
- You're a big man. You figure it out.

133
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:20,302
I bet there's a part of you
that wants to be friends with them.

134
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:22,502
- Maybe.
- So be nice to them.

135
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:25,302
Win your enemies over
with unflappable kindness.

136
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:29,502
- Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big.
- No! No more milk for him.

137
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,901
He's had enough. Give me that.

138
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:37,501
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it
in the manner to which you're accustomed.

139
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,781
Oh!

140
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:43,701
Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.
I know what it takes to be cool.

141
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,501
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

142
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,580
- Hi, you guys.
- God, it's her.

143
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,700
- Look, about the other night...
- Oh, that was hilarious.

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,900
I just wish I'd known ahead of time.
I would've brought potato salad!

145
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,580
You guys want tomorrow's biology test?

146
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,980
- Whoa! How'd you get that?
- I spent the night with Mr Burler.

147
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,580
Ah, the sun's up.
I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.

148
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,380
- Wow, thanks!
- See ya.

149
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,100
- That was kinda cool.
- Yeah.

150
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm bored.

151
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,300
Wanna go push the janitor,
knowing he can't legally push us back?

152
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,100
- Sure!
- OK, cool. Let's go do it.

153
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,700
Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.

154
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Why, you smug little bastard!

155
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Peter! Chris, these are plantains.
And there's nothing wrong with them.

156
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,980
In fact, a lot of women prefer them
to normal-size bananas,

157
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
because they're exotic and flavourful
and very, very special.

158
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,780
Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring
for the plantain section. Stop with this!

159
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,300
You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.

160
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,100
I mean, mine goes inside me
when I stand up. How do you think I feel?

161
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,100
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Oh, of course not, honey.

162
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,580
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me
at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!

163
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,700
Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?

164
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,500
Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.
Look, I know you're upset, but...

165
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,100
- Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?
- He's around.

166
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,700
Let me out of this
stink-filled corduroy dungeon!

167
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,179
- Peter, that's sick!
- It's OK. He's outside the underwear.

168
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,899
- Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.
- Thanks, Jim.

169
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:20,379
When you pull that thing into your garage,
does the garage say "Is it in yet?"

170
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,299
Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.

171
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,579
Ow. My pride.

172
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:50,699
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids
and they didn't spit on me.

173
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,379
Connie Demico even
invited me to her sweet 16.

174
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,899
Wonderful! What time do we nail
those snot-nosed punks?!

175
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,179
Nail them? You told me
to win them over with kindness.

176
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:05,179
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,
it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.

177
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,299
Revenge?

178
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,179
I'm like one of those bald eagles
you see on the Discovery Channel:

179
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,099
Beautiful to look at,
but mess with one of my chicks

180
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:17,499
and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip
your eyes out! Cookies are done.

181
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,899
- Who wants chocolate-chip?
- I do!

182
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:24,379
But keep talking. All this stuff about
eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.

183
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,699
Really. I've got about half a pack
of Rolaids in my diaper.

184
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,499
I'm glad you want to join
the National Gun Association.

185
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,898
Let me show you around.
This is our shooting range.

186
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:54,098
Here we have our locker room
with full shower facilities.

187
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:57,578
Holy crap! They're all so... small!

188
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:02,098
You see, Peter, the way we look at it,
a man's only as big as the gun he carries.

189
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:05,498
Sign me up, and get me
the biggest freakin' gun you got!

190
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,498
- Stewie, you can come out now.
- Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story.

191
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:16,298
Pull!

192
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,978
Oh, yeah.
Who's the big man now, huh?

193
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:22,498
- Madonna or Janet Jackson?
- Which Janet?

194
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:25,698
- Velvet Rope.
- Yeah, that one. Pull!

195
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:29,698
- What the hell are you doing with that?
- You want to touch it? Go on.

196
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,178
Careful. We don't want it to get
too excited and go off in your hand.

197
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:36,698
This is pathetic. All because
you feel inadequate next to Chris.

198
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:40,978
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete
with my son or his freakishly large penis.

199
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,898
- I'm a freak.
- Don't despair.

200
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:47,978
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it
and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.

201
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:54,178
Connie Demico's house is two storeys.
If we set up booby traps here, here...

202
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:57,978
- How'd you get these blueprints?
- Oh, your mother has her ways.

203
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,298
She has her ways.

204
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,178
- Can I have those blueprints?
- Sure, here you go.

205
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:07,298
Now I've put together
a little flash bomb to create a diversion.

206
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:09,898
I used to date
the pyro guy from Whitesnake.

207
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,098
What's Whitesnake?

208
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:15,898
That's the music mommies and daddies
listen to. Fire in the hole!

209
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,098
Some guys from the club
are going hunting tomorrow.

210
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:22,898
- Count me in.
- Hunting?

211
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:26,297
- You were gonna play hockey with Chris.
- Bring him along.

212
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:29,497
- Oh, no. It's too dangerous.
- Lois, Lois.

213
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:34,177
The National Gun Association is all about
safety, especially when it comes to kids.

214
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,377
Take a look at our new video.

215
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:43,777
Let's face it, your kids will get
into your guns. That's a fact.

216
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:47,897
Gun accidents can be avoided by
introducing your children to guns early.

217
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:52,297
Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.
Say, do you ever get lonely?

218
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:55,697
- Yes.
- Me, too. Hold me.

219
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,777
If you squeeze me,
I make bad people go away.

220
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,977
But wait a minute.
I thought guns were bad.

221
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:03,897
False! Guns are good.

222
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:08,497
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses
used guns to conquer the Romans?

223
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:14,177
So remember: Guns don't kill people,
dangerous minorities do.

224
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,977
See, Lois? They're responsible.

225
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:29,777
Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.
I can write my name in the snow.

226
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:34,097
- This is fun, Dad.
- Son, son, I told you.

227
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,497
Out here in the wilderness,
call me Rooster Cogburn.

228
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:40,777
I was starting to think
you didn't like me any more.

229
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:45,097
Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.
There must be a deer around here.

230
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,177
- Those are snowmobile tracks.
- Shh! There he is.

231
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:59,097
Such grace. That's the thing
about hunting - you gotta be patient.

232
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,297
What the hell was that?!

233
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:14,576
Put this in the heating grate
and set it off in five minutes.

234
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,696
I changed my mind. I won't do it.

235
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,776
- They're my friends now.
- They pelted you with meat.

236
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:23,576
Did you forget the neighbour kids
chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?

237
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:26,176
Yes, I did!

238
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:29,376
OK. Now we're gonna play
Seven Minutes in Heaven,

239
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:34,776
and it's my party, so I want Doug
to go in the closet with... Meg.

240
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:38,976
Have fun.

241
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:45,776
OK. Everyone get ready.
Say hello to the lovers.

242
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,696
I don't know who should be
more humiliated, Meg or the pig.

243
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:56,696
- She's such a dork.
- I think I feel worse for the pig.

244
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:02,096
Mom, you were right!
I should have just stuck to the plan!

245
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:07,496
I figured you might get soft on me,
so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.

246
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:12,096
- Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?
- 16.

247
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:14,696
- 18?! You're first.
- Mom!

248
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,576
I like where this is going.
Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.

249
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:22,976
Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.
Say hello to Satan for me!

250
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,576
It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.

251
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:32,096
I'm afraid the fever
has affected his motor skills.

252
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,776
He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.

253
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:38,496
Looks like he'll have to repeat
the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.

254
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:42,696
The only way to get rid of them
is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.

255
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,696
Congratulations.
You've passed the fourth grade.

256
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:49,096
Great. I gotta leave though.
I'm going hunting with my son.

257
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:53,695
Dad, I know what to do!
I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!

258
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:59,695
Go away! Go on, get!
Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!

259
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:03,895
Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.
I mean, I just froze up.

260
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:07,575
But you handled that bear like a real man.
I'm proud of you, son.

261
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:12,175
You are? Because I heard
what you said about my huge... you know.

262
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,495
Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?

263
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:20,295
I was just being stupid. Take it from me,
that thing you got there is a blessing.

264
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,775
I mean, every guy you see with a big house
or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth

265
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:27,695
is really just saying
"Don't look at my penis. "

266
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:32,375
- But you'll never have to worry about that.
- Thanks, Dad! You're the best.

267
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:38,095
You know, Dad, I just realised something.
Your name's Peter.

268
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,695
You're right, it is.

269
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,775
Peter.

270
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,895

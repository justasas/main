00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,559
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,838
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,557
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,556
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:18,435
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:23,354
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:24,753
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:30,152
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,230
- So, tell me about yourself, Tina.
- I really love music.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,948
Me, too. I just saw Don Giovanni. In my
opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.

11
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:46,627
- Definitely.
- And the use of recitative throughout...

12
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,946
- Mozart was a genius.
- Oh, yeah, re... cita... tive...

13
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,225
is really, you know, where it's at.

14
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:55,224
- Sir, are we ready to order?
- Whoa. Hold on a second.

15
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:59,343
- You don't know what I'm talking about.
- Sure I do. Opera's bitchin'!

16
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:05,022
OK. I guess I'll have the escar-got
and a glass of chab-lis.

17
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:07,621
Same here. Escar-got and the chab-lis.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,739
Don't dawdle, Jonas. Play your exercises.

19
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,139
Brian, what happened with your date?

20
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,618
- Same as always. She was an idiot.
- Oh, Brian.

21
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:20,737
Don't slow down, Jonas. Keep the rhythm.

22
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:25,936
"Bum, bum, bum, bum
Brian, your standards are ridiculously high

23
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:31,014
"You'll never find a girl unless
you compromise so you can find your love

24
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,413
"I don't think

"How long has the coffee

27
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,131
"I could really use a cup about now

"Oh, it's not very fresh

- " Some crappy movie on TNT

31
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,727
Very good, Jonas. I'll see you next week.

32
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,607
So, you don't think
these women understand you?

33
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:00,325
I'm not comfortable
talking about this a-melodically.

34
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:03,525
- Peter, could you...
- Hang on a second.

35
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:07,123
Now back to "The Life and Times
of Grizzly Adams".

36
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:11,922
- Grizzly? Who's Steve?
- What?

37
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,921
There's a message
on the machine from Steve.

38
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh, yeah, Steve. He's... new to the mountain.
I met him down at the general store.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,999
- He makes canoes.
- Oh.

40
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:27,997
- How come I've never met him?
- He hasn't really been here that long.

41
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:31,596
- Long enough to get your number!
- Ben! Ben!

42
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,196
Dammit.

43
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:37,195
Look at that Grizzly Adams.
Look at how confident he is, how majestic.

44
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:40,394
- I'm gonna grow a beard.
- Peter, you know I hate beards.

45
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:44,113
Oh, no, it's time I joined the ranks
of great men with beards.

46
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:49,311
Why do you think Jesus Christ was
so popular? Because of all the magic tricks?

47
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:53,790
Brian's depressed. Could you take him
with you to the laser rock show tonight?

48
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,109
Sure. That's one thing I'm good at -
cheering people up.

49
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,107
Mr and Mrs Ramsey,
JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy.

50
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:05,586
And I will not rest until
I find her killer, or killers.

51
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:09,305
Oh, really, don't bother.
Nothing's going to bring our baby back.

52
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:13,904
- No, I insist. I will make it my life's work...
- We're fine. Drop it.

53
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:19,302
The next laser rock show
will begin in 20 minutes.

54
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,101
You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show!
Come on, cheer up, would you?

55
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,501
I don't feel like it.

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,779
Binary code is a computer language in which
words are translated into zeroes and ones.

57
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,978
Anything can be expressed in binary,

58
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:37,097
as we demonstrate in this scene
from The Miracle Worker.

59
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,376
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

60
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,575
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

61
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,494
0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1.

62
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,493
01! 01!

63
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,571
You don't think this is amazing?
When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair,

64
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,290
I nearly crapped my pants!

65
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,769
All right! Virtual reality!

66
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,369
Whoa! You guys gotta try this!

67
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,688
Hey, look at me.
I'm a pole in a strip club! Oh!

68
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,967
It's showtime.

69
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,686
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh!
Hey, stop! False alarm! Agh!

70
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:19,685
Oh, my God! I'm flying. I'm flying!

71
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,284
I'll have a Diet Sprite.

72
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,078
You are a filthy whore.

73
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:50,356
- OK, Johnny Depp or Richard Grieco?
- Oh, that's gross!

74
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:52,475
- Yeah, let's not do this.
- Come on.

75
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:56,274
If you're secure in your masculinity,
you can answer a hypothetical.

76
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,473
Johnny Depp, cos he kind of
looks like a chick.

77
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:03,672
- What about you, Peter?
- Oh, man. I don't know.

78
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,671
Richard Grieco would probably appreciate
you more. Not take you for granted.

79
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,670
With Johnny Depp,
he wouldn't really need you.

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,269
He'd probably sneak out
after you fell asleep.

81
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,468
Of course, with Johnny, you'd get
financial security. I'd go with Johnny.

82
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,147
Oh, great.

83
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,466
- Brian?
- Hey, Joe. How's it going?

84
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:27,665
Good. You were doing
a little swerving back there.

85
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:31,664
- Me and the boys were just...
- Whoa! You're off the meter, Brian.

86
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,463
- You're under arrest.
- Come on.

87
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,662
Move it!

88
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:39,461
- One of you guys all right to drive?
- Yeah, I can do it.

89
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,940
I'll meet you at The Drunken Clam.
We'll tie one on.

90
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,139
I'm very disappointed in you.

91
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:56,057
God, a DUl. I can't believe this.
I could actually go to jail.

92
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:59,855
It's OK. You'll get through this DUl
and you'll be a better person for it.

93
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,334
Hold on. Don't disguise his alcohol
dependence as a ticket to self-realisation.

94
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:10,052
You're not one to talk. Remember when I gave
you apple juice and told you it was wine?

95
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:14,651
- You are a special person.
- Thanks.

96
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:19,450
Now, come on. I'm being serious.
I will be serious here for a second.

97
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,649
Are you gonna listen to me?

98
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:27,927
Are you gonna listen to me
so I can tell you that I respect you?

99
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,645
Brian, I know this is a bad time for you.

100
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:38,444
And if I have any advice to give you,
it is this: Grow a beard.

101
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:41,323
I wish you'd shave that thing.
Beards are so ugly.

102
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,723
- Hey!
- Oh, relax, Wooly Willy.

103
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:46,042
There's lots of fun things you can do.

104
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,921
- There we go.
- Thanks!

105
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:52,640
On the charge of driving under
the influence, we find you guilty.

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,239
Good call. Churn the butter.

107
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,039
Ooh! Ooh!

108
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:01,317
In lieu of jail time, I sentence you
to 100 hours of community service.

109
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:03,637
Next item.

110
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:07,436
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
to join these two in holy matrimony.

111
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:12,434
If anyone objects to this union,
speak now or for ever hold your peace.

112
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,234
Quiet! You had your chance!

113
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:21,312
- What are you doing for community service?
- I got assigned to Outreach to the Elderly.

114
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:24,711
I gotta take care of an old woman
who hasn't been out in 30 years.

115
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:27,630
When I got caught at school
with my hand down my pants,

116
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,509
I had to keep it there for a whole week.
Ha! What a week!

117
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,627
Taking care of this old woman'll be
like baby-sitting, with bigger diapers.

118
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,227
Aha! So they do make bigger diapers!

119
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:41,426
That deceitful woman told me
I'd have to use the toilet.

120
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:44,505
Fie on the toilet! It's made slaves of you all.

121
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:48,304
I've seen it sitting in there,
lazy, slothful porcelain layabout

122
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:52,303
feeding on other people's doo-doos
while contributing nothing to society!

123
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,902
You get a job!

124
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:02,420
Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here
from the Outreach to the Elderly programme.

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,499
You're late!

126
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,617
- What the hell is this?
- Delousing powder!

127
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,697
Everyone on the outside is filthy!

128
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:16,815
- You could have warned me.
- OK. It's gonna burn like hell in 30 seconds.

129
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,015
I like my tea at four, my dinner at six.

130
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,814
I take my bath at seven
so I can listen to Paul Harvey.

131
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:25,813
You'll warm up my bath with quick bursts
from the faucet during commercials.

132
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:30,491
Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into
commercials. It's been 30 seconds.

133
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,408
- Stop scratching that thing.
- I can't. It's itching like crazy.

134
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,407
- Can I scratch your beard?
- You finished your homework?

135
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,807
- Yes.
- OK then.

136
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,805
Brian, you're quiet.
Is community service not going well?

137
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,884
Lois, it's horrible.
I was cleaning her house all day.

138
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:57,883
It's the worst job I've ever had.
Except for one.

139
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:03,602
Excuse me. Would you like
to taste my smoked-meat log?

140
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:09,000
- Here you go. Enjoy your food.
- Yes, enjoy your studio apartment.

141
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,399
- You got something right here.
- Where?

142
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,679
- Other side.
- Here?

143
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,078
- The left side.
- Here?

144
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,798
- Your other left.
- Where?

145
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,397
- Up a little.
- Is it gone?

146
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,797
- Go down.
- Is it gone?

147
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:26,075
Is it gone? Agh!
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

148
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:27,795
Peter, hold still!

149
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:30,394
- Don't touch that bird!
- What's it to you?

150
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:33,273
I'm Dr Goodman of the
Quahog Ornithological Society,

151
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:36,472
ironically dining in a restaurant
that serves poultry.

152
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,671
- Doctor, what is this?
- It's a very rare species.

153
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,791
The endangered White-rumped Swallow.

154
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,990
- Rump.
- This isn't funny, Chris!

155
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,868
Swallow. Look,
just get rid of this bird, all right?

156
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:54,267
I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen
its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.

157
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,466
He can't have a bird in his beard.

158
00:09:56,586 --> 00:10:01,665
You have to wait until the bird departs
of its own accord or you'll be prosecuted.

159
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,864
Wow! You sure know a lot of stuff.

160
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:06,583
- It's great to learn.
- Cos knowledge is power!

161
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,061
- What is this? Spit soup?
- Tomato bisque.

162
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,460
- What is this? Snot soup?
- Tomato bisque.

163
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,379
- What is this? Diarrhoea soup?
- I'm not making you anything else. Eat it.

164
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,858
Then I'll have to call the judge,
and that means you'll go to jail!

165
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:29,657
You're one phone call away from getting
a human booster shot from a guy named Mali.

166
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,172
- Dammit!
- Shh!

167
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,772
Sorry! Sorry!

168
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,771
- Shut up.
- There's nothing I can do.

169
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,970
- Take it outside.
- Ever heard of a sitter?

170
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,169
- It's an endangered species.
- I'll make you an endangered species!

171
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,968
- Good comeback, Potsie!
- I'll kick your ass!

172
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,047
- Yeah!
- Everybody shut up!

173
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,966
He has stopped squawking.
He's receded into my beard.

174
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:07,645
We can all watch the movie. Shut up.

175
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,764
Eric, we're all going
to Marty's after the movie.

176
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:16,443
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, honey.

177
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,962
- Aah!
- Aah!

178
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:19,162
- What's wrong?
- Aah!

179
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,762
- Aah!
- Aah!

180
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:24,960
That's it. You're history, pal. No bird
Frenches my wife and gets away with it.

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,959
- Help! Help! I've broken my hip!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

182
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,158
Brian!

183
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:37,157
- 5.3 seconds. I could have been dead by now!
- You're not really...?

184
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:40,636
I heard you drop that light bulb, too.
That'll be 67 cents!

185
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:44,954
- Go warm me up some diarrhoea soup!
- That's it! I've had it with you, you old hag!

186
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:50,153
You're a miserable, dried-up shut-in, trying
to make everyone feel as bad as you do!

187
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,952
Why don't you do the world
a big favour and drop dead?!

188
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,950
- This last one won't open.
- You gotta jiggle it.

189
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,750
- Like this?
- Let me get it.

190
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,948
Oh, thanks. And... you know, drop dead.

191
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:12,746
Get out of my beard,
you squawking bastard!

192
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,345
Nothing. I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

193
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,345
Oh, my God! Peter, no!

194
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:21,944
Lois, the bird must die!

195
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,342
It's gone! It's gone! Oh, thank God!

196
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,341
Peter, what's that sound?

197
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,340
Oh, my God. They're babies.

198
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,619
Hey, look, Lois. There are
three of 'em, just like ours.

199
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,417
And, uh... um...

200
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,536
Sweet.

201
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,334
We now return to
E's mysteries and scandals.

202
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,014
- Pearl Burton, the Jingle Queen.
- Pearl?

203
00:12:56,134 --> 00:13:00,332
I'm AJ Benza. You won't find Pearl's name
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

204
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:04,411
Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't
turn on a radio or television

205
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:07,330
without hearing one
of her trademark jingles.

206
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,010
"You're only healthy when you're tan

207
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,209
"So soak up all the sun you can

208
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,928
"With Copper... Coppertone

209
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:19,927
At her peak, Pearl Burton
earned 26 grand a year,

210
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:23,726
which, by today's standards,
would be just under 49 billion dollars.

211
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:28,404
- Brian, she's beautiful.
- Yeah, and that voice. I had no idea.

212
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:32,523
In 1961, Pearl used an appearance
at Carnegie Hall to make the leap

213
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:34,402
from jingle-singer to artist.

214
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,600
That's "Habanera" from Carmen.
Oh, I've never heard it sung so beautifully.

215
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,319
- Sing Coppertone!
- Yeah, Coppertone!

216
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,398
- Do Doan's Pills!
- Sing Gold Bond Medicated Powder!

217
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:50,518
- Pepsodent!
- Chiclets!

218
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:54,717
No one has seen Pearl Burton since
that fateful night over 30 years ago.

219
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:59,315
- She's presumed dead.
- My God. I said those awful things to her!

220
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:05,114
Pearl!

221
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,912
Pearl, don't do this!

222
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,311
You should be happy.
I'm doing the world a big favour!

223
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,590
Move! Your fur is making my feet sweat!

224
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,189
Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing.

225
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,908
It was the most beautiful sound
I've ever heard.

226
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,307
Oh, sure. Warbling for
Vick's VapoRub and Dippety-Do!

227
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:27,387
No, I mean...

228
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:30,706
Stop trying to talk me out of it!
I'm a pathetic sellout!

229
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,305
No one who sings Carmen
like you is pathetic!

230
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,104
- What?
- I heard you sing "Habanera".

231
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:39,903
- You were sublime.
- You... you liked my aria?

232
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,183
I was overwhelmed.

233
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:45,782
You're the first person who ever
complimented my "Habanera". Thank you.

234
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:50,780
Well... I'd better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.

235
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,379
- But you're not scheduled tomorrow.
- I know.

236
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,971
And then the cow came out of the barn.
See? Look, there's the cow.

237
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:23,771
And what does a cow say?

238
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,969
Yes! Yes, that's right.
A cow says "Peep-peep-peep-peep. "

239
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,888
- Peter, they're getting awfully big.
- So?

240
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,367
A mother knows when it's time
for her babies to leave the nest.

241
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:38,566
Hey, they're free to go
any time they want! Aah!

242
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,366
Fine. I'll let 'em go.

243
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,762
- Pearl, do you rent or own?
- Own what?

244
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:58,280
Those wings, you angel.
That was fantastic. That was so incredible.

245
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,759
What do you want for dinner? I was thinking
of making that lamb and rice you love.

246
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,158
Pearl, what I'd really like
for dinner is to go out.

247
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,077
Brian, you know I can't do that.
I haven't left this house in such a long time.

248
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:13,876
- I'm afraid.
- I know. But I'll be with you.

249
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,875
I don't know.

250
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,074
There's so much you've missed
in the last 30 years.

251
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,674
In fact, allow me to fill you in.

252
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,673
"The '60s brought the hippie breed

- I've seen better.

Brian, looks like somebody's
checking you out.

Nah, I'm not ready yet.
Hey, you're getting some looks yourself.

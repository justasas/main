1
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:05,462
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:08,742
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:12,263
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:14,663
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:18,144
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:22,945
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,745
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:29,746
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,347
A tragic accident in the Providence area.

10
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,748
A family lost their lives
when they swerved off the road

11
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:42,748
and into a ravine, exploding on impact.

12
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,148
- Do you find this funny, Tom?
- Oh, no.

13
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:49,069
I was remembering I accidentally
put my shirt on inside out this morning.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,950
It's fine now, though. So what were
you saying? A fashion show?

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,551
Turn the TV off. We gotta find
an anniversary gift for Mom and Dad.

16
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,671
Don't look! We're shopping!
We're shopping!

17
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:05,272
Kids, you don't need to do anything special
for our anniversary. Just your father.

18
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:08,353
I hope he doesn't get you a gift
at the last minute again.

19
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:12,753
My goodness. A human thumb.
Where did you ever find this?

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:17,354
It was on e-bay.
Oh, God! Call an ambulance!

21
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,674
This year, instead of exchanging gifts,

22
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:23,275
I told him it'd be nice if we could
spend a romantic day together.

23
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:28,156
Oh, dear. I think we all know what
that means. Boi-oi-oi-oiing. Gross.

24
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,957
Hey, fellas. I got us a tee time tomorrow
at Barrington Country Club.

25
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:36,557
- Barrington? Wow.
- I'm in.

26
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:39,678
- Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
- Oh, crap!

27
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:43,559
If Lois finds out I'm ditching her,
she'll hit me with a frying pan.

28
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:48,960
Which is why I'm gonna drink
this frying pan antidote.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,960
All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.

30
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:13,284
What the hell?
"Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. "

31
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:18,565
"Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart.
Love, Peter. " Oh, how fun!

32
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:26,766
Before you tee off, here are your
complimentary monogrammed bag towels,

33
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,967
a sleeve of balls,
and this mobile ball cleaner.

34
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:39,088
- Clean as a whistle, sir.
- I won't get short by touching your spit?

35
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:42,089
You'd be the first, champ.

36
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,970
- It's about time.
- Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play.

37
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,971
Loretta's mother is in town and we have
to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.

38
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:55,091
- Cleveland!
- I mean the pull-out sofa bed.

39
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:59,772
You could be the first black guy to play
this course. People are gonna be impressed.

40
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,892
- Hey, a black guy.
- Ooh, fun.

41
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,773
- Come on.
- Maybe we should play another time.

42
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:09,574
Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois
busy so I could be here. Grip it and rip it.

43
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:13,894
The fed will be lowering rates, so get
your money out of T-bills and put it all into...

44
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,295
Waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup!

45
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,575
Waffles! Buy waffles!

46
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:20,976
Waffles! Waffles! Waffles!

47
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:24,896
Waffle! Waffle! Waffle! Waffle!

48
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,177
OK, kids, keep your eyes peeled for a clue.

49
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:33,378
What Jughead has done here -
and it's quite ingenious actually -

50
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,898
is paint pupils on his eyelids

51
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:40,499
so he can sleep through class
without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.

52
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,979
He's sleeping.

53
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,580
- Mom, I found Dad's first clue.
- I can't believe your father organised this.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,981
Usually he can't even handle simple tasks.

55
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:53,581
Peter, why is there a diaper
in the lamp socket?

56
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:57,702
Lois, he's done it again!
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:58,582 --> 00:03:59,982
Ha!

58
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:07,504
- Let's pack it in. There's too much water.
- Let's hit the bar.

59
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:12,185
Oh, come on. There's worse things
in life than rain. Like... like spiders.

60
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:14,505
He's behind the door!

61
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:19,106
Peter, he's bothering
everyone. Say something.

62
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:21,986
I'll kick his ass.
Someone ought to kick his ass.

63
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,787
Don't go in there!

64
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:26,587
- Peter!
- All right, all right. Give me a Kleenex.

65
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,508
I knew he was bad. I knew it... Aah!

66
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,388
Out of me way!
They're after me Lucky Charms!

67
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:36,389
I paid him ten bucks to say it. Classic.

68
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,990
- We'll be in the clubhouse.
- Go on, run away. More golf course for me.

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,311
That was close. That looks dangerous.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

70
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,512
Ah, it'll be fine.

71
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:04,114
You again?!

72
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:10,995
- Death, please don't take me now.
- Relax. You're not dying.

73
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:14,315
- You're having a near-death experience.
- Thank God!

74
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:18,916
Oh, yeah. Thank God I get to hang out
with a fascinating gent like yourself.

75
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:23,397
- So, when am I gonna die?
- Two years after your wife divorces you.

76
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:26,197
What are you talking about?
Lois would never leave me.

77
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:29,118
She's been crazy about me
since the night we met.

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,719
Oh, my God, that's me! Look how thin I was!

79
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:40,320
My, this is certainly a beautiful night.
I love looking at stars.

80
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,720
- Say no more.
- Peter, wait. I...

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,401
Very interesting... but stupid.

82
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,202
Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!

83
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:54,602
- Then why don't you give him a kiss, huh?
- No. Peter, get away from me with that.

84
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:59,403
- Come on. Give Arte Johnson a kiss.
- Peter, stop it. I mean it!

85
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:00,923
Oh!

86
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,205
Oh, my God!

87
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,926
Oh, Peter, I hear music.

88
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:22,207
Yeah, me too.
From now on, this'll be our song.

89
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,608
Ow!

90
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:32,329
I've never met a guy like you.
You're so full of life.

91
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:40,210
It's like I can really be myself
with you. I'm so happy.

92
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,211
- Oh, man, she was beautiful.
- This looks awfully familiar.

93
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,531
Wait a second. I remember this.

94
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,012
That's me! Look at all that hair.

95
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:53,813
I can't believe I thought that looked good.
I must've been high.

96
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:58,333
- I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
- I love you, Peter Griffin.

97
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:02,534
Look at that. Huh? Huh?
There's no way she's gonna leave me.

98
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,335
Now put me back in my freakin' body.

99
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:10,216
I can't until you have a revelation.
One of those things that changes your life.

100
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,416
The hell with this. I'm going home.

101
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:16,737
- You can't get in that way.
- I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.

102
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:21,217
Oh, crap. I don't have time for this.
Listen, I'm late for an appointment.

103
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:24,538
If you don't want to follow
procedure, fine. Stay in limbo.

104
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,939
No, no, wait, wait.
I don't want to be in limbo.

105
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,820
OK. It says the next note
will be right under my nose.

106
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,141
They're off!

107
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:43,621
And quick out in front, Silver Dasher,
followed by My Nose!

108
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,422
Aha! Hold my purse!

109
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:54,823
- What's Mom doing?
- She's screwing up my six-two quinella.

110
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,224
My Nose out in front,
followed by Sea Biscuit,

111
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,344
followed by Some Crazy Lady
and Middle-Aged Housewife,

112
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:03,625
followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That
and Silver Dasher.

113
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:07,025
And now it appears there's
a woman chasing the dogs.

114
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:13,146
- Let's go, kids!
- Tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.

115
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:18,627
Too late, Stewie. The fix is in
and the noodles are boiling in the pot.

116
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,348
Wait, I got it. I figured out my revelation.

117
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:24,148
- God loves a working man.
- No!

118
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,629
The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston,
wealthy young man.

119
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:32,230
No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!

120
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,631
You're shook up about that appointment.
You're Death. What are you afraid of?

121
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:41,031
Where the hell have you been?
When I said lunch, I said noon, not noonish.

122
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:45,352
- Sorry, Ma.
- Is sorry gonna reheat the casserole?

123
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:49,353
- So, who's your friend?
- It's a work thing. Near-death experience.

124
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,553
- Where are you going?
- To take a leak.

125
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:57,034
Don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't
zip up your fly, a seagull will get ya!

126
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,755
God, she's a pain in the ass!
I wish Dad was still dead.

127
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:05,036
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you, Lois's dad
was a pain in the ass when I met him.

128
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:14,037
- Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?
- Oh, Peter, you look so wonderful.

129
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:17,438
- You aren't nervous, are you?
- You'll know when I'm nervous.

130
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,158
- Lois?
- Now.

131
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:24,359
Take the rap for this. I only get one chance
to make a first impression.

132
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,360
Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
Hey, Mr Pewterschmidt.
What are you feeding this gal?

134
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,761
Peter Griffin. Can I take this tie off?

135
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,561
It's a pleasure.
My daughter is taken with you.

136
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:43,162
And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at her.
Huh? Show us front and back there, Lois.

137
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:46,243
Don't think I don't know
where that comes from.

138
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:49,843
That's world-class juice
you got brewing in the old flesh balloon.

139
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,964
- Eh? Eh? Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna go get my purse.

140
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:57,445
Based on what you've seen with your wife,
what can we expect in terms of droopage?

141
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:01,045
Are we talking a slope or full-blown
fried eggs hanging on a nail?

142
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,366
- What do you think of this?
- It's nice.

143
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:05,446
- It's Etruscan.
- Get out of here.

144
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,247
- No, seriously.
- Oh, that's great.

145
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,769
- Hey, look. A manatee!
- We can use it for soup.

146
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,451
Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard.
You picked a great day to get rescued.

147
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:35,771
We were just about to sing
a song about mopping.

148
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,972
"We're mopping the deck
Which is Navy for "floor"

149
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:42,052
"And when we're done mopping
We'll mop it some more

150
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:45,373
- Oh!
- " Swab means mop, deck means floor...

151
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,053
Could you tell me when
you're going back in time?

152
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:53,054
I was talking to a robe for 20 minutes
before I realised you weren't in it.

153
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:56,455
Ma, for God's sake,
leave me alone! I'm working!

154
00:10:56,575 --> 00:11:01,856
Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your
mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.

155
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:05,256
- Brilliantly choreographed.
- That's your tax dollars at work.

156
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:07,377
Why not join us and see the world?

157
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:11,658
Sorry, pal. I've seen the world,
and its name is Lois.

158
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:15,178
How romantic.
Why can't you find a nice girl?

159
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,459
- Ma, she's gonna dump him.
- At least he got that far.

160
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,459
You know who he took
to the prom? His cousin!

161
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,580
- That's weak.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,780
All right. All right, that's it!
I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.

163
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,061
Death, put your jacket on
or you'll get frostbite!

164
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,462
- I don't have skin!
- That's cos you didn't eat your beans!

165
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,862
Come on, come on.
Get back in your big, fat body.

166
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:42,383
Why should I help you save your marriage
when I can't get a girl?

167
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,583
Whoa, wait! What are you saying?

168
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,784
The revelation, jackass! It could have
helped you save your marriage.

169
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:54,785
But too late. Oh, and by the way, when the
lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.

170
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:58,066
Wait, wait. I can't lose Lois!
Please, I'll do anything.

171
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:03,867
- What if... what if I helped you get a girl?
- Really? You think you could do that?

172
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:08,067
All we gotta do is get you fixed up.
Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean...

173
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,868
...shave, cologne... Chicks'll be all over you.

174
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:17,069
- Gee! You really think so?
- Absolutely.

175
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,871
You got any SPF-50?
I bleach like a gym sock.

176
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:30,991
Death, will you relax? The beach
is a perfect place to pick up chicks.

177
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:34,792
Now, I want you to go over there
and ask those girls if you can play.

178
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:39,073
- Hey, can I join you?
- I guess. What's your name?

179
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,074
- Josh.
- Do you, like, live around here?

180
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:45,594
No. I... I live with my mom.

181
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,475
- Let's get out of here
- See ya, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.

182
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,595
Heads up!

183
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:58,396
How do we get up there?
Dad put grease on the pole.

184
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:01,477
Don't worry. We've been
studying fulcrums in school.

185
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:07,198
You have to counterbalance the weight
at the point where the lever pivots. Like so.

186
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:09,398
Stewie, you wanna play rocket ship?

187
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:13,679
- What the deuce?
- Blast off! Go on. Get the note for Mommy.

188
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,199
How dare you use me
for your own personal selfish... Hmm.

189
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh. Pull slower. I must remember
to do this game when no one's around.

190
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,681
What was I thinking? You don't know
anything about picking up chicks.

191
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,281
Are you kidding? I learned from the best.

192
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,202
Come on, buddy.
We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!

193
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:36,883
- Great! We're closer to Rhode Island.
- Rhode Island? Forget that.

194
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,883
I'm taking you out for shore leave.

195
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:41,084
- Does this look like a "Q" to you?
- No.

196
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:45,404
- How about now?
- Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.

197
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:49,405
Let's ask her then. Lois, should Peter
sit around and mope all night?

198
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:54,486
Or should Peter go out with his buddy
and have some fun?

199
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,686
All right!

200
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,487
That one's a feminist type,
she's into he-men,

201
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,688
and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this.

202
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:08,688
The plight of women is deplorable.
I can bench-press 800 pounds.

203
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:11,409
You, me and Coltrane till dawn.

204
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:14,089
There you go, Peter.
One for you, two for me.

205
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,210
You guys go on without me.

206
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,612
- So why didn't you go with them?
- You don't know what it's like in love.

207
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:30,892
Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy.
She works at a pet store.

208
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:34,893
I met her last summer when her dad
hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out.

209
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,693
- What's with that moustache?
- Let me see that.

210
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:41,294
Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos.
Here, this is her.

211
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:45,895
- Nice ass.
- Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos's ass.

212
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,895
I guess I don't have a photo.
Trust me, she's cute.

213
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,896
Let's go get her.

214
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,216
- I'll need that picture of Olmos's ass back.
- Oh, yeah.

215
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,897
Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!

216
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:03,298
I found the note!
"Go back to the mini-mart"?

217
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:06,498
This isn't very creative. Let's go, kids.

218
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,699
Mom, you remember that goldfish
we flushed down the toilet?

219
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,820
He wasn't dead.

220
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,020
- There she is. That's her.
- All right, go on. Just like we practised.

221
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:23,701
- Hey, you.
- Hi. I was just, uh... uh...

222
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,422
in... in... I was just
in the neighbourhood and...

223
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:32,623
So I thought that, uh... So... You...

224
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:36,304
I'll, uh... This is a bad time.

225
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:39,704
Maybe I'll just come back.

226
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:43,905
- Who am I kidding? I'll never get her.
- Not with that attitude. Come on!

227
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,706
Robert Reed got Florence Henderson
and he was a burgermeister.

228
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,906
You gotta find a way to make it happen.

229
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,507
So long. I hope you find your girl.

230
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:56,227
Thanks, Quagmire.
Hope you live next door to me someday.

231
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:58,428
Hey, does this look like a "Q" to you?

232
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,708
How about now?

233
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,029
So, where is it that you need to go,
my new honky friend?

234
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:11,110
Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?

235
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,631
Nothing's too far away from Maxine,
the cheatin' queen. Women.

236
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:20,231
That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt.

237
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:27,033
That truck's coming up on us awful fast.

238
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,913
Holy crap! Do you see what I see?

239
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:35,314
- I'm afraid I do.
- We're being chased by ghosts!

240
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,715
You went through all this to see your girl?

241
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:42,315
I sure did, and I'm a fat idiot.
What's your excuse, you big chicken?

242
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,036
- Chicken? You take that back!
- Yeah? Make me!

243
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,116
I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.

244
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:53,637
- Oh! Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
- No. But this will!

245
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:56,518
Aah! Aah! You bastard!

246
00:16:57,438 --> 00:17:02,239
- What the hell is going on out here?
- Actually, I, uh... I, uh...

247
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,919
Actually, he wanted to ask you something.

248
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,240
Wanna go somewhere and grab a coffee?

249
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,640
- Sure. I get off at two.
- Great! Great! I'll meet you here.

250
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,441
You did it! All right! Hey, who knows?
You might even, you know...

251
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,722
- I'm not following you.
- Intercourse.

252
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:29,243
- What are you doing here?
- Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack,

253
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,124
so we had to pick her up
some Kibbles 'n Bits.

254
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:34,524
- Cleveland!
- I mean Cheez-its.

255
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,925
- Did Peter give you a clue for me?
- Peter?

256
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,325
He's at Barrington
with Brian and Quagmire.

257
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:42,446
He's golfing? On our anniversary?!

258
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:47,527
Oh, boy. You just put Peter in the
doghouse, which is where your mother...

259
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,647
Don't say it!

260
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:52,327
Your mother smells.

261
00:17:55,728 --> 00:18:00,249
See, this is why I hate clothes shopping.
I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.

262
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,129
You're trying too hard.
She won't care what you wear.

263
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,850
She's just gonna be glad to see you.
That's how it was with Lois.

264
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,852
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

265
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,733
- Hi, Mr Pewterschmidt.
- What are you doing here?

266
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:28,134
It's a long story - with terrific performances
and a wonderful scene in a carnival.

267
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:30,654
I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!

268
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,655
Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin.

269
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:37,055
I want you to take this
and stay away from my daughter for ever.

270
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:40,336
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.

271
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:45,337
No deal. Lois may be worth a million to you,
but to me, she's worthless.

272
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,937
- I love her, Mr Pewterschmidt.
- Oh, Peter!

273
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:55,458
Holy crap! Back then I gave up
a million bucks just to be with Lois.

274
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:59,339
Now I won't even miss a golf game
to spend our anniversary together.

275
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,260
- No wonder she's gonna dump me.
- Or is she?

276
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,540
Wait a minute. That's my revelation.
I gotta pay more attention to my wife!

277
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,941
Eureka. Now, come on back
to the golf course. I've got a date.

278
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:15,262
Death, wait, wait, wait. Before we go,
I need you to do me one more favour.

279
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:20,543
Peter. Peter Frampton.

280
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:24,863
Oh, no! God, please no!
I'm too young to die!

281
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,544
Sure you're not supposed
to get Keith Richards?

282
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:33,145
All right. If you want to live, come with me.
And bring your guitar.

283
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:37,666
And bring that thing you use to make it go
wah... wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.

284
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:41,146
Hey! Get out of the way!

285
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,867
Damn. How could he lie to me
on our anniversary?

286
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:13,152
- Oh, Peter. Our song.
- Happy anniversary, Lois.

287
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:18,953
This is the most romantic gift you've ever
given me. How did you put this together?

288
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:24,154
I had a little help...
from a very special friend.

289
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,954
- I like animals.
- Uh-huh.

290
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,755
Cos they're like people, little furry people.

291
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,276
Yeah... Hey, you ever go on the Internet?

292
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:37,276
They got some cool stuff
there on that Internet.

293
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:41,877
I bought these shoes from a company on
the Internet, cos they don't test on animals.

294
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,757
Wow.

295
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,958
You know, animals never have war.
War is an invention of mankind.

296
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:52,559
What the hell are you talking about?
Animals fight all the time!

297
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,960
Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug
your children with nuclear arms.

298
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
Check, please.

299
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,885

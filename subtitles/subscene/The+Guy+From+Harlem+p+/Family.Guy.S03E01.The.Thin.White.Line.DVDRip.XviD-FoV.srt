1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,689
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:08,889
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,568
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,608
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,568
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:23,408
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:24,888
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:30,127
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:36,167
I'm in a rut.
Nothing thrills me any more.

10
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:39,807
I can't even think of a reason to
get off the bed in the morning.

11
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,967
- Really?
- My life is so pathetic.

12
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:45,766
I've seen that Behind the Music
with Leif Garrett 18 times.

13
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:50,926
- Hey, Leif. It's been a while.
- Too long, man.

14
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,846
I'm so sorry about everything, man. I'm so...

15
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,726
Ready for a bombshell? You saved my life.

16
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,645
But... but I was driving. I...

17
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:03,485
I was on a road to destruction, man. The
accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive.

18
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,245
Can we turn off the cameras, dude?

19
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:08,725
It's... it's like I'm, I don't know,
trapped in my own life.

20
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:11,685
Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly
focused.

21
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:15,444
Try thinking about others.
Why don't you do some volunteer work?

22
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,764
That makes sense.
Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.

23
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:20,764
You still have 13 more minutes.

24
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:23,404
Oh. Do I? Hm.

25
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,684
I, uh, I notice you got a new receptionist.
Nice little body on her, huh?

26
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:30,723
That's my daughter.

27
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:34,923
We could probably call this an early day,
huh?

28
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,563
Attention, everyone.

29
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:43,243
Due to several complaints and
two deaths related to worker fatigue,

30
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,482
I have decided to throw
a company picnic this Saturday.

31
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:50,002
- How you gettin' to the picnic?
- I don't know. I don't have a ride.

32
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:55,642
Hey, John, you got a two-seater. Hey, Derek,
maybe you go with John, huh? Huh?

33
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,882
For the last time, I'm not gay.

34
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:00,082
- Thanks anyway.
- We'll get him.

35
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:04,801
Here. Right this way. Watch your step.

36
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,161
OK. They're in the woods.

37
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,441
The camera keeps on moving.

38
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:14,401
Uh, I think they're lookin' for some witch or
something. I don't know. I wasn't listening.

39
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:17,840
Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening.

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Something about a map.

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
Nothing's happening.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,400
It's over. A lot of people
in the audience look pissed.

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,559
Now, remember, Chris, we have to
work together so that our steps...

44
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,159
This is my favourite event:
Catch the greased-up deaf guy.

45
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,639
Go!

46
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,439
You're never gonna catch me!
You're wastin' your time!

47
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,958
Forget about it! Go do somethin' else!

48
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,678
See y'all next year!

49
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,998
- King me.
- I don't want to play any more.

50
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:03,478
The pain. I can't live like this, Brian.

51
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,877
I need you to pull the plug.

52
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:09,157
I-I can't. I...

53
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:11,997
Be my angel and set me free.

54
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,237
Please.

55
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:23,676
Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it!

56
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,036
I... But... You...

57
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:28,396
Nurse! This dog is trying to kill me! Nurse!

58
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:32,476
You are twisted, lady. You hear me?
You are screwed up in the head.

59
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:38,235
The winner of our final contest
will receive a very special prize.

60
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:41,355
A week's paid vacation!

61
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:45,795
Did you hear that? Oh, God,
please let it be a fart contest.

62
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:48,275
These are tranquilliser darts.

63
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:52,195
I have enough here to take down
Robert Downey Jr.

64
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,034
Robert Downey...

65
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:58,154
The last one left standing wins.
Let the game begin.

66
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:08,074
- All right!
- Run for your life, Peter!

67
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,033
Look at him. He runs like a Welshman.

68
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:14,113
Doesn't he? Doesn't he run like a Welshman?

69
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:16,953
- Hey, Brian.
- Hi, Joe.

70
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,633
Bonnie making chicken Marsala?

71
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:23,993
No. She made that three nights ago.
Wow! That's some nose you've got!

72
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,392
Yeah. One time it almost
got me a spokesman deal.

73
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,472
"Follow your nose. "
"Follow your nose. " "Follow your nose. "

74
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,192
Oh, I'm sorry. No, that was good.

75
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,992
I-I just didn't think you were
gonna go so cartoony with it.

76
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,232
- How would you read it?
- Oh, I don't know.

77
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:46,031
I was thinkin' of doin' it, you know, good.
Like an actor. But your way's good too.

78
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,711
We could use a nose like that at the precinct.

79
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,471
Really?

80
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:57,270
I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter.
One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't wanna feed Grandma bacon
while she's in the bathtub.

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,750
Peter, are you OK?

83
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,949
Mr Weed, I think Peter needs a doc...

84
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,269
We have a winner!

85
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:19,229
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

86
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,589
No drugs. She's good. He's clean.

87
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,829
That's it, except for the flight crew.

88
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,508
Hey, Brian. What's with
the Johnny Law routine?

89
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:33,148
Say hello to our newest narc. He's a natural.

90
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:36,428
Oh, yeah? How good are you?

91
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:41,628
You're back from Manila. You ate lumpia,
then you made love to two Filipino women.

92
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:44,548
- And a man.
- You mean three Filipino women.

93
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,227
No-o-o-o-o!

94
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,507
Wait a second. Got something.

95
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,706
This could be the real deal, boys. Let's do it!

96
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,865
Don't move, dirtbag!

97
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:24,305
It's coke! Yes! All right! We got 'em! This is
great. This is the rush I've been lookin' for.

98
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:28,585
Good work, Brian.
Uh, you still got a little, uh...

99
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,345
Oh. Oh, thanks.

100
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:38,344
Where shall we go for your week off?

101
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:41,384
We could all go to Purgatory
like we did last year.

102
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:46,304
This isn't bad. It's not that good,
but it's not that bad.

103
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:48,384
- It's so-so.
- Yeah. More or less.

104
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:54,943
Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs,
does that make you a schnozage?

105
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:58,823
- Did you stay up all night writing that?
- I got to bed around 2.30.

106
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:01,383
You know the street value of that cocaine?

107
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:07,662
Let's see. Four and a half kilos
uncut Nicaraguan. 1.7 mil, that area?

108
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:10,542
Uh, yeah. That's... that's... that's right.

109
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,262
You guys, Brian's famous!

110
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:14,262
- You're a hero!
- Way to go!

111
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:19,622
Oh, come on, stop it, you guys. It's nothing.
Oh, Lois, your toast is ready.

112
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:21,221
Wow! Oh, my!

113
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:25,621
- Uh, Meg's using a new conditioner.
- He's right! That's amazing!

114
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:30,021
- Time to change Stewie.
- Preposterous. I haven't... There it is.

115
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,741
All right!

116
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,540
Stop the car.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,180
Over there.

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,380
Everybody freeze! This is a bust!

119
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,060
Brian, this is a Sunday-school class.

120
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,980
The hell it is. Pure Bogotá bullion.
This is a drug ring.

121
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,819
- But these are just kids.
- Oh, yeah? What's your name?

122
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,619
- Ricky.
- They're not kids. They're midgets.

123
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,779
Filthy drug-peddling midgets.

124
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,619
Oh, my God!

125
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,179
Look out, Brian!

126
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,777
- Nice work!
- You're a credit to the force.

127
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:28,057
Additional generic cop compliment, Brian.

128
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:32,257
Thanks. But the real hero here is God
for blessing me with this nose.

129
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:35,537
And a few other equally amazing
appendages.

130
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:42,776
- I better take this cocaine down to Evidence.
- Oh, I'll... I'll do that.

131
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,816
I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.

132
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,776
So it's settled. We're takin'
a cruise to the Bahamas.

133
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,776
Ah, this is gonna be great.

134
00:08:55,816 --> 00:09:00,215
And look. It says we have our
choice of cabins - port or starboard.

135
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:05,095
Ha! Listen to me!
I sound like an old salt!

136
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,615
I must say, I've always
dreamed of a life at sea.

137
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:16,494
"I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy

138
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,654
"And your record will stand as proof

139
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:21,174
"Be it galley or freighter,
I'm an expert navigator

140
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,254
"And you're also a world-class poof

141
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:27,973
"My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the
street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue

142
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:32,453
"Well, despite your point of view
I can thrill a girl or two

143
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,173
"But I'd rather get it on with you

144
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:36,293
Ha-ha-ha!

145
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,573
Sorry to be tardy to the party.

146
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:46,172
Wow, Brian! Have you lost weight?
You gotta tell me your secret.

147
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:49,332
Here's a hint - put down the fork! Face!

148
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,772
So, how was your day?

149
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:55,572
Un-freakin'-believable. First we
nailed a bastard who had the gall

150
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:59,651
to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll.
Her doll!

151
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:04,091
Where's the line any more? I got news for ya.
It-it's not even on the radar screen.

152
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,571
The days of decency
and virtue are gone. Bam!

153
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:11,691
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud
puddle. One day you see your reflection in it,

154
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,371
and the next day it's a damn oil spot
on your cracked driveway

155
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,050
staring back at you, mocking you.
Blah! Blah! Blah!

156
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,930
Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit
of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.

157
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,170
You know what I haven't had in a while?
Big League Chew.

158
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,569
So take it from me - McGriffin, the drug dog.

159
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:36,849
If you really wanna get high,
it's as easy as being yourself.

160
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:42,849
Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...
Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.

161
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,408
Hey, kids! You know why I'm happy?

162
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:53,048
Cos I'm free of S... T... Ds!

163
00:10:56,008 --> 00:11:00,768
- That McGriffin guy was so cool!
- Totally. I'm never doing drugs now.

164
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,527
Ahhhhh.

165
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,207
Got milk?

166
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:11,367
Before you go on a cruise,
you gotta build up a base tan.

167
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:16,207
But I heard that if you use tanning beds,
you could get something called melanoma.

168
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:20,886
Oh, that's just fancy talk
for sexified. Now, climb in.

169
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:30,046
- Hey, what kinda tanning booth is this?
- Those aren't tanning booths.

170
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,246
- That row is time machines.
- Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?

171
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:38,725
Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's
a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.

172
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,205
Oh, look, my very own lion!

173
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,285
Oh, my God!

174
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,445
Must've got the wrong hat.

175
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:50,645
And now, here's something
we hope you'll really like.

176
00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:59,364
There's no smokin' in the terminal.

177
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:02,644
There's worse things than nicotine.
And I'm gonna find 'em.

178
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:08,083
Patience. It took St Patrick more
than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.

179
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:11,643
- Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
- OK.

180
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,683
- Open it!
- Agh! Let me go!

181
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:16,043
Help! Help!

182
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,843
Where's the stash? I'll do
a freakin' body-cavity search.

183
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:22,843
- Argh! Argh!
- Sir, we apologise.

184
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,962
There's no easy way to say this.
You have a drug problem.

185
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:30,562
A drug problem? What's this really about?
Jealousy? Am I stealin' your thunder?

186
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,162
- Give me your badge.
- Fine!

187
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:35,762
By the way, Horowicz, you should
show Joe your impression of him.

188
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:40,441
Oh, well... It's not as good as my
Irish cop. It's just a little thing I...

189
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:45,681
"I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up
for it by having a very strong upper body. "

190
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:48,321
Well, I do say that.

191
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:55,680
The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're
gettin' in the mood for our cruise.

192
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sittin' out there
on a boat yammerin' to himself.

193
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,360
He doesn't even know I'm watching him.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Ah, splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.

195
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,320
- Everybody, this is Tina.
- What happened to you?

196
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,039
Less questions and more shut-the-hell-up.

197
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,999
Just because you can't feel your teeth
doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.

198
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,239
Hello. I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.

199
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,399
So, what? She's, like,
your mom or somethin'?

200
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,438
Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to
wipe the dried blood from under your nose?

201
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:35,718
- Here's the channel Lois doesn't know about.
- Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

202
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:39,198
Wait. That man seems to have
suffered a serious snakebite.

203
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:42,517
Brian, would you please ask
your new friend to leave now?

204
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:45,757
Oh, sorry. Things gettin'
too real for the Stepford wife?

205
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:49,157
And look at you two - Quasimodo and
Lumpy.

206
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,757
I leave more personality in
tightly-coiled piles on the lawn.

207
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,437
Oh, do me! Do me next!

208
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:57,317
Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.

209
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:08,476
- Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?
- Your family has something to say.

210
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,436
Brian, I know I don't speak up much,

211
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:14,036
and it's really hard for me to
talk about my feelings, but...

212
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,715
Let's start with someone
more interesting. Peter?

213
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,595
Ever since your addiction,
you've been a jerk.

214
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,195
I miss the old days
when you were my sidekick.

215
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:29,515
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was
made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.

216
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:32,954
Uh, yeah, yeah.

217
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,634
Uh... yeah.

218
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,754
Yeah. Eeh. Yeah.

219
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,114
Brian, how about a little tie music?

220
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,874
"Peter's tie, Peter's tie

221
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,154
"That's because Peter's the guy!

222
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:49,673
All right. That's it. A little tie music.

223
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,153
Heh-hee!

224
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,833
Yeah!

225
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:57,473
Look, you-you guys got it
all wrong. I-I-I... I wa...

226
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,113
Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone!

227
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:02,632
Oh, God, I need help!

228
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:05,392
I guess now we know what kind of dog he is.

229
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:08,112
A melan-collie.

230
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:14,072
Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I should have said "Chi-wah-wah".

231
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,831
I don't have to impress you.

232
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:22,231
Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois.

233
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,871
But why do we have to cancel our cruise
just cos the dog's a cokehead?

234
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:30,711
We're not going on vacation while Brian's
in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.

235
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,751
Aw, man!

236
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,510
I'll make it up to you.
My cousin works at Club Med.

237
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,030
Holy crap! Look at this place.

238
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,550
This is where God would come
if he had to stop doin' blow.

239
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,910
- They have tennis courts!
- And a full spa!

240
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,629
Wow! No wonder people do drugs!

241
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,789
Good luck, Brian. I just know
you're gonna get clean.

242
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,909
Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with
all these mineral baths and jacuzzis.

243
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:02,749
Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun
and everyone wets themselves.

244
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,428
I give you gold and I get squat.
I'll be in the car.

245
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,468
That was a very productive first day, Brian.

246
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,948
Our goal here is to find your X factor -

247
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,148
the element in your life
that made you turn to drugs.

248
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:21,827
Just having some time away to sort things
out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.

249
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,147
What are you doing here?

250
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:28,787
I'm on vacation. Oh, and if
anyone asks, I'm also on smack.

251
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,427
Peter, this is a detox clinic.
You can't vacation here.

252
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,506
Why not? This place is
way better than a cruise.

253
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,626
I whipped this speedfreak's ass
at horseshoes today.

254
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,746
This isn't a vacation for me.
I'm tryin' to get healthy.

255
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,386
Yeah, OK. All right.

256
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,146
Hey, softball this afternoon.

257
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:52,066
Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant
teenagers from across the lake.

258
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,145
OK, come on, everyone. Exercise
is an important part of recovery.

259
00:16:56,185 --> 00:17:01,625
Just work with the resistance of the water.
Ten more reps. And one. And two.

260
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:03,585
And three.

261
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,985
Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

262
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:16,704
Trade you this for your cupcake.

263
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:23,544
What? It was just Carpet Fresh.
I'm on your side.

264
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:28,623
I've been observing your behaviour. I don't
think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.

265
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:34,343
Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips.
In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.

266
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:37,223
I'll be keeping my eye on you.
What's your name?

267
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,503
Uh, my-my name? Uh...

268
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,662
Uh... uh... uh...

269
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:45,342
Pea... uh... uh... uh...

270
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,502
Tear... uh...

271
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:51,062
Uh... Griffin.

272
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,182
Yeah. Yeah. Peter Griffin.

273
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,222
Oh, crap.

274
00:17:55,702 --> 00:18:00,061
I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess
with the pregnant teens across the lake?

275
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:01,941
I can't. Group therapy.

276
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:07,421
I saw one of those - more borin' than when
I was a security guard for George Harrison.

277
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Quiet down up there!

278
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,819
You wacky Beatle.

279
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,979
I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing
one session wouldn't be the end of the world.

280
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:35,939
There you go.

281
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,299
- What do you think they put in the bug juice?
- Bugs?

282
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,299
No, they don't! Come on.

283
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:43,939
Shut up.

284
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:08,217
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
14 premature births.

285
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,817
Sorry. I don't usually let Peter
talk me into this kinda stuff.

286
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:15,217
You have a pre-existing relationship
with this degenerate?

287
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,737
A degenerate, am I?

288
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,056
Well, you are a fastizio.

289
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:21,616
See? I can make up words too, sister.

290
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:25,016
- Well, I think we've found your X factor.
- You mean Peter?

291
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:29,976
His behaviour is a negative influence on you.
With your intelligence and sensitivity...

292
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:33,135
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
I made my own mistakes. All right?

293
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,135
This man took me into his home
and treated me like family.

294
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:39,135
- He's my best friend.
- And look where you've ended up.

295
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:42,095
You know, I think my therapy
here is complete.

296
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,935
I came here to get clean
and I did. So goodbye.

297
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:50,694
Brian, it's moments like this that make me
sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.

298
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:58,134
"He was all coked up and we were choked up

299
00:19:58,174 --> 00:20:01,374
"But now we're happy Brian's home,
cha-cha-cha!

300
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:04,613
I am serious, Lois.
You could be in show business.

301
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,333
- Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
- No.

302
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,453
- Chris, how are ya?
- I'm glad...

303
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:10,733
All right!

304
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:15,253
Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me,
you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.

305
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,453
Joe, if I've learned anything
from my experience,

306
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:21,532
it's that we're all responsible
for our own destiny.

307
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:25,852
- And that's why I'm leaving.
- Leavin'? You can't leave.

308
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,452
I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.

309
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,252
Aw!

310
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,572
Somebody say something.

311
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:35,892
Brian, wait!

312
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:39,971
Hold on a second.

313
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,891
Airport, please.

314
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:19,409

1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,599
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,878
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:12,597
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:14,597
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:18,476
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:23,394
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:24,794
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:30,073
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,671
Let's see. We've got soda, purple stuff...

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,670
Sunny D! All right!

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,269
We now return to "The Smurfs".

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:45,589
- Hey. You have a good time last night?
- Smurftacular!

13
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:49,787
- I saw you leave with Smurfette.
- We left the bar and she started smurfin' me.

14
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:52,587
Shut the smurf up!
Right in the smurfin'parking lot?

15
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,986
- Smurf, yeah!
- That is freakin' smurf!

16
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,385
- You smurf it.
- That is freakin' smurf.

17
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,785
Hello?

18
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,185
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:04,184
Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?

20
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,263
I'm watching the latest episode
of Laundry Theatre.

21
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:09,462
Those are Chris's socks, right?

22
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:13,261
They don't know that Stewie's shirt
is having an affair with Meg's trousers.

23
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,861
It's fun to watch rich people be naughty!

24
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,860
Listen to me. My sister just called.

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,779
Her baby's due any day now
and Ted just walked out on her.

26
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,179
Whoa, back it up. You have a sister?

27
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,257
I promised her I'd be on the next train.
Poor Carol, all alone in that big house.

28
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:31,656
Carol... She the one with
the Jacuzzi and the pool table?

29
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:33,256
- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.

30
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:35,376
Really? That's a surprise.

31
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:38,255
Come on, Lois.
When have I not been there for you?

32
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,774
- Get outta the car!
- Scream and you're dead.

33
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,973
Thanks for the ride, lady.

34
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:51,851
- It's the Griffins. What can I do for you?
- Glen, we have a family emergency.

35
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:55,250
We really need you to take the kids
for just a couple of days.

36
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,769
In accordance with Megan's Law,
I'm obligated to inform you that...

37
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,368
- That's fine. I'll take the kids.
- Thanks, buddy.

38
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:07,167
Gosh, I never entertained kids before.

39
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:12,166
So a chick walks into
a gynaecologist's office...

40
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,565
Wha-ha-ha-ha-hey!

41
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,844
Diggly, diggly, diggly, diggly!

42
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,562
Carol, we'll get you through this.

43
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:32,241
In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby
to smother with all your unrequited love.

44
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,560
And as soon as the baby can crawl,
it'll probably leave me too,

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,439
just like my eight husbands.

46
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:43,358
Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted.
I came back because I love you and...

47
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,837
I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.

48
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,236
It was so nice of you to come, Peter.
You're so considerate.

49
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:51,236
It was nothing.

50
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,830
Mr Quagmire, I finished the scavenger hunt.

51
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,629
Hold your horses. Let's go down the list.

52
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:17,549
- An unsharpened pencil?
- Check.

53
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,548
A speed-limit sign that
doesn't end in five or zero?

54
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:22,147
Your mom's hairbrush?

55
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:24,747
- You win!
- Oh, boy! What's my prize?

56
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:26,746
- A pencil and a speed sign.
- I did it!

57
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,146
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,024
Teeth and some toenail clippings
and we'll be ready for our date.

59
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,743
Carol, since Ted dumped you,
can I have his shirts?

60
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:43,622
Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

61
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,541
I know, but check this out.

62
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,540
Carol, say "David Banner,
I just slashed your tyres. "

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,539
- David Banner, I just slashed your tyres.
- Aaagh!

64
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,538
I'm priceless!

65
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,138
Sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies room.

66
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,017
- Does she still take the newspaper in there?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,536
And after she does, I just can't read it.

68
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:09,535
Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here
any minute. We'd better get moving.

69
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:13,534
You gotta relax. You let that kid start
calling the shots now and you're screwed.

70
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,932
Is Mr Quagmire baby-sitting
all these people, too?

71
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:26,011
Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
I'd put U and I together.

72
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:30,729
You must be a parking ticket,
cos you got "fine" written all over you.

73
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:35,208
Hey, there. I don't wanna
come between you... or do I?

74
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,008
That's awful.

75
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:41,207
This is a song I've been singing
for a number of years,

76
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:44,926
and I find it grows truer and truer
as time goes by.

77
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,602
I'm hungry for you, baby.
Come on, walk with me, talk with me.

78
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,920
Don't worry. We're almost there.
Peter, why are we stopped?

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,999
- I'll have three cheeseburgers.
- For God's sake, she's having a baby!

80
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:17,597
Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
And... I guess I'll have fries.

81
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,116
If I have fries,
is anybody else gonna have any?

82
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,316
I don't wanna be the only one eating 'em.
I'll feel like a fatty.

83
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:29,794
- Nurse, this woman is in labour.
- Excuse me. I was here first.

84
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:31,393
My leg is asleep.

85
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,313
Oh!

86
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,792
All right, let's see what we have here.
The baby's crowning.

87
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,792
Oh!

88
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:42,591
All right, I'm just going to put on
a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.

89
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:46,190
These don't feel like gloves at all.
They feel like used needles.

90
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,508
But this is where I always keep the gloves.
Maybe if I dig deeper.

91
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:54,787
No, just feels like more needles.
That's the craziest thing.

92
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,307
Oh. Now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.

93
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,786
Oh, my God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?

94
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,905
Honey, do something!

95
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,585
No baby, but it looks like
Carol's blowing a bubble.

96
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:08,384
- Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
- I am! It won't go back in.

97
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:11,103
Not you, Peter. Carol, push. Peter, you pull.

98
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,702
Aagh!

99
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,982
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

100
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:18,101
It's a beautiful baby girl.

101
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:21,700
A baby girl. I'm so happy!

102
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,979
But she has a penis.
We'll have to do something about that.

103
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,299
- Peter, no! It's a boy.
- Well, how do you like that!

104
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,298
Hey there, little fella.
Welcome to the planet Earth!

105
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,177
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!

106
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:39,296
- He takes after his Uncle Peter.
- He's Carol's baby. Give him to her.

107
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,175
Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:45,294
Honey, you were fantastic. And you were
so cute when you were holding it.

109
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,973
I know. I didn't wanna give it up. Let's steal it.

110
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,093
No, wait. I got a better idea.

111
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:53,292
- Lois, let's have another baby.
- What?

112
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,971
- Sweetie, you're not serious?
- I sure am.

113
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,491
The best thing I've ever done is being a dad.

114
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:01,690
Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.

115
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,768
Why haven't you sent for help?

116
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,687
I can't believe you wanna have another kid.

117
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,766
Did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?

118
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,886
Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
It's our pet rock.

119
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,485
I remember the first day we brought it home.

120
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,364
See that? Huh? Huh?

121
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,284
Bad rock! Bad!

122
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:28,483
We do that outside.
Look at him. He knows what he did.

123
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,682
I found my baby book!

124
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:34,481
Hey, here's the broken condom
that led to my birth.

125
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:39,360
And the resulting lawsuit bought us
this house. You're my favourite mistake.

126
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,159
You see, Meg? I'm the favourite.

127
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,958
Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days
of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

128
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:51,277
- Somebody hasn't heard the news.
- News? What news?

129
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:55,276
What's the most wonderful thing
that could happen to this family?

130
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,274
The Phillies won.

131
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:03,953
- You're gonna have a baby brother.
- Or a sister.

132
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:07,872
A new baby. That's wonderful.
Call me when Kojak starts.

133
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:08,752
What?!

134
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:15,150
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why
the deuce would they want to replace me?

135
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,269
My cheeks are pinchable, my bottom
is smooth, my laugh is heart-warming.

136
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,868
What's that? I certainly am not overreacting.

137
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:27,147
What happened to Bobby
when they added Oliver to The Brady Bunch?

138
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:31,666
- Oliver, did you break this vase?
- No, the floor did.

139
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,066
He's so cute.

140
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:38,064
- Hey, everybody! I...
- Bobby, you get back in the garage!

141
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:42,543
It can't happen. I was here first. Well,
technically third, but no time for semantics.

142
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:45,463
This is Stewie country,
and I intend to keep it that way.

143
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:51,941
As God is my witness, from this day forward,
Peter and Lois shall not conceive.

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,339
- What are you doing here?
- Peter and Lois are... getting intimate.

145
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:03,658
My God, I thought I had more time.
I've got to stop them.

146
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,537
Whaaa! Whaaa!

147
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:09,536
Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!
I saw the bo...

148
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:13,135
Blast! What is that name again?
Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!

149
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:17,134
- I saw the bogeyman.
- Did someone have a bad dream?

150
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:20,533
Why don't you sleep
with Mommy and Daddy?

151
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,053
Peter, for God's sake. Stewie's right here.

152
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,932
We can still do it.
He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.

153
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:29,131
Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

154
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,129
Roll over. Roll over, I say!

155
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:39,648
Smells like cheese.

156
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:45,327
- OK, insert rod support A into slot B.
- That's what...

157
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:48,526
If you say "That's what she said"
once more, I'll pop you.

158
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,525
What you buildin', neighbour?

159
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:54,244
We were keeping it a secret,
but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.

160
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:57,044
Lois and I are having another baby!

161
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:02,442
We are so throwing you a shower.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,919
Fat man, we'll see if Lois
wants to have sexual relations

163
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,238
when she finds lipstick on your collar.

164
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,917
There we are.

165
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,115
Well, look at you there.

166
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,635
You're a filthy girl, aren't you?

167
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,234
Yes, you're looking for a bad time,
that's what you're after.

168
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:39,233
You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad
and you don't care who you get it from,

169
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:42,832
because you have no self-respect,
and that gets you off, doesn't it?

170
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:46,431
Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.

171
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:50,110
And you got it all over your father's
favourite shirt. Go to your room.

172
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,309
Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

173
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,108
Make any joke you want.
You know I look good.

174
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:05,226
Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time
spent keeping people from having sex!

175
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,305
Now I know how
the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!

176
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:10,624
Time to initiate phase two.

177
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,502
All right, testing voice modulator.
Blast, you vile woman!

178
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:22,021
- Blast, you vile woman.
- That won't do.

179
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:26,500
Pardon me, you with
severe aesthetic deficiencies.

180
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,699
- Hey, ugly!
- Excellent. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

181
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,699
Sweet. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

182
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:37,097
Who's got beer?

183
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:44,615
- Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?
- To the can. Kissing you made me barf.

184
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,215
- What?
- Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.

185
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:51,614
- Like I could! He's so fat.
- I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.

186
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,613
That's it. Your dad's had enough.

187
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,012
I want you kids to go and drink
the antifreeze in the garage.

188
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,811
I'm gonna chug it all
so there's none left for you.

189
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,291
- Watch it!
- Peter!

190
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,610
What?

191
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,890
Hey, Peter.

192
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,209
I see nussing. Nussing.

193
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,688
I've had it with these interruptions.
All we want is time alone.

194
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:15,487
You kids go to your rooms
for the rest of the night.

195
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:20,286
I don't wanna go to my room.
There's an evil monkey in my closet.

196
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,485
Evil monkey! That's funny.

197
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,404
Agh!

198
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:31,803
This romantic dinner
was a wonderful idea, Peter.

199
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:35,682
You deserve it, my beautiful princess.

200
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:39,481
You know, I'm not wearing any panties.

201
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:43,600
Don't worry.
We can always throw that chair out.

202
00:12:55,077 --> 00:13:00,795
Very well, then. If I can't stop them from
the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.

203
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,589
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone.

204
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:35,066
As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate
of every sperm in Peter's body.

205
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,186
Aagh!

206
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,384
Computer on.

207
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,863
30 minutes before ship re-expansion.

208
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:50,662
Just enough time to obliterate
all those little potential usurpers.

209
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:52,382
- Engine status.
- Nominal.

210
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:53,981
- Fuel supply.
- Full.

211
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:58,260
Air supply.

212
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,779
Very well. Through the lips, over the gums.
Look out, testicles, here I come!

213
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,378
"Lois

214
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,177
"You can't spell "love" without L-O

215
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:14,456
"You can't spell "is" without I-S

216
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:18,655
"You can't spell "silo" without Lois

217
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,454
And solo from the pet rock.

218
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,974
No! No! No!

219
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:26,573
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

220
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:34,251
Warning: Host's oxygen levels rising.
Heart rate increasing.

221
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:38,050
My God. Either they're watching Batman
or they're doing the do.

222
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,168
If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the
sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.

223
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:49,967
- Computer, location.
- 15mm northeast of the duodenum.

224
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,246
Very well. Fire phasers!

225
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:56,165
Oh, jeez! My duodenum's acting up.

226
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:00,444
Entering testicular perimeter.

227
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:08,042
Well, well. Do you know what today is?

228
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,761
A bad day to be a sperm.

229
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,232
What the deuce...?

230
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,549
- Well, it seems you're out of ammunition.
- As are you, Stewart.

231
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,949
- You know my name.
- I know many things.

232
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,548
- Indeed.
- Quite.

233
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:03,147
We should exchange monosyllabic
expressions of arrogance in person.

234
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,427
- Hm.
- Mm.

235
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,745
- Peter, I'm waiting.
- I'm comin'.

236
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,021
- You came unarmed?
- As we agreed.

237
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:30,140
Admirable. But foolish!

238
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,619
It's going to be a shame
to destroy such a worthy adversary.

239
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,738
My thoughts exactly.

240
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:52,614
- I've got you in the sleeper hold.
- As I you.

241
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,334
Your attempts to escape are...

242
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,533
Futile.

243
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,809
Well, well. Nap time appears to be over.

244
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:19,527
Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be
able to do away with that red-headed woman.

245
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,127
What the...? How the devil
do you know about Lois?

246
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,526
You've seen that little gleam
in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?

247
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:27,605
That's me, plotting my escape.

248
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:31,324
You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
What else do you hate?

249
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:34,923
People who send pictures
of their families as Christmas cards.

250
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:38,802
- People who use the word "guestimate".
- Guys who wear sandals with socks.

251
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:42,321
Jason Patric. Ew!

252
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:45,121
Perhaps I've been looking
at this the wrong way.

253
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:48,000
I should embrace the idea
of having a little brother.

254
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,399
After all, it's obvious
we'd make quite a formidable team.

255
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:16,712
- Two minutes to re-expansion.
- Dear God! I'll never get out of here in time.

256
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,992
Move aside. I know a short cut.

257
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,710
Mm.

258
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,309
Mm.

259
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,986
Re-expansion in 60 seconds.

260
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,705
There's the tear duct.
We've gotta make him cry.

261
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,905
I think I know just the way.

262
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,503
Follow my lead.

263
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:15,697
Oh, Peter. I love you.

264
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:18,896
And I love you, Lou Gossett Junior.

265
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:21,895
It worked. You've got to get
down there so you can be born.

266
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:24,095
10 seconds to re-expansion.

267
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,694
- I guess this is goodbye.
- For now.

268
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:32,772
When you're born, don't let the doctor
slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.

269
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,168
Give it to her good, old man.

270
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,567
Peter, wait. I've been thinking.

271
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:55,087
It's been a long time since
we had such a wonderful night.

272
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:59,565
It'll be impossible to spend time together
like this if we're raising another child.

273
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,885
I thought, you know,
Brian would do a lot of the work.

274
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:07,283
I don't know. I mean,
Stewie alone needs so much attention.

275
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,083
Maybe we should hold off
on having another baby.

276
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:14,481
- Yeah, you may be right.
- No, no! You must receive his seed!

277
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,081
- Look who's here!
- But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?

278
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,680
- Honey, not in front of Stewie.
- OK. Back in a minute.

279
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,358
No, no, no! Come back here this instant,
you fat bastard, and do her!

280
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:31,877
Stop! Stop it! Stop tickling me! Stop it!

281
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:34,956
I'll kill you, I swear to God!

282
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:39,155
Wha... Wha... What did you just do?

283
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,474
No!

284
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,953
You killed my brother! How could you, you...!

285
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:52,352
Oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive.

286
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:55,151
Well played, sperm brother. Well played.

287
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,950
He's more clever than I thought.

288
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,069
Perhaps too clever.

289
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,742

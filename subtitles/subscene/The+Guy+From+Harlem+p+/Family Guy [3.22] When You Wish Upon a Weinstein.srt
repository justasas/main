1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,800
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:08,946
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:12,674
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:15,728
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,048
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,889
Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,790
Laugh and cry

8
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:30,863
He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,414
Dad, can you help me with my math?

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,000
Mr Shackleford says if I don't learn it
I won't be able to function in the real world.

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,592
OK, you gotta go down the road
past the old Johnson place.

12
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:48,238
You're gonna find two roads,
one parallel and one perpendicular.

13
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:52,488
Keep goin' until you come to a highway
that bisects it at a 45-degree angle.

14
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:54,763
Solve for X.

15
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:58,747
Maths. Huh!

16
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:03,111
Math, my dear boy, is nothing more
than the lesbian sister of biology.

17
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:09,424
- Hello, sir.
- Enough foreplay. What you sellin'?

18
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:12,657
Well, I was gonna try to sell you
some Handsome Cream,

19
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:15,889
but I can see you already
bought out the store.

20
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:18,122
- Go on.
- So perhaps you'd be interested

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:22,408
in something every homeowner
cannot be without: volcano insurance.

22
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,317
- Go on.
- According to my uncle,

23
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,907
who's a real whiz with volcanos,
a volcano is coming this way.

24
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:34,117
Hm. I too have an uncle.

25
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,067
Come in.

26
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:39,714
- How much is this volcano insurance?
- I-I don't know. Let's say $200.

27
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:43,998
$200?! That's more than I spent on
all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:48,578
- What about that jar of money?
- No way. That's Lois's rainy-day fund.

29
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:53,866
- Come on. It never rains in Rhode Island.
- Yeah, but we've never had a volcano either.

30
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:57,684
Well, don't you think we're overdue for one?

31
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,638
Touché, salesman.

32
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:12,275
- Agh! What the hell are you doing?!
- Watching you sleep, cutie-pie.

33
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:15,138
Why, you sick, sick little moo-cow!

34
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:17,653
You shall watch no more!

35
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:21,356
- Stewie!
- My glasses! I can't see a thing!

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,310
- Why won't you let me get laser surgery?
- I just don't think it's safe.

37
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:29,173
OK, just a quick incision here
and we should be all done, Mrs Wilson.

38
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,331
- Luke, use the Force.
- Really? Cos I was just gonna...

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
- Use the Force.
- OK.

40
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,681
- Are you happy?
- I've never been happy.

41
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:46,083
Oh, don't worry, honey.
We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.

42
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,825
And in the meantime here's a vision test.

43
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:52,132
What is this? A poopy or a Toblerone?

44
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,150
We now return
to "Girlfriends" on Lifetime.

45
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,974
- Barry was over last night, and...
- Don't tell me.

46
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:03,594
He left the toilet seat up.

47
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,839
Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny -

48
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:10,534
he fought in Vietnam, he's an exorcist,
but there is one thing that terrifies him.

49
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,831
Commitment!

50
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,859
Oh, Midge. You're my third best friend
in the whole world.

51
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,087
- Third? Who are the first two?
- Ben and Jerry.

52
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:27,808
Peter, did you take the money
from the family jar?

53
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,233
Who, me? Yes, me.
Couldn't be. Then who?

54
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,678
Yeah, I did it. I bought volcano insurance.

55
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:36,377
Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.

56
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:40,488
That's what you said when you
talked me out of getting cloud insurance.

57
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:44,555
Look at them up there.
Just plottin'. Picking their moment.

58
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,726
So, Bill, we attack tomorrow?

59
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,954
Yes. Tomorrow.

60
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,308
- I mean it this time.
- I do too.

61
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:58,681
Peter, that was our emergency money. And
your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.

62
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:02,208
- Lois, no one really needs glasses.
- You wear glasses.

63
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:05,449
That's only to fool the man
from the draft board.

64
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:08,082
I can't believe you squandered that money.

65
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,389
I swear, sometimes I feel
like I'm married to a child.

66
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,447
What can I say about my beautiful bride?

67
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,650
Except "Milk, milk, lemonade,
around the corner fudge is made. "

68
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:26,454
Watch who you're calling a child, because if
I'm a child, you know what that makes you?

69
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:30,947
A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
stand here and be lectured by a pervert.

70
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,221
Can you believe it?
Lois thinks I'm bad with money.

71
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:41,845
She's got a point. You're the white version of
a black guy who's not good with his money.

72
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,889
Hey-hey, guys and dolls.
Drinks are on doh-ray-mi.

73
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,543
- Where'd you get that?
- This is from my stockbroker Ian Greenstein.

74
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,531
He made some smart investments
that really paid off.

75
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,651
That guy is to money
what Miss Ann-Margret is to...

76
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,969
Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire.

77
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,459
My accountant Larry Rosenblat
just got me a huge tax refund.

78
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:08,848
And tickets to Bring In 'Da Noise,
Bring In 'Da Funk.

79
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:12,985
The noise was good, but I thought
they phoned in a lot of the funk.

80
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:18,056
Wait. Rosenblat? Greenstein? You're saying
I need a Jewish guy to handle my money.

81
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,066
Peter, not every Jewish person
is good with money.

82
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:24,785
Well, yeah, not the retarded ones,
but why would you even say that?

83
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,939
For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's
edgy and there's offensive. Good day, sir!

84
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,726
Mother, you know how
I hate asking for money, but...

85
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,289
Mother, Peter's an excellent provider.

86
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,405
No, Mother, I do not think I'd be
better off married to a chimp.

87
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:46,563
I don't care how well that chimp
across the street is doing.

88
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,534
Really? Well, yeah, OK,

89
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:54,154
I guess you can tell him I said hi.
But don't make me sound desperate.

90
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:59,402
I gotta get a Greenstein or
a Rosenblat of my very own.

91
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:05,308
Nothing else has worked so far

92
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:10,005
So I'll wish upon a star

93
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:15,727
Wondrous dancing speck of light

94
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:20,633
I need a Jew

95
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:26,307
Lois makes me take the rap

96
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:31,491
Cos our chequebook looks like crap

97
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:36,375
Since I can't give her a slap

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,880
I need a Jew

99
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:46,824
Where to find

100
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:51,125
A baum or stein or stin

101
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,801
To teach me how to whine

102
00:06:55,034 --> 00:07:00,434
And do my taxes?

103
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:36,453
Though by many they're abhorred

104
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:40,746
Hebrew people I've adored

105
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:46,151
Even though they killed my Lord

106
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,769
I need...

107
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:53,389
A...

108
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,439
Jew

109
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,807
Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car
just broke down. May I use your phone?

110
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:18,078
Now my troubles are all through

111
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,949
I have...

112
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,026
A...

113
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,012
Jew

114
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:24,889
Hey!

115
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:32,095
I prayed for you, Max Weinstein.
And here you are!

116
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,927
OK... Listen, uh, thanks for
letting me use the phone.

117
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,986
Thanks for Spaceballs.

118
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:42,267
- Well, if there's anything I can do for you...
- You can't leave!

119
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,189
Aaargh!

120
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,413
- What do you want?!
- Financial advice.

121
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,207
How the hell did you know
I'm an accountant?

122
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,627
Hello?! Max Weinstein?

123
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,211
I'll try, but I don't know why you
think I can get your money back.

124
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:19,057
Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages.
You're Jewish; you're good with money.

125
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:24,458
I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from
marching in my parade. Now get my money.

126
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,704
Oh. It's you. Um...

127
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,933
I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message. Beep!

128
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,830
Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi,
this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...

129
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:45,452
Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed
this contract and it offers no cover at all.

130
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:48,941
It just says "volcano insurance"
over and over again.

131
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:53,782
And down here in small print it says "He's
signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it. "

132
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,083
So?

133
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,230
Refund this man's money and we'll go.

134
00:09:57,316 --> 00:10:00,516
- I don't have your money!
- How about that money?

135
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:04,457
No way! That's Lois's rainy-day fund!
Ah, dammit.

136
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,988
- You didn't date her cos she was a tickler?
- Tickler!

137
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,804
- You're not a stickler for a tickler?
- Not a stickler.

138
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,019
Not a tickler stickler?

139
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:16,609
- Tickler stickler ickler...
- Ickler tickler...

140
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:20,755
- Where the hell is the remote?
- Hey, honey, guess what?

141
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:23,783
- I got back the money for Meg's glasses.
- Really?

142
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:26,612
Oh, honey! Oh, hello.

143
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:30,223
This is my special friend
Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.

144
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:33,677
- Ooh, my. How exotic.
- Thank you...?

145
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:38,018
See, here's your rainy-day money,
and I balanced our chequebook too.

146
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:41,698
- You balanced our chequebook?
- Yep. Isn't that right, Max?

147
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,748
Mm? Oh, yeah, sure. He did it.

148
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:49,472
I'm gonna call my mother right now and
tell her to tell that chimp across the street...

149
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:58,123
Look how low I've sunk. Taking credit
for something a smart Jewish person did.

150
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,724
- That's OK, Peter.
- People have done that for too damn long!

151
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,570
It is the white devil that has propagated,

152
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,385
exacerbated, instigated...

153
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,735
Instigated... Line?

154
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,455
Instigated our hatred like a Buick.

155
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,249
God, what was I thinking
when I agreed to this?

156
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:20,365
This is so degrading. This is worse
than the time I was at the Friars Club

157
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,836
and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.

158
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:28,328
Lois, I appreciate
the marshmallow and fish casserole,

159
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,261
but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.

160
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,781
Oh, because it's not kosher?

161
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,927
- Yeah, let's go with that.
- Can Stewie and me be excused?

162
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,755
- He's gonna help with my math homework.
- Chris, he's just a baby.

163
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:44,313
Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar

164
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:48,916
Where was it you graduated from again?
Hm? The University of Duhhhh?

165
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,109
- I can help you with your homework, son.
- God! Is there nothing you people can't do?

166
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,923
- I mean, other than manual labour.
- Peter! What a ridiculous thing to say.

167
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,320
They built the pyramids. You'll have to
excuse Peter. He can be tactless sometimes.

168
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,142
Like when he soiled himself
at that dinner party.

169
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,149
I was so sorry to hear
that your father passed away.

170
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:15,378
Yes. It spread through his body so fast,
but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...

171
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,396
Uh-oh!

172
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:23,329
Well, there's only one thing that'll top
a great dinner like that... Operation!

173
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:26,617
- May I play?
- Mom!

174
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:30,371
Thank you, but I can't stay.
It's Friday. I've gotta go to Temple.

175
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,808
Temple? Like Indiana Jones?

176
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,410
Will you just pick it up already?!

177
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:57,694
They better not be expecting money. I gave at
church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.

178
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,730
Peter! Max, it was nice of you
to invite us along.

179
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:04,654
Your husband's got a good heart
but his views on Judaism are misguided.

180
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,016
I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate him.

181
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:14,207
No, no! No, no, I don't think so.

182
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:18,106
It's not that I have ideological differences,
I'm just not a hat person.

183
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:21,469
Hey, I didn't know the principal
of Meg's school was Jewish.

184
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,831
Hey, there's Bill Nye the Science Guy.
And half of Lenny Kravitz.

185
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,311
Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?!

186
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:38,076
Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to
Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.

187
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,190
Ah, what the hell.

188
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:46,015
Oh dear. Sister Mary Joseph, it appears
Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.

189
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,316
Lock and load, Brides of Christ!

190
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,335
Excellent, excellent.

191
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,241
- Hello.
- Oh, we're not Jewish.

192
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,560
But I hear you people
have such lovely services.

193
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,997
Oh, my God, I didn't mean "you people", I...

194
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,882
I-I didn't mean "Oh, my God" either.

195
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,797
I know he's your God too.

196
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,217
Shh.

197
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:23,673
And on this day, the Sabbath,
we gather here to...

198
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,761
Uh-oh!

199
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:32,732
Well, that was so nice.
A good sermon and such beautiful songs.

200
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,433
Yeah, just like that other
Jewish musical we saw.

201
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:41,686
A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no?

202
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:46,793
But here in our little village of Anatevka,
you might say each one of us...

203
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,271
Khan!

204
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,970
Kha-a-a-an!

205
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:58,307
- There's my cab. It was nice meeting you.
- Thanks for everything, buddy.

206
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:01,782
Mr Weinstein, I thought you were gonna
help me with my homework.

207
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:05,123
Sorry, son, I have to go.
But I'm sure you'll do just fine.

208
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,060
I dunno, Max. The kid's not exactly
an honour-roll student. Watch.

209
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,123
- Hey.
- He did it.

210
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,900
See?

211
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:16,634
Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came
to Temple with me. You're a nice family.

212
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,935
I have faith that Chris will
grow up to be a real mensch.

213
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:28,218
Lois, I just figured out how to make sure
Chris becomes a big success.

214
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,211
Tell me this has nothing
to do with Tony Robbins.

215
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,930
No, I learned my lesson.

216
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,999
- Could you sign this book, please?
- Tony Robbins hungry!

217
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:43,711
No, Lois. I'm gonna make Chris Jewish.

218
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,744
- What are you talkin' about?
- He thinks Chris will become smart.

219
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:51,711
You can't convert someone
because you think it'll help their grades.

220
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:54,774
I don't wanna hear another word about this.

221
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:08,292
- Where are we going?
- Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl.

222
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:13,354
But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna
go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!

223
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,760
OK!

224
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,001
Chris, duck.

225
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,138
Mr Griffin, I still don't understand.

226
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,549
Why exactly does your son
want to join the Jewish faith?

227
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,790
I dunno, he's bicurious.

228
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:39,576
I appreciate your interest,
but Judaism takes a serious commitment.

229
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:43,538
Elliot here has spent years preparing
for his Bar Mitzvah this Saturday.

230
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,401
A Bar Mitzvah! Perfect!
How much for one of those?

231
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:50,512
You can't just buy a Bar Mitzvah.
It requires a lot of study.

232
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:56,384
Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study
he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?

233
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,787
Right?

234
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,865
Right?

235
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:09,283
Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah.
I'm OK just the way I...

236
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,954
Ow! Ow! Ow!

237
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:14,823
Now, we got no time to lose.
There's gotta be some place in America

238
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:18,985
where you can take a spiritual ceremony
that begins a lifetime commitment

239
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,256
and blow through it in about 20 minutes.

240
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,863
All right, Dad!

241
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,270
So, how do I look in my new glasses?

242
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:45,864
How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere
there's a portrait of you getting prettier.

243
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:50,161
Wow, someone needs a nap.
After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.

244
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,036
This isn't the first time
my wit has gone unappreciated.

245
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:59,595
And in the comedy competition,
Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars.

246
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:03,126
Challenger Sinbad receives... four stars!

247
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,367
We have a new champion - Sinbad!

248
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Stewie, any parting words?

249
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,428
Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple.

250
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,665
You-you are a very funny man.

251
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:19,811
"Men be acting all like zombies at the mall. "

252
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,252
God, ain't that the truth?

253
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,159
Where's your father and Chris?
It's not like them to be late for lunch.

254
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,613
I think they left a note.

255
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,621
- What do you know about this?
- Nothing.

256
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:47,324
- I know when you're lying to me, Brian.
- No, no, I swear.

257
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,982
Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

258
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:55,257
- What-what-what are you doing?
- Oh, you don't know that either?

259
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,580
Last chance, Brian.

260
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,763
Agh! They're in Vegas
gettin' a quickie Bar Mitzvah.

261
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:07,774
What?!

262
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,598
Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.

263
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:17,056
Quick, I need to borrow your car.
I've got a Bar Mitzvah to stop.

264
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:19,702
No problem. Let me grab my keys.

265
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,944
Ah. Here they are.

266
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,589
Aw, Chris. In a few minutes you'll become
a smart, successful Jewish man.

267
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,786
I could make a foreskin joke
but this is a solemn occasion.

268
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:02,114
Besides, there'll be plenty of time
for that on the ride back.

269
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:06,551
Oh, I got so many of 'em, too.
I know, I know. "Shh. " But later...

270
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,036
Chris!

271
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,464
Chris!

272
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:36,467
- Stop this travesty right now.
- So Bar Mitzvahs are travesties, huh?

273
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:39,864
No. My son getting
Bar Mitzvahed is a travesty.

274
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:42,101
He's doin' it for all the wrong reasons.

275
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,490
Well, lookee here, Herschel.

276
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:47,589
We got us one o' them self-hatin' Jews.

277
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:51,717
Nothin' I hate worse than a Jew who
doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage.

278
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:56,189
Come on, Mordecai, let's get her.

279
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:17,245
I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son
to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.

280
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:21,037
Then his wife wouldn't be sorry
she didn't marry the chimp next door.

281
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:26,187
Peter, just because Steven makes more
money than you doesn't mean he's smarter.

282
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:29,305
- And I think Chris will do just fine.
- How do you know?

283
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,330
Because I have faith in him,
the way I have faith in you.

284
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:36,696
Besides, a person's religion
is no guarantee of success.

285
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:41,533
I see what you're saying. The Jewish
are just like us. No better, no worse.

286
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:45,235
Yeah, and as they say, "zo Zion met grec".

287
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,080
- What?
- I think what he's trying to say is

288
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,600
everything's gonna be OK.

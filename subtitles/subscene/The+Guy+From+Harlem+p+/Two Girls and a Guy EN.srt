1
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:14,402
You got a problem?

2
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,404
Me? No I ain't got no problem.

3
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,565
Come on, take a good look, do I look like I
have a problem?

4
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,405
Looks to me you have like 350 problems.

5
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,412
Yeah, well you better get your eyes checked, cause I ain't
got no problems, okay.

6
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:27,483
As a matter of fact, around here I am the one
that makes the problems.

7
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,419
-Oh, I am scared!
-I am just standing here checking you babes out.

8
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:35,480
Why don't you go to the supermarket and check yourself out first, huh?

9
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,926
Ooh, you are a tough little cookie,
I like that.

10
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,590
You know what, one smack should straight you right up;
how about that?

11
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:45,497
Oh yeah, and who is gonna do the smacking?
You and what militia?

12
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:48,603
-Listen, you stuck up little bitch.
-No, you listen, dickface.

13
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:51,936
My boyfriend is gonna be here any second and if you're still
here when he comes, you're gonna run

14
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,443
as fast as you can, and only then, it will be too late.

15
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,378
-You're such a tiger! I love it.
-Fuck you and your pink shirt.

16
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,781
-Hey, asshole.
-Carol, what are you doing here?

17
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:05,377
-I thought you were going to the tanning.
-I was...I just...I am

18
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,389
were you...are you...just

19
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,550
giving these tourists directions.

20
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,391
-Come on, baby, you know I love you.
-Directions to tourists, my ass.

21
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:15,328
Those girls don't mean anything to me.

22
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,400
Damn weasel.

23
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,402
-Men, am I right or wrong?
-They serve their purpose.

24
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:23,405
I am not complaining, I got the greatest boyfriend in the whole
world.

25
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:27,409
But the way I look at it, most guys are more like that jerk
than they are like my boyfriend.

26
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,911
By the way,
my name's Lou, short for Louise.

27
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:33,414
My father wanted boys, so he made everyone
call me Lou and the name just kind of stuck.

28
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,246
-What's yours?
-Carla.

29
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,819
-Are you kidding?
-No.

30
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,421
My best friend in the third grade was named Carla,
Carla Naxenhoff.

31
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,424
-What's your last name?
-Bennett.

32
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,427
-Bennett, great name, Bennett.
-It's English.

33
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,497
I've been to London before, twice actually.

34
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:51,429
Once to dance and once with my boyfriend, just for two days.
He was giving a concert.

35
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,369
That's actually why I am here, my boyfriend lives in this building.
Do you got a boyfriend?

36
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:56,871
-Sort of.
-What does he do?

37
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,339
-He's an actor.
-Get out! Like mine.

38
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:02,537
I thought that yours is a musician. You said he did a concert in London?

39
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:05,547
Not that kind of concert.
More like mixed media.

40
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:08,777
He sings, he dances, he acts, he does stand ups.

41
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:12,216
He is a real entertainer,
like Liza Minelli.

42
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,381
-So what do you do?
-Design.

43
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,892
-Female Calvin Klein, huh?
-Well, we're in the same field... but I'm not...

44
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:21,452
You're not nearly as famous, I know.
I am gonna be famous one day, I just know it.

45
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:25,396
My boyfriend promised me, as soon as he makes it.

46
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,197
He's gonna cast me as his co-star because we're so good together.

47
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:30,899
But you never know, I may make it first, and then I'll have to cast him as my co-star,

48
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:32,804
...if I'm in the mood.
Just kidding.

49
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,411
He is actually really talented, and I am not just saying that.

50
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,003
He has a way with words.

51
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,083
He can talk you into buying a house without a roof.

52
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,910
-Sounds irresistible.
-That's what he is. He is irresistible.

53
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,714
People cannot resist him.

54
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,413
You know, I bet you've seen him on TV.

55
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:49,424
He's had guest spots on "N.Y.P.D. Blue",
in "Homicide"...

56
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:52,654
and he did the Gary Shandling show twice.
He was totally hilarious.

57
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,930
And he wrote personally to
Barry Levinson and Don Simpson.

58
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:57,659
And Simpson was gonna give him a lead...

59
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:00,931
in this romantic comedy that his production company was gonna do,

60
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,100
but then he died.

61
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,443
Are you okay?

62
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:18,613
Blake Allan.

63
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,458
Yeah, that is his name.

64
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,460
Who are you?

65
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,622
His girlfriend.

66
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,627
I am his girlfriend.

67
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,968
I am his girlfriend.

68
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,313
American Airlines, flight 11.

69
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:50,820
Right.

70
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:57,584
So you mean you came here to surprise him, too?

71
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:05,435
Oh my God!

72
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:15,536
Looks like he's giving us a lot bigger surprise

73
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:18,273
than either one of us was planning on giving him.

74
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,612
Just one minute.

75
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,401
I'll buzz you in.

76
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:12,747
Welcome home.

77
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,361
You don’t know me, no wonder it's his favorite song.

78
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,866
It should be his anthem.

79
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,436
Notice anything different?

80
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,368
That's where my picture used to be.

81
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,203
It still is.

82
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:36,445
-It is?
-When you're here.

83
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:39,547
Did he ever tell you that's the first time he put anyone's picture

84
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,378
on his piano besides his mother?

85
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:44,885
Yes, because he said it made him feel like I was physically with him.

86
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,456
In front of him and inside of him at the same time.

87
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:51,392
Maybe we should wreck his whole fucking apartment right now.

88
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:53,121
I'd rather wreck him.

89
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:57,455
Yeah that's a really good idea, but how? Should we stab him?

90
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:58,964
Too quick.

91
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,636
Asshole.

92
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:02,336
Creep.

93
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,463
Scumbag.

94
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:04,970
Did you really love him?

95
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:06,805
Yeah, I did.

96
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,477
Did you?

97
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:10,407
I told him I did, and I thought I meant it.

98
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,413
Who knows? I felt something.

99
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:14,449
-Emotional?
-More.

100
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,449
More?

101
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,043
More than I felt for anyone else, different.

102
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,418
-Which is what he said...
-...that you were different?

103
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,921
He never experienced real love before he met me.
Before me, love was

104
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,585
just another four letter word.

105
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:28,323
Beginning with L, no more significant than like or lust.

106
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,362
Then he would shake his head like this.

107
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,334
Shows how helpless he was about his work with his overwhelming passion.

108
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:37,438
-And when he'll go inside of you it's like...
-Returning home to his sanity, his refuge.

109
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,270
-Perfect rhythm.
-Perfect rhythm and harmony.

110
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,936
Atomic union or something...

111
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:47,380
The union of atomic matter, the matter returning to its pure state after temporary separation of time and space.

112
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:48,781
How do you remember all that?

113
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:51,945
Easily. He said it about 100 times as if it were a mantra.

114
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,613
Did he ever asked you to marry him?

115
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,714
-No, why, he asked you?
-No.

116
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,893
-Why you ask?
-Just curious.

117
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:01,395
Just trying to understand his twisted mind.

118
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,829
I think his thing for me was more sexual.

119
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,402
Although he did say he felt romantic towards me.

120
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:08,971
He told you he loved you?

121
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:12,399
Yeah, he said:
"I love you and you love me"...

122
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,343
because he couldn’t stand it if he said I love you, and didn’t say it back.

123
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,971
It is crazy. Even now I shouldn’t care

124
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:23,314
-what he said or did...
-It still hurts, I know. It hurts me, too.

125
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,353
I feel like this is somehow a dream that I am gonna wake up from.

126
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:27,423
So do I.

127
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:30,254
-How long did you know him?
-Ten months, how about you?

128
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,521
-February 15.
-I don’t remember the date,

129
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,996
but it was definitely snowing. So it must have been February,

130
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:40,435
and everything started off real slow. And then he got really intense all of a sudden

131
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:42,437
-and he told me...
-He was yours and you were his...

132
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,667
and neither one of you is ever gonna be with anyone else ever again.
That was in March.

133
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,841
Yeah, March, right,
because he said it to me

134
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:53,279
at halftime at the NCAA semi-finals.

135
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:55,374
Un-fucking-believable.
He knew it from the beginning.

136
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:58,318
-Knew what? Knew what he wanted?
-He knew what he was up to.

137
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,616
It's not like he knew one of us for years or even months,

138
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:03,624
and then the other one came in his life and made it complicated.

139
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:07,224
He decided consciously to take a shot with 2 girls at the same time.

140
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,457
He wanted a girlfriend. He wanted to fill the void.

141
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,635
And so he figured if one of us didn’t work out then the other might.

142
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:15,896
What he didn’t count on was that the both of us would work out.

143
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,404
-But we did.
-Until now.

144
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,065
It is gonna be neither.

145
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,343
But you don’t think he was looking to have two permanently,

146
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,972
-like those what do you call it?
-Bigamists?

147
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,975
-No, those ones in Utah.
-Mormons?

148
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:31,479
Yes: Mormons.

149
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,413
Do you think he is a Mormon?

150
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:36,424
-He is no Mormon.
-He sure is a cocksucker.

151
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,494
No, I think that was our function.

152
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,424
Oh you did that with him?

153
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,327
-What?
-Give him head?

154
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,329
Why, does that shock you?

155
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,435
No, it is just that...
do you know what he used to tell me?

156
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:50,267
All the way from Houston he said it to me on the phone last night.

157
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:55,276
He said that he couldn’t even get a hard on for any girl besides me no matter how good she was or what she did.

158
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:57,278
-And you believed him.
-I believed him.

159
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,439
Isn’t that pathetic? I am as pathetic as that asshole on the street.

160
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:05,283
-Would you have believed him?
-Not would, but did.

161
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,456
-He said the same things to you?
-Word for word.

162
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:11,218
And if that wasn’t his big faith in you.
He said it was a matter of choice.

163
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:12,885
Without you he is incapacitated.

164
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:16,397
-He would be impotent with anybody else.
-Because I owned his dick, it didn’t belong to him.

165
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,399
-It was attached to him.
-But it belongs to me.

166
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:22,403
Huge and hard, thick and long and perpendicular to the Earth, not to the floor but the Earth,

167
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,406
-and filled with oceans...
-Oceans of cum.

168
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,408
Oh my god. I am gonna fucking cut it off.

169
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,911
I am gonna slice it off,
sliver by sliver

170
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,312
with an electric meat slicer.

171
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:34,983
That is what I’m gonna do.

172
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,313
-That motherfucker.
-You said it.

173
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,488
-What?
-That's what he is: a motherfucker.

174
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,493
You think he did it with his mother?

175
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,356
Not literally, but I think his relationship with his mother

176
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,431
is more complicated than he admits to.

177
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,433
Definitely.
I mean who else has framed photographs

178
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:54,435
of their mother all over their apartment?

179
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,937
And the way he used her in stories he would tell,

180
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,873
like when he was little.
No father around.

181
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,945
"Mother and I went to Florida, went to Atlantic City."

182
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:06,109
"Mom and I had an argument over me having a ponytail."

183
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,285
-Right.
-And the way he used her with us.

184
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:12,318
-No, not with me, I never met her.
-I never met her either.

185
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:15,448
But the way he used her, saying he is spending the night at her house because she's sick.

186
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,222
-You don’t think she was sick?
-Well, who knows?

187
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,321
All we knew is that he can't call her because the ringing sound would frighten her...

188
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:26,232
Exactly. "Just leave a message on the voicemail if anything urgent came up".

189
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,305
4 nights a week; Those were the nights he must have been with you.

190
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,906
No I was always three,
never 4, you must have been 4.

191
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,476
No, I was three also.

192
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,479
Well, do you think there is a third?

193
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:40,680
Or one night of cruising recruitment for the future.

194
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,320
Can you believe we fell for this?

195
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,818
You only suspect it when you're doing it yourself.

196
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:49,324
Interesting.

197
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:52,494
but you weren't fucking around on him, were you?

198
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,429
-No.
-Neither was I.

199
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:58,864
But I could have, I had plenty of chances.

200
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,697
Like that guy on the street in the white suit?

201
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,293
Much better than him.

202
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,431
I know that, I was just being vicious.

203
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:06,942
Right.

204
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:10,575
But you must had a million chances.

205
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,375
-You're beautiful, Carla.
-No, I am not.

206
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:13,710
Yes, you are.

207
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,215
Let me ask you something.

208
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,376
What if he is here?

209
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:17,453
Ok.

210
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,471
Mommy, it’s me. I’m back.

211
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,412
Little trouble getting back from the airport, but the plane got in on time.

212
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:53,482
I love you. I hope you are doing well.
Call me as soon as you get this. Bye.

213
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:12,362
Carla, it's Blake.
I just got back in town.

214
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:16,427
I am prepared to perforate your every orifice

215
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:20,306
with my tongue.
I miss you wildly.

216
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:24,038
I am hot. I got to see you. Bye.

217
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:34,615
Hi, who's there?

218
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,789
All right, well, just tell her

219
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:39,461
Blake is back.

220
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:41,463
Thank you.

221
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,405
Mark! It's Blake.

222
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,374
What is it, like 4:30 there? Get up.

223
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,083
So what happened with the job? Did you get it?

224
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:10,289
No? Why?
Too talented as usual?

225
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:14,352
What's going on?

226
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:20,363
So what else?
What about, like, anything?

227
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:27,431
Really? Wow. And that's in the Catskills?

228
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:31,938
God, I actually don’t know anyone who made it in the Catskills.

229
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,939
What are they paying there?

230
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:38,048
Wow, that will cover the dry-cleaning.

231
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:42,050
What about like a TV spot or something?

232
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:46,393
I cant even believe we are discussing this. This is ridiculous.

233
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:48,986
It's like you don’t know who you're dealing with here.

234
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,457
You've been jerking quite a bit there?

235
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,401
No, I’m just kidding.

236
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,403
Hold on. Let me think about it for a second.

237
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,775
Call me daddy,
call me daddy.

238
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:05,335
Bend over and then squeal like the pig that you are

239
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,416
for offering me this job.

240
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:09,408
No, I'll take it.

241
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:11,444
When do I start?

242
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,754
Ok, thanks, bye.

243
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,270
Hi.

244
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:29,938
Yes.

245
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,443
Live, from "La Paz"...

246
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:40,438
it is "Blanco Allegra".

247
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,460
You give your hand to me...

248
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:57,398
and then you say hello.

249
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,470
And I can hardly speak.

250
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,465
My heart is beating so.

251
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:10,475
And anyone can tell

252
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,882
you think you know.

253
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:22,484
No, you don’t know me.

254
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,330
No, you don’t know the one

255
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:33,490
who dreams of you at night.

256
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,499
Honey, I let my chance go by.

257
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:47,505
And the chance you might have loved me, too.

258
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:58,459
You give your hand to me

259
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:02,464
and then you say goodbye.

260
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,468
I watch you walk away...

261
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,443
What a surprising way to see you!

262
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:52,446
I was just... my god!

263
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,781
I was just thinking when am I gonna see you? And here you are.

264
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,388
How did you get in?

265
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:00,614
Magic.

266
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,357
Did the super let you in?

267
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,788
You look great...fuck!

268
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:09,464
Okay.

269
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,900
You know what's so great?
I could have not orchestrated this any better.

270
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,904
This is a rare opportunity. You get to see how I am behaving

271
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,200
when you are not here.

272
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:20,400
What did I do? I came in

273
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,409
I sit down, and I call you. The first thing I do is tell you I love you,

274
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,911
I miss you,
I wanna lick you, I can't wait to see you.

275
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,346
Got up, I’m inspired thinking I’m gonna see you...

276
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,477
I sit down, I play, I sing.
How the fuck did you get in here?

277
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:41,496
Wow, you've never looked this phenomenal.

278
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,658
Did I give you a key?
I did, right?

279
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:48,492
I am just so happy to see you. I really am. In this two weeks,

280
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,438
I forgotten how beautiful you are, and I missed you.

281
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,371
Did you miss me as much as I missed you?

282
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:57,378
-How much did you miss me?
-Pretty madly, like a psychotic.

283
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,382
-Why do you think I was calling you 40 times a day?
-Needed to check up on me?

284
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,882
What? What kind of crazy statement is that? Why do I need to check up on you?

285
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:08,889
-To see what I was up to.
-What are you talking about?

286
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,653
What do you suspect I would be up to?

287
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:15,388
This conversation is getting real strange.

288
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:16,965
What is going on?

289
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,457
What is going on?

290
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,400
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

291
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:23,563
Then why are you using words like suspect me?
Like I would suspect you of something.

292
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,936
-And you don’t?
-No. Suspect you of what?

293
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,908
Suspect you of anything, why?
Why would I?

294
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:32,412
-Never would I have thought you've done something wrong.
-You don’t think that?

295
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:35,916
-No, why would I?
-I don’t know. What you might think is wrong

296
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:38,486
for me, I might think it's right
and vice versa.

297
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:41,990
What are you trying to tell me?

298
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:43,089
About what?

299
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,159
About you.

300
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:45,494
Nothing.

301
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,429
Did you fuck anybody?

302
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:58,204
When?

303
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,434
Whenever.

304
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,102
Ever?

305
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:04,309
Well, yes.

306
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,382
I mean, I seem to recall you and I have shared a little fucking.

307
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:10,543
-Making love, come on.
-Making love, is that what you wanna call it?

308
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:13,383
That's what I call it, that's what it is to me when I was with you.

309
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:15,548
-As opposed to what?
-As opposed to nothing.

310
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,888
What are you driving at?
Come on.

311
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:20,461
How many girls did you fuck while you were in L.A?

312
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:23,965
When I was in L.A?
That's the last two weeks. None.

313
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,333
Cause I haven’t been with any other women since I was with you.

314
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:28,630
That's the last ten months.

315
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,330
-You don’t have to say that.
-I know I don’t have to say that, I am just saying that because it's the truth.

316
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:33,533
I mean we're not married.

317
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,906
You are a free man, you can do it whatever you want. It's okay if you have.

318
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:38,411
I don’t want to. Do you?

319
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:41,414
No.

320
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:42,484
Well.

321
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:47,422
-With anyone, you don’t want to?
-With anyone but you.

322
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,423
-Okay whatever you say.
-Whatever.

323
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:53,427
This is got to be the most bizarre exchange

324
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,928
I’ve ever experienced in my life.

325
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,430
Did you take acid?

326
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,294
Did you, are you?

327
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:03,371
I was trying to figure out some explanation

328
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:07,272
for this Jekyll and Hyde behavior that you're exhibiting.

329
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,534
I am scared.

330
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:09,611
I don’t...

331
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:17,452
Look.

332
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:21,956
What's this?

333
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,620
What's there?

334
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,624
It looks like a broken window and a plant.

335
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,561
Yeah, I know it's a plant and a broken window, but the question is how did the window got broken?

336
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:39,064
It looks like the plant might have done it.

337
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:42,302
Yeah, but I don’t think that the plant just came through the window on its own.

338
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,571
Did you throw the plant to the window?

339
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:48,809
Did you do this to the window?

340
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:52,654
Maybe.

341
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,489
Maybe.

342
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,949
Maybe?

343
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,354
Maybe?

344
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:03,932
Maybe.

345
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:09,426
Have you gone completely and utterly out of your mind?

346
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:13,202
Are you glad I came by to surprise you?

347
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:16,209
Yeah, I am glad. I would be gladder if you met me in the airport or outside.

348
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,541
I can't believe that you threw this plant through this window.

349
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:22,549
I can't believe you're getting more upset about this window...

350
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:24,312
Than what?

351
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,388
Then about your protestations
of fidelity.

352
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:28,888
They are not protestations.

353
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:30,959
They are outright denials.

354
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:34,318
It's beyond desires, it's beyond choice.
It's phallic incapacity

355
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,398
It's an inoperative shaft.

356
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:39,228
I am telling you, if you would put a gun to my head

357
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:42,326
and say, "Fuck her, she's gorgeous, she needs you, it's easy, no one will know.

358
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:45,407
I'll say, "Pull it, pull the trigger, empty the chamber into my head,

359
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:48,237
because that's where it's at with me.

360
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:50,402
It's not my dick anymore. It is attached to me, yeah, but it belongs to you.

361
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:54,243
I am taking it a step further, I am telling you that, at this point with you,

362
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,841
because I am so attached to you, that every other girl on Earth is not exciting to me, in the slightest.

363
00:26:57,953 --> 00:27:00,353
Every other girl on Earth to me it's like slime.

364
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:03,357
It is like something that came from under a fucking rock.

365
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,188
It is disgusting to me!

366
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:07,194
It is like smelling cheese.

367
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,854
It makes me fucking sick.

368
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:10,363
It disgusts me!

369
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:12,400
It is like smelling vomit.

370
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:17,939
Including me?

371
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,444
Wow! This is a shock!

372
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,411
This is a surprise!

373
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,447
This is a massive shadow of shock.

374
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:30,315
I must say, it is difficult that either one of you is gonna believe me this moment,

375
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,887
-but there is absolutely a legitimate explanation for this.
-What is it?

376
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,387
He doesn’t have an explanation.

377
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,550
Just answer me one question,
in what way am I physically disgusting?

378
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,388
-No way.
-You just said I was.

379
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,395
-When?
-When? 30 seconds ago.

380
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:44,398
-I didn’t say...
-You just said that every girl you met since Carla...

381
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,401
-was physically disgusting to you.
-It was a figure of speech.

382
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,404
-Stop lying, asshole.
-I am not lying.

383
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:53,407
Not lying? Everything you have said to the both of us in the past ten months

384
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:56,342
-has been a total utter-fucking lie.
-Can I say one thing?

385
00:27:56,445 --> 00:28:00,245
And this is not some self-serving jargon in an attempt to get myself out of the moment.

386
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:03,350
I even hide little tiny parts of my life from both of you to avoid causing pain.

387
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:06,353
-Fuck you!
-I never said anything...

388
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,185
-that I didn’t wholeheartedly mean.
-Fuck you.

389
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,759
If you actually believe what you just said, it's worse than if you don’t.

390
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:16,363
-I don’t follow that at all.
-Oh, what a big surprise!

391
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:18,296
What, you know what she just meant by that?

392
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,359
-Yeah, I understood perfectly what she said.
-Well, go ahead, explain it to me.

393
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:24,302
You know what, I don’t have to tell you anything.

394
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:28,001
You're just lucky you don’t have a kitchen knife sticking through your Adam's apple right about now.

395
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,010
-Carla...
-I prefer you don’t use my name.

396
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,411
What do you want me to call you? Timmy?

397
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:34,448
I don’t wanna hear your voice at all right now.

398
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:38,445
Absolutely, excuse me. I gotta get that.

399
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:42,589
Hi, mom.

400
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,589
Mom?

401
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:44,659
Hi.

402
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:48,396
Yeah, it was good.

403
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:52,399
I didn’t get it, but I got this other thing in the Catskills that's gonna be real good.

404
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:54,799
Can I call you back in ten minutes? Thanks.

405
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:58,397
Ten minutes, okay?
Bye, mom.

406
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,837
-So there is a third.
-Third what?

407
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:02,740
-Third girlfriend.
-That's absurd.

408
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:06,346
You used your mother with me to get with Carla.
You used your mother with Carla to get with me.

409
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:10,509
And now, you're using your mother with both of us, to get with whoever it is you're planning on going out with tonight.

410
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,348
No, you don’t understand.

411
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:15,355
No, actually we didn’t understand.

412
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,015
Now we do understand.

413
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,285
We understand everything.

414
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,190
Everything except how...

415
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:22,354
it would be if you stopped lying.

416
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:23,590
You were caught.

417
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:26,867
Stop and try to explain.

418
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,527
-He cant.
-Let him try.

419
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:29,604
Go ahead.

420
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:33,202
-My mom is...
-Your mother is your excuse,

421
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:35,367
if she even exists.
Who knows?

422
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,444
You know what this is?

423
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:39,380
This is reality

424
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:43,375
I am devastated by this.

425
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:45,680
No you're not;
you're just exposed.

426
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:49,883
what do you have to be devastated about?
You didn’t find out it was someone you trusted and betrayed you.

427
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:51,323
I know, but...

428
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:52,552
You know what?

429
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:55,391
Nothing you say means fucking shit anyway,

430
00:29:55,497 --> 00:30:00,457
because you're a lying, cheating manipulating motherfucker.

431
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,564
You know what I think? That is really abusive.

432
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:10,407
I don’t think you understand, how it causes me pain to hurt people I care about.

433
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:12,343
-Care about?
-Yes, care about. I like to cause pain

434
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:14,415
-to people that I hate.
-Care about?

435
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,313
What happened to love?

436
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,487
I thought you loved me.

437
00:30:20,455 --> 00:30:21,479
I really did.

438
00:30:22,491 --> 00:30:24,322
And Carla thought you loved her.

439
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,424
I did.

440
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,154
And I do.

441
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,429
I really... I do.

442
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:30,828
Me or her?

443
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,758
Both of you.

444
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:33,835
Both!

445
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:35,594
Both is very convenient.

446
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:38,264
Both is really convenient.

447
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,671
What about only?
You said only.

448
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:46,344
Look, I fucked up here.

449
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,683
-I was...
-You were greedy and selfish.

450
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:50,882
-I was wrong.
-Coward.

451
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,851
A greedy selfish coward.

452
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,468
You know what?

453
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,637
I’m gonna...

454
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:13,566
Please, stop pursuing me and phoning...

455
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,336
I cant, I cant.

456
00:31:15,444 --> 00:31:18,641
I think that I understand where you're coming from.

457
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:21,244
And I was there and I have been straight with you

458
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,409
this whole entire...

459
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:26,419
You know this was the form that was appropriate to you.

460
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,421
If you have to confront me.

461
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:36,494
I don’t think that there is anything for me now.

462
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,329
I can't, because,

463
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,503
this isn’t, this isn’t...

464
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,132
and both at the same... that wasn’t nice.

465
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,501
That wasn’t right.

466
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:49,510
I was...

467
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:52,513
no way.

468
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:55,347
No, cause I know if I...

469
00:31:56,985 --> 00:31:59,249
I think it is abusive.

470
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,614
I don’t think...

471
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:01,956
Yeah.

472
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:03,618
I know, I know.

473
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:08,453
I gotta do it...for me.

474
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:11,456
For me, it is not like there was...

475
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:13,960
another.

476
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:18,465
This was not supposed to happen.

477
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:21,400
This is

478
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:23,637
misery.

479
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,109
This, to me, is misery.

480
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:12,619
Oh my god!

481
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:26,906
Okay, fine.

482
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,635
He's about as dead as we are.

483
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:30,973
Listen, I am about to teach a little something.

484
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,472
You fucking asshole,
how could you do that?

485
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:37,415
You know how that feels,
you fucker?

486
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,420
-Pretending like you are dead, that's sadistic.
-I have a point to make.

487
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:43,252
I am not interested in your point.

488
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,323
I am interested in why you are a sick, compulsive liar.

489
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,986
You are caught in a sewer of lies and deception

490
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:51,292
and your response is a lie.

491
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:55,268
You're right.
This is kind of fucked up. I am an actor...

492
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,861
-and actors lie.
-It gets worse and worse.

493
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,941
I am not trying to excuse it, I am just...

494
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:04,138
A lot of actors don’t lie. There's a lot of actors who play killers...

495
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:06,874
but they do not kill people when they are not acting.

496
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:09,815
Not good actors. Name me one good actor who doesn’t lie.

497
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,385
This is beyond belief,
even for you.

498
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:15,217
Okay. Denzel Washington.

499
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,958
-He doesn’t lie.
-Now how do you know that?

500
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,391
Because I just do, he like oozes honesty and integrity.

501
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:23,396
Yes, Denzel Washington
is a good actor.

502
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:26,228
A good actor persuades you of one reality and he lives another.

503
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:28,393
Come on, Blake, are you gonna tell me that
Denzel Washington...

504
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,403
Isn’t the most coolest around?

505
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:33,338
-I don’t know, do you know Denzel Washington personally?
-No, do you?

506
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,409
Yeah, I’ve seen him around in parties and other.

507
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,412
Really? You and Denzel
Washington had auditions together?

508
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:42,483
-Yeah.
-The two of you, like for a big director or something?

509
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:46,980
I mean, I don’t think Denzel fucking Washington auditions.

510
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:51,414
Do you? He is a huge fucking movie star, unlike yourself.

511
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:54,427
I saw him at "Gray's Papaya" like 2 weeks ago.

512
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,724
And I think I got a pretty firm hitch.

513
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:00,358
I am not talking about Denzel Washington as an individual,
I am talking generically.

514
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:03,301
I am talking about the art of acting,
the nature...

515
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,532
the life experience of me as an actor.

516
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,303
So your point is that it's okay for you to lie and live a double life...

517
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,038
-because you're an actor?
-What I'm saying

518
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:12,909
is that the two are connected.

519
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,972
If I was like a supreme court justice,

520
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:19,315
you would expect a little on the nose straight ahead answer.

521
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:22,322
But as an actor I think that I am granted a little leeway.

522
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:25,222
So, this makes it our fault? We should know that you're a liar and a double dealer?

523
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,453
Clarence Thompson.

524
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,396
Who the fuck is
Clarence Thompson?

525
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:33,626
the supreme court justice who lied about Anita Hill, duh.

526
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:36,470
Thomas.

527
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:40,406
-Thomas, who?
-Clarence Thomas.

528
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:43,409
And there is no proof that he lied about anything actually.

529
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:47,914
Oh really, you think that Anita Hill made up the whole Coke thing?

530
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:50,416
Are you intentionally missing my point?

531
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:53,578
No, I am not, you said that you're not a supreme court justice

532
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,417
and I said that
Clarence Thompson

533
00:35:55,523 --> 00:36:00,358
is exactly the same lying cheating pathetic fucking fool as you are.

534
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:03,363
Okay! Stop it both of you, you are letting him sidetrack us...

535
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,365
from finding out why he is such a liar...

536
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,367
which is the only reason that I am still here.

537
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,596
That's a very good point, Carla.

538
00:36:10,138 --> 00:36:11,435
Why I am still here?

539
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:14,268
I am fucking out of here.

540
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:19,277
You treat two people that you claim to love with such contempt?

541
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,949
It wasn’t contempt.
That's the last thing it was.

542
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:24,452
It was love.

543
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,784
It was love.

544
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:28,717
Fuck you, Blake.

545
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,883
And fuck you up and down, in and out

546
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:35,224
front and rear, fuck you till you bleed and pus pours

547
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,958
out of your asshole.

548
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,400
You are a lying,
mugging

549
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:43,903
masochistic, unemployable,

550
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,802
short, loft inheriting,

551
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:48,171
piece of shit fraud.

552
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:51,370
And love, you have the audacity to use the word love?

553
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:54,971
You don’t know the meaning of the word love.
Fuck you!

554
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:58,248
I am short now too, huh?

555
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:00,921
I make it 5' 10".

556
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:03,355
Short.

557
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:04,425
Fraud.

558
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:11,194
You know, what do you want, to sell it?

559
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:14,435
Fine.

560
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:16,836
You enjoy it.

561
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:37,287
What is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?

562
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,587
This is what you want, this is how you wanna live the rest of your life?

563
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:43,459
Damaging people around you, damaging yourself?

564
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:45,625
Is it?

565
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,393
Really, is it? Because if it is,

566
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:53,396
why don’t you really fucking blow your brains out?

567
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:54,475
Really, right now,

568
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:05,352
that's not what you want. You need a commitment to shape your ass up

569
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:07,421
and stop bullshitting everyone.

570
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:11,414
Stop deceiving them and yourself, too.

571
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:14,361
You should promise me this right now.

572
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:18,592
A real promise.
The real deal now.

573
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:24,099
-All right, I promise.
-I can't fucking believe you.

574
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:26,435
I can't believe shit that you say,

575
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:31,369
but I’m gonna give you a chance.

576
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:36,382
This is your last chance

577
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:38,452
to fucking get your shit together.

578
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:32,432
I come in, and the second I walk in the door,

579
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:34,729
the ground floor, the door is open.

580
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:37,498
I look in there, and there's a body.

581
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,441
I don’t know. No, it's like the guy artist, Rex.

582
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:44,444
I don’t know if it's him.
I don’t know who it is.

583
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:46,013
I call the police.

584
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:51,444
They come over, and within 25 seconds of finding this body,

585
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,384
they call the coroners

586
00:40:53,488 --> 00:40:54,853
and they are grilling me, these detectives.

587
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,585
When you called me, they were relentless,

588
00:40:57,692 --> 00:41:00,126
like I did it or something.

589
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:03,726
And then, maybe because of the time of death of the body,

590
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:06,595
it was obvious that I couldn’t...

591
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,471
Stop. You are smoking right now. I can hear it.

592
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,304
You want some more?

593
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,307
I got too much already.

594
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,476
Pour me a little of yours.

595
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:23,484
Cheers.

596
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,489
I know you're smoking, you don’t have to tell me.

597
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,350
You can't.

598
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:38,489
Yeah but I know, it's not even like I can sometimes or whatever.

599
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,528
You have no idea I took you to the hospital.

600
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:55,675
That's enough.

601
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:01,447
One more.

602
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,014
We'll finish the bottle.

603
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:06,450
Mom?

604
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,454
Mom?

605
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:29,415
Did you throw away the cigarettes?

606
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,483
Well, mom you are destroying your voice.

607
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:35,648
No, I am serious.

608
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:38,424
Why are you talking so low?

609
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:44,123
You are wrecking your circulation.

610
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:48,434
You are strangling your circulation.

611
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:51,505
Mom, the cigarette is like a nail.

612
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,338
Well you just gotta stop. You want me to come over there, I'll come over there.

613
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:58,603
You think I could ever braid your hair?

614
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,614
If you want to, you can.

615
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:04,378
Because I still like to braid my hair, but right now I have short hair.

616
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:10,446
Well, call me if you need me, okay? I love you, bye.

617
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:15,462
Wow!

618
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:27,133
Hey Blake, you wanna braid Carla’s hair with me?

619
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:30,409
It could be fun.
We could braid our hair.

620
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:33,640
-You want the truth?
-No, we want another lie.

621
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,983
No, seriously. The truth.

622
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:39,248
-The truth.
-Look at him.

623
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:42,982
The very words "the truth is" make him draw a blank.

624
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:46,588
The truth is that I meant everything that I said to each of you

625
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:48,423
-at the time I was saying it.
-Bullshit!

626
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,362
-No, it was new to me.
-Oh, it was new to you!

627
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:55,425
The first time I ever felt love was simultaneously with both of you...

628
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:57,299
for the first time ever in my life,

629
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:01,774
and I was baffled.
It was very unsettling.

630
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:03,366
Poor you!

631
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:05,378
Poor fucking you.

632
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,880
I am not suggesting sympathy,

633
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:12,385
I am just trying to make some sense of this fiasco that I’ve created.

634
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,887
Obviously you made your point, which was very confusing and unsettling.

635
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,388
We discovered, as you put it,

636
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,619
that you were in love with two women at the same time, and?

637
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,087
And it was exciting,

638
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:25,022
if you wanna know the truth. It never occurred to me

639
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,294
at any point to give up either one of you.

640
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:29,062
Because both of you made me feel

641
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,933
phenomenal when I was with you.

642
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,973
I was under the impression that I am totally inspiring both of you.

643
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:37,570
So, as long as we don’t know about each other, then it's OK?

644
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:41,409
I am not saying it's okay, it was wrong.

645
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:45,247
But the rightness of it that I felt gave me a way of justifying...

646
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,412
a way of seeing it the way I wanna see it

647
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,319
so I can continue.

648
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,890
You are such a manipulator!

649
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:56,224
Manipulation? No it is not,
because it requires concealing, I am concealing nothing.

650
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,854
-Since when?
-Since now.

651
00:44:57,965 --> 00:45:00,627
I absolutely think you're lying. You're definitely concealing something.

652
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:03,295
-It is too easy.
-Yeah, it is too fucking easy.

653
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,429
-It is too fast.
-What am I concealing?

654
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:08,271
You mean I could be aware of it.

655
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:10,444
Lying comes like breathing to you.

656
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,111
Mom, hi, it's me. Listen, I’m sorry to call you back...

657
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:18,742
but your voice sounds really weird.

658
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,284
It is really low.

659
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,390
Why are you talking like that, mom?

660
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,289
I’m scared.

661
00:45:26,427 --> 00:45:29,453
I will call you right back.
I think it is the connection...

662
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,624
I will call you right back. Hold on.

663
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,301
Why is this funny to you?

664
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:39,803
I’ve been concerned.

665
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,637
Hi. Are you sure you okay?

666
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:49,316
I’m sorry, I just don’t understand why...

667
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:54,648
I know, but just let me...

668
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:57,855
OK, I am here and I am worried about you.

669
00:45:57,959 --> 00:45:59,426
If I don’t...

670
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:03,589
Okay, sorry.

671
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,366
She is upset with me.

672
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:10,198
There's something wrong with her voice. It's so strange.

673
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,864
Blake, how is it your mother has been sick

674
00:46:12,974 --> 00:46:15,442
for like 10 months?

675
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:21,438
That's what you have been saying, right?

676
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:25,452
-Yeah.
-If there is a real change in her voice,

677
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:27,043
you should call a doctor.

678
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:28,280
I know, I am going to call him.

679
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,051
Hi, Dr. Cutler, please.

680
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,365
Can you tell him that Blake Allan called? It is very important.

681
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:43,971
He has my number. Thank you.

682
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:04,424
What?

683
00:47:17,972 --> 00:47:20,440
So you're never gonna believe anything I say again?

684
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,933
I would be pretty stupid to, wouldn't I?

685
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,370
Haven’t you ever lied to anyone

686
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:29,210
and knowing what it had done, and felt horrible about it,

687
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:31,945
and knowing that you could never do it again?

688
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:35,785
Knowing it meant nothing, or knowing that they've gone ahead and done it anyway?

689
00:47:37,658 --> 00:47:39,956
I guess what I am asking is...

690
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:42,462
can you forgive me?

691
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:01,415
So, explain something to me.

692
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:06,412
Did it excite you to know that you were always in danger of being caught?

693
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:08,915
It must have.

694
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:10,924
It excited you.

695
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,358
-It had to.
-No.

696
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:17,363
Oh yes it did. You were exciting yourself by living a double life.

697
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:19,433
You were risking disaster.

698
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,294
Of course it excited you.

699
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:23,927
-If it did, I wasn’t aware of it.
-You were aware.

700
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:12,491
Where the fuck are you going?

701
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,942
-I have to make a call.
-What, I have a phone here.

702
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:15,349
It is private.

703
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:31,300
Why didn’t you go after her?

704
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:35,406
-She doesn’t want me to.
-But you would if she did.

705
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:37,432
It's ok, you can admit it.

706
00:54:37,544 --> 00:54:39,705
I understand perfectly why you are attracted to her.

707
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:43,408
She is great, she's beautiful, clever, she is a good person

708
00:54:43,517 --> 00:54:47,419
and she knows how to take care of herself. I mean what more can somebody want?

709
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:49,921
Nothing, but you have all those qualities, too.

710
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:53,424
No, I don’t and you know it.
I am not beautiful, I am cute.

711
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:56,428
I am not clever,
I am street wise.

712
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,363
I am not a very good person; I mean the only thing I am is self-sufficient.

713
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:04,869
-I do know how to take care of myself.
-And you are a good person, don’t say that about yourself.

714
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,065
-No, I am not.
-How can you say that?

715
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:09,369
How do you know?
You don’t even know me.

716
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:13,207
I thought I knew you better than anyone who'd ever known you.
I thought I knew you better than you knew yourself.

717
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,941
-That's what you said.
-No, that's what you said.

718
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:20,613
Maybe I did, maybe I said it because I knew that is what you wanted to hear.

719
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:24,389
The way everything you said to me was what you thought I wanted to hear.

720
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:26,959
Right up to just now, when you did it again.

721
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,291
Speaking of which,

722
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,760
I noticed that you didn’t correct me when I said that I was

723
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:34,390
cute instead of beautiful

724
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:37,368
and street-wise instead of clever.

725
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,644
You're thinking about Carla.

726
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:49,971
See, if you had been honest from the beginning,

727
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,979
things might have worked out a lot better for all three of us.

728
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:58,419
And much more interestingly.

729
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,086
How so?

730
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:04,329
Sometimes you underestimate people.

731
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:06,865
What do you mean? I underestimated you?

732
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:12,371
No, meaning that I might have been ready for certain things.

733
00:56:12,473 --> 00:56:13,531
Such as?

734
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,438
Such as a lot of things.

735
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:18,444
Such as?

736
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:23,275
Different things. And Carla might have been ready, too.

737
00:56:23,484 --> 00:56:26,453
-For what?
-You know what I'm talking about.

738
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:28,382
I know, I just want to hear you say it.

739
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,389
-I am sure you do.
-So?

740
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,391
Use your imagination.

741
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:33,425
So what you're saying is...

742
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:35,392
What I am saying is that you blew it.

743
00:56:35,496 --> 00:56:38,556
You didn’t have the confidence in yourself to believe that

744
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:40,394
you could get what you wanted with the truth.

745
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,401
What did I want that I didn’t get?

746
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:44,937
Half of what you just got in there.

747
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:47,404
-You mean double?
-Yeah right, double.

748
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:51,410
Like what, that I would have been with both of you together?

749
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:55,004
Like that was my secret desire and I was too timid to admit it.

750
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:58,243
Well, no.
I am not saying just sex.

751
00:56:58,352 --> 00:57:00,343
And I am not saying sex once.

752
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:01,853
What do you mean?

753
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,786
I am referring to

754
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,016
Mormonism.

755
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,351
Mormonism?

756
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:08,393
Mormonism.

757
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:10,292
I think you mean bigamy.

758
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:13,525
Yes, bigamy, right. But not about the whole gang marriage,

759
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:16,364
just more of us hanging out together,

760
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:20,372
and doing things together, just being together all the time.

761
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:23,204
More like a triple instead of a couple.

762
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,709
So that's what you would have wanted?

763
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:26,210
No, that's how you would have wanted it.

764
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:29,373
You just didn’t have the whatever to admit it.

765
00:57:29,483 --> 00:57:31,678
-And you think that's what Carla would want?
-Maybe.

766
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:34,310
I think that she would be open to it.

767
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:37,447
I think that we could convince her.

768
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:43,451
Excuse me.

769
00:57:49,436 --> 00:57:52,405
Hello? Hi, Dr. Cutler,
thanks for calling me back.

770
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:55,407
Listen I’ve talked to mom, like three, four,

771
00:57:55,509 --> 00:57:57,807
a bunch of times today and there is

772
00:57:57,945 --> 00:58:00,345
something in the level of her voice that's got me like frightened.

773
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:04,349
And I just want you, could you call her,
and call me back,

774
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,975
and tell me what I should do?

775
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:15,360
No, I am telling you, I know something is wrong.

776
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:20,263
I just want you to call her, call me back, and tell me what is to be done.

777
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,925
This is turning out to be a very strange day.

778
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:27,000
Everything is changing so fast.

779
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:30,372
Everything seems to be going from one extreme to another and back again,

780
00:58:30,477 --> 00:58:33,378
almost as if like, love and hate were interchangeable.

781
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,276
No I don’t mean interchangeable.
I mean inverted.

782
00:58:36,316 --> 00:58:38,614
Especially now
for us with him.

783
00:58:39,419 --> 00:58:42,320
I mean there is a part of me that feels like we could just tell him to fuck off

784
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:43,787
and never see him again.

785
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:46,789
But then I was also thinking that we could try something else.

786
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:50,452
Something new, modern
and kind of strange.

787
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:54,232
Like this famous poet.
Do you know what I am talking about?

788
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:57,326
Excuse me. Am I right in assuming that I am not wanted at this moment?

789
00:58:57,437 --> 00:58:59,337
-Yes.
-Or for longer than a moment.

790
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:00,906
Then I will vanish.

791
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:05,343
-So which famous poet?
-I can't remember his name,

792
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:08,346
but there was a biography the other night that I watched on cable.

793
00:59:08,448 --> 00:59:10,348
He had a wife and a mistress,

794
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:14,284
and they did everything together, and the women really got along.

795
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:17,255
They were attracted to each other, they respected each other

796
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,359
and there was no jealousy or possessiveness.

797
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:21,757
I mean, it was really very cool.

798
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:24,359
And I just cant remember his fucking name.

799
00:59:24,464 --> 00:59:25,931
D.H. Lawrence?

800
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:30,197
No. Wasn’t he the Lawrence of Arabia guy, wasn’t he gay?

801
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:32,294
No, that was T.E. Lawrence.

802
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,964
No, this guy had a weird name.

803
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,634
It sounded like a zz,
like Ezzard...

804
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,936
Ezra Pound.

805
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:40,438
Yes, Ezra Pound, that's it!

806
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:42,376
I thought you vanished.

807
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,382
What are you doing?

808
00:59:44,484 --> 00:59:46,452
I mean really,
what are you doing?

809
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:51,389
Are you trying to figure out how to make us forget?

810
00:59:51,491 --> 00:59:55,393
Are you searching for a new role to slip into because this old one doesn’t work?

811
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:59,226
Are you lost? Nervous?
You look nervous.

812
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,959
Are you practicing your act?

813
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:04,402
-I am a practicing actor.
-You are trying too hard.

814
01:00:04,504 --> 01:00:06,301
-I am a good actor.
-Right.

815
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:08,565
-I am not a hack.
-Oh really?

816
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:10,609
Obviously you have never seen my Hamlet

817
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:14,340
or you wouldn’t be parading me in this fashion, you'd have respect for me. You would.

818
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:17,244
You see that picture over there?
I am the melancholic Dane.

819
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:19,147
Did Hamlet lead a double life?

820
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:23,921
-So you want center stage?
-Yes.

821
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:25,491
Always trying to be loved.

822
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:26,917
OK.

823
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:31,659
Hamlet is upset with his mother, for many things.

824
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:36,265
Co-conspiring to kill his father, and also, owning his dick.

825
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:38,360
You could relate to that one.

826
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,440
No, but I can relate to how angry he is

827
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,440
and on how she controls his dick

828
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,474
OK.

829
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:45,306
It's coming.

830
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:49,515
"Ecstasy.

831
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:52,275
"My pulse, as yours,

832
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:55,377
doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music.

833
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,389
"It is not madness that I have uttered...

834
01:00:57,491 --> 01:01:00,892
bring me to the test, and I the matter will re-word;

01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:03,394
which madness, would gambol from...

836
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,625
Mother!

837
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:10,467
"For love of grace, lay not that flattering unction to your soul

838
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,470
"That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.

01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:18,910
"It will but skin and film the ulcerous place

01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:20,707

"Confess yourself to heaven;

01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,335

01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:11,320
"O, throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the other half.

853
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:14,628
"Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;  Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

854
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:18,232
-You're gonna tell me that I am not a great actor?
-I like your singing better.

855
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:19,464
You do?

856
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:40,353
Where did you grab that line? I didn’t know that you're into Shakespeare.

857
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,325
There's a lot you don’t know about me.

858
01:02:42,462 --> 01:02:44,987
Yeah I know, like who did you just go outside to call?

859
01:02:45,532 --> 01:02:47,500
-My mother.
-Really?

860
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:52,938
See by the way you are looking,
I know that you didn’t call your mom.

861
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,940
My mother, why is it so hard for you to believe that I am calling my mother?

862
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:58,033
Aren’t you calling your mother all the time?

863
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:00,374
Yeah, my mom is not well.

864
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,381
I would never lie about whether or not my mom was well.

865
01:03:03,483 --> 01:03:05,383
Well who knows? You've lied about everything else.

866
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:07,749
I've lied about nothing except sexual fidelity.

867
01:03:07,854 --> 01:03:10,322
Oh that's really nothing, isn’t it?
Hardly worth mentioning.

868
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,392
It is one tiny infinitesimal glitch on the radar screen.

869
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:15,324
Yeah and what do you mean about sexual fidelity?

870
01:03:15,428 --> 01:03:18,329
Do you mean it was just the two of us for the last year?

871
01:03:18,431 --> 01:03:21,400
-That I was lying to, yeah
-Oh, that you were lying to.

872
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:24,334
But what about casual acquaintances that you didn’t have to lie to

873
01:03:24,437 --> 01:03:27,304
because they didn’t care what you did, or who you did it with?

874
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,136
-Those were a few, a very few.
-How few is very few?

875
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:32,334
I thought we were beyond this.

876
01:03:32,445 --> 01:03:36,404
What made you think that we were beyond it?

877
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:38,313
Because we had a little moment?

878
01:03:38,418 --> 01:03:41,046
-A moment?
-Yes, a little moment which changed nothing.

879
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:43,418
Just as when I went outside, you and Lou had a little moment.

880
01:03:43,523 --> 01:03:45,354
Which changed nothing, either.

881
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,484
-We didn’t touch each other.
-He is actually telling the truth this time.

882
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:50,253
It didn’t even come up.

883
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:52,388
-Why not?
-I wouldn't have let him.

884
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:53,932
That thought never crossed my mind.

885
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:57,265
-Oh that's nice! Thank you very much.
-You said you wouldn't have anyway.

886
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,596
Well!

887
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:02,941
How few is few?

888
01:04:03,476 --> 01:04:04,443
Five.

889
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:08,276
Seven, sorry seven.

890
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:13,384
-It was less than 10.
-Less than 10?

891
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:18,215
Less than 10? Do I hear twenty? Thirty? Fifty?

892
01:04:18,325 --> 01:04:22,386
Who do you think I am? Nero?
I am not Wilt Chamberlain.

893
01:04:22,495 --> 01:04:23,894
No, but you are desperately

894
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:25,692
obsessed and totally out of control.

895
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,630
Don’t deny it, Blake, you are.

896
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:30,401
Well, maybe I am out of control.

897
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:32,471
Often, usually.

898
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:34,633
I mean do you really wanna do this?

899
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:38,336
Cause this will open the door of utter inhibited disclosure.

900
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:40,913
Do you really wanna hear names, dates, places,

901
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:44,415
who wanted to be licked where, fucked how?

902
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:48,351
Or in my estimation, what do I think your personal defects are?

903
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:51,913
Or what you are ready to hear
or what you don’t wanna hear secretly?

904
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:56,325
Or what if I told you what I thought about you, would that devastate you to hear?

905
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:59,864
What, you're saying that the reason that we're in this situation

906
01:04:59,966 --> 01:05:01,593
is because of our personal defects?

907
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:04,602
what kind of girl would wanna get with a guy like me, knowing?

908
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:06,367
We didn’t know.

909
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:09,875
You never even let us get to know you, that's the thing,

910
01:05:09,977 --> 01:05:13,309
because you thought if we got to know you and see who you are that we wouldn’t wanna be with you.

911
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:16,280
-Why weren’t you honest from the beginning?
-I never told you...

912
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:19,874
You could have said:
"I cannot be faithful"

913
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:22,477
Why did you make it into some kind of fucking romance,
that you didn’t believe in?

914
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:25,387
You know I think you've been avoiding us this whole time, by calling your mother.

915
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,221
It's like you are obsessed with your mother.

916
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:30,956
I mean we can't even talk to you for 2 seconds, cause you're on the phone talking to your mother.

917
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:34,400
You substituted her for having a real relationship in your life.

918
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:37,095
Stop talking about my mom.
This is not right.

919
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:38,761
Everything is from your point of view.

920
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:43,900
You are not fucking interested in us, because you're so fucking into your own head, how fucking charming and funny

921
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,741
and everything, you just fucking avoid it. And you don’t care about us and our problems at all.

922
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:50,407
All you care about is fucking convincing yourself that you are so desirable

923
01:05:50,517 --> 01:05:53,008
by getting a lot of women to fuck you.

924
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,246
You don’t even know how to be like just a person.

925
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:57,585
Just a clear simple person.

926
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:02,189
And this is probably the most truthful moment in your life right now, am I right?

927
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:05,196
I can't believe that you're just dumping all this shit on me.

928
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:09,860
It is really fucked up, I would never get off on just sitting out,

929
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:12,870
railing into somebody and telling them their character defects. It is just twisted.

930
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:14,735
-So you think you really know me?
-Yeah.

931
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:18,375
-And you know all my faults and all that?
-Pretty well.

932
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,742
Okay, how many guys do you think I fucked?

933
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:23,108
None, you said none.

934
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,611
That's right but you said none too, haven’t you?

935
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:30,445
Not only is it what you've told me, but I just know that you're probably incapable of it.

936
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,424
You don’t think I know what sexual temptation is?

937
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:41,126
So how many guys do you think I fucked since I’ve been with you?

938
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,292
None.

939
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:43,469
More.

940
01:06:44,003 --> 01:06:44,901
One.

941
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:45,971
More.

942
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:47,403
Two, you are lying.

943
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:49,407
-More.
-Three. I know what you're doing.

944
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:52,478
-You are just trying to...
-More.

945
01:06:53,346 --> 01:06:55,405
-Four?
-Yes, four.

946
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:59,417
But maybe it was three because one was Vittorio, he was a repeat.

947
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:04,682
Do you wanna hear how these guys like to be degraded

948
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:07,282
or how do they like being licked or touched or fucked?

949
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:10,260
Do you want a comparative description of dick size,
including your own?

950
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,930
I don’t like this.

951
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:13,864
Do you still love me?

952
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:16,367
Am I still your one, your only one that you love?

953
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:19,438
Are you incapable of getting excited by anyone except me?

954
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:23,602
I can't.

955
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,275
I mean do you still love me?

956
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:30,709
Okay I know what you're trying to do, I kind of understand it, even though

957
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:35,379
it's twisted and really psychotic for you to do it, but I will forgive you

958
01:07:35,488 --> 01:07:37,922
Just stop, it's not working.

959
01:07:38,024 --> 01:07:40,219
You can call him, he's at Soho if you don’t believe me.

960
01:07:40,326 --> 01:07:42,385
Cause he is staying there, penthouse five.

961
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:45,396
And in fact he threatened to tell you if you don’t go see him tonight.

962
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:49,901
I just know you would never do it because you would've never reacted with such anger

963
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:51,561
to what I did, if you were doing it yourself.

964
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:52,968
Because if you have,

965
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:56,337
then you are so much more fucked up than I am.

966
01:07:56,442 --> 01:08:00,276
At least I am fucking finally telling you the truth, and you don’t need to pull it out of me.

967
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,283
See, I wasn’t trying to hurt you. Now you're doing it to me, with the intention of being hurtful.

968
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,376
I am not trying to hurt you, I am only trying to get on

969
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:11,184
some honest ground where I feel like the rug isn't gonna be pulled out from under me.

970
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,521
You fuck Vittorio?
Vittorio?

971
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:15,355
That Chippendales jerk?

972
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:18,055
I wanna be on honest ground, too.

973
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:21,092
I understand completely what Carla’s saying.

974
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,429
Right.

975
01:08:29,475 --> 01:08:30,772
Three girls.

976
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:37,381
Three girls.

977
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:48,460
I am so glad I said it.

978
01:08:48,995 --> 01:08:52,396
You know what, this isn’t even going well.

979
01:08:52,498 --> 01:08:54,432
This little thing you guys set up to fuck me.

980
01:08:54,534 --> 01:08:56,229
No. We have not discussed this.

981
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:58,497
I had no idea that she was gonna say this

982
01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:00,505
and I am sure she had no idea that I was gonna say this.

983
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:01,904
Jesus Christ!

984
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:05,172
And this just proves to both of us...

985
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:08,346
-Girls?
-...that we were sort of unsatisfied with you.

986
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:11,349
-Girls!
-So you are essentially a carpet muncher?

987
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,351
And I find that term offensive.

988
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,353
-I am sorry.
-I find that term offensive.

989
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:16,387
Clamp bumper.

990
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,354
No, I am an evolved woman

991
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,858
who realizes that you can get a lot out of

992
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,655
a relationship with a woman.

993
01:09:22,762 --> 01:09:26,858
Like sensitivity, trust, nurturing that you cannot get out of a man.

994
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:29,366
-You know there's like a gray area.
-I can't fucking believe...

995
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:34,372
that you came here and have driven my ass into the ground for 45 minutes

996
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:37,307
holding all this information of what you two been up to.

997
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,379
-This is fucking nuts.
-This is not over.

998
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,382
You fucked four other guys, and you've been with three women?

999
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,384
-Yeah.
-This is pathetic.

1000
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,317
Why are you so shocked?

1001
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:52,380
Shocked? This fucking last hour you've been railing into me about this bullshit.

1002
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:56,326
You are eating pussy, you are fucking three other guys and Vittorio.

1003
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:57,896
Fuck both of you!

1004
01:09:57,997 --> 01:10:00,898
You should have known that we were doing this.

1005
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,401
Why does it matter if you love them or not? This is fucking ridiculous.

1006
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,369
Oh yeah, well have you loved anyone?

1007
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,399
Did you really love me, did you really love Lou?
Have you ever loved anyone?

1008
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:13,911
Can you spare in between all the time you're fucking all these different people?

1009
01:10:14,013 --> 01:10:15,981
Do you have time to, like, have a feeling?

1010
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,939
And it doesn’t feel very good, does it?

1011
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,985
Did you ever had any real feelings,

1012
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:25,482
or did you just like play Hamlet all the time and pretend to have real feelings?

1013
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:32,495
Look, I made my suggestion and I thought it was a good one.

1014
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,000
Two girls and a guy.

1015
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:38,663
But it seems like you guys are a little to conventional for that,

1016
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:40,498
and that's okay.

1017
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:56,344
Hello? Dr. Cutler? Thanks for calling me back. So did you talk to her?

1018
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:57,456
Yeah.

1019
01:10:59,992 --> 01:11:04,122
No, I think there was a very significant drop in her voice, 50% at least.

1020
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:09,332
Well no offense, maybe you don’t know I’ve talked to her three times a day

1021
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:10,993
and I know there is something different.

1022
01:11:11,504 --> 01:11:13,472
Do you think it is possible that...

1023
01:11:14,006 --> 01:11:15,473
Yes, she's still smoking.

1024
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:18,572
I don’t know what she told you,
but that's the truth.

1025
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:22,708
Well, when you tell me not to worry,

1026
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:24,476
don’t worry, I am worried!

1027
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:30,079
Your professional opinion?

1028
01:11:30,523 --> 01:11:34,254
Listen, I know my mother and I am telling you there is something wrong with her,

1029
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,487
and I think that she should probably be admitted today.

1030
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:43,934
Well I don’t think that's acceptable. All right, so if you're not gonna be in the office,

1031
01:11:44,036 --> 01:11:45,901
then give me...

1032
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:50,437
You want me to call you? Do you want me to track you down to the 9th hole?

1033
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:54,502
I am telling you that I need your help, and you're telling me not to worry, and I am worried.

1034
01:11:56,983 --> 01:11:58,951
Well then, refer me to someone else.

1035
01:12:00,486 --> 01:12:03,455
I am telling you there's something wrong, I got to bring her in.

1036
01:12:06,492 --> 01:12:09,461
I am relaxed, but I don’t understand why you're...

1037
01:12:12,498 --> 01:12:13,965
What do you suggest?

1038
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:17,366
Is that all you have to say?

1039
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:23,472
You are a fucking quack.

1040
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:27,308
I'll do it myself.

1041
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:29,972
I am tired of this bullshit.

1042
01:12:32,452 --> 01:12:34,317
I am gonna go upstairs and make a phone call.

1043
01:12:34,454 --> 01:12:38,413
Okay, I apologize if I was derogatory about your bisexuality.

1044
01:12:38,524 --> 01:12:39,821
It's ok.

1045
01:12:42,528 --> 01:12:45,429
I gotta go see my mom in a couple of minutes cause there's something...

1046
01:12:45,531 --> 01:12:47,590
This guy is a piece of crap.

1047
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,497
Just five minutes.

1048
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:55,238
I feel bad about everything, I do.

1049
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:58,442
I am sorry I reacted the way I did in there.

1050
01:12:59,445 --> 01:13:02,380
I just, words are not serving me at all.

1051
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:04,382
I think that language is always lies.

1052
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:06,952
That is why I like playing the piano, because

1053
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,284
there is no words.

1054
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,958
What is your point, what do you wanna do?

1055
01:13:13,326 --> 01:13:16,386
I don’t know, I am very reluctant to say goodbye.

1056
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:19,363
I think there's something exceptional

1057
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:23,400
to accomplish, not to ditch our relationship right now?

1058
01:13:24,504 --> 01:13:26,472
Even if I think that,

1059
01:13:26,839 --> 01:13:29,399
I think the cycle would still continue.

1060
01:13:29,509 --> 01:13:31,568
Finally it will just come down to chemistry.

1061
01:13:31,677 --> 01:13:34,407
-Hormones.
-The only thing to do.

1062
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:36,607
When you're overcome with overwhelming desire

1063
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:38,411
just submit to it.

1064
01:13:43,523 --> 01:13:46,424
Even if it is admitted to?

1065
01:13:46,526 --> 01:13:48,994
-Did I do that?
-What?

1066
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:51,760
Like you want me to say, "Hi, how is your day?"

1067
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:53,991
"It was great, I fucked this guy, how was yours?"

1068
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:57,730
What are you saying? That after everything it is better to lie?

1069
01:13:59,305 --> 01:14:02,297
I am just saying that maybe we're just not capable of monogamy.

1070
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:06,367
Maybe for some people it's like nature,
maybe we're just...

1071
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:07,946
Fucked up?

1072
01:14:08,314 --> 01:14:11,545
Maybe monogamy violates some part of our being.

1073
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:15,883
Desire makes us feel alive. We need to feel desired.

1074
01:14:15,988 --> 01:14:18,456
And to say no is like automutilation.

1075
01:14:19,325 --> 01:14:22,385
Some people are so desperate they need to feel like they are not alone,

1076
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:25,396
so they pretend like they can love one person exclusively.

1077
01:14:25,498 --> 01:14:29,059
-They being you and I?
-Would you argue with that?

1078
01:14:29,168 --> 01:14:31,398
I'd like to,
but I don’t think I can make a valid argument.

1079
01:14:31,504 --> 01:14:35,406
I think that regardless of whether or not you can trust me

1080
01:14:35,508 --> 01:14:38,477
or I can trust you, when I am not with you and we trust ourselves,

1081
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:41,605
it doesn’t mean that we just can right now.

1082
01:14:41,714 --> 01:14:44,410
I think we should continue and see what happens.

1083
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:50,580
I gotta go see my mom. I'll be right back

1084
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,158
Don't leave, okay?

1085
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:13,445
I am gonna go.

1086
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:17,780
Here's my number.

1087
01:15:19,485 --> 01:15:22,454
If you ever have the beer, I'll always have the time.

1088
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:24,786
And I don’t mean just sexually.

1089
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:27,618
Not just sexually anyway.

1090
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:43,900
Hi. Manhattan.

1091
01:16:44,003 --> 01:16:45,470
Frank E. Campbell.

1092
01:16:47,473 --> 01:16:48,462
It is a business.

1093
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:53,478
Camp... the letter E.

1094
01:16:54,013 --> 01:16:58,245
It's  Campbell,
C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L.

1095
01:16:59,452 --> 01:17:01,044
It's a funeral home.

1096
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:34,453
Hi, I am calling...

1097
01:17:54,507 --> 01:17:55,405
Hi.

1098
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,406
Hello.

1099
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:07,408
Yeah, I am calling to make funeral arrangements

1100
01:18:08,454 --> 01:18:10,354
for my friend's mother.

1101
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:12,416
Dorothy Allan.

1102
01:18:14,393 --> 01:18:15,917
Okay, we'll be there then.

1103
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:16,414
Are you okay?

1104
01:19:34,473 --> 01:19:35,940
We should go.

1105
01:19:45,484 --> 01:19:46,951
I am gonna get my coat.

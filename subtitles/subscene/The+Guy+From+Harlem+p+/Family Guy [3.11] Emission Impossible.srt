1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,700
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:08,127
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:11,987
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,142
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:18,132
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:23,192
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:24,798
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:30,137
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,130
Let's see. We've got soda, purple stuff...

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,240
Sunny D! All right!

11
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,995
We now return to "The Smurfs".

12
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,396
- Hey. You have a good time last night?
- Smurftacular!

13
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:50,734
- I saw you leave with Smurfette.
- We left the bar and she started smurfin' me.

14
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:53,712
Shut the smurf up!
Right in the smurfin'parking lot?

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,230
- Smurf, yeah!
- That is freakin' smurf!

16
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,731
- You smurf it.
- That is freakin' smurf.

17
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,232
Hello?

18
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:02,734
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,818
Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,999
I'm watching the latest episode
of Laundry Theatre.

21
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:11,331
Those are Chris's socks, right?

22
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:15,224
They don't know that Stewie's shirt
is having an affair with Meg's trousers.

23
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,984
It's fun to watch rich people be naughty!

24
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,094
Listen to me. My sister just called.

25
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:23,098
Her baby's due any day now
and Ted just walked out on her.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,620
Whoa, back it up. You have a sister?

27
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:30,801
I promised her I'd be on the next train.
Poor Carol, all alone in that big house.

28
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:34,417
Carol... She the one with
the Jacuzzi and the pool table?

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.

30
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:38,343
Really? That's a surprise.

31
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,316
Come on, Lois.
When have I not been there for you?

32
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,001
- Get outta the car!
- Scream and you're dead.

33
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,306
Thanks for the ride, lady.

34
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,430
- It's the Griffins. What can I do for you?
- Glen, we have a family emergency.

35
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:59,007
We really need you to take the kids
for just a couple of days.

36
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:02,676
In accordance with Megan's Law,
I'm obligated to inform you that...

37
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:06,423
- That's fine. I'll take the kids.
- Thanks, buddy.

38
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:11,434
Gosh, I never entertained kids before.

39
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:16,608
So a chick walks into
a gynaecologist's office...

40
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,244
Wha-ha-ha-ha-hey!

41
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,738
Diggly, diggly, diggly, diggly!

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,750
Carol, we'll get you through this.

43
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:37,518
In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby
to smother with all your unrequited love.

44
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:41,037
And as soon as the baby can crawl,
it'll probably leave me too,

45
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,055
just like my eight husbands.

46
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,099
Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted.
I came back because I love you and...

47
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,785
I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.

48
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:55,291
It was so nice of you to come, Peter.
You're so considerate.

49
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,434
It was nothing.

50
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,907
Mr Quagmire, I finished the scavenger hunt.

51
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,825
Hold your horses. Let's go down the list.

52
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,868
- An unsharpened pencil?
- Check.

53
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,947
A speed-limit sign that
doesn't end in five or zero?

54
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,674
Your mom's hairbrush?

55
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,342
- You win!
- Oh, boy! What's my prize?

56
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,451
- A pencil and a speed sign.
- I did it!

57
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:35,936
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,060
Teeth and some toenail clippings
and we'll be ready for our date.

59
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,988
Carol, since Ted dumped you,
can I have his shirts?

60
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:52,006
Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

61
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,044
I know, but check this out.

62
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,129
Carol, say "David Banner,
I just slashed your tyres. "

63
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,298
- David Banner, I just slashed your tyres.
- Aaagh!

64
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,525
I'm priceless!

65
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:08,193
Sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies room.

66
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,183
- Does she still take the newspaper in there?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,826
And after she does, I just can't read it.

68
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,930
Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here
any minute. We'd better get moving.

69
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:23,141
You gotta relax. You let that kid start
calling the shots now and you're screwed.

70
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:29,795
Is Mr Quagmire baby-sitting
all these people, too?

71
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,119
Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
I'd put U and I together.

72
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:41,038
You must be a parking ticket,
cos you got "fine" written all over you.

73
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:45,716
Hey, there. I don't wanna
come between you... or do I?

74
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,707
That's awful.

75
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:52,003
This is a song I've been singing
for a number of years,

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,880
and I find it grows truer and truer
as time goes by.

77
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:09,095
I'm hungry for you, baby.
Come on, walk with me, talk with me.

78
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,853
Don't worry. We're almost there.
Peter, why are we stopped?

79
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:24,085
- I'll have three cheeseburgers.
- For God's sake, she's having a baby!

80
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:29,859
Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
And... I guess I'll have fries.

81
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,615
If I have fries,
is anybody else gonna have any?

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't wanna be the only one eating 'em.
I'll feel like a fatty.

83
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:42,641
- Nurse, this woman is in labour.
- Excuse me. I was here first.

84
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,405
My leg is asleep.

85
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:45,398
Oh!

86
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:48,915
All right, let's see what we have here.
The baby's crowning.

87
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,063
Oh!

88
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,948
All right, I'm just going to put on
a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.

89
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,750
These don't feel like gloves at all.
They feel like used needles.

90
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:04,222
But this is where I always keep the gloves.
Maybe if I dig deeper.

91
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:08,683
No, just feels like more needles.
That's the craziest thing.

92
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:11,385
Oh. Now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.

93
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,970
Oh, my God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?

94
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,196
Honey, do something!

95
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:18,964
No baby, but it looks like
Carol's blowing a bubble.

96
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:22,878
- Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
- I am! It won't go back in.

97
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,759
Not you, Peter. Carol, push. Peter, you pull.

98
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,472
Aagh!

99
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,861
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

100
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,079
It's a beautiful baby girl.

101
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:36,767
A baby girl. I'm so happy!

102
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,199
But she has a penis.
We'll have to do something about that.

103
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,659
- Peter, no! It's a boy.
- Well, how do you like that!

104
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,797
Hey there, little fella.
Welcome to the planet Earth!

105
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,804
Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!

106
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:55,076
- He takes after his Uncle Peter.
- He's Carol's baby. Give him to her.

107
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:57,142
Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:57,343 --> 00:07:01,343
Honey, you were fantastic. And you were
so cute when you were holding it.

109
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,195
I know. I didn't wanna give it up. Let's steal it.

110
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,429
No, wait. I got a better idea.

111
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:09,717
- Lois, let's have another baby.
- What?

112
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:12,532
- Sweetie, you're not serious?
- I sure am.

113
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,162
The best thing I've ever done is being a dad.

114
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,472
Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.

115
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,779
Why haven't you sent for help?

116
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,969
I can't believe you wanna have another kid.

117
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,151
Did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?

118
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
It's our pet rock.

119
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,090
I remember the first day we brought it home.

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,080
See that? Huh? Huh?

121
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,081
Bad rock! Bad!

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,360
We do that outside.
Look at him. He knows what he did.

123
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:48,737
I found my baby book!

124
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,630
Hey, here's the broken condom
that led to my birth.

125
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,670
And the resulting lawsuit bought us
this house. You're my favourite mistake.

126
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,678
You see, Meg? I'm the favourite.

127
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:06,633
Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days
of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

128
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:10,161
- Somebody hasn't heard the news.
- News? What news?

129
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,299
What's the most wonderful thing
that could happen to this family?

130
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,654
The Phillies won.

131
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,401
- You're gonna have a baby brother.
- Or a sister.

132
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,436
A new baby. That's wonderful.
Call me when Kojak starts.

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
What?!

134
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:34,986
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why
the deuce would they want to replace me?

135
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:39,308
My cheeks are pinchable, my bottom
is smooth, my laugh is heart-warming.

136
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:44,148
What's that? I certainly am not overreacting.

137
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:47,555
What happened to Bobby
when they added Oliver to The Brady Bunch?

138
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:52,215
- Oliver, did you break this vase?
- No, the floor did.

139
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:53,804
He's so cute.

140
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:58,863
- Hey, everybody! I...
- Bobby, you get back in the garage!

141
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:03,554
It can't happen. I was here first. Well,
technically third, but no time for semantics.

142
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:06,664
This is Stewie country,
and I intend to keep it that way.

143
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:13,266
As God is my witness, from this day forward,
Peter and Lois shall not conceive.

144
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,139
- What are you doing here?
- Peter and Lois are... getting intimate.

145
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:25,615
My God, I thought I had more time.
I've got to stop them.

146
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,634
Whaaa! Whaaa!

147
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:31,715
Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!
I saw the bo...

148
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,479
Blast! What is that name again?
Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!

149
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:39,636
- I saw the bogeyman.
- Did someone have a bad dream?

150
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:43,204
Why don't you sleep
with Mommy and Daddy?

151
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,868
Peter, for God's sake. Stewie's right here.

152
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,852
We can still do it.
He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.

153
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:52,176
Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

154
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,483
Roll over. Roll over, I say!

155
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,210
Smells like cheese.

156
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,046
- OK, insert rod support A into slot B.
- That's what...

157
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:12,394
If you say "That's what she said"
once more, I'll pop you.

158
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,529
What you buildin', neighbour?

159
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:18,333
We were keeping it a secret,
but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.

160
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,289
Lois and I are having another baby!

161
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,925
We are so throwing you a shower.

162
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,903
Fat man, we'll see if Lois
wants to have sexual relations

163
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,358
when she finds lipstick on your collar.

164
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,249
There we are.

165
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,753
Well, look at you there.

166
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,362
You're a filthy girl, aren't you?

167
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:01,067
Yes, you're looking for a bad time,
that's what you're after.

168
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,219
You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad
and you don't care who you get it from,

169
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,987
because you have no self-respect,
and that gets you off, doesn't it?

170
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:12,739
Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.

171
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:16,571
And you got it all over your father's
favourite shirt. Go to your room.

172
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,928
Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

173
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,821
Make any joke you want.
You know I look good.

174
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,270
Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time
spent keeping people from having sex!

175
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:35,564
Now I know how
the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!

176
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:38,016
Time to initiate phase two.

177
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:47,225
All right, testing voice modulator.
Blast, you vile woman!

178
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,888
- Blast, you vile woman.
- That won't do.

179
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:54,546
Pardon me, you with
severe aesthetic deficiencies.

180
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:57,864
- Hey, ugly!
- Excellent. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

181
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,999
Sweet. Ha-ha-ha-ha!

182
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,622
Who's got beer?

183
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:13,327
- Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?
- To the can. Kissing you made me barf.

184
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:16,147
- What?
- Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.

185
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,656
- Like I could! He's so fat.
- I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.

186
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,842
That's it. Your dad's had enough.

187
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:26,326
I want you kids to go and drink
the antifreeze in the garage.

188
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,270
I'm gonna chug it all
so there's none left for you.

189
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:31,868
- Watch it!
- Peter!

190
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:33,294
What?

191
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,628
Hey, Peter.

192
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:39,046
I see nussing. Nussing.

193
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:42,664
I've had it with these interruptions.
All we want is time alone.

194
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,613
You kids go to your rooms
for the rest of the night.

195
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:50,531
I don't wanna go to my room.
There's an evil monkey in my closet.

196
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,934
Evil monkey! That's funny.

197
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,102
Agh!

198
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,616
This romantic dinner
was a wonderful idea, Peter.

199
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:06,618
You deserve it, my beautiful princess.

200
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:10,583
You know, I'm not wearing any panties.

201
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:14,864
Don't worry.
We can always throw that chair out.

202
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:32,717
Very well, then. If I can't stop them from
the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.

203
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:56,563
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone.

204
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:08,473
As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate
of every sperm in Peter's body.

205
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,810
Aagh!

206
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,355
Computer on.

207
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,881
30 minutes before ship re-expansion.

208
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:24,787
Just enough time to obliterate
all those little potential usurpers.

209
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,668
- Engine status.
- Nominal.

210
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:28,339
- Fuel supply.
- Full.

211
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:32,686
Air supply.

212
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:37,388
Very well. Through the lips, over the gums.
Look out, testicles, here I come!

213
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,250
"Lois

214
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:45,129
"You can't spell "love" without L-O

215
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,570
"You can't spell "is" without I-S

216
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:53,952
"You can't spell "silo" without Lois

217
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,929
And solo from the pet rock.

218
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,562
No! No! No!

219
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:02,272
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

220
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:10,202
Warning: Host's oxygen levels rising.
Heart rate increasing.

221
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:14,187
My God. Either they're watching Batman
or they're doing the do.

222
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:22,594
If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the
sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.

223
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,608
- Computer, location.
- 15mm northeast of the duodenum.

224
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,049
Very well. Fire phasers!

225
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:33,092
Oh, jeez! My duodenum's acting up.

226
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,569
Entering testicular perimeter.

227
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:45,465
Well, well. Do you know what today is?

228
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,333
A bad day to be a sperm.

229
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,251
What the deuce...?

230
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,976
- Well, it seems you're out of ammunition.
- As are you, Stewart.

231
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,536
- You know my name.
- I know many things.

232
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,238
- Indeed.
- Quite.

233
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,905
We should exchange monosyllabic
expressions of arrogance in person.

234
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,337
- Hm.
- Mm.

235
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,860
- Peter, I'm waiting.
- I'm comin'.

236
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,891
- You came unarmed?
- As we agreed.

237
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,109
Admirable. But foolish!

238
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:17,803
It's going to be a shame
to destroy such a worthy adversary.

239
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,071
My thoughts exactly.

240
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:34,495
- I've got you in the sleeper hold.
- As I you.

241
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,358
Your attempts to escape are...

242
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,659
Futile.

243
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,606
Well, well. Nap time appears to be over.

244
00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:02,436
Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be
able to do away with that red-headed woman.

245
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,280
What the...? How the devil
do you know about Lois?

246
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,790
You've seen that little gleam
in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?

247
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,014
That's me, plotting my escape.

248
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,823
You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
What else do you hate?

249
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,578
People who send pictures
of their families as Christmas cards.

250
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,610
- People who use the word "guestimate".
- Guys who wear sandals with socks.

251
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:26,296
Jason Patric. Ew!

252
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,242
Perhaps I've been looking
at this the wrong way.

253
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,241
I should embrace the idea
of having a little brother.

254
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:35,764
After all, it's obvious
we'd make quite a formidable team.

255
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,130
- Two minutes to re-expansion.
- Dear God! I'll never get out of here in time.

256
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,574
Move aside. I know a short cut.

257
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:10,547
Mm.

258
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Mm.

259
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,502
Re-expansion in 60 seconds.

260
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,320
There's the tear duct.
We've gotta make him cry.

261
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,633
I think I know just the way.

262
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,478
Follow my lead.

263
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:03,665
Oh, Peter. I love you.

264
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:06,983
And I love you, Lou Gossett Junior.

265
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:10,118
It worked. You've got to get
down there so you can be born.

266
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,445
10 seconds to re-expansion.

267
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:16,137
- I guess this is goodbye.
- For now.

268
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:21,369
When you're born, don't let the doctor
slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.

269
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,576
Give it to her good, old man.

270
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:41,077
Peter, wait. I've been thinking.

271
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,699
It's been a long time since
we had such a wonderful night.

272
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:49,325
It'll be impossible to spend time together
like this if we're raising another child.

273
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:52,836
I thought, you know,
Brian would do a lot of the work.

274
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:57,374
I don't know. I mean,
Stewie alone needs so much attention.

275
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,360
Maybe we should hold off
on having another baby.

276
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,878
- Yeah, you may be right.
- No, no! You must receive his seed!

277
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:08,664
- Look who's here!
- But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?

278
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:12,416
- Honey, not in front of Stewie.
- OK. Back in a minute.

279
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:18,248
No, no, no! Come back here this instant,
you fat bastard, and do her!

280
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:23,043
Stop! Stop it! Stop tickling me! Stop it!

281
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,278
I'll kill you, I swear to God!

282
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:30,697
Wha... Wha... What did you just do?

283
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,233
No!

284
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,810
You killed my brother! How could you, you...!

285
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:44,404
Oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive.

286
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:47,344
Well played, sperm brother. Well played.

287
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:50,257
He's more clever than I thought.

288
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Perhaps too clever.

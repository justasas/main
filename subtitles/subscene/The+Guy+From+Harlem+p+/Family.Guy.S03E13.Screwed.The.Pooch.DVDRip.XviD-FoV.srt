1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,560
I got the whole day planned.
First, we see the primates.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,960
Then the butterfly house, bathroom break...

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,479
Can't we all just run around
in a disorganised fashion?

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,079
- Yeah!
- Monkeys throw their poo!

5
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,079
If we don't adhere to a schedule,
we won't see everything.

6
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,759
Kids, gas masks. Run!

7
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,558
There you are.
Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr Pig.

8
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,158
Now, where's Mr Sheep?
Is he being baa-shful?

9
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,358
That's right. You're all ripe for parody.

10
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:41,358
- Can we go now?
- Shut up! I'm having fun.

11
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,277
Oh, my, someone's awfully rude.
Oh! My fanny is not on the menu! What?

12
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:52,477
What the...? Agh! Agh!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh!

13
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:59,277
Here, little fella. Come get the food.

14
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,757
I have always wanted to do this.

15
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:06,356
Oh, here are the marsupials.
Peter, what the hell are you doing?!

16
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:09,876
Look at me, Lois, I'm Roo. Come on, Ma.

17
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:14,676
Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of
their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.

18
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:20,276
I am going to kick your ass.

19
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,955
"It seems today that all you see

20
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:27,155
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

21
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:30,675
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

22
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,275
"On which we used to rely?

23
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,555
"Lucky there's a family guy

24
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:41,554
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

25
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,274
"Laugh and cry

26
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:48,274
"He's a family guy

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,153
- How's it going?
- Great. Beautiful day.

28
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:11,073
Gorgeous. We sit here and force small talk
while they have the time of their lives.

29
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,952
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,472
Here, girl.

31
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:31,551
Sorry. I... I thought I smelled... cookies.

32
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,151
Wow. Does it really smell like cook...?
God! She farted and it went down my throat!

33
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:42,471
- Full house.
- That's some poker face you've got, Peter.

34
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,471
- Years of practice, boys.
- Peter, you're on a roll.

35
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,870
We ought to get you down to Atlantic City.

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,270
Sorry, guys. Lois is making me
visit the in-laws this weekend.

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,750
Why does she bother? Me and Lois's
old man have never gotten along.

38
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,950
Hey, I got an email from Mr Pewterschmidt.

39
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,270
You should find some common ground
with your father-in-law.

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,670
Figure out what he likes and study up on it.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,749
That's a great idea. I'll learn how to act
like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now.

42
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:12,149
- You're working through Christmas!
- But, sir, what of Tiny Tim?

43
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,869
Bah! He and his ukulele shall go wanting.

44
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:21,348
The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this.

45
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,348
"I'd be more apathetic
if I weren't so lethargic. "

46
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:40,867
Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny.
Yeah, can I have a copy of Jugs?

47
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,347
In French, when you want
to say "yes", you say "oui, oui".

48
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:52,147
You gotta be kidding me!
Oh, my God! That is hysterical!

49
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:56,146
Oh, man! And what do you say
for no? "Doo-doo"?

50
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,946
I'll be right back.
I gotta go take a wicked "yes".

51
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,946
- Ohh.
- It's a person.

52
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:15,665
- Would you fix the bathroom faucet?
- I fixed it already.

53
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:20,345
- No, you didn't. It's still dripping.
- I'll give you all my Star Wars cards if it is.

54
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:24,745
Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter
how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man.

55
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,065
Oh, my God!

56
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:33,264
- Was he just mastur...?
- Yes.

57
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:37,664
- Oh, my.
- Do we... do we rub his nose in it?

58
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:45,744
- Oh, hi, Brian.
- Listen, Lois, about yesterday...

59
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,463
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
It's perfectly normal.

60
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:53,263
I know. It's just, I should be able
to control my baser instincts,

61
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,343
but lately I've just been having these urges.

62
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,343
Why don't you come to my parents' house?
The fresh air will help you relax.

63
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,143
Mm, I know where I go when I want to relax.

64
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:08,462
- I know the guy that owns this place!
- What?!

65
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,462
I said, I know the guy that...
Oh, I'll tell you later. I love this song.

66
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:20,942
Thanks, but I think a quiet weekend
by myself is just the thing I need.

67
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,541
Well, have a good time.

68
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,461
I'm gonna relax, mellow out,
and watch some television.

69
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:32,261
We now return to
"World's Sluttiest Dogs" on Fox.

70
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,941
Hey, wait up!

71
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:39,340
Right into the bumper.

72
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,740
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, look at you all.

73
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,060
I know someone who's getting a gift
certificate for liposuction in her stocking.

74
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,940
- Thank you.
- Hello, everyone.

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,339
- Hi, Daddy.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt.

76
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:02,259
- Did Peter have a stroke?
- He's cultured himself, like Pretty Woman.

77
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,739
Oh, so I should treat him
like a high-class whore.

78
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,459
That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips.

79
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,058
- Would you like a piece of candy?
- I smell death on you.

80
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:19,738
Ahoy, Mr Pewterschmidt.
Permission to come aboard?

81
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:23,138
- No!
- Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here.

82
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:27,058
- What is she? A 45-footer?
- Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor.

83
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,937
I didn't know you looked
so good in shorts.

84
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,457
- What?
- You don't have an eye spliced in this line.

85
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:35,857
I'll tie a bowline in there and make one.
That should hold her.

86
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:43,737
- And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.
- Mmm, lovely.

87
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:47,856
Carter, did you tell your son-in-law
he's not supposed to swallow the wine?

88
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:50,536
Hey, where the hell is that Peter Griffin?

89
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:55,056
He said he'd give me a hundred dollars
if I took off all my clothes off.

90
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,456
Thanks for bringing me.
This is just what I needed.

91
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,736
I'm glad. It seems like
everybody's having a lot of fun.

92
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:08,055
- How long are you and your family in...?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh. No conversation.

93
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,135
You idiot! I'm never taking you
to my country club again!

94
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:14,055
- I'm sorry, Mr Pewterschmidt.
- Your husband is a moron!

95
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:19,655
He walks up to the premier of China
and says "Dong, where is my automobile?"

96
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:23,134
I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd,
but it's worse than before.

97
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:25,934
This sucks worse than that time
I was on Survivor.

98
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,734
How dare you wash your clothes
in our drinking water, Bebe?

99
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:34,334
Now how are we gonna survive
in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?

100
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,854
Make sure the wheel goes all the way around.

101
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:41,333
Oh, no. Head-hunters. Am I fired?

102
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,853
Peter's been trying really hard
to get you to like him.

103
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,253
Give him another chance?
Let him join your poker game?

104
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,533
I'd rather be stuck in an elevator
with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried,

105
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:57,252
Carrot Top, uh... Sean Hayes...
Oh, you get the picture.

106
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,852
- Please?
- No!

107
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:03,052
OK. You know, maybe later
I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place

108
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,652
and introduce her to that mulatto boy
who looks a lot like...

109
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:09,532
- Would Peter like to play poker with us?
- He'd love to.

110
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:10,932
That sounds dynamite.

111
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:19,051
Brian, come here and meet Sea Breeze,
my prize-winning dog.

112
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,531
Isn't she a perfect specimen?
Look at these legs and that beautiful coat.

113
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:27,331
Feel the heat coming off of her genitalia.
You could roast a marshmallow.

114
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:31,530
That's how you can tell she's a champion.
Go on. Put your hand there.

115
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,730
- Oh... That is...
- Is that something?

116
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,250
That is something. That is... that is hot.

117
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,450
Isn't she the most beautiful dog?

118
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,930
Yes. Yes, she is a beautiful dog.
And that's OK.

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,249
This is Peter.
He's the idiot my daughter married.

120
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,129
- Michael Eisner.
- Bill Gates.

121
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:53,729
Peter's an anti-trust lawyer
with the Justice Department.

122
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,729
Just kidding. He's a fisherman
or some stupid thing.

123
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,729
- Hey, fellas.
- Wow! Ted Turner!

124
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:02,649
- I told you not to invite him.
- He must have followed us.

125
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:05,328
Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards?

126
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:08,528
- Peter, why don't you deal?
- We're playing Texas Hold 'Em.

127
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,248
- Are aces high or low?
- They go both ways.

128
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:13,448
He said "They go both ways. "

129
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:18,928
- Like a bisexual.
- Thank you, Ted. That was the joke.

130
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:25,047
- I see your bet, and I raise you CNN.
- Oh, I don't think I can...

131
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:28,127
You can beat him, Mr Pewterschmidt.
He's bluffing.

132
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,527
He bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing.

133
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:35,047
I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you
lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.

134
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:38,926
I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN
with US Steel. What have you got?

135
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,046
- Two pair.
- Ace-high straight.

136
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:44,526
You sold me out. I could use a man
like you. How's a million a year?

137
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:47,046
You disgust me! Get out of my face!

138
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,326
That's the first time
any of us have beaten Ted.

139
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:55,046
- How'd you know he was bluffing?
- When he lies, he blinks twice.

140
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:59,445
I noticed it when he did an interview
and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.

141
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:00,645
I'm gonna turn in.

142
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,245
Me too. I gotta be at Disneyland. We're
ethnically cleansing the Small World ride.

143
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,325
You guys practically run this country.

144
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,725
There's gotta be a ton
of fun stuff we could do.

145
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:19,044
Oh, man, there's a toll booth.
Anybody got a quarter?

146
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:23,524
- What's a quarter?
- Well, we gotta give him something.

147
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:32,243
Man. Looking up at the sky
just makes you feel so small.

148
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:36,443
Yeah. I mean, if God created
all this, who created God?

149
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:39,923
- Maybe he created himself.
- Or herself.

150
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,923
- Ohh...
- Think about that.

151
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:44,643
Neat. This guy's deep. Where'd you find him?

152
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:48,122
He's my son-in-law.

153
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:51,242
- OK, honey. I gotta go. You want a ride?
- Sure.

154
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:02,442
- Wow.
- I actually had a good time with you tonight.

155
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:06,321
And I just want to say...
I'm glad you married my daughter.

156
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,521
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Actually, it wasn't me, it was...

157
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:12,321
No, no, it's OK. I'm used to it.

158
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,321
- Having fun, Peter?
- I put all my poker winnings on your dog.

159
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:23,040
Dog?

160
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,720
Nothing to worry about.
Sea Breeze is a sure thing.

161
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,040
- Sea Breeze?
- Dad, where are the jockeys?

162
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,240
They're all in the laundry.
I'm going Indian today.

163
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,639
- Oh, come on, Sea Breeze!
- Sea Breeze! Yeah!

164
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,439
- Come on! Go! Go!
- Come on!

165
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,039
What's Brian doing?

166
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,919
- Oh, my God.
- He's violating Sea Breeze.

167
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,918
No, he's awkwardly positioning himself...
Now he's violating Sea Breeze.

168
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:11,518
Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am
about this. I don't know what came over me.

169
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,037
You had better not have ruined my race dog.

170
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,117
I am very disappointed in you!

171
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,437
I'd turn my back, but I've seen
what you do in that situation.

172
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,637
Now, Carter and I have
a polio match to attend.

173
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:26,837
Get away from me! You and that filthy
mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?

174
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,637
She's fine. Sea Breeze
will be able to race again.

175
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:33,436
But, unfortunately, not for
another nine weeks. She's pregnant.

176
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,836
I just want you to know I am
going to do the right thing here.

177
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,836
You're never going to see Sea Breeze again!

178
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,436
- Pack your things and get out!
- I am never speaking to you again.

179
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,836
Don't worry. I have a plan.

180
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:51,235
I am gonna go back in time and stop
Brian from getting it on with your dog.

181
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:53,315
Everybody stand back.

182
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,435
Aah!

183
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:02,915
Oh... Oh... Oh, boy... Oh... Oh...
Oh, God. Agh. Agh.

184
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,914
Mr Pewterschmidt,
please can we still be pals?

185
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:10,234
See. I made a picture of you and me
out of glue and macaroni.

186
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,634
That means a lot to me because you made it.

187
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:14,034
- Really?
- No! Get out!

188
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,714
- Mr Pewterschmidt, Sea Breeze is gone!
- What?

189
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,034
I can't find Brian.

190
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:22,833
Peter, do you know what I'm going to do
to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?

191
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,033
I think I have an idea.

192
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,713
This is the room. The light switch
is here. It's mostly for show.

193
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,832
There's your Murphy Bed. Don't mind
the Epsteins. They keep to themselves.

194
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:44,832
We're going to see Bobby Darin
at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?

195
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,432
Bobby Darin, tomorrow.

196
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:49,632
This is the bathroom.
Watch out, we got some bad roaches.

197
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,312
- You're on our turf, man.
- Man, I'll cut you.

198
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:56,511
I'll cut you up so bad
you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.

199
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:59,031
- Those are bad roaches.
- I blame the schools.

200
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,511
- Were you followed?
- Don't worry. I've got a decoy.

201
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,911
Hey, Lois. Hubba-hubba.
Whoa, Lois, you put on a few, huh?

202
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,031
Well, I never!

203
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,830
That's all right, I don't think he was the one.
Let's go get sundaes.

204
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,630
We all really miss you.
And Peter talks about you all the time.

205
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,710
- Oh, really? Anything nice?
- No.

206
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,030
Oh, so he's still mad, huh?

207
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,230
I should go. Take this. It's probably
not a good idea for us to meet any more.

208
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,909
Daddy swore he'd track you down
any way he could.

209
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,229
- Bingo!
- I told you she'd lead us to him.

210
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,109
- Let's call Pewterschmidt.
- Let's take the jet packs.

211
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:43,229
Cool!

212
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,629
Man, the people look like ants from up here.

213
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,108
They are ants, Michael. They are ants.

214
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,908
This is Tricia Takanawa live
where police have discovered

215
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,828
the whereabouts of Sea Breeze,
the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.

216
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:03,428
The dognapper has been traced
to this sleazy motel.

217
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:07,507
Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker
is already on the scene.

218
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,227
Who's that, baby?

219
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:14,107
Hello, this is Tom Tucker's
evil twin Todd Tucker

220
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,707
out to destroy his brother's reputation.

221
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:18,307
Ha-ha-ha.

222
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:23,026
I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my
prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.

223
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,626
Back to this breaking news.

224
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,106
Brian, please eat something.

225
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:42,825
My face is on the news. Your father won't
let me see the dog carrying my puppies.

226
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,505
And he's going to incredible lengths
to ignore me.

227
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,225
Brian, don't let him get to you.
Peter, come out of that thing!

228
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:53,825
He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him
that's getting to me, it's your father.

229
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:57,904
I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he
wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.

230
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:02,504
I don't know how my mother puts up with it.
He did promise to take care of the puppies.

231
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:06,704
They're not his to take care of. They're
my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.

232
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,704
My father wasn't there for me,
but I'll be there for my kids!

233
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,104
I'm gonna sue your dad for custody!

234
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:23,423
Please stop this. Brian has every right
to see his puppies when they're born.

235
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:24,703
Sorry, pumpkin.

236
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:28,223
I had no idea you could be so cruel.
I'll never forgive you for this!

237
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:32,022
- You're just having your period.
- This court will now come to order.

238
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:36,222
- Brian, do you like children?
- I love children. That's why I'm here.

239
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,622
I want the opportunity to raise my puppies.

240
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:43,422
Do you remember an incident at a South
Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996?

241
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,822
Yeah, I guess.

242
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:57,701
Waa! Waa! You like that, huh?!
You like that?! Waa!

243
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:03,301
You just tune this out, don't you?!
Waa! Well, tune this out! Waa!

244
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,500
- Aah...
- Waa!

245
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
- Aah...
- Waa!

246
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
- Aah...
- Shut up!

247
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,100
I was angry because my Moon Over
My Hammy was overcooked and...

248
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,220
I also have your rental records
from the Quahog Video Store.

249
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,220
- Can you read the last two titles?
- Son In Law and Bio-Dome.

250
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,019
- And who's the star of those films?
- Pauly Shore.

251
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,099
Pauly Shore!

252
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,099
He's terrible.

253
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:31,419
I rented those for Peter. He got banned
from the store for taping over movies.

254
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,499
Rosebud.

255
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,898
It's his sled. It was his sled
from when he was a kid.

256
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,898
There, I just saved you
two long boobless hours.

257
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,618
How convenient. Blame it on someone else.

258
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,218
Is that the man we want
raising these puppies?

259
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:52,618
Peter? Oh, you've gotta
believe me, Your Honour.

260
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,698
Peter, I'm putting together
another card game. You in?

261
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:58,297
- You... you want me to play?
- Absolutely.

262
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:02,017
But first I want you to testify
against that horny mutt of yours.

263
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:04,017
Oh, I don't know if I can do that.

264
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:07,497
That's too bad, because Bill and Michael
want to see you again.

265
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:10,617
Bill's going to bring his Stretch Armstrong.

266
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,297
Oh, man, and his arms
stretch out to next week!

267
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,416
Your Honour, Peter Griffin
would like to take the stand.

268
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:22,696
Mr Griffin, which of the following two
phrases best describes Brian Griffin?

269
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:25,416
Problem drinker,
or African-American haberdasher?

270
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,696
- I guess problem drinker, but that's...
- Thank you.

271
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:33,415
Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you
stare at it long enough, you see something?

272
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,415
- Sexual deviant, but that one's not...
- Thank you.

273
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:41,095
Now, isn't it true that you told my client
that Brian is a menace to society

274
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:44,095
and should never be allowed
to see his children?

275
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:47,015
Um... Uh...

276
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,694
Brian should be allowed to see his puppies!

277
00:18:55,494 --> 00:19:00,014
- Peter, think about what you're doing.
- I am. Your Honour, Brian'll be a great dad.

278
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:03,414
If I was half the parent he is,
I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...

279
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:06,013
- Chocolate-chip.
- Stewie's favourite bedtime story is...

280
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:08,013
- Goodnight, Moon.
- Meg's real father's name is...

281
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,093
Stan Thompson.

282
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:15,213
I've heard enough. I do believe
that Brian would be a successful parent.

283
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:20,093
If he was to repeat his actions, he would
be setting a bad example for his puppies.

284
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:24,212
Therefore, I grant Brian custody
with the condition that he be neutered first.

285
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,492
Yeah! You did it, buddy! Oh, congratulations!

286
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,812
Oh, man! What does "neutered" mean?

287
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:36,412
You're almost there, Sea Breeze.
Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before,

288
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,612
but promise me you won't eat any of them.

289
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:44,011
This is like a Greek tragedy where a man
chooses between himself and his children.

290
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:48,291
Of course, you'll be playing
the role of "Sans Testiclese".

291
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:51,091
We're ready for you down the hall.

292
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:55,211
Sure you want to go through with this?
You could have puppies with another dog.

293
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,890
And maybe with a condor!
Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.

294
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,890
Would you like that, Brian?
Huh? Flying puppies?

295
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,210
No. Those puppies in there are mine.

296
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,210
And I'll give anything
to be with them. Anything.

297
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,210
I am not looking forward to what you're
gonna be like once they do this to you.

298
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,809
Mmm. I love chocolate.

299
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,089
But I can't eat it because then I'll get fat.

300
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:23,209
But it's so good!

301
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,889
- Are you ready, Brian?
- I guess so.

302
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,889
Stop! Brian, come quick!

303
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:35,208
- Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies!
- Then whose are they?

304
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:43,208
You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore!

305
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:45,088
You must be so relieved.

306
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:48,687
Actually, I... I was kind of
looking forward to being a dad.

307
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,207
Don't worry. There'll be other chances.

308
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:56,287
Hey, you know what's funny?
I always thought that dogs... laid eggs.

309
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,407
And I learned something today.

310
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:26,485

1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,800
"It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:08,145
"Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,764
"But where are those
good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,841
"On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:18,046
"Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:22,902
"Lucky there's a man who positively
can do all the things that make us

7
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,786
"Laugh and cry

8
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:29,981
"He's a family guy

9
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:38,257
Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired
figure skater with the horse teeth,

10
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:40,748
the one who got what she had coming.

11
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:43,247
Nice figure eight, Mom.

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,230
Ha! All right!

13
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:55,126
OK, Bonnie. One, two, three, push!

14
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,153
Oh! Ah! Whoa!

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,420
My God! I can walk! It's a mira...!

16
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,806
- Sorry, Dad.
- Just get the chair.

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,530
Good shot.
Made my brown eye blue with that one.

18
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:22,186
- Yeah. Next one's coming for your head!
- Oh, no! No, help! Oh, help!

19
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:26,416
- What the hell?
- Now is the winter of your discontent!

20
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:30,848
You wanna race? On your mark, get set, go!

21
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,739
First to where
that Pakistani girl fell through the ice

22
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:36,661
after coming to the States
for her severely burned face

23
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:41,063
she got when the man she refused to marry
dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!

24
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,771
Yes! Yes! In your face! In your face!

25
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,522
In my face! In my face!

26
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:52,147
Ahh! No! Acid girl! It's acid girl! Ahh!

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,930
- James Woods High! Whoo!
- Hey, guys.

28
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,955
- What do you want?
- I'm trying out for cheerleading.

29
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,761
Peter Rabbit would be wise
to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.

30
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,043
Why don't you try the flag girls squad?

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
Are you trying out for flag girl?

32
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,289
Yes! I win again, Andy.

33
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:31,297
One more before
the missus notices I'm not on the couch.

34
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:33,662
Too late!

35
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:40,497
Hey, careful, Quagmire.
Don't get too close to that thing.

36
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,995
Did I just get laid?

37
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:46,394
- Nice game, Peter.
- I'm on a roll.

38
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:49,973
- I whipped Chris on the ice today.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

39
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:52,727
It's only a matter of time
before he beats you.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,960
What? I'm better than him at everything:
Sports, video games, even magic tricks.

41
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,047
- Ha-ha. Got your nose.
- Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.

42
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:10,862
Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.

43
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:14,118
Face it, sooner or later
you'll have to pass the torch.

44
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:17,652
I remember the first time
Kevin beat me. I was so proud,

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,680
I gave him a little congratulatory
punch in the arm. Then another.

46
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:26,171
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went
to live with a foster family for a while...

47
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,558
- It's inevitable.
- Don't feel bad.

48
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,853
I think I know why your son beat you.

49
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:34,749
Apparently, you're
a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.

50
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:40,395
Which is good, cos I finally have someone
to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.

51
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,035
Does it feel good
on your new budding bosoms?

52
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,260
- It sure does...
- Get the hell off me!

53
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,558
Rudolph, we figured out
what makes your nose red.

54
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:55,417
- Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails?
- No, it's a tumour.

55
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:58,058
You mean like
a magical Christmas tumour?

56
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:02,367
No, a malignant tumour, the base of which
is lodged deep within your brain.

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,550
- Oh. Like a happy special...
- You're going to die.

58
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,506
Hey, everybody, guess what I am.

59
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:14,805
The end result of a drunken backseat
gropefest and a broken prophylactic?

60
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,388
- I'm on the flag girl squad!
- Oh, honey, congratulations.

61
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,580
- Hey, Chris. I bet you can't do this.
- I bet I can!

62
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,434
We perform at all the football games.
I'm practically a cheerleader!

63
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:30,596
That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful?

64
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,327
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see
your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.

65
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:36,647
You're on!

66
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:39,494
So, you're a flag girl. That's great, Meg.

67
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,016
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:46,001
Now you can be somewhere else
when the boys don't call.

69
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:51,556
- All right. Salt shaker up the nose.
- I got pepper.

70
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,992
Ha-ha! Yes! I win!

71
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:58,185
- That was fun, Dad!
- I'm the man!

72
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,997
Yeah! Ahh!

73
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:07,194
Lois, go get the medical dictionary
and look up "fork" and "lung. "

74
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,661
- Why?
- Time's a factor, Lois.

75
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:19,094
Say, Meg, looking sharp.
You want to go out after the game tonight?

76
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:22,749
Neil, I'm a flag girl now.
I'm way too cool to be seen with you.

77
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:27,505
Really? Not even
if I smoke this corncob pipe?

78
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,481
Are we all ready to cheer
at the game tonight?

79
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:42,923
"We?" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?

80
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:46,266
Yeah. This morning my mom
was, like, "Don't forget your lunch",

81
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,605
and I'm all "I'm a flag girl now,
I won't forget my lunch",

82
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:52,744
and she's all
"Don't forget your halftime routine. "

83
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:57,352
Moms! Hey, maybe we could all,
like, hang out after the game.

84
00:05:57,672 --> 00:05:59,672
Go, team!

85
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:02,177
Uncool people are like animals.

86
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:05,147
You want to go feed
the science club after school?

87
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,661
Look at me.

88
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,575
Look at me, I'm smoking.
Dog, dog, look, look...

89
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,883
Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer.
It constricts the blood vessels...

90
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:28,861
- Shut up.
- The dog just told me to shut up.

91
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:31,983
I demand to know
what you plan to do about this. Hey!

92
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,510
- Hey! The dog just told me...
- Be quiet, Stewie.

93
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,745
- Freezing my nips off out here.
- Oh, look, there's Meg.

94
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,879
Meg! Meg! Meg!

95
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,261
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi, Meg.

96
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,477
Here we go.

97
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:08,153
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.

98
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:11,106
- They've held hands all night.
- I mean Meg.

99
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,948
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.

100
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:21,237
- Oh! This meat stinks something fierce!
- This'll knock her down a couple notches.

101
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:36,065
Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how
these kids celebrate these days!

102
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:44,333
What do you got? What do you got?
Huh? Huh? Come on.

103
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:48,137
- Come on, ref. That's charging.
- Your feet were moving. No foul.

104
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:52,574
No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call!
And I know something about stupid calls.

105
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,844
Hello?

106
00:07:56,013 --> 00:08:00,893
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at
the office and they're making me stay late.

107
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,711
Caller ID says you're
calling from the kitchen.

108
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:07,344
- In fact, I can see you.
- Can you see me now?

109
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:09,296
- No.
- Now I'm at the office.

110
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:13,374
Score's tied, next basket wins.
You might finally beat your old man.

111
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,229
"Old man"? I'm the white Larry Bird.

112
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,467
What do you got?
What do you got? Huh? Come on!

113
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,198
- Your mother and I are getting a divorce!
- You are?

114
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:26,235
Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.

115
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:27,765
Yes!

116
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:31,564
Son, you played good,
but your dad is still number one.

117
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:37,387
- Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.
- Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?

118
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,156
Oh, my God! That's not your leg!

119
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,848
- What's wrong, honey?
- I'll tell you:

120
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,429
I try to make love to you
and you think about Chris.

121
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:59,062
- Is there something you need to tell me?
- Thanks to you, our son has a huge wang.

122
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,854
- Thanks to me?
- He didn't get it from me.

123
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,770
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

124
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,477
All right, stand back, Lois.

125
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,569
Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.

126
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,900
How did this happen?
I'm supposed to be the man of the house.

127
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,360
- You must be ashamed of me.
- Oh, Peter.

128
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,659
I care as much about the size of your penis
as you care about the size of my breasts.

129
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,922
Oh, my God!

130
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,745
You can't let those awful kids get to you.

131
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:34,178
They won't. I'm never
going back to that school again.

132
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:39,521
- Dad, could you help me with my algebra?
- You're a big man. You figure it out.

133
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:43,548
I bet there's a part of you
that wants to be friends with them.

134
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,910
- Maybe.
- So be nice to them.

135
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,809
Win your enemies over
with unflappable kindness.

136
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:53,131
- Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big.
- No! No more milk for him.

137
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,714
He's had enough. Give me that.

138
00:09:56,525 --> 00:10:01,445
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it
in the manner to which you're accustomed.

139
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:02,939
Oh!

140
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,920
Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.
I know what it takes to be cool.

141
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:40,671
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

142
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:48,083
- Hi, you guys.
- God, it's her.

143
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,330
- Look, about the other night...
- Oh, that was hilarious.

144
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:56,687
I just wish I'd known ahead of time.
I would've brought potato salad!

145
00:11:58,122 --> 00:12:00,602
You guys want tomorrow's biology test?

146
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:04,115
- Whoa! How'd you get that?
- I spent the night with Mr Burler.

147
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,099
Ah, the sun's up.
I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.

148
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,082
- Wow, thanks!
- See ya.

149
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:19,924
- That was kinda cool.
- Yeah.

150
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,037
I'm bored.

151
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,284
Wanna go push the janitor,
knowing he can't legally push us back?

152
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,220
- Sure!
- OK, cool. Let's go do it.

153
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:34,064
Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.

154
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:36,313
Why, you smug little bastard!

155
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:41,525
Peter! Chris, these are plantains.
And there's nothing wrong with them.

156
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,827
In fact, a lot of women prefer them
to normal-size bananas,

157
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:51,126
because they're exotic and flavourful
and very, very special.

158
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:57,028
Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring
for the plantain section. Stop with this!

159
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,797
You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.

160
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:03,705
I mean, mine goes inside me
when I stand up. How do you think I feel?

161
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,870
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Oh, of course not, honey.

162
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:11,481
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me
at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!

163
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,859
Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?

164
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:22,886
Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.
Look, I know you're upset, but...

165
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:26,672
- Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?
- He's around.

166
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,426
Let me out of this
stink-filled corduroy dungeon!

167
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:33,019
- Peter, that's sick!
- It's OK. He's outside the underwear.

168
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:38,978
- Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.
- Thanks, Jim.

169
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:53,986
When you pull that thing into your garage,
does the garage say "Is it in yet?"

170
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:02,411
Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.

171
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,458
Ow. My pride.

172
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:25,735
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids
and they didn't spit on me.

173
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,572
Connie Demico even
invited me to her sweet 16.

174
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:32,214
Wonderful! What time do we nail
those snot-nosed punks?!

175
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:35,645
Nail them? You told me
to win them over with kindness.

176
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,
it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.

177
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:42,128
Revenge?

178
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:46,055
I'm like one of those bald eagles
you see on the Discovery Channel:

179
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:49,146
Beautiful to look at,
but mess with one of my chicks

180
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:53,668
and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip
your eyes out! Cookies are done.

181
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,263
- Who wants chocolate-chip?
- I do!

182
00:14:56,448 --> 00:15:00,848
But keep talking. All this stuff about
eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.

183
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:04,373
Really. I've got about half a pack
of Rolaids in my diaper.

184
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:14,592
I'm glad you want to join
the National Gun Association.

185
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,134
Let me show you around.
This is our shooting range.

186
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,906
Here we have our locker room
with full shower facilities.

187
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,555
Holy crap! They're all so... small!

188
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:40,211
You see, Peter, the way we look at it,
a man's only as big as the gun he carries.

189
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,806
Sign me up, and get me
the biggest freakin' gun you got!

190
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:48,954
- Stewie, you can come out now.
- Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story.

191
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,161
Pull!

192
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,919
Oh, yeah.
Who's the big man now, huh?

193
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:01,587
- Madonna or Janet Jackson?
- Which Janet?

194
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,895
- Velvet Rope.
- Yeah, that one. Pull!

195
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:09,031
- What the hell are you doing with that?
- You want to touch it? Go on.

196
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:12,685
Careful. We don't want it to get
too excited and go off in your hand.

197
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:16,362
This is pathetic. All because
you feel inadequate next to Chris.

198
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,790
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete
with my son or his freakishly large penis.

199
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:23,902
- I'm a freak.
- Don't despair.

200
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,104
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it
and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.

201
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:34,534
Connie Demico's house is two storeys.
If we set up booby traps here, here...

202
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,557
- How'd you get these blueprints?
- Oh, your mother has her ways.

203
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:41,043
She has her ways.

204
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,019
- Can I have those blueprints?
- Sure, here you go.

205
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,269
Now I've put together
a little flash bomb to create a diversion.

206
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,047
I used to date
the pyro guy from Whitesnake.

207
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,361
What's Whitesnake?

208
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:57,209
That's the music mommies and daddies
listen to. Fire in the hole!

209
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,718
Some guys from the club
are going hunting tomorrow.

210
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,645
- Count me in.
- Hunting?

211
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:08,127
- You were gonna play hockey with Chris.
- Bring him along.

212
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:11,472
- Oh, no. It's too dangerous.
- Lois, Lois.

213
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:16,291
The National Gun Association is all about
safety, especially when it comes to kids.

214
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,700
Take a look at our new video.

215
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:26,353
Let's face it, your kids will get
into your guns. That's a fact.

216
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:30,639
Gun accidents can be avoided by
introducing your children to guns early.

217
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:35,216
Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.
Say, do you ever get lonely?

218
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:38,805
- Yes.
- Me, too. Hold me.

219
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:42,036
If you squeeze me,
I make bad people go away.

220
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,372
But wait a minute.
I thought guns were bad.

221
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,432
False! Guns are good.

222
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:52,113
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses
used guns to conquer the Romans?

223
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:58,069
So remember: Guns don't kill people,
dangerous minorities do.

224
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,230
See, Lois? They're responsible.

225
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,340
Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.
I can write my name in the snow.

226
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,895
- This is fun, Dad.
- Son, son, I told you.

227
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,429
Out here in the wilderness,
call me Rooster Cogburn.

228
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:25,857
I was starting to think
you didn't like me any more.

229
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:30,322
Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.
There must be a deer around here.

230
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:33,585
- Those are snowmobile tracks.
- Shh! There he is.

231
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,953
Such grace. That's the thing
about hunting - you gotta be patient.

232
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,367
What the hell was that?!

233
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:01,122
Put this in the heating grate
and set it off in five minutes.

234
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:03,395
I changed my mind. I won't do it.

235
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:06,562
- They're my friends now.
- They pelted you with meat.

236
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:10,501
Did you forget the neighbour kids
chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?

237
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:13,267
Yes, I did!

238
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,580
OK. Now we're gonna play
Seven Minutes in Heaven,

239
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,120
and it's my party, so I want Doug
to go in the closet with... Meg.

240
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,646
Have fun.

241
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:33,643
OK. Everyone get ready.
Say hello to the lovers.

242
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:41,955
I don't know who should be
more humiliated, Meg or the pig.

243
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:45,098
- She's such a dork.
- I think I feel worse for the pig.

244
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,695
Mom, you were right!
I should have just stuck to the plan!

245
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,260
I figured you might get soft on me,
so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.

246
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,191
- Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?
- 16.

247
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:03,899
- 18?! You're first.
- Mom!

248
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:07,889
I like where this is going.
Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.

249
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,490
Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.
Say hello to Satan for me!

250
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,416
It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.

251
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,019
I'm afraid the fever
has affected his motor skills.

252
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,847
He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.

253
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,689
Looks like he'll have to repeat
the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.

254
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,050
The only way to get rid of them
is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.

255
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:36,229
Congratulations.
You've passed the fourth grade.

256
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,760
Great. I gotta leave though.
I'm going hunting with my son.

257
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:44,534
Dad, I know what to do!
I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!

258
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:50,712
Go away! Go on, get!
Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!

259
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:55,173
Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.
I mean, I just froze up.

260
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:59,033
But you handled that bear like a real man.
I'm proud of you, son.

261
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,799
You are? Because I heard
what you said about my huge... you know.

262
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,319
Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?

263
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:12,262
I was just being stupid. Take it from me,
that thing you got there is a blessing.

264
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:16,951
I mean, every guy you see with a big house
or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth

265
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:20,068
is really just saying
"Don't look at my penis. "

266
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,870
- But you'll never have to worry about that.
- Thanks, Dad! You're the best.

267
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,834
You know, Dad, I just realised something.
Your name's Peter.

268
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,681
You're right, it is.

269
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,880
Peter.

1
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,200
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,000
Dune.

3
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:24,200
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:30,100
It is here and only here
where it can be found: the Spice.

5
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,800
Greatest treasure
in the universe.

6
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,800
And the neverending cause
for conflict, betrayal, ...

7
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,800
and murder.

8
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,000
No.

9
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,500
Another bad dream, uncle?

10
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,700
No, it's a digestion, that's all.
Miserable food here.

11
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,720
I can't wait to be off
this foul planet.

12
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,500
What are you doing here, boy?

13
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,600
They're dead, uncle.

14
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,800
The Bene Gesserit witch
and her son. Both dead.

15
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,700
We discovered a Fremen siege not far from
where our thopter was supposed to crash.

16
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,400
They've been rescue by this
Atreides snake Duncan Idaho.

17
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,700
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.

18
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,900
The emperor's man.

19
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,300
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.

20
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,800
The witch and her son were last seen
driving a thopter into a sand storm.

21
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:07,900
- You've seen the bodies?
- They are most certainly dead.

22
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,000
You've seen the bodies?

23
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,300
Nothing survives one
of those storms, uncle.

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,000
The wind was over 800 kilometres an hour.

25
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,800
Nothing survives.

26
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,264
How long have I been asleep?

27
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,470
Not long.

28
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,590
The storm passed a little while ago.

29
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,158
It was Yueh.

30
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,317
He's the one who betrayed us.

31
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,807
They had his wife.

32
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,492
You should put it on, Paul.

33
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,612
You're the duke now.

34
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,361
We have to get out of here.

35
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:54,903
I found some supplies
stowed in the compartment by the hatch,

36
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:59,069
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.

37
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:05,235
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.

38
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,526
Fremen?

39
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:09,859
We're going to need them...

40
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,608
...to take back Arrakis.

41
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,899
How do we know which way to go?

42
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,027
South.

43
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,905
That's into the deep desert.

44
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,242
There were rumors
of sietch communities there.

45
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,412
That's where we'll find the Fremen...

46
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,289
...or die trying.

47
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm all right.

48
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:52,183
It's just the stress. I'm fine.

49
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,867
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.

50
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,955
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

51
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,881
Or did you think I would just be
too simple-minded to see the truth?

52
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,931
Leave us alone.

53
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,949
What happened on Arrakis
was beyond my control, Daughter.

54
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,455
An ancient feud between royal houses.

55
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,259
Don't patronize me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?

56
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,260
Used you?

57
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,256
Sending me to the duke
as a token of your support...

58
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,212
...making me a courier
of your esteemed respect...

59
00:07:57,295 --> 00:08:00,625
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.

60
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Or was that your idea, Fenring?

61
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:08,244
That would be something
your perverse mind would suggest.

62
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:11,657
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?

63
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,912
Send me into the desert to die
like that poor boy and his mother?

64
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,958
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.

65
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,002
Despite the Baron's efforts...

66
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,006
...he assures me he did everything he could
to secure them from harm.

67
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,801
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.

68
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,679
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.

69
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,050
Enough!

70
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,603
There will come a time, Daughter...

71
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:49,348
...when you will have to shed
this naiveté of yours...

72
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:53,218
...and learn what it means
to rule an empire.

73
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,500
And when that time comes, Father...

74
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,585
...you may learn to regret it.

75
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,441
It's only another few kilometers,
that's all.

76
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,778
Hurry, we don't have much time.

77
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,320
The sun will soon be up full.

78
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,895
We'll have some shade in here.

79
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:12,351
If there are any Harkonnen patrols this far out,
they'll have a tough time spotting us.

80
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,382
Such a pity.

81
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:40,084
A pity that you had to get mixed up
in this business, Doctor.

82
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,705
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.

83
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,866
I'm the Emperor's servant,
nothing more and nothing less.

84
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:50,859
So you did not lead them
to that warren of Fremen scum?

85
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,494
That was Idaho's idea.

86
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:56,216
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.

87
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:59,816
We know all about Idaho
and his efforts on the Duke's behalf.

88
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:01,868
A foolish, desperate gambit.

89
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,366
And where was that Fremen trash
when he needed them, eh?

90
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:18,230
So, what will you say when the Emperor
questions you about what happened here?

91
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,227
What's your impression, hmm?

92
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:26,015
The desert is
an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.

93
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,969
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...

94
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:35,549
...and her spawn have found that out,
haven't they?

95
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,456
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials
when he's face to face...

96
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,097
...with death's sweet smile.

97
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,042
Muad'dib.

98
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,902
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

99
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,115
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.

100
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,860
But here, on Arrakis,
you need desert power.

101
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,988
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters...

102
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,493
...tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

103
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,809
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.

104
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,349
Did you get any rest?

105
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,600
Some.

106
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:59,389
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

107
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:03,428
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.

108
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,217
How is my sister?

109
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,126
I'm having dreams again.

110
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,248
Visions.

111
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,370
Even when I'm awake.

112
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,408
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.

113
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,653
Even your father didn't know.

114
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:31,234
Why not?

115
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,604
There wasn't time.

116
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,144
What have you done to me?

117
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,852
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.

118
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,766
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?

119
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:59,389
This place is changing me.

120
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,388
It's the spice.

121
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:06,928
It's in the air we breathe,
in the food we eat.

122
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:09,386
I can't escape it.

123
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,295
Drink it all.

124
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:43,963
The best place to conserve water
is in your body.

125
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:46,965
The stillsuit will do the rest.

126
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:54,136
If we stay on this dune
we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.

127
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,303
Is that a good idea?

128
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,262
It's the most direct path.

129
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,458
You all right?

130
00:15:58,835 --> 00:15:59,918
Yes.

131
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,349
Hold on.

132
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,859
That shouldn't have happened.

133
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,516
I was careless about these dunes.

134
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,540
We lost our paracompass.

135
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,654
Can you hear that?

136
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,619
It's a worm!

137
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:56,362
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!

138
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:08,704
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!

139
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,755
A thumper?

140
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
Someone called it away.

141
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,207
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.

142
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,375
The spice.

143
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,585
Everywhere...

144
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,840
...when the worm came.

145
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,582
There had to have been people
for this many plants to survive.

146
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,457
Fremen.

147
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,663
We have to find them.

148
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:53,039
Most intruders here
regret finding the Fremen.

149
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,533
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.

150
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,988
I know you.

151
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,399
You're Stilgar...

152
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,391
...the Fremen who came to see my father
with Duncan Idaho.

153
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,466
That was a sloppy crossing you made
from the crash.

154
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,714
You called a worm.

155
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,586
You were watching us?

156
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,956
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.

157
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:43,410
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.

158
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:47,070
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?

159
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:50,649
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.

160
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,150
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.

161
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,986
My people are cautious and pragmatic.

162
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,281
Good qualities in the desert.

163
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,034
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity
than invite disaster.

164
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,914
Your only value at the moment
is the water in your flesh.

165
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,709
You know the law, Stil.

166
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,335
Yes.

167
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,089
The law.

168
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,269
Tell them to stop hunting my son.

169
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,771
Tell them.

170
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,445
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!

171
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,697
Do you hear me?

172
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,076
Is this the way
you welcome friends of Liet?

173
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,328
Is it?

174
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,171
As leader of this tribe...

175
00:20:55,922 --> 00:21:00,092
...I'm offering the Weirding woman
and her son sanctuary.

176
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:05,591
No Fremen anywhere will lay a hand on you
while you have my protection.

177
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:07,881
For how long?

178
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,839
Don't be a fool, woman.

179
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:12,671
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.

180
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,295
Don't be fugitives from us as well.

181
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:30,998
Merciful God!

182
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,079
I've heard of the Weirding ways.

183
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:38,199
Imagine what a man could do with it.

184
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,946
No doubt we have much
to teach each other.

185
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:47,855
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.

186
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:49,977
He won't move unless I say so.

187
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,808
Discipline. Good.

188
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,674
He's here!

189
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,579
He is unharmed.

190
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:15,743
We are coming down.

191
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,033
Leave me alone.

192
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,991
Made a lot of noise climbing.

193
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:36,282
He has much to learn.

194
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,613
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?

195
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,325
He surprised me, that's all.

196
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,537
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.

197
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,250
We have now two with us
who are not trained.

198
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,420
In squad lines with flankers.

199
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,007
We have to make Cave of Ridges
before full sun.

200
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,885
Chani, you will be responsible for him.

201
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,678
My name is Paul.

202
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,261
Only until we give you a new one.

203
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:19,923
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.

204
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:07,491
Across there is home...

205
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,575
...Sietch Tabr.

206
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,616
We'll be there tomorrow.

207
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,033
Tomorrow?

208
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:15,741
That must be hundreds of kilometers
from here.

209
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,699
It will be a hard ride.

210
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:20,407
Sun will be up soon.

211
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:24,157
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.

212
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,549
When you give us your stillsuits,
we will recover your water for you.

213
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,064
Here is some food.

214
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:11,247
Spice.

215
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:15,811
We don't have delicacies from the cities
like you are used to.

216
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:18,025
It's fine.

217
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,197
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?

218
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,785
I can tell by the way you stare at her.

219
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,872
I don't know what it means.

220
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,797
Be careful, Paul.

221
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:30,440
We are new to these people
as they are to us.

222
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:33,619
Everything we say and do must be careful.

223
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:37,717
Predicting the future,
then plotting to make it so.

224
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,597
These are superstitious people.

225
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:49,301
If we are to survive, it will be best
to accommodate their legends.

226
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:15,121
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.

227
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,535
A desert creature.

228
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:30,613
Not finished yet!

229
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,527
Still have work to do!

230
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,902
The pre-spice mass.

231
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:52,401
I am a desert crea...

232
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,399
Spice blow.

233
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,024
Somewhere to the east.

234
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,063
A large field from the looks of it.

235
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:06,013
We have to send gatherers
before Harkonnen pirates come for it.

236
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,927
You harvest the spice?

237
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:12,175
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.

238
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,463
It's Liet's wish.

239
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,376
We pay them to keep our skies free
of their satellites...

240
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:22,831
...so that no one can know
what we are doing here.

241
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:26,036
You will learn.

242
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,279
Amtal!

243
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,110
I invoke amtal.

244
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,358
Jamis.

245
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,029
What is this?

246
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,830
His way of dealing with what happened
the other night.

247
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,711
That was an accident.

248
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:47,474
He bested me because there was
witch-force at Tuono basin.

249
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:49,439
Amtal! It's my right!

250
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:52,950
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.

251
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,578
You're starting something here
you're going to regret.

252
00:29:57,702 --> 00:29:59,363
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.

253
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:02,605
If you know what's good for you,
you will find an honorable way...

254
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:04,267
...to leave this thing alone.

255
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,347
Silence!

256
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,889
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.

257
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:12,555
If you try that again,
we know it's your witchcraft.

258
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:16,806
I won't be able to protect you
or the boy anymore.

259
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:20,850
Come. You can't stop this.

260
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,905
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.

261
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,447
Use it well.

262
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,356
May your blade chip and shatter.

263
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,802
I'm going to bathe this knife
with your blood.

264
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,214
First, you'll have to find my blood.

265
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:27,029
- Do you yield?
- Yield?

266
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,739
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!

267
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,243
- He's never had to kill.
- What?

268
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,496
Then he'd better learn.

269
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:04,382
Finish. Don't toy with him.

270
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,820
He's bested Jamis.

271
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,124
This didn't have to happen.

272
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,624
It is our way.

273
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,744
Your way?! Killing each other.

274
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:21,062
No man recognizes leadership
without the challenge of combat.

275
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:34,504
There is a legend among us...

276
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,079
...that a voice from the out-world
will come.

277
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,080
The Mahdi.

278
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,210
He will hold the key to our future.

279
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,673
It is said that a Bene Gesserit
will be his mother.

280
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,801
A Sayyadina.

281
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,345
Friend of God.

282
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,059
There are rumors about you and your son.

283
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,770
From the city. Liet.

284
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,691
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?

285
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,567
I hope...

286
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,607
...and I fear.

287
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,810
If it's true, your boy will have to
call me out one day...

288
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,765
...to challenge me
for the leadership of the tribe.

289
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:30,262
The huanui is prepared. It's time.

290
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,550
It's our way.

291
00:35:46,631 --> 00:35:49,254
From water does all life begin.

292
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,419
The flesh belongs to the person...

293
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:59,126
...but his water belongs to the tribe.

294
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:06,416
I was a friend of Jamis.

295
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,585
When the hawk plane fell upon us...

296
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,922
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...

297
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,968
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.

298
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,097
I was a friend of Jamis.

299
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,142
I was a friend of Jamis.

300
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,179
I was a friend of Jamis.

301
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,054
He taught me...

302
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:09,720
...that when you kill...

303
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:13,052
...you pay for it.

304
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:15,050
Bila-Kayfa!

305
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,465
He sheds tears.

306
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,257
He gives water to the dead.

307
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,962
Jamis carried 33 liters of the tribe's water.

308
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,167
Counted and measured.

309
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,775
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.

310
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:05,479
Because you fight without stillsuit...

311
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:08,641
...you may regain the water
you lost fighting.

312
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,508
May you guard it for the tribe,
preserve it against loss...

313
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,677
...be generous with it in time of need.

314
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:29,597
May you pass it on in your time
for the good of the tribe.

315
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,855
Needs a naming now, Stil.

316
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,652
It's time.

317
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,236
What would you have us call you,
young Atreides?

318
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,193
By what name do you wish Fremen
to know you?

319
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:54,858
What is the name of that little mouse?

320
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:00,314
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.

321
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,146
Muad'dib.

322
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,310
Is that the name you wish?

323
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:12,767
Yes.

324
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,978
Muad'dib.

325
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,899
Wise in the ways of the desert.

326
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,362
Hiding from the sun. Traveling at night.

327
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,863
We call him the "Teacher of Boys".

328
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,994
Muad'dib.

329
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,205
Yeah, a fine choice.

330
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,873
So, from now on
you will be addressed as Muad'dib.

331
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:52,537
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.

332
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,620
Your lives will depend on it.

333
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,535
There.

334
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:26,032
Get ready.

335
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,221
What is that?

336
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,097
The one who will come. Mahdi.

337
00:43:10,937 --> 00:43:14,271
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent
to the spice blow.

338
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,607
Give her some time, Muad'dib.

339
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:25,981
Liet is dead.

340
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:30,692
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?

341
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,609
Harkonnen treachery.

342
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:35,817
She loved her father very much.

343
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:53,568
It needs a new dew collector.

344
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:03,194
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

345
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,403
We had rivers of it.

346
00:44:12,154 --> 00:44:14,528
Great flowing veins of water.

347
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,735
From the snows of mountains...

348
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:23,728
...into lakes so wide
you couldn't see the other side.

349
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:27,514
Oceans of water.

350
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,541
Our home was on the coast.

351
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:43,906
Great waves would hurl themselves
against the cliffs.

352
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:49,274
They used to put me to sleep.

353
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,732
My father had a dream, Muad'dib.

354
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,862
A dream that one day...

355
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,240
...we could change this place...

356
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,453
...make it more like your homeland.

357
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,972
Windtrap.

358
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,184
Plenty of moisture this morning.

359
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,188
My father is at peace.

360
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,535
Muad'dib.

361
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,805
We have thousands of these caches.

362
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,100
Only a few of us know them all.

363
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,846
I know this place.

364
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,005
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.

365
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,246
In my dreams.

366
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,066
This is the water we will use
to change the face of Arrakis.

367
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,846
As my father taught us...

368
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:33,252
...the voice from the out-world will come.

369
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,668
The Mahdi.

370
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,924
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.

371
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,971
And no man shall ever want
for water again.

372
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,760
Just as you said, Stil.

373
00:48:53,968 --> 00:48:57,884
Harkonnen greed for spice
is the most reliable beacon in the universe.

374
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:02,300
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.

375
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:11,298
Anyone else hear that?

376
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,960
We didn't even have to damage
the thopter.

377
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,874
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.

378
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,124
That was our last communication.

379
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,056
There is no mayday, no evidence of wreckage
when we went to investigate.

380
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,847
That's the third thopter this month!

381
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,677
The patch turned out to be mock spice.

382
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,879
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!

383
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:32,785
We caught these last night,
a village near the rimwall...

384
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:34,657
...known to be desert sympathizers.

385
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,611
Mercy, Governor.

386
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,146
We are refugees.

387
00:50:39,522 --> 00:50:41,809
- We need food.
- Liar!

388
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:45,342
Spies! That's what you are!

389
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,588
Spies for the Fremen scum!

390
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,507
Fremen scum
who raid my spice warehouses!

391
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:57,179
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.

392
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,603
He was trying to dispose of this
when we caught him.

393
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,119
Send words to the filth of the desert!

394
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,247
Tell them what you witness here!

395
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,503
Tell them this is what awaits them!

396
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,336
Mahdi!

397
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:57,433
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.

398
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,298
The latest love letter from your brother.

399
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,088
Mahdil

400
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,919
Appears to be enjoying himself.

401
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:14,501
The moron's appetite for killing
never ceases to amaze me.

402
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:19,956
By the time he's finished,
there won't be a population left to rule.

403
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:23,038
Cheer up, lovely boy.

404
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:28,327
I merely allow him to brutalize them,
to savage them, until you arrive...

405
00:52:29,202 --> 00:52:33,741
...the handsome Feyd,
to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.

406
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,906
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.

407
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,157
Feyd, the savior.

408
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,618
There will be cheering in the streets.

409
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,830
You can even give them
your brother's head as a gift, if you like.

410
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:52,002
And then you will squeeze,
like the grips of a vice...

411
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:57,424
...so our treasuries become fat
with the profit of spice.

412
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,995
No man recognizes leadership...

413
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,039
...without the challenge of combat.

414
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,788
It is the way.

415
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:32,120
Call him out!

416
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:39,072
What do you see...

417
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,237
...Muad'dib...

418
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:46,441
...when you go away like that?

419
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:49,604
Where is it you go?

420
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,563
Many places, Stil.

421
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,943
Many roads.

422
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,032
Many choices.

423
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,537
These choices...

424
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,915
...are good or bad?

425
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,414
It's hard to know sometimes.

426
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:20,405
Either they are good choices
or bad choices.

427
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,441
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?

428
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,103
Of storms?

429
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:28,390
Of the future.

430
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,592
The future, Muad'dib, just is.

431
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,947
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!

432
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:09,493
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!

433
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:14,078
Need immediate evacuation!

434
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,541
We are ready, Muad'dib.

435
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,533
Muad'dib, it's time. We must hurry.

436
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,971
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.

437
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,015
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.

438
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:56,103
He made it clear on his arrival
that we should summon you and no other.

439
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,456
The other witches must leave.

440
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,166
As you wish.

441
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,506
This visit is as indiscreet
as it is unexpected.

442
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:35,837
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity
isn't aroused.

443
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:39,585
The Emperor's suspicions
are easily moderated...

444
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:43,624
...by his dependence on our services.

445
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,623
As you are so fond of reminding us.

446
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,627
The navigators are concerned.

447
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:03,019
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.

448
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,489
There is a problem on the horizon.

449
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:10,085
What kind of problem?

450
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,252
They are troubled by a nexus
they can't fully explore...

451
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:20,035
...an intersection of events...

452
00:57:20,368 --> 00:57:26,309
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions
beyond which lies a path...

453
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,303
...they cannot see.

454
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:32,000
And where is this nexus?

455
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,246
Planet Arrakis.

456
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,960
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.

457
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,671
The Atreides are dead.

458
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,299
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.

459
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,637
We sense a higher order interfering.

460
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,601
A misstep could be catastrophic.

461
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,472
Then we understand one another.

462
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,634
Completely.

463
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,584
We'll do what we can.

464
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,830
I thought...

465
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,424
...I felt something.

466
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,871
The spice must flow.

467
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,810
The balance of power must be maintained.

468
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,000
Sayyadina?

469
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,710
I'm awake, Chani.

470
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,510
Has there been any
word, a courier perhaps?

471
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,510
No. The raids are
in the Haga basin.

472
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:34,010
They won't risk communication until
they are deep across the bled.

473
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:54,110
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?

474
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,810
No.

475
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,610
It's just your skin.

476
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,910
My skin?

477
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,610
We've heard the stories
about off-worlders,

478
01:00:05,264 --> 01:00:07,300
the ones who come
from water planets.

479
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:11,810
Skin so moist it's like cream.

480
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,228
- Muad'dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?

481
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,210
Muad'dib is still a boy.

482
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,406
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.

483
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,185
Yes.

484
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,510
I say my prayers for his safe return.

485
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,910
We both do, Chani.

486
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,985
The smugglers transport our spice tribute
to the cursed Spacing Guild.

487
01:01:07,108 --> 01:01:09,146
The Emperor never knows.

488
01:01:09,855 --> 01:01:14,100
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.

489
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,468
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'dib.

490
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,931
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.

491
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,659
Something wrong, Muad'dib?

492
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,247
I thought I saw someone I knew.

493
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,083
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.

494
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,751
No, Stil.

495
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,460
Let them go.

496
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:00,709
I must have been mistaken.

497
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:10,623
Gurney.

498
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:15,456
My father's patience is wearing thin.

499
01:02:16,622 --> 01:02:20,371
These troubles on Arrakis
are proving difficult to manage...

500
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,121
...and our time is running short.

501
01:02:23,746 --> 01:02:27,037
I want you to make arrangements
for a trip to Giedi Prime.

502
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:28,370
Milady?

503
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,165
The Baron's nephew
is having a birthday celebration.

504
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,293
The Emperor ought to be represented,
don't you think?

505
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,379
I'm in the mood for a party.

506
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,265
Besides, it's time to shed
some of this naiveté.

507
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,065
She is not going!

508
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:59,265
I'm not going to allow that headstrong,
meddlesome child loose in Babylon.

509
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:03,821
My God, what a catastrophe
that would be.

510
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:09,570
The eldest daughter of the Imperial
House ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen

511
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,585
and his dreadful progeny.

512
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,235
Yes, catastrophe indeed.

513
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:19,965
But perhaps the seducer
could be seduced.

514
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:27,082
The more we know of the Baron's schemes,
the more we are prepared for the endgame.

515
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,765
Our operatives on Giedi
Prime have limited access.

516
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,965
Your daughter, on the other hand...

517
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,865
has proved quite adept at
intelligence gathering.

518
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:43,757
Gently chaperoned, I should think
she'd prove quite useful...

519
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,165
once again.

520
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,336
You've heard the voices
from your sietches.

521
01:03:55,462 --> 01:03:57,676
They say the Mahdi has come.

522
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:01,312
But you...

523
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:05,618
...the naibs of your tribes
are still cautious. You resist.

524
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:10,717
But I am offering you the future.

525
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,593
The future as Liet saw it.

526
01:04:14,968 --> 01:04:18,252
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.

527
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:21,619
Here.

528
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:25,111
And here.

529
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:28,478
And once we rid Arrakis
of the vile Harkonnen...

530
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:31,262
...we can complete his dream.

531
01:04:32,054 --> 01:04:33,633
I promise this.

532
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:37,791
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.

533
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,219
You'll never rid Arrakis
with guerrilla raids, boy.

534
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:43,184
It will take all-out war.

535
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:46,863
That's why I'm asking you
for hundreds of your best young men.

536
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:51,044
I want to give them the Weirding way...

537
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:54,055
...so they can come back to you
and train hundreds more.

538
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,263
So those hundreds
can train hundreds more.

539
01:04:56,345 --> 01:04:58,717
And then hundreds will become thousands!

540
01:05:00,425 --> 01:05:01,674
The Fedaykin.

541
01:05:02,258 --> 01:05:05,004
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.

542
01:05:05,547 --> 01:05:08,335
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!

543
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,871
My father once told me...

544
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:22,830
...that here on Arrakis...

545
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,998
...one needed desert power to rule.

546
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:34,668
You are desert power...

547
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:38,377
...and nothing can stop you...

548
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:42,794
...if you believe.

549
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,841
So you are the one.

550
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:24,612
Jessica of the Weirding,
our Reverend Mother Ramallo.

551
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:29,013
Mapes said you were beautiful.

552
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:33,248
She also said she pitied you.

553
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:35,366
I need no one's pity.

554
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,491
That remains to be seen.

555
01:06:51,446 --> 01:06:54,487
There is much talk of you in the sietches.

556
01:06:55,488 --> 01:06:58,612
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.

557
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:02,194
I hear them shout the name Muad'dib.

558
01:07:03,402 --> 01:07:06,817
He is a natural leader like his father.

559
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:10,484
The men admire his courage.

560
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,364
It will take more than courage
to survive what's coming.

561
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,160
The boy...

562
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,914
...he knows what it is
that's happening here?

563
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,334
He is aware.

564
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,004
You've exploited our legends well.

565
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,677
We had to survive.

566
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,762
And you may...

567
01:07:40,804 --> 01:07:42,346
...for a while.

568
01:07:42,763 --> 01:07:46,806
But remember this:
the very legend which protects you...

569
01:07:47,641 --> 01:07:49,933
...can also destroy you.

570
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:45,334
- How are you feeling?
- Well.

571
01:08:45,794 --> 01:08:47,169
Tired sometimes.

572
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,004
Healthy.

573
01:08:57,211 --> 01:08:58,914
And growing fast.

574
01:09:07,306 --> 01:09:09,757
I saw the one
they call the Reverend Mother.

575
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:12,333
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.

576
01:09:12,624 --> 01:09:14,576
- Why?
- To see me.

577
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:17,027
To see you.

578
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,694
She's Bene Gesserit.

579
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,069
One of our missionaries.

580
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,026
Convenient.

581
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,818
Stilgar says you've learned much.

582
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:32,150
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.

583
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,816
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.

584
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:51,272
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?

585
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,112
Because I loved him.

586
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:59,247
As long as your father
remained unmarried...

587
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,259
...some of the great houses could still hope
for an alliance through marriage.

588
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,934
We both knew what that meant.

589
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:09,152
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?

590
01:10:09,236 --> 01:10:11,074
I would have encouraged it.

591
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:12,538
Politics.

592
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,666
Yes.

593
01:10:16,374 --> 01:10:17,457
Politics.

594
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:02,568
While I was on the hajra...

595
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:04,901
...I had dreams about this garden.

596
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:09,524
Except it wasn't here,
it was somewhere else.

597
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:14,107
Was I there?

598
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:16,480
Yes.

599
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,275
And there were children...

600
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,028
...playing, very happy.

601
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,906
A wonderful dream.

602
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,915
Do you think it's possible
to love someone enough...

603
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,461
...you'd be willing to give that person up?

604
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,884
I think...

605
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:52,710
...there are times when it's necessary
to share the one you love...

606
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,912
...with things greater than both of you.

607
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,887
Everything is connected,
one thing to another.

608
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:20,090
The living and the dead,
the animate and the inanimate.

609
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:22,087
A system.

610
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,967
All parts functioning to serve the whole.

611
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,220
Smell the air, Muad'dib.

612
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,807
Cinnamon.

613
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,893
The pre-spice mass is below us.

614
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,647
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.

615
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,777
The Maker has left her nest long ago.

616
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,865
Her children have joined together
for survival.

617
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,785
They have grown.
They are losing water now.

618
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:55,955
It will mix with their waste.

619
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,037
If enough has accumulated...

620
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,156
...a giant bubble of foam
will heave up with tremendous force.

621
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:05,111
A spice blow.

622
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:08,023
Trading places with the sands above.

623
01:13:08,772 --> 01:13:11,227
The sun and heat will dry it out and...

624
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:13,349
...soon...

625
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,643
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.

626
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,105
The worm...

627
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,566
...is the spice.

628
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,776
So now you know.

629
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,074
Many of the little makers
will die in the blow.

630
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:39,332
The rest will swim off
to become Shai-Hulud, the Great Worm.

631
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,543
We may capture a few.

632
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,793
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.

633
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,541
That's enough for now.

634
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,432
When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...

635
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:03,169
...the whirlwind follows.

636
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,586
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.

637
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,673
The one who can be many places at once.

638
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,093
You are the whirlwind.

639
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,368
It's almost night, Muad'dib.

640
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:20,153
Time to return to the sietch.

641
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,127
You've been dreaming.

642
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,398
Too impatient, Farok.

643
01:15:52,932 --> 01:15:54,466
You moved too soon.

644
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,933
Try again.

645
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,128
Watch his posture.

646
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:07,285
Even the slightest change in his breathing
gives you advantage.

647
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,625
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.

648
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,764
I am Otheym.

649
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:51,669
These are my brothers
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

650
01:16:52,831 --> 01:16:55,946
We've come to find the one
who calls himself Muad'dib.

651
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:05,499
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.

652
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,997
We've come to join your crusade.

653
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:12,079
We want to learn the Weirding Way.

654
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:14,830
We want to become Fedaykin.

655
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,414
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.

656
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:46,373
- We could fight as Muad'dib.
- I believe you.

657
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,753
Let their waters join with ours.

658
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,061
I must congratulate you
on the perfection of your heir, Baron.

659
01:18:18,144 --> 01:18:23,095
He faces his 100th slave gladiator
in the arena this afternoon.

660
01:18:23,346 --> 01:18:25,052
He appears ready.

661
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:28,047
Well then,
perhaps we might take this opportunity...

662
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:29,920
...to conduct our conversations.

663
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:32,042
There is much to discuss.

664
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,256
Indeed.

665
01:18:34,968 --> 01:18:37,900
If that meets with your approval, Milady.

666
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:40,537
I am quite entertained here.

667
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:42,882
Fine.

668
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:44,978
By your leave, then.

669
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,278
What other house would have
been willing to humiliate itself

670
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,898
so the Emperor could rid
himself of a troublesome duke?

671
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,815
He's been asking
himself that very question.

672
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:23,978
Are you suggesting that the Emperor
contemplates a move against me?

673
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,985
Speculation is not a
worthy science, Baron.

674
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,578
Better we spend our energy
on what's most important.

675
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,819
The spice must flow.

676
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:41,865
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...

677
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:44,241
curious.

678
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,239
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...

679
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:52,698
...coming deeper into the southern regions
than ever before.

680
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:58,324
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild
won't be enough to protect us.

681
01:20:14,785 --> 01:20:16,493
Then it's agreed.

682
01:20:17,285 --> 01:20:19,493
We move with the next moons.

683
01:20:21,036 --> 01:20:23,411
When the Harkonnen find this place...

684
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:28,620
...there must be nothing left
but the wind howling through the rocks.

685
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,414
There is no turning back now.

686
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,958
Subdue the Maker.

687
01:22:32,106 --> 01:22:33,564
The Maker is dead.

688
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:35,439
The Water of Life.

689
01:22:35,774 --> 01:22:39,441
May Shai-Hulud have mercy on both of us.

690
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:20,246
When night falls again,
we have to leave this sietch...

691
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,543
...that has sheltered us for so long.

692
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:31,132
We must go south into the deep desert...

693
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,762
...where the demon Harkonnen
will not pursue us.

694
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:42,518
But our Reverend Mother
will not survive another hajra.

695
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,561
So that we don't have to make the journey
without her strength and guidance...

696
01:23:52,268 --> 01:23:57,766
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented
to undergo the rites at this time.

697
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:01,973
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.

698
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:06,930
So that we don't lose all, Chani...

699
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,055
...daughter of Liet,
will be consecrated as Sayyadina...

700
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,304
...Friend of God.

701
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,955
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...

702
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:24,929
...in the Sayyadina.

703
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:51,158
Here is the Water of Life,
the water that will free your soul.

704
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:56,419
If you are our Reverend Mother,
the universe will open to you.

705
01:25:58,057 --> 01:26:00,686
Let Shai-Hulud judge now.

706
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,800
You must drink it now.

707
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,985
What's happening to her?

708
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:42,072
The water is poisoned until she changes it.

709
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,651
This must take its course.

710
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,043
Mother? Mother?

711
01:27:54,647 --> 01:27:57,105
You cannot go there.

712
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,943
That is the place we cannot look.

713
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,570
The place only
the Kwisatz Haderach may go.

714
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:12,535
You must turn away, Jessica,
or it will drive you mad.

715
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,755
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.

716
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:28,589
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding,

717
01:28:29,298 --> 01:28:33,671
...and the lives that have come before.
They are yours now.

718
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:56,662
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.

719
01:28:58,162 --> 01:29:01,536
Holy Mothers!
What have we done?

720
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:05,242
This changes you both.

721
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:25,109
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.

722
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:28,236
She must see all that we see.

723
01:29:29,277 --> 01:29:32,778
That is the only way you can save her.

724
01:29:37,988 --> 01:29:42,447
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.

725
01:30:11,413 --> 01:30:15,914
The plan was perfect in its simplicity
and viciousness.

726
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:17,998
Of course it was.

727
01:30:18,332 --> 01:30:21,332
You helped your uncle design it,
didn't you?

728
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:25,698
Duke Leto thought
he was gaining control of Arrakis...

729
01:30:26,198 --> 01:30:29,024
...but he was only being fattened up
for sacrifice.

730
01:30:29,107 --> 01:30:32,847
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.

731
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,839
Swift and merciless.

732
01:30:36,545 --> 01:30:38,829
The Atreides never had a chance.

733
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:41,821
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed
within hours.

734
01:30:41,945 --> 01:30:43,482
The Sardaukar.

735
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:48,239
I sent the final communiqué
to your father myself.

736
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,340
Mother?

737
01:31:15,796 --> 01:31:17,293
Yes?

738
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,274
Mother Ramallo is gone.

739
01:31:41,226 --> 01:31:43,306
But she remains.

740
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:49,965
You have changed the waters.

741
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:54,550
Now we know you cannot be false.

742
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,509
Paul?

743
01:32:08,326 --> 01:32:11,986
The Reverend Mother
has changed the Water of Life.

744
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:15,189
It's now safe for us to drink!

745
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,286
The son and his mother,
the duke's concubine and her son...

746
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,090
...what did you do with them?

747
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:38,021
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.

748
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:41,095
You found their bodies
and disposed of them?

749
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,932
Never found them.

750
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:46,394
You never found the bodies?

751
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,080
You're trembling.

752
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,082
I'm afraid.

753
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:53,835
Of what?

754
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,586
Of you.

755
01:33:59,999 --> 01:34:01,954
You make me see things.

756
01:34:02,828 --> 01:34:04,491
What do you see?

757
01:34:06,989 --> 01:34:10,483
I see us together.

758
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,945
There is a great storm.

759
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,249
I have a child in my arms.

760
01:34:21,172 --> 01:34:23,010
Our child, Muad'dib.

761
01:34:25,352 --> 01:34:27,065
It's not a dream.

762
01:34:28,946 --> 01:34:30,450
I know you, Chani.

763
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:35,253
I've always known you.

764
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:42,927
We've sat upon a rock above the sands
and I've eased your fears.

765
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:48,140
We've caressed
in the darkness of the sietch.

766
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:54,021
We've grown old together.

767
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:02,927
History will say that the Fremen
were about to find their messiah.

768
01:36:05,035 --> 01:36:08,155
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...

769
01:36:09,126 --> 01:36:12,667
...and the world, as we knew it,
would change forever.

770
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,547
The saga of Dune is far
from over.

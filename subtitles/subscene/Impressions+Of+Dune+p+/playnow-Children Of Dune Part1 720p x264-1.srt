1
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,727
<i>Twelve years of war.</i>

2
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:37,917
<i>Twelve years since Emperor Shaddam
the Fourth was defeated...</i>

3
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:42,654
<i>and Paul Muad'dib's wild Fremen
spread out across the universe...</i>

4
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:47,319
<i>exterminating all that remained
of the old imperial armies...</i>

5
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,588
<i>colonizing the planets
of the known universe...</i>

6
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:52,889
<i>one by one under his rule...</i>

7
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,257
<i>sweeping away anything...</i>

8
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:57,816
<i>and anyone who resisted.</i>

9
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,786
<i>Millions have been defeated.</i>

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,884
<i>Millions more have been slaughtered.</i>

11
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,393
<i>There are no innocents anywhere.</i>

12
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:20,623
<i>And the name of Muad'dib
is no longer a prayer.</i>

13
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:23,717
<i>For many, it is now a curse.</i>

14
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,787
The mercy of Muad'dib...

15
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,952
is on our worst enemies.

16
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:40,653
The compassion of Muad'dib--

17
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,920
Commander Farok,
the conversions have begun.

18
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,755
Anyone refusing the peace of Muad'dib
will be executed.

19
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,521
So it is written.

20
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:51,527
You who deny the glory of Muad'dib...

21
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:54,083
are condemned to death.

22
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:58,453
Sir, your son--

23
00:01:58,527 --> 00:01:59,754
He's been wounded.

24
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:34,252
My eyes! My eyes!

25
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,418
I'm blind, Father. I'm blind!

26
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:42,093
Don't give me to the desert, Father.
Please!

27
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,184
Don't send me to die.

28
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:55,792
<i>If history teaches us anything...</i>

29
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,520
<i>it is simply this--</i>

30
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,856
<i>Every revolution carries within it
the seeds of its own destruction.</i>

31
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:05,758
<i>And empires that rise will one day fall.</i>

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,792
<i>Arrakis.</i>

33
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,690
<i>Dune.</i>

34
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,727
<i>Once the wasteland of the universe...</i>

35
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:20,589
<i>now an imperial capital.</i>

36
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:24,889
<i>For it is here and only here
that giant worms still roam...</i>

37
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:28,223
<i>creating spice...</i>

38
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:31,727
<i>still the greatest treasure
in the universe...</i>

39
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,521
<i>still the cause of conspiracy...</i>

40
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,583
<i>betrayal and murder.</i>

41
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,390
- The holy sister!
- Alia!

42
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,090
In the beginning, we were all empty.

43
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,524
Ignorant of all things.

44
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:30,083
We did not know the power
that resides in every place.

45
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,285
And in all time.

46
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,757
He is the power that awakens the soul.

47
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:38,315
And brings us joy.

48
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,322
Muad'dib! I don't suppose you feel
it's necessary to inform me...

49
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,451
when you go on these walkabouts.

50
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:20,118
You'd only try and stop me... again.

51
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:23,125
- The streets are full of danger.
- Truth is in the streets, Stil...

52
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,955
not in this parade of sycophants
who flutter around this palace...

53
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,959
with their meaningless statistics
and empty ritual.

54
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:33,050
Ritual is the way by which
men are enlightened, Muad'dib.

55
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,389
Tell me, Korba...

56
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,222
when was it you reinvented yourself from
Fremen Fedaykin to religious fanatic?

57
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:43,726
The day you defeated Shaddam
and his armies, Muad'dib.

58
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:45,918
The day I saw the future.

59
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,117
The city's filled
with adventurers, Muad'dib.

60
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:58,148
Not to mention agents of
the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit...

61
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,454
and the former imperial family.

62
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:03,686
Surely they conspire to something
a little more elegant...

63
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,624
than assassination
on the streets of Arakeen.

64
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:11,152
You are vulnerable, Muad'dib.

65
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:14,387
No matter how powerful
you have become...

66
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,425
you cannot escape this simple fact.

67
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:20,123
You're right about one thing, Stil.

68
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,623
There is no escape.

69
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,418
I'm not asleep.

70
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,421
I thought the doctors said
you were supposed to rest.

71
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,652
As long as you insist on wandering
the city like some off-world pilgrim...

72
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,886
I will never be able to rest.

73
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,391
Are you going to lecture me too?

74
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:25,986
While I was walking,
I stepped in a puddle.

75
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,683
An open pool of water in the street.

76
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,656
Muad'dib has brought many wonders
to Arrakis, the people say.

77
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:43,715
Muad'dib spends water like a madman.

78
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,316
That's what they say, Chani.

79
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:50,689
The old Fremen.

80
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,783
I hear them...

81
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,189
in the streets when I walk.

82
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,152
We've become water-fat.

83
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:07,086
They resent the wonders
I've brought to their desert.

84
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,056
They resent me.

85
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,654
You know what I'd pay
to end these wars?

86
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,423
To separate myself from this...

87
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:32,550
damnable myth I've become?

88
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:39,348
What's to stop you?

89
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:41,722
Command it, Muad'dib.

90
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,486
After all, you are the emperor.

91
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,824
Even if I vanished tomorrow,
the revolution would follow my ghost.

92
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,152
This is not a clean place.

93
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,723
It's time to return to the desert.

94
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,883
We were happy there.

95
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,549
<i>Father.</i>

96
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,725
<i>I'm waiting and I'm ready.</i>

97
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,653
<i>To know the future
is to be trapped by it.</i>

98
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,721
<i>But knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.</i>

99
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:58,088
<i>It's the first step
along the Golden Path.</i>

100
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:02,386
<i>I'm the answer.
I'm ready, Father.</i>

101
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,885
<i>And I am ready, Father.</i>

102
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,954
<i>The answer's standing
right in front of you...</i>

103
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:12,458
<i>in the Golden Path.</i>

104
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,219
Is there no other way?

105
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:13,515
Everywhere we turn,
his power confronts us.

106
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,786
- He's a curse.
- He's a messiah.

107
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:19,848
You can't launch a frontal attack
on a messiah.

108
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,551
Even if you succeed,
their martyrdom remains.

109
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,523
But he is human,
and because he is human...

110
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:27,820
he has his weaknesses.

111
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:31,154
So, what do you suggest, Princess?

112
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:34,487
Something subtle. Something...

113
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,922
unexpected.

114
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,522
A ghost, perhaps.

115
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:46,513
May I introduce our friend,
Reverend Mother, Scytale of the Tleilaxu.

116
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,115
Get to the point, Wencisia.

117
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,953
I haven't traveled all the way
to the edge of the universe...

118
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:56,515
to discuss nonsense
with a face dancer.

119
00:13:56,592 --> 00:14:01,490
You Bene Gesserit are desperate to
regain control of Muad'dib's bloodline...

120
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:05,388
and because you want to break
his monopoly on spice.

121
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,549
He who controls the spice
controls the universe.

122
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,114
As long as Muad'dib controls Arrakis...

123
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,158
we are all at his mercy.

124
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:16,749
And that's why I intend
to destroy that domination...

125
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:20,019
and return the imperial throne
to the planet Kaitain...

126
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,115
and the Corrino family,
where it rightfully belongs.

127
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,918
Face dancers, sex toys...

128
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:31,457
musicians, technicians--

129
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,447
Whatever the need...

130
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,616
we have the breed.

131
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:45,785
- Good gods!
- Good chemistry is more like it.

132
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,654
Duncan Idaho.

133
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,191
Yes, the Atreides hero.

134
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:53,918
Paul Muad'dib's most beloved
friend and teacher.

135
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,117
But Idaho is dead.

136
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,282
Killed by your father's Sardukar.

137
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:02,586
Even in defeat, my father's men
did not abandon wisdom, Reverend Mother.

138
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,648
A few precious pieces
of Idaho's ruined flesh...

139
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,123
hidden away, saved...

140
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:14,317
awaiting just the right time,
the right place.

141
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,483
Perfect duplicate. Perfect ghola.

142
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:20,547
A perfect gift for a lonely emperor.

143
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,489
A time bomb waiting
for the trigger to explode.

144
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:27,513
- You intend to kill Muad'dib?
- Exactly.

145
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,786
But that will mean chaos.

146
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:34,951
- Spice production will be disrupted.
- Learn the lesson my father ignored.

147
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,423
It's not who controls the spice...

148
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:41,652
but who has the ability to disrupt
the spice who controls the universe.

149
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,021
But what makes you think...

150
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:48,421
Muad'dib will ever accept this... ghost?

151
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,424
I'm leaving it up to the Spacing Guild.

152
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,486
And what of the trigger?

153
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:56,524
The device to set the time bomb off?

154
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,524
Leave that to me.

155
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:47,188
Test after test, and still nothing.

156
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,251
I'm healthy, strong.

157
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,485
No matter what they do,
the doctors can't find the reason...

158
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:58,285
why I'm unable to conceive.

159
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:01,290
What does Muad'dib say?

160
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:05,120
Muad'dib is afraid.

161
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,682
He fears for me
if I have another child.

162
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:12,180
I can feel it.

163
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:15,917
He may be right to fear.

164
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,651
Someone has been feeding you a poison.

165
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,486
It's the only possibility left.

166
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:23,988
But the doctors
have never found evidence.

167
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,480
They wouldn't.

168
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,547
Its traces are subtle, confusing.

169
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,182
Of the most sophisticated chemistry.

170
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:34,917
Beyond their knowledge.

171
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,355
Surely from off-world.

172
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,650
But...

173
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,486
there are remedies.

174
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:46,022
The ancient Fremen diet...

175
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,682
which might overcome
the contraceptive's effects.

176
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:51,724
But it's dangerous.

177
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,814
You would be required to eat greater
and greater quantities of spice.

178
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,789
And if you conceive...

179
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,653
it will accelerate your pregnancy.

180
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,924
But the question remains...

181
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:10,549
who has been able to feed you
the contraceptives for so long?

182
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,886
Be that as it may...

183
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,254
this is a question that cannot be
delayed any longer.

184
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:19,950
The great houses are still demanding...

185
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,048
that a constitution be on the agenda...

186
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,556
at the next convention of the Lansraad.

187
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,852
It's nothing but a ruse...

188
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:32,550
contrived by enemies of House Atreides
to conceal far more sinister motives.

189
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:35,090
Perhaps we could offer the appearance
of a constitution.

190
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,981
Something ceremonial.

191
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,282
It doesn't need to be real.

192
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:47,517
Deceit, after all,
is a legitimate tool of statecraft.

193
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,580
Bravo, sister-in-law.

194
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,749
I couldn't have said it better.

195
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,290
Yes, perhaps something
at the local level.

196
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,823
Something impotent,
virtually meaningless.

197
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,618
No!

198
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,089
Atreides power
must never be marginalized...

199
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:03,487
by the chaos of democracy.

200
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:07,422
<i>- I'm sure my brother agrees.
- Father.</i>

201
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:15,253
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

202
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,990
<i>You must decide.</i>

203
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,949
<i>The first step. You can't wait.</i>

204
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,615
<i>Along the Golden Path.</i>

205
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:28,214
<i>The answer's standing
right in front of you.</i>

206
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,553
<i>But you must decide.</i>

207
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:45,320
Alia knows my mind.
I forbid a constitution.

208
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:48,482
Order in council this day,
et cetera, et cetera.

209
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:50,955
Irulan, are you taking this down?

210
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,684
Yes, my lord.

211
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,951
We will deliver the formal declaration
when the Guild ambassador arrives...

212
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,253
to present his credentials.

213
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,381
Then...

214
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:04,946
if there's nothing more--

215
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:19,681
A Guild embassy, Muad'dib?

216
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,553
On Arrakis?

217
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:25,649
The Council of Naibs
won't like this, Muad'dib.

218
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:29,052
We remember well...

219
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,852
how the Guild brought those
who oppressed us...

220
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35,891
how they blackmailed us for spice...

221
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,151
to keep our secrets from our enemies.

222
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:40,281
Think I'd forgotten, Stil?

223
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,986
This... decision troubles me, Muad'dib.

224
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,888
There's something...

225
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,821
reckless about it.

226
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:55,186
Not reckless.

227
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,917
Necessary.

228
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,653
You'll know my reasons soon enough.

229
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:05,622
No. I trust you'll convince the naibs...

230
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,919
of the wisdom in this.

231
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:23,156
<i>A Guild ambassador,
here on Arrakis.</i>

232
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,653
<i>Muad'dib's decision strikes some
as mysterious, even dangerous.</i>

233
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,688
<i>But Muad'dib never does anything
without reason.</i>

234
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:39,251
I should spill your water on the sand
for what you've done.

235
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,290
I know it was you, Irulan.

236
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:45,681
You're the only one
who could have hidden the poison.

237
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,849
Don't lie!

238
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:50,652
You will insult him if you lie.

239
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,647
It is my right to bear the royal heir.

240
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,315
It is your duty to play a role.
Nothing more.

241
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,789
- I am his wife!
- You have his name.

242
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:01,653
I am the one he calls "wife."

243
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:05,721
Do you think you are the only woman
who truly loves him?

244
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:14,915
But I am the only woman he loves.

245
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:26,480
I could cuckold him.

246
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,580
Dare him to expose me.

247
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:35,051
Cuckold him all you like...

248
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:37,590
as long as you're discreet.

249
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,715
He won't deny you.

250
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:44,315
But no child, Irulan. Ever.

251
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:09,146
So, what do you think, Tyekanik?

252
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:13,316
Does my little prince have what it takes
to lead a Sardukar army one day?

253
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,982
There are many ways
to lead an army, Princess.

254
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:20,917
Being a warrior is only one of them.

255
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,683
And not necessarily the best.

256
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:27,588
Prince Farad'n. Your turn.

257
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,152
Muad'dib's decision to accept
a Guild ambassador...

258
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,247
is causing much unrest on Arrakis.

259
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,051
Good.

260
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:42,483
Once the face dancer is insinuated
into Muad'dib's palace...

261
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,449
we shall light the fuse...

262
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,819
and the Idaho ghola will do its work.

263
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,548
Mom? Mommy?

264
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,680
- What is this?
- I'm sorry, Princess.

265
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:58,882
The future emperor, crying?

266
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:01,946
I don't want to be an emperor.
Let someone else do it.

267
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,354
Nonsense.

268
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,745
Wipe your tears. Here.
Getting all over me now.

269
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,914
All right. Now, go back to your men.

270
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,149
Go back. Go.

271
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,917
Do you want the men to see you crying?
Do you want them to think you're weak?

272
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,615
I don't care.

273
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,189
Well, I do.

274
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:28,652
So now you will go back...

275
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:31,917
and this time...

276
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,455
you will do it properly.

277
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,251
Won't you?

278
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,488
Commander Farok,
hero of the Naraj campaign.

279
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,923
I bring you greetings from
your new friends on Salusa Secundus.

280
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,581
Hurry. The eyes of Muad'dib
are everywhere.

281
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:42,781
These are seats once occupied
in sietch by Muad'dib...

282
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:46,289
during the days when he taught us
the weirding way.

283
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:49,789
It is some time since you've seen him.

284
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:53,254
I think he's forgotten
I ever existed.

285
00:25:56,356 --> 00:26:00,220
He's blind. Your son.

286
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:07,687
At the Battle of Naraj.

287
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:09,552
I wonder if Muad'dib knows...

288
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:12,555
how many have been maimed
in his name.

289
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:16,721
I couldn't leave him to the desert.

290
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,415
Even I violated the old laws.

291
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,251
The laws of men have gone.

292
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:26,245
The laws of a god have replaced them.

293
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,783
We were a noble people once.

294
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,584
We had a proper sietch.

295
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:36,614
I owned a chrysknife.

296
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,986
My own share of spice.

297
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,488
I was a rider of worms.

298
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,019
And then Muad'dib came...

299
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,578
with his witch mother.

300
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:53,214
And he promised to fulfill
Liet's prophesy.

301
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,347
And we followed.

302
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:59,981
- You joined his jihad?
- Do you know why?

303
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:04,921
I heard there was a thing called a sea.

304
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:09,388
Men came back from Muad'dib's wars,
and they said they had seen it.

305
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:12,251
And did you find your sea?

306
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:16,522
It healed me of jihad.

307
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,147
Now I'm ready
to help rid the universe...

308
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,656
of the cancer that is Muad'dib!

309
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:24,780
And that is Othyem's daughter?

310
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,784
Lichna.

311
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:29,152
If you bring her to Muad'dib...

312
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:32,087
he will never refuse to see her.

313
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:34,847
I was hoping that's what you'd say.

314
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:54,787
Lichna. I will enjoy
being called Lichna.

315
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:09,715
What is the meaning of this?

316
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,517
Helen Gaius Mohiam
of the Bene Gesserit...

317
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,055
you have violated
Muad'dib's eternal order...

318
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:16,986
never to set foot
on Arrakis again.

319
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:20,284
I am not on Arrakis.
I am in free space.

320
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:24,345
There is no such thing as free space
where Muad'dib rules.

321
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,120
I abase myself before the emperor.

322
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:18,087
We welcome you to our court,
Edric of the Spacing Guild...

323
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,951
and to a new understanding
between us.

324
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:24,353
Please allow me the honor
of presenting His Majesty...

325
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,650
with a small token of our esteem.

326
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:45,451
According to our investigators,
this one was killed here on Arrakis...

327
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:49,148
the body recovered
after the unfortunate conflict...

328
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:52,280
between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.

329
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:59,312
Terrible wounds required many months
of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.

330
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,617
We acquired him as a gift
befitting an emperor.

331
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:16,451
What is your name, ghola?

332
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:18,613
They say it was Duncan Idaho.

333
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,745
Idaho is dead!

334
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,254
This thing...

335
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,221
is a horror!

336
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,448
Send him away!

337
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,453
And do you enjoy the name?

338
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,818
It stirs up curious feelings.

339
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:35,616
You don't know who you are?

340
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:38,221
I know nothing of my past, sire.

341
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,617
How is this one trained?

342
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:46,746
It amused the Tleilaxu
to train him as a mentat.

343
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:50,481
I beg you, my lord!
Let me take its water.

344
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,552
Find quarters in the keep
for the ghola, Stil.

345
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:01,611
We accept this gift in the spirit
with which it was given.

346
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:05,213
Majesty, there is the matter
of Reverend Mother Mohiam.

347
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,120
She was removed from our highliner
by your agents...

348
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:10,313
in violation of our neutrality.

349
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:12,651
Be careful, Ambassador.

350
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,086
To be neutral is to be indifferent.

351
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:19,520
You would do well to disassociate
yourself from those who are not.

352
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:25,547
As you will learn, Edric,
my sister has the pulse of the court.

353
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:27,679
Be advised.

354
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,187
Reverend Mother.

355
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:49,011
I shudder to see you
in such circumstances.

356
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:51,247
I've been in worse.

357
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:54,753
Did the cards answer all your questions?

358
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:59,350
Answers only breed more questions.

359
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:03,320
What is important is how
one navigates between the two.

360
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,651
So, you haven't forgotten
everything we taught you.

361
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,980
Has the emperor explained
why I'm to be detained?

362
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,621
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.

363
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,746
But I hope it won't be too long.

364
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,413
We understand.

365
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,622
The sisterhood is aware of my delay?

366
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,621
They have changed your schedule
in light of the situation.

367
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,984
I'll be patient then.

368
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:42,980
You seem to be adapting to life here
quite well.

369
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:49,945
I have made my peace with it.

370
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:53,784
I hope your training has been a help.

371
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,946
A comfort.

372
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:59,819
One day, even Muad'dib
will know the good you've done.

373
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,078
For us all.

374
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:50,214
Do you know how dangerous that was?

375
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,084
Eleven blades, Paul!

376
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,745
Eleven!

377
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:00,850
The finest swordsmen in the imperium
have not gone up against more than nine.

378
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:04,877
Experienced swordsmen would never
have been so reckless.

379
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:08,012
This is why you invaded my privacy?

380
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:10,952
To disapprove of my recklessness?

381
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:16,281
- A body was found in the desert.
- A young woman.

382
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:19,048
- A Fremen.
- Fremen?

383
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:22,179
Decapitated and her hands removed.

384
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,616
So someone was afraid she'd be found
before the desert does its work.

385
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:30,314
I want you to examine the scene
the way our mother taught us.

386
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,252
You will take the ghola mentat with you.

387
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,277
I assume you can handle him.

388
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,480
I should arrange a thopter.

389
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,718
Poisoned!

390
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:21,846
- How can you tell?
- The molting of the skin.

391
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:25,184
Clearly the effect of rapid
neurological atrophy.

392
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,413
A Tleilaxu specialty.

393
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:32,319
Tleilaxu? Face dancers.

394
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:35,116
This is a dead Fremen girl, my lady.

395
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:39,813
What if there are no women
reported missing amongst the Fremen?

396
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:46,315
Othyem's daughter, my lord.

397
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:49,479
- Lichna.
- It's been years since I've seen you.

398
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:51,180
And my father.

399
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:57,278
I must beg Muad'dib's forgiveness
for this intrusion, but...

400
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:02,320
I am the smoke who banishes sleep
in the night.

401
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:08,643
Sit.

402
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:20,143
Deliver your warning then.

403
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,380
You must visit my father...

404
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:24,511
as soon as possible, milord.

405
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:27,554
- There is a plot against you.
- There are many plots against me.

406
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,450
This is a Fremen plot.

407
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,351
My father has information for you.

408
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:35,386
But he's weak.

409
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,420
He's sick.

410
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,750
He needs you to visit
so he can tell you.

411
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:43,985
Why didn't he tell you
so you could tell me?

412
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:47,953
He feared I might be captured
before seeing you.

413
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:50,317
If I know nothing,
I can divulge nothing.

414
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:55,485
I leave for Othyem's tonight.

415
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:05,016
Othyem has missed... his old friend.

416
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,812
A face dancer.

417
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:40,445
- Good one too.
- Let me take its water.

418
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,646
No, Stil.

419
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,778
This must play out the way I've seen it.

420
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:09,010
Cursed be thy name, Atreides.

421
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:16,013
Your time has finally come.

422
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,778
The stoneburner is set and ready.

423
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:22,911
Let the others know
Muad'dib is in the streets.

424
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,885
Go.

425
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:35,513
So, you've come, then.

426
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,281
We meet again, Muad'dib.

427
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:05,813
Answering the call of the Fedaykin.

428
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,315
I carry your water burden, Othyem.

429
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,052
Command me.

430
00:40:41,587 --> 00:40:44,519
I caught the spitting disease
in Tarahill.

431
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,608
- The tribe will take my water soon.
- Let me summon my doctors.

432
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:56,245
We've had doctors as good as any
Muad'dib could provide.

433
00:40:57,787 --> 00:41:00,049
There's treachery, Muad'dib.

434
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:04,542
I'm ashamed to say it.

435
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,950
The Fremen plot against you.

436
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:10,548
They want time to stop.

437
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,781
They want things
the way they used to be.

438
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:17,752
Bijaz has told me their names.
He was a gift to me...

439
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,581
after our victories on Tarahill.

440
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:21,449
I am a person, not a gift.

441
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,146
Cheap to feed but costly to fill.

442
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,618
Empty me as you will, sire.

443
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:29,744
He always prattles on like that.
He's a good spy.

444
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,615
You should take him tonight.

445
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:35,585
Our enemies will think I'm selling him
to you because I need the money.

446
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,779
To be gone is to be bygone.

447
00:41:37,854 --> 00:41:39,820
Let bygones be bygones.

448
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:43,047
And Bijaz and Muad'dib
must be gone by now.

449
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:47,287
He's right, Muad'dib.
It's not safe for you to be here.

450
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,816
These are troubled times, old friend.

451
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,983
It was better
when we were alone in the desert...

452
00:41:57,054 --> 00:41:59,145
with only the Harkonnen
as our enemies.

453
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,486
There's a thin line
between enemy and friend.

454
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:13,747
Where that line stops,
there's no beginning...

455
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,752
and no end.

456
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:24,153
Bygones be bygones,
let them fall where they may.

457
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,379
This has been a dirty day.

458
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,684
The wind speaks of demons.

459
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:05,152
That is not the wind.

460
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,751
Stoneburner.

461
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,983
Don't look at it, my lord!
You can't look at it!

462
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:00,251
My eyes!

463
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,180
It's worse in the Old Quarter.
Stoneburner for sure.

464
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:13,185
- What about Muad'dib?
- We are just entering the area now.

465
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,810
My eyes!

466
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,311
Milord! Is that you?

467
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:46,546
Here! I'm over here!

468
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:50,809
Take this one
and get him to the keep immediately.

469
00:44:50,886 --> 00:44:52,352
Your eyes--

470
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,783
Do it, Fedaykin.
Do it now!

471
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:56,843
This way.

472
00:44:58,687 --> 00:45:00,016
My lord.

473
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:02,177
Your eyes.

474
00:45:02,253 --> 00:45:04,946
My eyes are gone, Stil.

475
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,184
My gods! Muad'dib.

476
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:13,878
Calm, Stil.

477
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:16,511
They blinded my body...

478
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,451
but not my vision.

479
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,152
There are men who need
your help, Fedaykin! Here and here!

480
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,351
The law, Muad'dib.

481
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,648
We live by Atreides law now, Stil.

482
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:35,251
None of these men
are to be taken out into the desert.

483
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:39,350
Anyone who wants is to be fitted
with Tleilaxu eyes.

484
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:51,518
Not eyes, yet he sees.

485
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:02,413
He has sight without eyes.

486
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:35,816
You knew this would happen.

487
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,917
It had to be.

488
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,884
Why?

489
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:44,612
Why?

490
00:47:49,486 --> 00:47:51,418
For our son.

491
00:47:54,886 --> 00:47:57,408
How long have you known?

492
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,708
I have always known.

493
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:05,283
It was just a matter of when.

494
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,083
Forgive me, Chani.

495
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:13,577
There was no way I could spare us this.

496
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:15,812
I waited as long as I could.

497
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:21,943
We will return to our desert, my love.

498
00:48:23,886 --> 00:48:27,011
To the sietch where our son
will be born.

499
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:32,378
I'm afraid, Muad'dib.

500
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:37,812
I suddenly feel like
we have so little time.

501
00:48:40,853 --> 00:48:43,512
We have eternity.

502
00:48:47,252 --> 00:48:49,411
You have eternity.

503
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,517
I have only now.

504
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:11,480
So you are Bijaz.

505
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:14,848
Would I were Bijou and not Bijaz.

506
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,351
A jewel is prettier than a horse's ass.

507
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:20,242
You're a mockery then.

508
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,911
A trick of nature
meant to confuse and annoy.

509
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:28,615
Annoy, yes.

510
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:31,846
Confuse, no. Is wind a trick?

511
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,852
Then you are the wind.

512
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:36,010
No, I am words in the wind.

513
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:38,449
Words that are names.

514
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,280
Names that are death.

515
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:45,144
He knows.

516
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:50,682
- What does he mean?
- What I mean is what I say.

517
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:52,719
And what I say is what I mean.

518
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:57,549
Time for accounting,
unless you come just to mocker me.

519
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,210
My brother says you know
the names of the traitors.

520
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:05,685
Poor Muad'dib. Poor Bijaz.

521
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:10,151
<i>Betrayed and betrayer
together at last</i>

522
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:15,611
You will give me the names
of those who would betray us.

523
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:18,311
Very well, then.
Let's start with your priests.

524
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:20,318
He has another agenda.

525
00:50:20,386 --> 00:50:22,579
How do you know?

526
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,312
I sense it.

527
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:27,818
Senses are dangerous.
They can be fooled.

528
00:50:27,885 --> 00:50:31,374
Only a machine
functions without senses.

529
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:34,212
Are you a machine, ghola?

530
00:50:34,286 --> 00:50:37,684
I'm a mentat.
I trust only logic and statistics.

531
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:40,116
Not mysticism and prophesy.

532
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:46,849
My brother had a mentat teacher
who talked like that.

533
00:50:47,452 --> 00:50:48,577
Hawat.

534
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,048
You remember.

535
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,916
- You did that on purpose.
- You remember.

536
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:01,512
I feel.

537
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:03,911
There is a difference.

538
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:06,509
Is there?

539
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,042
It frightens you, doesn't it?
The memory.

540
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:15,779
You're afraid you'll remember
who you were.

541
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:20,541
No ghola has ever been restored
to his former being, child.

542
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:22,380
I'm no child.

543
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:26,111
I awakened to consciousness
in my mother's womb.

544
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:29,878
I have memories of many women
alive inside of me.

545
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:33,679
I know what they knew.
I feel what they felt.

546
00:51:33,752 --> 00:51:37,276
But I can handle it. Can you?

547
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:47,077
Palace Fedaykin are everywhere.

548
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:51,584
By the time Alia is through,
a common pickpocket won't be safe.

549
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:55,641
The fools even had a stoneburner
and they couldn't succeed.

550
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:59,207
Our spies have no idea
who was responsible.

551
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,547
It could have been Fremen rebels
from the deep desert.

552
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,880
It could have been an element within
the Quizrate itself. We may never know.

553
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:11,043
- What about Scytale?
- He maintains his masquerade.

554
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,949
- And the dwarf?
- Confined to the keep. Who knows where.

555
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:18,917
Then our plan is still in place.

556
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:49,917
He's alive.

557
00:52:49,985 --> 00:52:52,144
Gurney, tell me he's alive.

558
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:54,446
He is alive.

559
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:58,145
But he's blind.

560
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:03,276
It was a stoneburner.
Stilgar suspects Fremen.

561
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:04,942
Alia? Chani?

562
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,678
All safe.

563
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:11,209
Blind. Blind.

564
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:15,581
There are rumors that Paul can still see
despite his blindness.

565
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:19,085
Vision-sight.
They say it's a miracle.

566
00:53:19,152 --> 00:53:22,276
- Another brick for the myth of Muad'dib.
- My lady?

567
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:25,511
Arrange with the Guild ambassador
immediate transport to Arrakis.

568
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:27,380
I don't think that would be wise.

569
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,383
It was only a matter of time
before this happened.

570
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:32,383
It might not be long
before it happens again.

571
00:53:32,451 --> 00:53:35,111
And you would not want to encourage it.

572
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:37,616
Ah, forgive me, my lady.

573
00:53:37,685 --> 00:53:41,276
But those who would rid themselves of
Muad'dib would only be more provoked...

574
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,442
by the arrival of his mother.

575
00:53:43,518 --> 00:53:45,950
If Paul needed you,
he would surely send for you.

576
00:54:02,685 --> 00:54:06,515
We go forward. We come back.

577
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:08,778
We go forward. We come back.

578
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:12,012
<i>Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer's right in front of you.</i>

579
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:15,881
<i>- The Golden Path.
- But you must decide.</i>

580
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,417
<i>It's the only way.</i>

581
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:28,515
What troubles you, my lord?

582
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:30,210
The future.

583
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:34,743
You're drunk on too much time.

584
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:38,147
I'm drunk on too much me.

585
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:42,744
Do you know how many people have died
since I became emperor?

586
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:48,583
Even your empire must live its time...
and then die.

587
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,584
That's why you're here, isn't it?

588
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:55,840
Is that what you've seen?
In your visions?

589
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:59,009
It's obvious to anyone who can see.

590
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:02,783
It's what the Tleilaxu
have written upon you--

591
00:55:02,852 --> 00:55:05,010
to kill me.

592
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:09,645
What is it, Stil?

593
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:14,844
I have just received word
from Salusa Sucundus.

594
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:17,642
Shaddam is dead.

595
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:35,275
It was very generous of Muad'dib
to permit his wife...

596
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:39,340
to attend the funeral
of his mortal enemy.

597
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:43,941
How grateful you must be for the safety
my sacrifice assured our father...

598
00:55:44,951 --> 00:55:46,645
and you.

599
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:53,716
Not one major house represented!
Not one!

600
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:57,944
Muad'dib would not allow
any formal delegations, milady.

601
00:55:58,018 --> 00:56:02,678
As far as he was concerned, your father
died the day he was defeated on Arrakis.

602
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:06,707
My father was the 81st
Padishaw emperor. A colossus!

603
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:10,182
Who is this bastard Atreides
but some Bedouin charlatan?

604
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:14,308
Do not underestimate the power
of Muad'dib's prescience, milady.

605
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:18,613
Your father did,
to his great misfortune.

606
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:21,549
My father was betrayed by you...

607
00:56:21,618 --> 00:56:24,175
and your simpering Spacing Guild.

608
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:29,351
And those witches of the Bene Gesserit.
And for what? For spice.

609
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:33,475
You abandoned your emperor for spice.

610
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,642
We cannot guide our ships
without it, milady.

611
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:40,945
And that is why you will help me
kidnap a worm and bring it here.

612
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:45,076
I mean no disrespect, Princess...

613
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,481
but take a worm from Arrakis?

614
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:52,347
Even if the Idaho ghola succeeds, there
is still the sister to contend with.

615
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:56,611
We must be prepared with other means
to diminish the Atreides' power.

616
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:59,980
You want to bring a worm here?

617
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:04,949
Salusa Sucundus might prove hospitable
to the great worms of Arrakis.

618
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:08,950
If they thrived,
a new spice cycle could begin.

619
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:10,916
And?

620
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:15,144
Atreides monopoly would be broken.

621
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:17,116
Plans within plans.

622
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,979
If Muad'dib ever suspected
such a gambit...

623
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:24,813
he would smash this planet
and the Corrino name into oblivion.

624
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:27,442
We're already in oblivion.

625
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:34,312
Kidnap a worm from Arrakis.

626
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:37,544
The spice must flow.

627
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:52,516
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

628
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:47,141
The doctors say her metabolism
has accelerated.

629
01:00:47,217 --> 01:00:50,240
The pregnancy is proceeding
faster than normal.

630
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:53,477
It will be a dangerous birth.

631
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,782
Beloved. I'm sorry.

632
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,907
I've distracted you.

633
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,873
If only you could
distract me forever.

634
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:50,112
My body's confusing me, Muad'dib.

635
01:01:50,183 --> 01:01:53,240
My life burns faster.

636
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:56,874
I'm so hungry, always hungry.

637
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:04,147
Make arrangements, Stil. We leave
for the sietch as soon as possible.

638
01:02:04,217 --> 01:02:07,615
The baby will be born there.
Inform my sister.

639
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:43,279
- How long have you been there?
- Long enough.

640
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,781
Are you sick, my lady?

641
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:54,147
You don't know what it's like
to hunt the future.

642
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:04,310
You've taken spice. Too much.

643
01:03:04,384 --> 01:03:09,873
My brother needs me, Duncan,
and my vision is incomplete.

644
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:14,473
I need to remember.
I need to remember the future.

645
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:18,777
- I'm going to summon doctors.
- No. No.

646
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,748
Don't leave me.
I just need to--

647
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:25,611
just to--

648
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:34,310
I can't move.

649
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,010
What are you doing to me?

650
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,243
I am playing.
You were made to be played.

651
01:03:47,317 --> 01:03:49,475
Like Othyem. Poor fellow.

652
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:51,913
Had a terrific struggle with you.

653
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,642
The flesh did not want
to come back.

654
01:03:55,850 --> 01:04:00,407
- You are Tleilaxu.
- Born and bred... in the same tank.

655
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:03,143
Just we two... in the same tank.

656
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:06,705
First me, then you-- then you.

657
01:04:06,783 --> 01:04:09,806
You're trying
to bring out the violence in me.

658
01:04:11,117 --> 01:04:13,947
Oh, no. Not yet.

659
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:19,177
The script is written,
but the stage is not set.

660
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:26,213
But one day soon,
the emperor will come to you...

661
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:30,511
a mask of grief
obscuring his face.

662
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:40,347
And he'll say, "She's gone.
She is gone."

663
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:44,473
And then you will finally
know what you're expected to do.

664
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:51,379
<i>- She is gone.
- She is gone, Duncan.</i>

665
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:56,347
Now it's time to forget what
you remember when day becomes night.

666
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:01,541
<i>Forgetting is not having
till the words are right</i>

667
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:23,915
What do you see with those eyes?

668
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:29,144
What everyone sees.

669
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:03,111
We're leaving for the sietch
this morning.

670
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,307
- And I'll be left behind.
- Appropriate, I'd say...

671
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,906
considering what you've done.

672
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:17,873
I never meant to hurt Chani
or you.

673
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:19,506
I just--

674
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,645
I've given orders
no harm is to come to you...

675
01:06:33,516 --> 01:06:36,414
no matter what happens.

676
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:38,779
- Is she--
- She's well...

677
01:06:40,082 --> 01:06:41,911
for the moment.

678
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,375
I've been cruel to you, Irulan.

679
01:06:50,982 --> 01:06:54,278
- I don't want your pity.
- I'm offering none.

680
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,679
Simply telling you the truth.

681
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:02,443
You were destined, conditioned.

682
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:05,970
I understand only too well.

683
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:08,572
Destined to be used.

684
01:07:11,016 --> 01:07:14,608
- By you?
- By your father. By the Bene Gesserit.

685
01:07:14,683 --> 01:07:18,479
By the Spacing Guild.
To protect them from me.

686
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:27,481
And they'll get their wish,
though not exactly as they'd like it.

687
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,276
I don't understand.

688
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:38,008
The time of plots and revenge
is coming to an end.

689
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:44,037
You must have a chance
to find peace.

690
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:46,638
I'm gonna give you that chance.

691
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:49,147
It's ironic.

692
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:52,943
Your selfish, clumsy attempts
to mother an imperial heir...

693
01:07:53,016 --> 01:07:55,073
actually prolonged Chani's life.

694
01:07:55,849 --> 01:08:01,009
And for that, I'm grateful.
Forever.

695
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:33,542
Muad'dib, is it truly necessary
to bring the face dancer and the dwarf--

696
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:38,071
They have their parts to play, Stil,
just like you and me.

697
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,903
- Chani and I will take this one.
- Muad'dib--

698
01:08:47,982 --> 01:08:50,971
I know the way better
than anyone else, Stil...

699
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:52,844
except, perhaps, you.

700
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:55,882
You must remain here,
as we agreed.

701
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:06,771
Time to settle accounts.

702
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:46,072
- Stay where you are.
- What's the meaning of this?

703
01:09:55,448 --> 01:09:58,846
You plotted
against Muad'dib, Korba.

704
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:02,575
You conspired against your emperor.
You're under arrest for treason.

705
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:11,376
I am a Fremen. I demand
to be judged by Fremen law.

706
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:15,471
You will be, Korba. You will be.

707
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:40,479
I used to hunt these here
when I was little.

708
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:46,143
It's amazing, the simple pleasures
one has as a child.

709
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:55,342
But the desert is leaving now,
taking simple pleasure with it.

710
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:02,508
I wonder if my father would approve
of the future he inspired.

711
01:11:03,515 --> 01:11:06,572
A storm comes, my lady.

712
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:09,274
I am a desert creature, ghola.

713
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,871
I know when to hide.

714
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:23,776
Paul said he would join you as soon
as the naib council is concluded.

715
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:29,581
You called him Paul,
his Atreides name.

716
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:36,139
I did. A memory intruded
where none should have been.

717
01:11:36,215 --> 01:11:40,943
Then there are more.
And it frightens you.

718
01:11:41,015 --> 01:11:44,072
Duncan's memories.
They scare you.

719
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:50,607
Are they Duncan's memories
or the inventions of those who made me?

720
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:57,945
When the moment comes to decide,
you will know.

721
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:06,107
My lady.

722
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:06,104
It was the birth, my lord. They said
her body was drained by the speed of it.

723
01:16:15,015 --> 01:16:19,447
These are your children, Muad'dib.
Both are alive and strong.

724
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:23,038
- "Children"?
- Twins, my lord.

725
01:16:23,114 --> 01:16:25,876
A boy and a girl.

726
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:54,809
I never saw children.

727
01:17:35,748 --> 01:17:37,407
Beloved.

728
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:42,176
Forgive me.

729
01:17:45,047 --> 01:17:49,843
There are some things
no one can bear...

730
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:57,973
problems in this universe
for which there are no answers...

731
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:03,278
for which nothing can be done,
nothing.

732
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:09,976
I am sorry.

733
01:18:16,514 --> 01:18:19,503
Nothing in this universe...

734
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:22,643
is as great...

735
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:27,270
as my love for you.

736
01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:55,303
I can't see.

737
01:18:56,914 --> 01:18:59,574
My lord? My lord!

738
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:03,309
She's gone.

739
01:19:08,114 --> 01:19:12,808
She is gone, Duncan.
She is gone, Duncan.

740
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,240
<i>Then you will finally know
what you are expected to do.</i>

741
01:19:31,546 --> 01:19:33,308
<i>You're expected to do.</i>

742
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:46,336
This was the moment
you came back to me, Duncan.

743
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,612
Stay where you are, both of you.

744
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:01,340
I warn you. A face dancer can move
faster than you can possibly imagine.

745
01:20:07,147 --> 01:20:09,340
So, it is truly you.

746
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:12,175
Duncan Idaho of the Atreides.

747
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:15,270
A ghola can regain his past.

748
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:20,474
Tell me.
What do you remember?

749
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:26,571
- Tell him.
- Everything. My childhood.

750
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:29,841
My youth. My death.

751
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:36,574
We did it. We did it. Majesty,
don't you see what this means?

752
01:20:36,647 --> 01:20:39,977
You can have her back again,
your beloved Chani.

753
01:20:40,047 --> 01:20:42,275
The proof is standing right
in front of you.

754
01:20:42,346 --> 01:20:46,540
We can restore the flesh
and the spirit. We can recreate her.

755
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:48,806
This was your plan all along.

756
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,937
Plots within plots, my lord.
You should know this better than anyone.

757
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:55,242
We've been trying for decades
to achieve this.

758
01:20:55,313 --> 01:20:59,769
Make an alliance with us,
Muad'dib, the Tleilaxu.

759
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:03,540
Let us restore your beloved Chani.

760
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,907
<i>Live content and safe
for the rest of your life...</i>

761
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:12,510
with her, with your children.

762
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,307
<i>With her, with your children.</i>

763
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,169
My lord, please don't
listen to this blasphemy.

764
01:21:21,246 --> 01:21:23,337
Don't move, Duncan Idaho.

765
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:26,277
You kill me, and you're
killing Muad'dib's children.

766
01:21:28,346 --> 01:21:32,006
You can feel it, can't you, Muad'dib?

767
01:21:34,713 --> 01:21:38,736
Can't you?
You can hear her.

768
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:43,302
<i>- I'm afraid, Muad'dib.
- Calling your name.</i>

769
01:21:51,346 --> 01:21:56,802
<i>Father. Don't be afraid, Father.</i>

770
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,209
I'm here, Father,
as you knew I would be.

771
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,474
We go forward. We go back.
Don't be afraid.

772
01:22:02,546 --> 01:22:06,876
We're pre-born, my sister and I,
thanks to our mother and the spice.

773
01:22:06,947 --> 01:22:10,845
Thanks to you.
Father, yes, it is me.

774
01:22:12,113 --> 01:22:15,011
We go forward. We go back.

775
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:19,444
<i>We are pre-born, my sister and I,
thanks to you.</i>

776
01:22:19,513 --> 01:22:23,639
<i>My eyes. Let me see for you.</i>

777
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:26,736
I can do it.
I can bring her back to you.

778
01:22:26,813 --> 01:22:29,745
Use my eyes, Father.
Use my eyes.

779
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:32,244
My eyes. Let me see for you.
Let me see for you.

780
01:22:32,313 --> 01:22:34,677
<i>- Use them.
- I can do it.</i>

781
01:22:34,747 --> 01:22:39,304
I can bring her back.
Let us give you back your love.

782
01:23:01,747 --> 01:23:05,406
- The children! The children!
- They are safe, Muad'dib.

783
01:23:14,313 --> 01:23:18,972
I meddled in the future,
in all possible futures...

784
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:22,505
trying to create them.

785
01:23:24,413 --> 01:23:30,403
Instead, they created me,
and I became trapped by it.

786
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,606
Yes, but knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

787
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,646
The first step
along the Golden Path.

788
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:43,005
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer is right in front of you.

789
01:23:56,179 --> 01:23:58,407
Finally, I am free.

790
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,212
<i>History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

791
01:24:19,613 --> 01:24:24,772
<i>Those who wished an end
to House Atreides have failed.</i>

792
01:24:25,946 --> 01:24:30,504
<i>No longer an emperor,
no longer a god...</i>

793
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:35,739
<i>a simple blind Fremen wanders alone
into the desert to die.</i>

794
01:24:38,113 --> 01:24:40,977
They say he has gone on a journey...

795
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:46,077
into the land where men walk
without footprints.

796
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:49,670
He will not be found...

797
01:24:50,946 --> 01:24:53,378
yet all men will find him.

798
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:58,402
I wonder if that's what he wanted.

799
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:10,009
I need you, Duncan,
more than ever.

800
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,409
Stay with me.

801
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,735
<i>Muad'dib is gone,
but his children remain...</i>

802
01:26:05,812 --> 01:26:08,903
<i>and conspiracies continue to breed.</i>

803
01:26:10,213 --> 01:26:14,770
<i>The saga of Dune is far from over.</i>

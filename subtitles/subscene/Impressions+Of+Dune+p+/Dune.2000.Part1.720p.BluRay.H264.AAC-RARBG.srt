1
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,875
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,458
Dune.

3
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,250
Wasteland of the Empire...

4
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,250
...and the most valuable planet
in the universe...

5
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,667
...because it is here,
and only here, where spice is found.

6
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,750
The spice.

7
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,458
Without it,
there is no commerce in the Empire.

8
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,958
There is no civilization.

9
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,125
Arrakis.

10
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,917
Dune.

11
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,333
Home of the spice.

12
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,917
Greatest treasure in the universe.

13
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,917
And he who controls it,
controls our destiny.

14
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,375
Father!

15
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,375
Mentat engineers,
please report to fusion plants.

16
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,167
Life support technicians,
prepare for departure.

17
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:37,500
This move to Arrakis comes
at a delicate moment for House Atreides.

18
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,875
A test of your father's loyalty
to the Emperor.

19
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,875
You must remember, Paul...

20
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,667
...our society is a tangled web
of competing forces.

21
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,583
Our civilization rests upon
a political tripod...

22
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,250
...a most unstable of structures.

23
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,958
A deceptive balance of power exists
between the Emperor...

24
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,375
...the Congress of Royal Houses, and
the supposedly impartial Spacing Guild...

25
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,750
...with its invulnerable monopoly
on interstellar transport.

26
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,250
Complicated by a feudal trading culture
that turns its...

27
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,958
Dr. Yueh would be disappointed.

28
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,250
Then he'd know how I feel.

29
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,333
Attention.

30
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,042
Departure from Caladan airspace, 0-10:00.

31
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,417
It's never easy leaving one's home, Paul.

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,333
Think of this as a new adventure,
the adventure of a lifetime.

33
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,417
You call this an adventure:

34
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,917
Leaving our home for some dry speck
of dust in the middle of nowhere?

35
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,417
You're a duke's son.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
You have duties, responsibilities.

37
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,625
How could I ever forget?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,292
Every day I have to eat responsibility
for breakfast and duty for dinner.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,625
Sarcasm doesn't become you.

40
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,208
I just want to see my father.

41
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,875
So do I.

42
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,292
Attention.

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,083
Departure from Caladan airspace, 0-10:00.

44
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,292
All Atreides personnel,
please prepare for departure.

45
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,667
The Reverend Mother has arrived.

46
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,458
She wants to see you,
before we depart for Arrakis.

47
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,250
You have given him your face, Jessica.

48
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,042
But the father has given him his eyes.

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,917
And his courage.

50
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,417
We shall see.

51
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,750
Come here, boy.

52
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,917
Let me have a better look at you.

53
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,625
If you know what's good for you,
you'll do as I say.

54
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,708
I'll be the judge of what's good for me.

55
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,417
Your mother has taught you many things,
I see.

56
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,792
She tells me you dream.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Your Reverence...

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,583
- ...if I could...
- You're dismissed, Jessica.

59
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,375
Since when is it permitted to treat
the Lady Jessica as a common servant?

60
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,375
She was a common servant.

61
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,667
My servant.

62
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,292
And a good one, too...

63
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,958
...until she was 16,
and your father took her.

64
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,583
Now, I would like to hear
about your dreams.

65
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,042
They're just dreams.

66
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,375
About what?

67
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,708
Why don't you tell me?

68
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,708
Do you know what this is?

69
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,083
It is a test, young Atreides.

70
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,250
A test for what?

71
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,917
Put your hand inside, and we'll see.

72
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,708
What's in it?

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,083
Pain.

74
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,375
I hold the Gom Jabbar at your throat,
young Atreides.

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,292
Keep your hand in the box and live.

76
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,167
Remove it and die.

77
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,875
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

78
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,667
That's right, boy.

79
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,375
Pray.

80
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,250
I will face my fear,
I will let it pass through me.

81
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,167
And when the fear is gone,
there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

82
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,125
No woman, child,
ever withstood that much pain.

83
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,708
You are a gifted boy, young Atreides...

84
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,708
...but you have much to learn.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
He survived.

86
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,125
You should've warned me.

87
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,917
She was forbidden.

88
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,208
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,417
Paul.

90
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,208
You were supposed to have a daughter.

91
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,208
You have hopelessly complicated matters.

92
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,208
An Atreides daughter could've been wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

93
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,500
The feud between the houses
could've been ended.

94
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,167
My duke wanted a son.

95
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,083
You arrogant girl.

96
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,583
Putting his desires above our interests.

97
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,167
How dare you turn your back on
the centuries of our breeding programs.

98
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,792
I'll pay for my mistakes.

99
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,167
And your son will pay it with you.

100
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,667
We'll do what we can.

101
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,167
He may be worth saving...

102
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,083
...but for the father, nothing.

103
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,542
Good thing you don't play your baliset
as badly as you fight, Gurney-man.

104
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,542
It's too bad Duncan isn't here.

105
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,333
- Then I could get a real workout.
- Now you've done it.

106
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,042
Whoa, Gurney-man.

107
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,917
Never submit to anger.

108
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,125
Fast on defense, slow on the attack.

109
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,417
You forgot your first principle, Gurney.

110
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,708
Not likely.

111
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,333
Look down, lad.

112
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,833
Perhaps you'd like to sing soprano
next time I play.

113
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,292
Guess I'm just not in the mood today.

114
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,500
Not in the mood?

115
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,417
Mood is a thing for cattle and women,
young pup.

116
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,292
Mood is not for fighting.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,083
Even with the Weirding ways
your mother teaches you.

118
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,375
It's that old Bene Gesserit witch.

119
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,667
Something she said...

120
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,083
...or did.

121
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,625
The navigator is arriving.

122
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:09,625
Spacing Guild shuttle N-117
arriving central transportpart.

123
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,417
This zone is now restricted.

124
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,625
We'll be on our way to Arrakis soon.

125
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,042
It is said that they depend on the spice...

126
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,125
...and that without it, they can't navigate.

127
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,417
It is said.

128
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,625
They used to be human, didn't they?

129
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,208
Until the spice changed them.

130
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,792
I don't think anyone knows for sure.

131
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,708
I've never seen one.

132
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,917
No one has.

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,792
It's forbidden, Paul.

134
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,375
So don't endanger
our shipping privileges trying.

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,667
All non-Guild personnel,
please secure quarters.

136
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,667
Will Arrakis be as bad as they say, Thufir?

137
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,792
The storms, perhaps.

138
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,458
They can eat the flesh off your bones
as you stand.

139
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,958
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm is the giant worm.

140
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,750
It's not worms I worry about.

141
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,542
Your father is a formidable man, Paul.

142
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,833
Even the Emperor fears him.

143
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,750
I'd sooner cast my fate with him
than trust anything...

144
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,958
...some Bene Gesserit hag said.

145
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,625
Why do you hate them?

146
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,250
The Bene Gesserits?

147
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,958
I don't hate them.

148
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,917
I don't trust them.

149
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,917
I am a Mentat.

150
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:54,542
I trust logic and statistics,
not mysticism and prophecy.

151
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,917
Attention. All Atreides personnel,
restriction to quarters now in effect.

152
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,125
Please prepare for departure.

153
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,708
Spacing Guild navigator docking central
transport part. This zone is restricted.

154
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,417
Repeat.

155
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:24,208
Spacing Guild navigator docking central
transport part. This zone is restricted.

156
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,583
And so it begins.

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,667
The trap is set, the prey approaches.

158
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:26,083
A glorious winter is about to descend
on House Atreides and all its heirs.

159
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,750
The centuries of humiliation,
visited upon my family...

160
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,583
...will finally be avenged.

161
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,958
But Arrakis was mine!

162
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,542
Shut up, Rabban.

163
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,667
I did what you said, Uncle.

164
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,542
I made the people cower.

165
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,750
I crushed that vile planet.

166
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,333
He said "squeeze", brother, not "crush".

167
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:52,042
Rabban aspires to rule House Harkonnen
one day, Feyd.

168
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,542
And yet he can't even rule himself.

169
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,042
Explain our plan, Mentat.

170
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,917
The plan is elegant and vicious, dear Baron.

171
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,333
Of course it is.

172
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,917
I designed it.

173
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:10,917
In order for the Empire to survive,
the spice must flow.

174
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,125
But the production
has become inconsistent.

175
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:22,708
In his wisdom, the Emperor decided
only one man is honest enough...

176
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:27,792
...and loyal enough to be trusted with
restoring the spice production adequately.

177
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,292
Duke Leto Atreides.

178
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:35,208
Temporarily interrupting
80 years of Harkonnen rule...

179
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,792
...and all the profits that go with it.

180
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,000
I said "temporarily", you moron.

181
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,208
It doesn't take long for Duke Leto
to believe he has Arrakis...

182
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,500
...firmly under control.

183
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,667
And then,
at the moment of his greatest confidence...

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,792
The traitor strikes.

185
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,583
A traitor? Who?

186
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,875
That remains my little secret for now.

187
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,875
What about the other great houses?
They're sure to protest.

188
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,875
Perverting common wisdom, Nephew,
is a mark of all great conspiracies.

189
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,958
You see, Nephews,
a popular man arouses jealousy...

190
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,458
...and Duke Leto is a very popular man.

191
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,250
The other great houses
will be glad to get rid of him...

192
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,542
...even though they would never admit it.

193
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:20,750
The spice...

194
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,333
...will flow.

195
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,750
The Emperor will be pleased
and House Harkonnen...

196
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,333
...will be more powerful than ever.

197
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:36,458
Alone and vulnerable,
at the edge of the universe...

198
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,958
...valiant Duke Leto
will finally come face to face with fear.

199
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,917
When I'm through,
he won't know who to trust...

200
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:49,625
...not even that Bene Gesserit witch
he sleeps with.

201
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,833
They'll all be turning on one another
like rats in the flood.

202
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:58,500
By the time the traitor is fully revealed...

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,625
...the fate of Atreides
will already be sealed.

204
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,292
My son always says
you have a feline grace, Duncan.

205
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,667
I didn't want to startle you, Milord.

206
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,375
The latest emigration reports.

207
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,875
They fear our regime
will be as bad as the Harkonnens'.

208
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,250
We're losing too many.

209
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,167
Spice hunters, drivers, weather scanners,
dune men, we'll need.

210
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,667
Should I persuade some to stay?

211
00:18:58,667 --> 00:18:59,750
No.

212
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:02,958
I have something more important
for you to do.

213
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,833
I want you to go into the desert.

214
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,250
The Fremen?

215
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm getting reports of hundreds,
perhaps thousands, in villages...

216
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,542
...what they call "sietches".

217
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,125
In the deep desert.

218
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,917
Beyond the mountains.

219
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,917
The Harkonnen sneered
at the desert people.

220
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,750
Hunted them for sport.

221
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,042
- I doubt they'll expect any better from us.
- Then we have to change that.

222
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,833
We're going to need allies here, Duncan.

223
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:42,000
I want you to seek out their leader...

224
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,500
...this Liet I keep hearing about.

225
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,917
A phantom.

226
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,500
He may not even exist.

227
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,917
He could even be many different men.

228
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,292
Find out.

229
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:04,292
Negotiate patience so I can demonstrate
our good intentions with deeds.

230
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,583
If I'm lucky, they will judge all of us by you.

231
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,375
You honor me, sir.

232
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,583
I am endangering you and I know it...

233
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,000
...but you're the only one
I can trust with this.

234
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,667
That's a dusty little garrison town.

235
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,167
A testament of the harsh climate
of the place.

236
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,750
What's he doing?

237
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,875
Water seller, Milady.

238
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,250
You need never bother
with the likes of them.

239
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,042
The cistern at the palace
holds 50,000 gallons...

240
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,333
...and it's always kept full.

241
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
What's wrong with their eyes?

242
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,750
Those are Fremen, desert people.

243
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,333
It's the spice.

244
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,833
It's everywhere: the air, the food.

245
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:59,542
By the time a Fremen child is 12
his eyes have turned completely blue.

246
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,417
Guards everywhere.

247
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:39,417
We didn't have to live like this on Caladan.

248
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:43,375
Family apartments are in the west wing.
The furniture is being brought up.

249
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,000
What is this for?

250
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
An old custom, I'm told.

251
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Guests ceremoniously splash water
on the floor after washing their hands.

252
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,792
They save the squeezings.

253
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,458
Demeaning custom.

254
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,958
Idaho has prepared for us well, Milord.

255
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,167
Duncan?

256
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,583
Where is Duncan? Can I see him?

257
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,542
I have him occupied on official business
for the moment.

258
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,875
You must be patient.

259
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,458
I've assembled the general staff,
as you requested.

260
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,958
No, don't take it up there.

261
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,667
I want the coat of arms to hang here.

262
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,333
The first thing visitors must see.

263
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,458
This is House Atreides now.

264
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,125
We are not like the Harkonnen.

265
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,542
You will be treated here with respect.

266
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,625
From now on,
we speak the lady's language at all times.

267
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,833
The Shadout Mapes, Milady,
head of household staff.

268
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:07,625
Mapes, show Milady our apartments.
Make sure she has everything she needs.

269
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,417
I'll join you after the briefing.

270
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,917
This way, Milady.

271
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,583
Come, Paul.

272
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,000
The men are waiting.

273
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,083
Me?

274
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,292
Right now?

275
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,792
It's time you participated.

276
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:39,167
I've had the girls sandscrub these walls
to within a millimeter of their frames.

277
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,375
The Harkonnen stench is finally gone.

278
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,583
Built by off-worlders many years ago.

279
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:05,458
A chapel for the memories of what
they left behind when they came here.

280
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,833
A thousand people
could survive a year on the water...

281
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,208
...it takes to keep this place a month.

282
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,333
And a Harkonnen
never let us forget it, Milady.

283
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:39,125
Your name, Shadout,
it means "well-dipper", doesn't it?

284
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,833
I was raised in the desert sietches,
Noble-born.

285
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,708
Refer to me as Milady, Mapes.
I'm not noble-born.

286
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,417
I am the bound concubine of the duke.

287
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,500
There is no wife?

288
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:56,292
I'm his only companion,
the mother of his son.

289
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
You are Bene Gesserit.

290
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,417
Yes, I know the ancient tongues.

291
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,208
I'm trained in the ancient ways.

292
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,875
This place is precious.
It should be protected.

293
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,500
Tell the people, Mapes,
this place belongs to them now.

294
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,792
As long as we rule here...

295
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,458
...the Atreides family
will keep it in trust for them.

296
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:41,875
Stay there.

297
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,333
Give them back their money.

298
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:50,167
Go on.

299
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,125
It is a custom, Milady.

300
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,833
This custom stops now.

301
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,125
Do as I said.

302
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,125
Do as I said.

303
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:04,542
Water will never again be sold
at the Atreides' door.

304
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,125
At the end of every meal,
any person who calls at this door...

305
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,125
...may receive a full cup, free.

306
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,333
Is it possible?

307
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,417
Could it be possible
that she brings the Mahdi?

308
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,625
The thing must take its course.

309
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:37,417
What about the mining accounts?

310
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,292
The Harkonnen spice operation took...

311
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,292
...10 billion solaris out of here every year.

312
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:51,375
Now, does anyone here still think that the
Harkonnen have just packed up and left?

313
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,083
Gurney, I want you to make contact...

314
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,083
...with the smugglers
operating in the deep desert.

315
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,875
Tell them that we'll ignore
what they're doing from now on...

316
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,458
...as long as they make it worth our while.

317
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,958
The Emperor is extremely jealous
of his spice profits, Milord.

318
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,375
It's one thing
to turn a blind eye to smugglers.

319
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,542
It's quite another
to pocket some of their earnings.

320
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:22,042
Well, then just tell him what we're doing.

321
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,167
Bank the entire amount to his name,
Shaddam IV.

322
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:35,625
But then deduct it from our taxes
as a legitimate expense.

323
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,958
In other words, cost of doing business.

324
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,542
What?

325
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,208
I would just love to see the Baron's face
when he hears of this.

326
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:56,708
All the Harkonnen parasites
who got rich taking smuggler bribes...

327
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,208
...will be flushed into the open.

328
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,000
No more graft.

329
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,333
The Emperor cannot deny this.

330
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,833
Not in public, anyhow.

331
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,792
Well done, lad.

332
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,083
Now...

333
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,667
An emperor's daughter must do better.

334
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,167
Worthy to be your first-born.

335
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,083
They tell me her ambitions
tend more to the literary than the political.

336
00:28:55,375 --> 00:29:00,042
Never underestimate the political uses
of an awakened mind, Majesty.

337
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:05,333
Subterfuge and cunning are often
better allies than a fierce heart...

338
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,750
...and a strong back.

339
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,750
All she lacks is the primacy of our gender.

340
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,750
Then you must marry her well.

341
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:19,125
Someone with a suitably
pliable personality.

342
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,625
Too bad it won't be that young Atreides.

343
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,917
The most admirable lad, I'm told.

344
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,625
Good union of breeding and training.

345
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,833
We must arrange to send Duke Leto
a token of our love.

346
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,000
He must continue to think of us fondly.

347
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:58,208
Why did we come here, Father?

348
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:01,583
And don't just tell me
it's a matter of honor or duty.

349
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,375
There's more to it, isn't there?

350
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,583
I've never lied to you, Son.

351
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:21,875
We've been entrusted with the most
profitable commodity in the universe.

352
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,667
That alone makes us many enemies.

353
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,750
Then why don't we call them out?

354
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,583
Expose them...

355
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,458
...in front of the Emperor.

356
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,583
What if he's one of them?

357
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,875
This is a hard lesson, Son.

358
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,958
In the world we live in,
self-interest governs all.

359
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,833
The Emperor needs us...

360
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:55,625
...for the moment, to administer Arrakis,
to make the spice flow.

361
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,458
But he fears us, Paul.

362
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,917
He fears my influence
among the great houses.

363
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:09,625
If he decides it's in his interests...

364
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:14,417
...that House Atreides should fall,
he will do nothing to stop it.

365
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,000
He might even...

366
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,000
...invite opportunity to hasten it.

367
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,833
Well then, if you're right,
this place is a trap.

368
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,917
Perhaps.

369
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:35,083
But knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

370
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,208
I should've taken
the House Atreides renegade...

371
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,792
...fled to the darkest corners
of the universe.

372
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:49,083
You're too honorable for that, my love.

373
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,875
No. I'm too fed up.

374
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,583
This endless feud stops here.

375
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,750
The Harkonnen are a rogue clan, Leto.

376
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,750
No matter how much prestige
they try to buy...

377
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,958
...they'll never have the respect
you've earned.

378
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,333
Respect can't buy us peace.

379
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,958
I'd trade it all for a place somewhere.

380
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:33,542
Anywhere where we could be alone,
where Paul could be safe.

381
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,917
And all I had to think about
was your happiness.

382
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,208
Maybe then I could finally make...

383
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,500
Please, don't talk about things
that can't be.

384
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:06,500
You belong to your time,
I was bred to my destiny.

385
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,917
Even if I were able to go back and choose...

386
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,292
...I would change nothing.

387
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,917
One of yours, Turok?

388
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,042
Harkonnen mercenaries.

389
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,625
Someone is signaling from the palace.

390
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:37,500
Save your strength for the desert, Atreides.
Word has already been sent to the palace.

391
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,417
We have people among you.

392
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:43,208
- Are they trustworthy?
- They are Fremen.

393
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,125
I'll take care of these.

394
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,875
I didn't mean to intrude.

395
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,583
Forgive me, Milady.
I was enjoying the morning.

396
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,250
For a moment,
I could imagine my wife walking there.

397
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:48,833
My Suk conditioning is supposed to rid me
of such unstable emotions as hope.

398
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,250
Still, it's all I have left.

399
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,625
We have spies everywhere, Dr. Yueh.

400
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,458
If she's still alive we'll find her.

401
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,542
Seems almost a sacrilege...

402
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,917
...wasting one's water
in a land starved for it.

403
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,208
Well, I'm sorry we dragged you here
to this dangerous place.

404
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,333
I came willingly, Milady.

405
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,417
Only half the sandcrawlers are operable...

406
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,500
...but we'll have most of the ornithopters
working soon.

407
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,708
That is a harvester factory.

408
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,500
We have about 1,000.

409
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,000
As big as she is,
there are worms in the deep desert...

410
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
...that could swallow one whole.

411
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,083
Why don't we use shields?

412
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,375
Shields are useless in the desert.

413
00:36:56,083 --> 00:37:00,458
Even a simple body shield
will call every worm within 100 kilometers.

414
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,958
Drives them into a killing frenzy.

415
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:06,083
The imperial ecologist, Milord, Dr. Kynes.

416
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,167
We prefer the traditional term,
planetologist.

417
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:13,083
I understand that we have you to thank
for our stillsuits.

418
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,875
I hope they fit well.

419
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:19,167
This is basically a high-efficiency filter
and heat-exchange system.

420
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,542
The skin layer is porous.

421
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:25,833
Perspiration passes through heat filaments
and salt precipitators.

422
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:31,958
Water is reclaimed in catchpockets,
which you can draw from this tube.

423
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,333
Properly adjusted, water loss
is kept under 15 milliliters a day.

424
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,833
That's hardly measurable.

425
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,542
That's the point.

426
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,917
You're a Fremen.

427
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,333
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

428
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,708
But I am in the Emperor's employ.

429
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,833
You've worn a stillsuit before?

430
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:01,208
This is the first time.

431
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,500
Someone adjusted it for you?

432
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,000
No, it just seemed the right way
to put it on, that's all.

433
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,708
Well then...

434
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,000
...the desert awaits.

435
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,958
Maintain 120 degrees southeast, Milord.

436
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,292
Set.

437
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,458
That's where the sandmaster
is concentrating his equipment.

438
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,375
How many men are there
on a mining crew?

439
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,750
As few as possible.

440
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,167
Mining is a perilous adventure at best,
Milord.

441
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,042
Has anyone ever been lost out this far
and survived?

442
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:08,250
Men have walked out of the nearer zones
by crossing the rock areas...

443
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,167
...where worms seldom go.

444
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,167
Fremen?

445
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,833
Fremen.

446
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,125
There it is.

447
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,833
That's the harvester.

448
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,417
And those are the scouts?

449
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,625
Yes.

450
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,125
Watching for wormsign.

451
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,542
"Wormsign"?

452
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,417
Wherever there is spice, there are worms.

453
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:29,625
Always?

454
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,708
They defend the spice sands.

455
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,500
Has there been an effort to wipe them out?

456
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,417
Too much area to cover. Too many worms.

457
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,208
A rich field by the look of the color.

458
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:46,792
Is that wormsign?

459
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:53,917
Where's the carryall
to evacuate the harvester?

460
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:56,083
Wormsign, approximately 40 kilometers.

461
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,292
He's got you.

462
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,417
Estimated intercept, six minutes.

463
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,417
Do they always cut it this close?

464
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,292
It's not standard procedure.
The carryall should be here.

465
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:07,083
- How many men on that harvester?
- Usually 23, Milord.

466
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,875
- Are we sure the worm will attack?
- No doubt about it.

467
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,500
Crew on the harvester,
this is Duke Leto Atreides.

468
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,167
We're taking you out. Cease operations
and prepare for evacuation.

469
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,792
Spotters, land to the west.
Prepare to be boarded.

470
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,792
Those spotters only carry four men,
in addition to the crew.

471
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:22,958
We can only get two in here.

472
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,792
You two work on the back seats.
We'll jettison them when we land.

473
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:26,667
That'll get in three more.

474
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:32,167
This is harvester Delta Ajax Niner.
Sir, we have almost a full load.

475
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:35,667
Damn the spice.
We can always get more. Prepare for evac.

476
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,042
That's an order!

477
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,750
Worm sighting. 10 degrees southwest.

478
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:49,542
Estimated speed, 40 knots.
We have an approach.

479
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,542
Worm intercept, five minutes.

480
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,625
Sandmaster,
this is a command from your duke.

481
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,625
Cease operations
and evacuate the station immediately...

482
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,708
...or I'll cut your ship in two with a lasgun.

483
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,083
I can hear it.

484
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,417
The worm.

485
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,000
I can hear it coming.

486
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,500
Over here! Over here!

487
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,667
Both of you, over here!

488
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,583
The rest to the spotters!

489
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,292
Run, you sand dogs, run!

490
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,667
Get down and hang onto anything you can.

491
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,875
What are they doing?

492
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,750
Milord, we must go now! Hurry!

493
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:16,708
Capacity overload.

494
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:23,083
We need altitude or it'll suck us down.

495
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,875
Capacity overload.

496
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,000
Capacity exceeds lift capability.

497
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,083
Bless the Maker and his water.

498
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,375
Bless his coming and his going.

499
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,958
May his passage cleanse the world.

500
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,542
May he keep the world for his people.

501
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,542
How about the men left behind?

502
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:10,167
- Send a ship to search for them.
- But they were right by the worm...

503
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,333
Send a ship anyway.

504
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:14,125
When God ordains a man's time to die...

505
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:19,250
...he directs that man to the proper place.

506
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:20,917
Paul.

507
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:25,250
I want the pilots from that missing carryall
delivered to me personally.

508
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,333
Someone's going to pay for that waste.

509
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,542
This is a different kind of man.

510
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:40,417
He risked his life and that of his son
to save the men instead of the spice.

511
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:45,792
A leader like that could have commanded
fanatic loyalty.

512
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,292
This is my legacy to you, Son.

513
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:02,708
The greatest wealth in the universe
and the never-ending struggle to defend it.

514
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,083
The ancients used to say
danger and opportunity were...

515
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,375
...often the same thing.

516
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,375
This is not one of Yueh's
academic exercises, Paul.

517
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,875
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea.

518
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,167
And here we need desert power.

519
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,167
Desert power.

520
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:33,083
Remember that.

521
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,750
Mahdi, Mahdi.

522
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,833
Leto is growing more popular
with every passing week.

523
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:12,417
He has ruined our system
of bribes and patronage.

524
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:17,000
He's been able to maintain the spice quota
despite our sabotage.

525
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:21,625
Even that mongrel ecologist Kynes
is sending the Emperor favorable reports.

526
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,417
And what do you deduce
from all of this, Nephew?

527
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:28,625
The longer we wait,
the harder it will be to dislodge him.

528
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,292
Piter, try again, will you?

529
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:39,083
Leto's continued success makes
the other great houses nervous, Rabban.

530
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:45,083
We can hear whispers, petty jealousies
that could easily give birth...

531
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,208
...to considerable envy.

532
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,708
Bugger envy!

533
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,667
We have a traitor among them.

534
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:53,375
I say strike now!

535
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,083
For your approval, Uncle.

536
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,542
The slave is quite a specimen this time,
don't you think, Rabban?

537
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,458
Perhaps Feyd
shouldn't be quite so casual today.

538
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,375
No.

539
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,833
Perhaps my dear brother
might even break a sweat today.

540
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,458
What you fail to understand...

541
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,417
...is that I want Leto to become popular.

542
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,917
I want him to feel secure.

543
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:49,625
I want him to feel confident.

544
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,000
Confidence breeds distraction.

545
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,500
And that is when one is most vulnerable.

546
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,667
Such a beautiful boy.

547
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:55,875
Little is known about the sandworms
that inhabit the desert regions of Arrakis.

548
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,167
It is known that worms are drawn...

549
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:01,250
...to the vibration and noise
of mining activity.

550
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:06,750
However, there is no direct evidence
linking desert worms to spice production.

551
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,083
Needs a new dew collector.

552
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:08,583
Dew collector?

553
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,167
Chromaplastic.

554
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,167
At night it cools very fast.

555
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,167
In the morning, daylight heats it.

556
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:22,083
The surface condenses moisture
out of the air...

557
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:26,958
...and it trickles down
to keep the plants alive.

558
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,875
- A simple beauty.
- A meaningless beauty.

559
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,458
In such a godforsaken place.

560
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,333
We deal here with the law of the minimum.

561
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,333
Unless we learn to live with it,
conditions can never change.

562
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:52,042
Are you saying that conditions here
could change?

563
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,125
Favorable conditions?

564
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,625
To change the ecology of the planet?

565
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,125
That depends.

566
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,917
On what?

567
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,625
On who the steward of the desert is.

568
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,708
Perhaps one day the person will come
who will understand...

569
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,417
...who will see the future
and know what can be.

570
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,583
The one who will change Arrakis:

571
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,292
The Mahdi.

572
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,167
You asked me to inquire
about the shouting the other day.

573
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,292
The words they were calling out
at your shuttle.

574
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,375
"Mahdi", something like that.

575
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,083
It means "messiah".

576
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,458
They have a legend here, a prophesy...

577
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,167
...that a leader will come to them
from off-world.

578
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,958
A boy. The only son of a Bene Gesserit.

579
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,958
To guide them to true freedom.

580
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,375
Messiah?

581
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,375
Paul?

582
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,667
These are a simple people, Milord.

583
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,667
They survive on hope.

584
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,250
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

585
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:04,208
I'm sorry, Milord.

586
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,500
Mapes didn't tell me you were in here.

587
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,125
No wait.

588
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:11,917
It's fine.

589
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,083
I was tired.

590
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,083
I fell asleep.

591
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,875
You can go on about your work.

592
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,667
Tell me...

593
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,542
...do the cooks use much spice in our food?

594
00:53:56,875 --> 00:54:00,250
The spice is everywhere on Arrakis, Milord.

595
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,833
Everywhere.

596
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,917
Don't move.

597
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:26,042
Just do exactly as I say.

598
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,333
It's a hunter-seeker.

599
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,500
They will kill you...

600
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,417
...instantly, if you move.

601
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:51,917
Listen to me.

602
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,917
The operator, wherever he is...

603
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,917
...can only target movement.

604
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,375
Stay perfectly still.

605
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,000
Don't give in.

606
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,875
Fear is the mind killer.

607
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,042
You're lucky to be alive.

608
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,750
I was its target?

609
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,125
It goes toward movement, that's all.

610
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,708
You could have let it go
and saved yourself.

611
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,792
There is a traitor among you.

612
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,000
Someone close.

613
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,917
Someone very close.

614
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,792
I want him alive!

615
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,667
Hey, you!

616
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:22,167
They tried to take the life of my son!

617
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:23,250
He looks local.

618
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,042
- There's nothing to identify him.
- Harkonnen, surely.

619
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,833
- And not working alone...
- Stop it, both of you!

620
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:35,833
Burn him.

621
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,125
Everything except the hands.

622
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,917
Put some spice in each one...

623
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:50,625
...and send them to the Baron
on Giedi Prime.

624
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,333
He almost took the life of my son.

625
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:04,375
Get out, all of you! Out!

626
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,250
You simple ass.

627
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,875
I told you that I wanted
those bastard Atreides to feel secure.

628
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,750
But no, you couldn't wait.
You had to have your own way.

629
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,667
Now your initiative
has made them more defensive.

630
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,958
Now what, Piter?

631
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,958
Advancing our timetable
would seem appropriate at this point.

632
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,750
Another blinding burst of insight!

633
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,750
How is it that I am blessed with such
extraordinary counselors as these?

634
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,042
There is, of course,
the slight troop-transport problem.

635
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,333
Our negotiations with the Spacing Guild
are not yet concluded.

636
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,333
Damn the Guild and their navigators.

637
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:47,708
Even the Emperor can't move without the
blessing of the Spacing Guild, dear Baron.

638
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:51,125
And what would you suggest,
my most devious Mentat?

639
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:55,833
Offer an increase in spice royalties...

640
00:58:56,417 --> 00:59:00,917
...payable in advance
from Rabban's own reserves...

641
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,833
You are out of your mind, you...

642
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:04,917
Get on with it, Piter.

643
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:08,625
We must try and turn this setback
to our advantage.

644
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:13,583
Perhaps your incompetence
will prove useful after all...

645
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,917
...and hasten the day
House Atreides must fall.

646
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,667
You're tired, Father.

647
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:42,083
Yes, I am tired.

648
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:47,875
The degeneration of the great houses
has worn me out.

649
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,083
Our house hasn't degenerated.

650
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:52,667
Hasn't it?

651
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:56,250
Your assassin didn't arrive here
without help.

652
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,458
But who could you suspect?

653
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,167
I can only suspect.

654
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,542
I can't prove...

655
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:05,250
...and there's suspicion enough
to go around.

656
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,667
It can't be Gurney.

657
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,958
He knew your assassin
would be more valuable alive.

658
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:13,333
Gurney's impulsive, Father.
He doesn't have that kind of cunning.

659
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,333
Or Yueh's intelligence.

660
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,042
Surely not Yueh?

661
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,625
His Suk conditioning
would drive him mad first.

662
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:24,750
Never let sentiment
cloud your judgment, Son.

663
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,917
There is someone.

664
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,417
Sooner or later
you must face whoever it is.

665
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,833
So this is how it works.

666
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,333
They sow the seeds of distrust...

667
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:46,792
...and get us to fear each other.

668
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,708
Learn this lesson well, Son.

669
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:56,708
If you want to hold Arrakis,
you must be ready to fight fear with fear.

670
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,500
Fear and power.

671
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,000
That's our cue.

672
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
The man in silver
is a stillsuit manufacturer in Carthag.

673
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,583
An inferior product to the Fremen's.

674
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,875
The hard-faced woman next to him
runs an escort service in Arsunt.

675
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:40,792
Impressive client list, I'm told.

676
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:46,750
By the fireplace, Lingar Bewt,
water shipper from the polar region.

677
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,167
The man to his right...

678
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:50,958
A Spacing Guild representative.
How could I miss him?

679
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:55,042
The man with Thufir is Esmar Tuek,
smuggler, highly successful.

680
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,917
He has fast ships if we need them.

681
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,042
Milady, Milord...

682
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:05,250
...I was honored by the invitation.

683
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,042
You are always welcome here, Dr. Kynes.

684
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:13,542
We found the missing carryall, Milord,
hijacked by Harkonnen agents...

685
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:16,917
...who tried to sell it at a smuggler's camp.

686
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,500
They are now dead.

687
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,792
We are indebted to you, sir.

688
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:30,792
Milady will see to it
you have everything you need.

689
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,208
It will be my pleasure.

690
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,208
And my honor, Milady.

691
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:41,500
I understand they lost another harvester
to a worm.

692
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:46,875
If they keep this up, they won't even be
able to have enough money to buy water.

693
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:57,292
Gentlemen and ladies, Her Royal Majesty,
Princess Irulan Corrino.

694
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:08,875
Your Highness, your attendance
is a most welcome delight.

695
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:13,875
My father sends you his enduring respect
and affection, my Lord Duke.

696
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:21,250
The Emperor wishes everyone to know
of the confidence he has in House Atreides.

697
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:37,125
She brings the Emperor's Sardaukar killers
as her bodyguards.

698
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,625
Water customs here are so fascinating...

699
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,125
...don't you think, Your Highness?

700
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:03,417
When I arrived, my bathing towels
were hurried away almost before I was dry.

701
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:06,208
To save their squeezings, I assume.

702
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,833
That's a safe assumption.

703
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:11,417
Nothing about this place is fascinating.

704
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,583
If it weren't for the spice,
no one would bother about it at all.

705
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:23,667
Fortunately enough,
for a water seller like you, I would guess.

706
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:29,250
I enjoy watching the flight of birds
here on Arrakis.

707
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:32,458
Many exist without any water at all.

708
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,333
Carrion eaters, you know, blood drinkers.

709
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,417
A curious adaptation, don't you think?

710
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,625
You mean they are cannibals?

711
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:45,792
I said they drink blood,
not necessarily the blood of their own kind.

712
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:47,625
Why not?

713
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,333
One's fiercest competition
comes from one's own kind.

714
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:54,417
They eat from the same bowl.

715
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:05,417
It's said that Fremen
drink the blood of their dead.

716
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,125
Isn't that so, Dr. Kynes?

717
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,292
Not the blood, sir.

718
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,000
All of a man's water.

719
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:18,625
A necessity
when one lives in the deep desert.

720
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,583
The human body is 70 percent water.

721
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:26,208
Surely a dead man no longer requires it.

722
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,792
At least here is honest merrymaking.

723
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,083
Careful, lad.

724
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,167
That spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

725
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,250
Play, Gurney.

726
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,458
Let's you and I at least have some peace.

727
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,667
When the son of my beloved duke
orders me to relax...

728
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,458
...then, by God, I intend to do so.

729
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:14,333
Is that how you really feel, Gurney-man...

730
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,125
...about my father?

731
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:19,625
"Beloved"?

732
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,250
You young pup.

733
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:29,333
If I didn't know better, I would take
those words for an accusation.

734
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,250
It was a simple question.

735
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:41,625
Your father rescued me
from a Harkonnen slave pit, boy.

736
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:47,125
He took me into his household,
groomed me as his war master.

737
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The man or woman...

738
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:55,208
...that raises a hand against him...

739
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:59,083
...will have it cut off by me,
as a prelude to their death.

740
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:07,083
I'm ashamed of myself doubting you,
Gurney-man.

741
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,792
That's enough, lad. No more of this.

742
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:28,083
Gentlemen and ladies,
I use the terms loosely of course.

743
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:31,292
I, the Baron Harkonnen...

744
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:36,875
...have decided that the great seal
of our venerable house...

745
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:40,667
...that confused and ugly Chimera,
the griffin...

746
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:46,750
...no longer adequately represents
the ambition of our appetites.

747
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:51,667
Therefore and henceforth, in conclusion
and furthermore, ergo and et cetera...

748
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:56,042
...our ample and royal self...

749
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:59,458
...from this day forth,
and throughout the universe...

750
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:03,542
...we shall no longer be known
as House Harkonnen.

751
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,042
We shall be...

752
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,125
...House Hog.

753
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:26,542
Now I know why they say
your skill with a knife...

754
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:30,333
...is exceeded only by your mastery
of the baliset, Gurney Halleck.

755
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:44,750
Is it Atreides custom
to abandon an honored guest...

756
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,417
...without even the courtesy
of a lame excuse?

757
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,917
Forgive me, Your Highness.

758
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,417
Careful.

759
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,625
Spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

760
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,708
So I've noticed.

761
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,625
You were expecting someone
more delicate, perhaps?

762
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:17,208
"Refined" was the word I had in mind,
actually.

763
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,500
There's an ancient saying
I've learned to trust:

764
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,583
"Never judge a book by its cover."

765
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:29,208
We are not all that different, Paul Atreides,
you and me.

766
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,792
You don't know what you're talking about.

767
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,083
I've heard all about the moody Paul...

768
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:41,500
...the grim Paul,
the angry and unhappy Paul...

769
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,500
...who has been exiled to Arrakis where,
poor boy...

770
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:49,167
...one day he will inherit responsibility
for the greatest treasure in the universe.

771
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:51,875
And a never-ending struggle to defend it.

772
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,875
We both suffer the solitude
of our birthright.

773
01:09:55,875 --> 01:10:00,958
Except that tomorrow you will return
to the comfort of your palaces on Kaitain.

774
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:04,167
To the confinement of its perfect gardens
and lonely apartments.

775
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,958
To your servants and entourage.

776
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:08,750
With their slavish flattery
and cautious conversation.

777
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,542
As an heir to an Emperor.

778
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,958
Who damns my mother
for bearing daughters instead of sons.

779
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,250
You're mocking me.

780
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:22,250
No.

781
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,542
I'm trying to interest you.

782
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:36,333
Are you gonna dance with me
or just stand there looking confused?

783
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,708
I didn't want to come here, you know.

784
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,917
Being an ornament
of my father's diplomacy...

785
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,417
...is hardly my idea of a good time.

786
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:03,792
But you turned out to be more complicated
than your reputation.

787
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And I like complicated.

788
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,167
We've been looking for you, Your Highness.

789
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:18,500
So now you've found me.

790
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,792
- Have you been hurt?
- Be still, Captain.

791
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:24,167
The Princess has been
under my protection.

792
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:25,583
Oh, please.

793
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:29,375
- Gurney, hold.
- Stand down, Captain.

794
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:33,083
- Gurney.
- I said stand down, Captain!

795
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:37,250
It's late, Highness. The shuttle awaits.

796
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,875
I am not ready to go.

797
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,250
Your father left strict orders.

798
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,250
You see?

799
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,667
Perhaps we should be the adults here.

800
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:52,167
Set an example
for our hot-tempered friends.

801
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:56,958
You are more interesting than you appear,
Paul Atreides.

802
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,750
I hope this won't be our last encounter.

803
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:06,250
My father will no doubt reward you
for such mindless obedience, Captain.

804
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:42,208
Muad'Dib.

805
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,000
Muad'Dib.

806
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:10,667
Father?

807
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,708
Duncan?

808
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,917
Forgive the abrupt arrival, Milord.

809
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:47,208
But we've taken
a force of Harkonnen infiltrators.

810
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:50,417
The Fremen found them
in the cave of the shield mountains.

811
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:53,625
One of the Fremen, Turok,
was badly wounded.

812
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:56,917
- I rushed him here for treatment...
- But he has died.

813
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:01,917
This is Stilgar, Milord...

814
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:04,000
...leader of Turok's tribe.

815
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:08,917
We've heard many things in the desert
about Leto Atreides.

816
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:12,292
I hope what you've heard
will be the beginning...

817
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:14,292
...of a friendship between us.

818
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:22,292
My people have suffered long
under the rule of such as you.

819
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,792
No, not such as me, nor any of my family.

820
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,792
All that changed
when the House Atreides came to Arrakis.

821
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,167
Duncan?

822
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,667
Paul.

823
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:49,958
Stilgar, this is my son, Paul Atreides.

824
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,458
Yes.

825
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,958
We have heard about him as well.

826
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:58,167
The Fremen want me
to remain with them, Milord.

827
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:02,958
He fights well.

828
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,125
And he has done his best for our friend.

829
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,125
It will reassure us.

830
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,917
Dual allegiance, Milord,
to you and to their tribe.

831
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,417
There is a precedent.

832
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,625
Liet serves two masters.

833
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,792
Let it be known among your people,
Stilgar, that Duke Leto Atreides...

834
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:42,625
...honors the sacrifice
that your warrior has made on our behalf.

835
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,917
I wish nothing but peace between us.

836
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:03,167
We thank you for the gift
of your body's water, Stilgar...

837
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:08,083
...and accept it in the spirit
with which it was given.

838
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:15,958
Duncan Idaho...

839
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:19,750
...your water now belongs to us.

840
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,875
The body of our friend, Turok,
remains with your duke.

841
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,875
His water now belongs to the Atreides.

842
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,167
That is the bond between us.

843
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,833
Mapes? Mapes!

844
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,750
Mapes, who did this? Who?

845
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,917
Traitor.

846
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:03,042
Who?

847
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:04,917
Guard dead.

848
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,042
Shields.

849
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:09,708
The shields.

850
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,500
Gurney!

851
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:53,375
Yueh?

852
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:59,167
God forgive me.

853
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,750
I had no choice.

854
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,375
Why?

855
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,750
Why?

856
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,375
Because I need to save my wife.

857
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,333
We haven't much time.

858
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:21,542
The Harkonnen will be in the palace soon.

859
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,625
I'm giving you the final revenge, Milord...

860
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,625
...for this terrible thing I've done
to you and your family.

861
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,542
You will have your revenge, Milord,
I promise.

862
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,833
Just remember the tooth.

863
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,417
The tooth, Milord.

864
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,917
When you have the Baron face to face...

865
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:49,125
...remember the tooth.

866
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,167
An Emperor's Sardaukar.

867
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,167
The duke! Where is the duke!

868
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:39,583
Not in quarters, sir.
We can't find the young master either.

869
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:42,250
Bastards!

870
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,250
No prisoners.

871
01:20:56,542 --> 01:21:01,333
So, as soon as the city is pacified, Piter...

872
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:05,250
...remove all of the Sardaukar troops
to our frigate.

873
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:09,833
No trace of the Emperor's involvement
must ever be found here.

874
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,542
Piter.

875
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,625
A pity she has to remain gagged.

876
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:20,917
She has such a magnificent mouth.

877
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:24,833
A pretty mouth
with the sting of a scorpion.

878
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:29,208
We know all about
your Bene Gesserit witchery, my dear.

879
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,500
Perhaps I should cut your vocal cords...

880
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,208
...and then Piter
could have his way with you.

881
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:40,125
But then again, perhaps not.

882
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:47,208
No blood on my hands.

883
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:50,583
I have no idea what happened to you.

884
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,875
So when I see the Emperor's...

885
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:57,208
...wrinkled old bitch of a truthsayer...

886
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:01,083
...I suppose I'll just have to say,
"Don't know."

887
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:12,375
Aim for the desert.

888
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:15,875
Let the worms clean up the mess.

889
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:19,167
The bodies must never be found.

890
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:36,833
He looks sufficiently paralyzed.

891
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:40,250
My half of the bargain, Baron.

892
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:43,167
I promised you the duke. There he is.

893
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,125
Well, it's a delicious sight, Doctor.

894
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,333
Now it's time for your half.

895
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:52,125
And believe it or not,
I'm a man of my word.

896
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,833
Where is she?

897
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,917
You promised we'd be reunited.

898
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,125
You said you'd free her
if I did what you asked.

899
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,833
Well, I've done it.

900
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:05,833
So where is she?

901
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:08,417
Your wife is free, my good doctor.

902
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Completely free.

903
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,292
Free of her mortal coil.

904
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,792
Free of her physical cage.

905
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,500
I've freed her.

906
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:39,583
I promised you'd be reunited,
and I'm a man of my word.

907
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,875
As now you can see.

908
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:50,167
You think you've defeated me.

909
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:57,083
Never trust a traitor.

910
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,083
Not even one you create.

911
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:03,750
My noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
I hope so.

912
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:08,958
I kept you alive so you could witness
every precious moment of your betrayal.

913
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:15,958
What?

914
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,042
Paul.

915
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:18,833
Oh, the boy.

916
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:22,833
I don't know, I left him to the desert,
he and that gorgeous woman of yours.

917
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:27,250
My men left them to explore
the beauty of the sands of Arrakis.

918
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,542
Perhaps they'll see some worms.

919
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:34,625
We couldn't have all that noble blood
all over our hands, could we?

920
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:38,125
The Emperor was quite insistent
about that.

921
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:39,625
Yes...

922
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,625
...your beloved Emperor.

923
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:46,125
Just goes to show,
never get more popular than the boss.

924
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:48,833
Unless you intend to sack him.

925
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:52,208
Did I say that? How impolitic of me.

926
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:56,208
I must be spending too much time
with that idiot nephew of mine, Rabban.

927
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,000
You won't say anything will you,
my dear man?

928
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,292
Perhaps we should get on with it, then.

929
01:25:01,292 --> 01:25:02,917
Get on with it?

930
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:04,708
This is kanly, Piter!

931
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,292
Vendetta!

932
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:10,792
And I am going to savor
every minute of it.

933
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:16,083
My family has hated the Atreides
for generations.

934
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:22,083
They have been the sand in our eyes,
the stink at our meals...

935
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:28,083
...these arrogant Atreides,
always standing in our way.

936
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:33,083
I want Leto to appreciate the beauty...

937
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,667
...of what I've done to him.

938
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:41,083
I want him to know that I,
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen...

939
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,458
...am the instrument
of his family's demise...

940
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:48,542
...the extinction of House Atreides...

941
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:52,250
...and the ascendancy of House Harkonnen.

942
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,333
The tooth.

943
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,750
What did he say?

944
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,333
Tooth.

945
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:05,042
What did he say, Piter?

946
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,625
The tooth.

947
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,833
No!

948
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:43,500
Need you more proof
of what heaven's choice is?

949
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:48,583
Atreides is dead, and Harkonnen lives!

950
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:00,292
He's dead.

951
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:09,250
Father's dead.

952
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:23,542
- What are you doing?
- We won't survive long in the open.

953
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,833
We must find shelter.

954
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,833
But Harkonnen patrols.

955
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,042
Worms.

956
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,958
We have to take our chances.

957
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,500
One of ours?

958
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:10,000
We can't take the chance.

959
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,583
Could be Harkonnen
coming to finish the job.

960
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:34,458
Hurry! Harkonnen patrol ships
are in the area, approaching fast.

961
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,458
Strap in.

962
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:17,750
- What is this place?
- A Fremen sietch. A small one.

963
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:21,333
There's a storm coming.
We can stay here until it passes.

964
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,542
Liet, we must talk.

965
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,417
Rest here.

966
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:34,917
How did you know where to find us?

967
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:36,917
Dr. Yueh sent a courier.

968
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:40,625
Said you were being taken to the bled,
south of the mountain shield.

969
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,417
Milord...

970
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:47,000
...I'm supposed to give you this.

971
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:18,667
Harkonnen patrols are in the area.

972
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:21,583
- They tracked our thopter.
- They called you Liet.

973
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,167
You're the one, aren't you?

974
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:31,375
The one who's never seen,
the one who may not even exist at all.

975
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:33,958
Their leader.

976
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:36,167
I prefer the term "guide" to "leader".

977
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:37,667
Guiding them?

978
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:39,833
Until Mahdi comes.

979
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,042
Harkonnen thopters approaching.

980
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,333
Milord.

981
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,458
- You're coming with us?
- No.

982
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:50,333
- They'll kill you.
- Me?

983
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,625
I'm Dr. Kynes.

984
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,750
I work for the Emperor, you remember?

985
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,125
I'll just say I was your hostage.

986
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,333
Milord, please.

987
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:12,625
I must remain with the Fremen, Milord,
as I promised your father.

988
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,667
Just hold on.

989
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:15,375
We can't lose them.

990
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,333
Paul, the storm. We can't go into that.

991
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:38,125
We have no choice.

992
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:40,542
Nothing survives one of those storms.

993
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:44,042
Unless they want to die,
they won't follow us in, will they?

994
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,625
I must not fear.

995
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,792
Fear is the mind killer.

996
01:33:00,792 --> 01:33:04,208
I will face my fear,
and I will let it pass through me.

997
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:07,000
When the fear is gone
there will be nothing.

998
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,708
Only I will remain.

999
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,583
There is a legend that the night
House Atreides lost Arrakis...

1000
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:22,292
...a star exploded in the skies
above their homeland on Caladan.

1001
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:30,333
But, the saga of Dune was far
from over.

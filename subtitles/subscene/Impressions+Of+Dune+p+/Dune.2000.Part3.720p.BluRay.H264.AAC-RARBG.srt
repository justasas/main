1
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,875
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,458
Dune.

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,500
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,417
Wilderness home to the mysterious
desert tribes called Fremen

5
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,625
who long for a messiah to free them
from Harkonnen bondage.

6
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,000
A messiah,
a boy once known as Paul,

7
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:42,208
now known as...
Muad'Dib.

8
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,167
Pick up the pace, you lazy desert rats,
we have a quota to meet.

9
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,792
Sound the alarm!

10
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,167
Disperse the men to the safe houses.

11
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,167
Get word to Stilgar.

12
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,583
We'll evacuate the city tomorrow.

13
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,542
Halt!

14
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,458
Turn around.

15
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,542
Papers!

16
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,417
I said your papers, you scum...

17
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,292
There's a tunnel out of the city,
at the foot of the steps.

18
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,792
The blessings of Muad'Dib
be with you and your family.

19
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,292
Your plan worked, Muad'Dib.

20
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,792
Now they know we can strike them at will.

21
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
We could take the city in an hour.

22
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,292
It's not time.

23
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,167
But they are vulnerable, Muad'Dib.

24
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,375
Not yet.

25
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,667
The advance unit found something
in the chaos, Muad'Dib.

26
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,250
Something you should see.

27
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,333
There was a secret crematorium
in one of the Harkonnen barracks.

28
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,958
And this was all...

29
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:42,042
...of your father that was left.

30
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,708
The men think it's an omen,
a sign that our final battle...

31
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
...with the Harkonnen is at hand.

32
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,208
Your visions frighten me, Muad'Dib.

33
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,083
There are things still hidden from me.

34
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,500
Places I can't go, things I can't see.

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you ever worry that just trying to see
the future changes it?

36
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
We're speeding toward the abyss, Chani.

37
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,667
I have to see a way around it.

38
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,875
Perhaps it's time for me to leave.

39
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,458
I've been away from our son too long.

40
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,375
We'll make arrangements
once we reach Cave of Ridges.

41
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,875
We will be there after the next raids.

42
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,375
Will we ever have peace, Muad'Dib?

43
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,750
We'll have victory.

44
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,542
I'm sorry, Milord.
He said you must come at once.

45
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,125
Do you really take me
for that much of a fool, boy?

46
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,833
I don't understand, Uncle.

47
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:40,500
What kind of poison did you choose, boy?
Something slow and painful, I assume...

48
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,625
...so you could watch?

49
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,125
Tell me, Feyd, why didn't you simply
assassinate me yourself?

50
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,417
You had plenty of opportunity to.

51
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,500
You taught me that my own hands
must always remain clean.

52
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Quick boy, very quick.

53
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:02,583
You're good material, Feyd,
and I hate to waste good material.

54
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,875
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right here.

55
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,292
My brother.

56
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,667
Yes.

57
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,083
That's right.

58
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,583
Your dim brother.

59
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,375
If I kill you, then he would be my only heir.

60
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,750
He can't even put down
a dirty mob of religious lunatics.

61
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,458
Yes, you're clever, Feyd.

62
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,042
But not that clever.

63
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,542
And don't get any ideas, Feyd.

64
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,667
My men have you in their sights
even as we speak.

65
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,042
Don't worry.

66
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,542
If I'd wanted you dead
you'd never have made it down the hall.

67
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,042
You're going to let me live?

68
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:57,958
I can't very well leave the wealth of Arrakis
to someone who's dead.

69
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,458
What wealth?

70
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,042
Every communiqué brings news
of another Fremen raid.

71
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,333
By the time my idiot of a brother
is through...

72
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,833
...the Emperor himself
will have to intervene.

73
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,125
You're not as dim as I thought.

74
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,833
You intend to draw the Emperor himself
into this?

75
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,833
You see, this is why you need me, Feyd...

76
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,333
...to help you think, to help you plot.

77
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,625
Why do you think I tolerate
the incompetence of your brother?

78
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,125
Because it amuses me?

79
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,000
Think, Feyd. Think.

80
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:33,208
There is method to this madness, even
though you've been too dull to divine it.

81
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,083
The spice.

82
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,708
Of course the spice.

83
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,875
The one thing that could possibly draw
the Emperor away...

84
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:47,208
...from his imperial pleasures,
out into the wastelands of the Empire...

85
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:52,292
...where he is vulnerable,
where he can be destroyed.

86
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,083
And Duke Leto was just the beginning,
the prelude to a move...

87
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,583
...on the imperial throne itself.

88
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:05,167
But timing is everything, beautiful boy.
Patience is our ally.

89
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:09,167
We must not make the Emperor suspicious
with foolishness like this.

90
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,583
So, what will it be?

91
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,667
I give you my pledge.

92
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,750
Good.

93
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,250
Now let the Emperor mock
House Harkonnen, call us swine...

94
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,750
...because in the end,
his throne will be mine.

95
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,042
That's it Hannah.

96
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,917
Good.

97
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,333
Good, Hannah.

98
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,417
Another healthy fighter for the cause.

99
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Alia, you were told to wait.

100
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,875
He looks like Mitha's son.

101
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,083
How can you know that, child?

102
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,583
The slaughter on Bela Tegeuse is history.

103
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,167
You weren't even born.

104
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,958
But, Mother, I saw it, and it's true.

105
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,583
Yes, it's true.

106
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,750
I hate them.

107
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,958
Alia.

108
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:04,333
They stare at me.
They whisper when I pass.

109
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,042
It hurts my feelings.

110
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,750
They're confused, Alia.

111
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,458
You frighten them.

112
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,250
Because I'm a freak.

113
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,833
You're not a freak. Who has said that?

114
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,042
No one.

115
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,917
Then don't you ever say it again.

116
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,917
My children are not freaks.

117
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,833
But I can't help it.

118
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,542
I just know things,
things I shouldn't know, but I just do.

119
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,708
It was a cruel thing I did to you, Alia.

120
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:45,125
I took the Water of Life
when you were still in my womb.

121
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,500
No one should ever be wakened
to consciousness as you were.

122
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,083
But we'll make them understand, Alia.

123
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,708
We'll make them see
that you're not just a little girl...

124
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,792
...that you've never really been one.

125
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,583
I want my brother.

126
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,083
What is it?

127
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,375
He came to challenge you in open combat.

128
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,458
You killed him?

129
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,875
I took care of it.

130
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,333
But he came to challenge me.

131
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,542
He wasn't worthy, Muad'Dib.

132
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,625
Otheym, get Stilgar.

133
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,333
Tell him to summon the Maker.

134
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,042
There is only one way
to stop these challenges.

135
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,125
You know what this will mean,
between you and Stil.

136
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,917
The men will want you to call him out.

137
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,125
Only if I survive the Maker.

138
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,292
Just remember what I've taught you.
Do it simply and directly.

139
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,000
- Nothing fancy.
- I'll remember.

140
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,917
Stand close enough that you can mount
when he passes.

141
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,500
- Not so close that he'll crush you.
- I'll remember.

142
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
You will hear him before you see him.

143
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,083
When you take your stand,
you must become completely still.

144
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,792
You must become a dune
in your very essence.

145
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,083
Stil.

146
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,792
I'll remember.

147
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,583
See that you do.

148
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,375
Fremen ride the worm
by the time they are 12.

149
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,583
I don't want an old man like you
shaming my teaching.

150
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,375
He won't fail.

151
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,750
I must not fear.

152
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,750
Fear is the mind killer.

153
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,667
I will face my fear.

154
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,625
I will let it pass through me.
Only I will remain.

155
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,750
He is too close.

156
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,542
He's not leaving enough room.

157
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,542
I can second him.
It's allowed, even in the test.

158
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,750
No.

159
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,333
He must do this alone.

160
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,875
He is turning it.

161
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,875
He is turning it!

162
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,583
Take positions!

163
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,667
It is our turn now, Muad'Dib.

164
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,750
You and me.

165
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,833
I don't think I've ever seen one that big.

166
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,417
Look, there.

167
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,000
Spice.

168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,583
We've never come so far south.
The Fremen would never allow this.

169
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,792
No choice.

170
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,292
The Spacing Guild's buying up
all the spice there is.

171
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,583
Nothing left for us.

172
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,000
This is a rich patch. I'll call the harvester.

173
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,792
Get some men up on those rocks first.

174
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,083
The Harkonnen patrols
won't be this far out.

175
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,958
It's not the Harkonnen I'm worried about.

176
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,583
I'll be damned. A false patch.

177
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,667
Get the men back on board!

178
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,750
Put the knife away, Gurney Halleck.

179
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,667
Who is it that knows the name
of Gurney Halleck?

180
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
Paul, is it truly Paul?

181
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,125
You young pup! Young pup!

182
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,333
Gurney-man.

183
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,625
So you're the reason
the Fremen have gotten so clever.

184
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,625
I'd never have expected you
to fall for such a simple trick, Gurney.

185
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,125
Desperate times, Milord.

186
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,708
Harkonnen patrols have forced us south,
deeper and deeper.

187
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,500
Where you might've seen things
you shouldn't.

188
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,917
This is Gurney Halleck, Stil.

189
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,917
My father's weapons master.

190
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,708
One of my teachers.

191
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:53,708
There aren't many of us who haven't heard
the name Gurney Halleck.

192
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:58,000
This is Stilgar, Gurney,
the naib of our sietch.

193
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Muad'Dib...

194
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,083
...feel the wind.

195
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,208
"Muad'Dib"?

196
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,875
- You're the one they call Muad'Dib?
- It's my Fremen name.

197
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,708
Come, we'll talk of all these things
while we wait out the storm.

198
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,083
Storm? We didn't see any signs.

199
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,500
It comes soon. Trust me.

200
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,375
What happens to my men?

201
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,000
We'll decide what to do with them
after the storm.

202
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,167
We'll have to hurry
if we're going to save the thopter.

203
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,250
This is one of the things
you should not have seen.

204
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,167
You have many such hiding places?

205
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,958
Many times many.

206
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
We call this one Cave of Ridges.

207
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,833
Would you like me to bring coffee?

208
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,458
Yes.

209
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,333
And more food.

210
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,042
Your woman?

211
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,625
The mother of my first-born.

212
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,542
So much has happened.

213
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:07,125
The boy I knew has now become a man.

214
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,125
Thanks to our enemies.

215
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,625
Cowards.

216
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,625
They hide in their cities in garrisons,
hoping you will wear yourself out...

217
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,417
...with useless raids.

218
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,833
In other words, they're immobilized.

219
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,625
While you know where,
and when you choose.

220
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,417
A tactic I learned from you, Gurney-man.

221
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,917
What about your men?

222
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,208
Smugglers, all. Good men.

223
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,917
Some newcomers.

224
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,083
Off-worlders.

225
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's hard to find recruits these days.

226
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,708
Any of my father's men?

227
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:46,083
Those that weren't butchered
by the Harkonnen...

228
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,792
...bribed whoever they could
to leave Arrakis.

229
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,292
Everyone thought...

230
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,375
We all believed you were dead, Milord.

231
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,000
But you stayed.

232
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,292
Awaiting an opportunity for vengeance.

233
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,583
I knew we'd be reunited, Gurney.

234
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,667
I saw it.

235
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,583
You're the only one left to me, Milord.

236
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,250
Hawat, Idaho, your father:

237
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,458
All dead, all betrayed.

238
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:21,250
I would've gladly have sacrificed myself
if I could've taken the traitor with me.

239
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,750
My father once spoke
about desert power, Gurney.

240
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,250
I remember well.

241
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,250
Well, you've just met it.

242
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,833
The surface of this planet is ours.

243
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,750
No storm, no worm,
not even the Emperor's Sardaukar...

244
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,333
...could stop us now.

245
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,625
Enlist with me, Gurney.

246
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,833
Feed on revenge with us.

247
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,917
Enlist?

248
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,042
I never left your service.

249
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,208
That stupid swine
seems almost begging for me to intervene.

250
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,125
The Baron is a pig, Father,
but he is not stupid.

251
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:18,000
Rabban has lost almost 50,000 troops
in the past two years.

252
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,708
- Arrakis is a fierce planet.
- Attrition cannot explain such losses.

253
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,417
He's losing five-to-one.

254
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,583
Read between the lines.

255
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
You are saying the Baron is allowing
this rebellion to continue?

256
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,083
I'm saying the Baron can count
as well as we.

257
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:42,458
For the sake of argument,
what if there were only 20,000 people...

258
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,375
...in a Fremen sietch?

259
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:48,958
And what if there were only 250
such communities on the whole of Arrakis?

260
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:54,458
Our spies are suggesting
there may be twice that many.

261
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,958
Yes.

262
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,667
Ten million.

263
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:03,458
Toughened by conditions
worse than your own prison planet, Father.

264
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:07,750
Yes, but brutalized by that mindless thug,
Rabban.

265
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,167
They would never ally with him.

266
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:15,250
Perhaps this brutality is simply part
of something more cunning.

267
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,625
A clever prelude
to ripen them up for someone else.

268
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:23,625
Someone to come and rescue them
from Rabban.

269
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,833
Someone like the other nephew,
the cute one, Feyd.

270
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,625
If such a plan succeeded...

271
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:36,125
...the Baron would have a force
to rival even your dreaded Sardaukar.

272
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,208
Summon Harkonnen to Kaitain.

273
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,333
We shall see what devices
this perverse mind is breeding.

274
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,500
Your Highness has a perceptive mind.

275
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,292
Shall I take that as a compliment
or a threat, Fenring?

276
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,208
I meant it only as a sign of my respect.

277
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,708
I share your fear of the Baron's schemes.

278
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,208
My father can handle the Baron, Fenring.

279
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,083
It is this Muad'Dib I'm curious about.

280
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:13,708
Halt!

281
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:17,125
He caught Korba from behind, Muad'Dib.

282
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,917
One of my newcomers.

283
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
- Sardaukar.
- Not a chance.

284
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,917
The only possible explanation
if he overcame Korba.

285
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,125
Submit, Captain.

286
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,292
Submit, Captain.

287
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,292
Sardaukar.

288
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,000
- Gurney.
- Let me kill him, Milord.

289
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,083
No.

290
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,583
Gurney Halleck is right.
We must take his water.

291
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,875
Otheym, see that he's not harmed.

292
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,292
We'll have use for him soon.

293
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,875
Chani, now you can return
to the southern sietch.

294
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,667
I want you to bring my mother here.

295
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,667
Your mother?

296
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,458
Milord, we were told
she was taken by the Harkonnen.

297
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,542
That she is dead.

298
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,875
She is very much alive, old friend.

299
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,833
And you will see her soon.

300
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,958
Come. We have another raid to plan.

301
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,333
Muad'Dib never sleeps.

302
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:46,250
They say Muad'Dib never eats.

303
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,417
They believe he can see into the future.

304
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,917
They believe he cannot be killed.

305
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,208
- No one has ever seen him?
- No, Highness.

306
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,417
Though many claim they have.

307
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:59,125
Sometimes in several places,
at the same time.

308
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,417
But what does he look like?

309
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,417
I want to know what he looks like.

310
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,208
No one will say for sure.

311
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,625
Perhaps he doesn't even exist.

312
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,292
Perhaps he's just a legend. A ghost.

313
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,208
There were no such things as ghosts.

314
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,000
We were able to jam their signals.

315
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,292
No communications escaped,
but I think you should see this.

316
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,875
The Guild agent.

317
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,875
Quite a distance
from the comforts on Kaitain.

318
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:57,083
May I remind you that I am protected
by the Imperial Treaties for Commerce...

319
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:01,667
...by the C.H.O.A.M. Declaration,
paragraph 12, subparagraph D...

320
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,375
...and by Articles 3, 8 and 14
of the Great Convention, which...

321
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,958
Imperial law is void
where Muad'Dib stands.

322
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:14,042
- The forms must be obeyed.
- Be quiet.

323
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,625
Shall we take their waters now, Muad'Dib?

324
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:20,625
We have surrendered without resistance.
We have put our lives at your mercy.

325
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,250
Mercy is a word I no longer understand.

326
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,417
Milord.

327
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,833
Tell me.

328
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,833
Are there many Guild agents
on Arrakis these days?

329
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:36,208
We are neutral in the matters
between you and the Harkonnen.

330
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,708
Are there?

331
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,833
Arrakis is crawling with them.

332
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,000
Buying up the spice
as if there was precious little left.

333
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,208
You're afraid, aren't you?

334
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,500
The spice must flow.

335
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,208
Otheym, disarm their thopters.

336
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:16,667
Fuel them only as much as needed
to reach Arrakeen.

337
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,583
You are letting them go?

338
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,250
Take a message to your masters.

339
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,542
Tell them your fight is hopeless.

340
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:48,042
Tell them the forces of Muad'Dib
cannot be defeated.

341
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,542
Tell them the days are numbered.

342
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,417
The men are going to question
your intentions.

343
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,417
The men, Stil, can't possibly imagine
what my intentions are.

344
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,375
Gurney.

345
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,375
Your son shares a bond with this man.

346
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,000
It runs very deep.

347
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,292
Very deep.

348
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,292
The kind only men can have.

349
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,875
And my little man.

350
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,792
You are so thin.

351
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,667
Is he being fed enough?

352
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,583
His appetite is as healthy as any I've seen.

353
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,958
He should be with the other children.

354
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,958
I cherish the time I spend
with my grandson.

355
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,458
He can't learn the ways of the sietch
if he's kept apart.

356
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:27,167
There are things he must learn
that extend beyond the ways of the sietch.

357
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,542
There will be time enough
to learn those things.

358
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,958
Does Paul share that sentiment?

359
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,542
Muad'Dib relies on my judgment
where our son is concerned.

360
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,833
You have been a good companion
to my son, Chani.

361
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,542
But he is not like other men.

362
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:56,208
- I'm sure I know that better than most.
- He is noble-born.

363
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,833
The rightful heir to the House Atreides.

364
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:05,417
An alliance with one of the other
great houses must remain a possibility.

365
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:11,208
You don't have to worry, Reverend Mother.

366
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,292
I will only do what's best for him.

367
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:17,708
Just as you did for your duke.

368
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,708
Pleasure to see you again,
Baron Harkonnen.

369
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,375
So the Emperor seems to be entertaining
some of the other royal houses as well.

370
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:37,375
There is much to discuss.

371
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,375
Really?

372
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,875
Your Majesty, these people are mad.

373
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,250
The women throw their babies at us.

374
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,042
They hurl themselves onto our weapons
to open a wedge for their men to attack.

375
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,750
Indeed.

376
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,750
I can wipe the planet clean
of the entire race, Your Majesty.

377
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,958
But then, who would mine the spice?

378
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,958
It's a terrible dilemma.

379
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,125
Do you have any idea
where this Muad'Dib character came from?

380
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,625
What he wants? What his price is?

381
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,250
He's a Fremen fanatic,
a religious adventurer.

382
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,542
They crop up regularly
on the fringes of civilization.

383
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,625
Your Majesty knows this.

384
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:39,000
Most seem simply bent on suicide.

385
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:44,708
Have you ever stared into the eyes
of a religious fanatic, Baron?

386
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:51,500
Suicide and martyrdom
are often the same thing.

387
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,208
It's a dangerous game he's playing.

388
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:59,083
This rebellion must be crushed. Now.

389
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,292
We agree.

390
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:05,083
Something must be done,
although we may not suggest...

391
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,083
...what that is, of course.

392
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,083
We cannot move on House Harkonnen
unilaterally, Majesty.

393
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,875
There are complications in our relationship.

394
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:20,000
It's time to draw this Muad'Dib
into the open.

395
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,667
Have the royal houses
prepare their armies.

396
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:30,167
We're moving the royal palace to Arrakis,
with the Guild's approval, of course.

397
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,125
They expect you to call Stilgar out.

398
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:15,417
No man recognizes leadership
without the challenge of combat.

399
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:20,917
Now that I've ridden the worm,
they think there's nothing else in our way.

400
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,333
Is there?

401
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:29,208
A man in a rush never sees
the edge of the cliff until it's too late.

402
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,500
They don't see any cliffs.

403
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
You don't allow them to.

404
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,417
They have a simple religion.

405
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,208
Nothing about religion is simple.

406
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:44,792
- Isn't it late to be worrying about that?
- We did...

407
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,875
I did what I had to do
to ensure our survival.

408
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,292
- You used them.
- Yes.

409
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:56,583
- So have you.
- No.

410
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,792
I'm fulfilling the role
destiny has chosen for me.

411
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:02,583
You sound like you believe
the legends about you.

412
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,792
Like the Kwisatz Haderach?

413
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,875
What do you know about that?

414
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,958
Mother Ramallo called me that...

415
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,083
...at Sietch Tabr, before she died.

416
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,542
I was supposed to have a daughter.

417
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:31,833
One that could be wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

418
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,958
A way to end the feud and possibly
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

419
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,458
The one who can be many places at once.

420
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:44,417
The ultimate achievement
of centuries of Bene Gesserit breeding.

421
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,417
The man who could go
where we could not.

422
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:51,417
The one with perfect memory,
who could provide perfect predictability.

423
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,125
And perfect power
for the Bene Gesserit, of course.

424
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,917
I did what I did because I loved your father.

425
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,333
I only wanted to give him a son.

426
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,708
I didn't want to create a god.

427
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,917
- Then you don't believe it's true?
- I'm your mother, Paul.

428
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,500
- I know who you are.
- Do you?

429
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,917
Forgive me, Reverend Mother.

430
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:15,000
Can I bring you anything?
Some food, perhaps?

431
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:16,917
Yes, thank you.

432
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,208
And then I'd like to see Gurney.

433
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:28,083
You must find a way not to lose Stilgar.

434
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,875
Come, Otheym.

435
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,667
Thought you'd escaped, witch?

436
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:50,750
- Gurney, what are you doing?
- I'm your confessor.

437
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,167
Take your hands off me.

438
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:58,167
Here to unburden your black conscience
of guilt before I send you into eternity.

439
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,042
Gurney!

440
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:03,042
One more step, Milord,
and I'll finish it right now.

441
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,750
You better explain yourself, Gurney.

442
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,333
I'll explain all right.

443
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:10,250
The day the House Atreides fell,
I swore an oath I would kill the one...

444
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,458
...who betrayed your father.

445
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,542
- You couldn't be more wrong, Gurney.
- Do not speak.

446
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:18,042
- Gurney.
- Stand where you are, Milord.

447
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,333
Am I capable of lying to you?

448
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,625
You never have, Milord.

449
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,042
The traitor was Yueh, Gurney.

450
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:26,125
No.

451
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,542
We have the confession in his own hand.

452
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:32,833
And as soon as you release my mother,
you can read it for yourself.

453
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,917
Look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't you.

454
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,625
I will know if you are lying.

455
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,125
I will know.

456
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,708
I would've given my life to save Leto.

457
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,292
The day he died, my heart turned to stone.

458
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,125
It was Yueh.

459
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,208
They had his wife.

460
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,000
My God, what have I done?

461
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,292
My God.

462
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,708
Be still, Gurney, it's over now.

463
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,292
I didn't see it coming.

464
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,083
You need to rest, Muad'Dib.

465
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,875
I didn't know he would threaten her.

466
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,375
I never saw it.

467
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,250
He could've killed her.

468
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,458
This can't go on.

469
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,167
You are asking too much of yourself.

470
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,958
I want you to take Leto
and return to the southern sietch.

471
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,750
I want you safe.

472
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,750
I'm safest when we are together.

473
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,042
But I'm not.

474
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,667
Muad'Dib!

475
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,625
He's alive.

476
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,792
I assure you, he's alive.

477
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:58,708
But the thread of life is so thin,
most think he's not.

478
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,000
- How long has he been this way?
- Almost to the day you left.

479
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,708
Otheym found him.

480
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,875
The experience has shaken him.

481
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:13,000
I spent a week trying to revive him.

482
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,375
But it's been no use.

483
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:21,292
There have been meetings, arguments.

484
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,958
Some of the elders think it's time...

485
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,750
...to take his water.

486
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,167
Who else knows?

487
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:36,167
Stilgar, the naibs,
and the Fedaykin, of course.

488
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,667
What do the Fedaykin think?

489
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:40,958
They think he's in a sacred trance...

490
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,458
...gathering his holy powers
for the final battle.

491
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,458
I've encouraged this view.

492
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,958
You have to help, Chani.

493
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,625
You're my last hope.

494
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:59,250
Please, tell me what to do.

495
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,625
The Fedaykin are right, Reverend Mother.

496
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,792
Muad'Dib is in a trance.

497
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,417
A dangerous trance.

498
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,208
He has taken the Water of Life.

499
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:53,292
The raw water of a drowned maker.
I have not changed it yet.

500
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,792
More could kill him.

501
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,167
It's our only hope.

502
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:33,250
Muad'Dib. Beloved.

503
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:36,458
Chani, what are you doing here?

504
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,625
Paul.

505
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,542
I was outside just a moment ago.

506
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:43,833
You drank the Water of Life.

507
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,750
Yes.

508
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:49,625
We thought you were dead.

509
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:57,333
You have no idea.

510
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,917
I have seen things
there are not words to describe.

511
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,208
You've seen the future.

512
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,708
The now, Mother.

513
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,708
The future and the past.

514
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,792
All at once.

515
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,708
All the same.

516
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
I am the whirlwind.

517
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:48,458
Paul. I can't go there.

518
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:51,250
I'm afraid.

519
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,083
I'm so afraid.

520
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,042
- It is the place we cannot go.
- That is why I have come.

521
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,250
You are the Kwisatz Haderach.

522
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,750
No, Mother. I am something more.

523
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,750
I am something unexpected.

524
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,667
I am the fulcrum, the giver and the taker.

525
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:15,250
I am the one
who can be many places at once.

526
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,333
I am the master of fate.

527
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,833
I am the tool of fate.

528
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,208
Reverend Mother?

529
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,208
Reverend Mother, are you sick?

530
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:56,708
I'm fine.

531
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,708
Now you understand.

532
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,750
I've decided we're alike, you and me.

533
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:54,833
Have you?

534
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:59,458
When this dusty little nuisance is over
I'll convince you.

535
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:01,917
I'd be confused if you didn't try.

536
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,125
I know.

537
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:05,833
Yeah, that's why we're alike.

538
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:10,542
We don't like to be confused.
We like to be certain.

539
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:18,333
Sometime, remind me to tell you
about the ancient legend of the Phoenix.

540
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,708
That's it, beautiful boy.

541
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,000
You may find a way for us yet.

542
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:36,500
She'd make a fine trophy
on Harkonnen linen, wouldn't she?

543
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:07,458
The Padishah Emperor is here,
in the space above us...

544
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,667
...with his favorite truthsayer
and legions of his Sardaukar.

545
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,250
Every great house has its raiders here.

546
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,542
The Baron Harkonnen is with them.

547
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,375
But Muad'Dib, how can you know this?

548
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,042
I've seen them.

549
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:29,542
Milord, we only heard this morning...

550
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,833
...from our smuggler allies.

551
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,042
- You were unconscious.
- Not unconscious!

552
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,333
Muad'Dib has seen through
the Water of Life.

553
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,625
Reverend Mother, is this true?

554
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:45,417
He has seen.

555
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:46,833
Muad'Dib!

556
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,625
You are a voice from the outer world.

557
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,917
You are the prophet sent to us
by Shai-hulud.

558
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:59,000
You must take your place, Muad'Dib.

559
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,417
We've waited long enough.

560
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,500
You must do it now!

561
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:06,625
Do you live for the good of the tribe,
Stilgar?

562
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,000
There is no other way.

563
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,708
And for the good of the tribe,
would you stand there...

564
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:14,208
...and let me drive this blade
into your heart?

565
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,583
- Call him out, Muad'Dib.
- Call him out.

566
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:19,917
- It is the way, Stilgar.
- It is the way.

567
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:21,208
It is the way.

568
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,583
Ways change!

569
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,792
Hard tasks need hard ways.

570
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,583
You must become our naib
so you can lead us against the Harkonnen.

571
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:39,083
And would you smash your knife
before starting that war?

572
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:42,375
Will you cut off your right arm
and leave it bloody on the floor?

573
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,167
Do you think the Mahdi is that stupid?

574
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:53,167
There isn't a man among you who could
stand against me in single combat...

575
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,875
...Stilgar included.

576
00:54:55,667 --> 00:55:00,250
Must I prove it by calling out the naib
of every sietch on the planet?

577
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,958
Must I cripple myself by killing
our strongest and wisest leaders...

578
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,958
...just for the sake of some mindless ritual?

579
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:14,125
You say I am the Mahdi.

580
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,542
I say I am your duke!

581
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:28,625
And it's time now to wipe Arrakis clean
of the awful Harkonnen stench.

582
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:33,625
Time to drive their name into the depths
of hell so that we may reclaim the planet...

583
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,042
...and create a paradise together!

584
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:45,500
As Liet taught us.

585
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,708
As Liet taught us.

586
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,583
Long live the duke.

587
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:03,208
Long live Duke Paul Muad'Dib.

588
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:10,083
Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!

589
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:16,375
Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!

590
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,000
The men have gathered the supplies.
We're almost ready to depart.

591
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,708
- What are they waiting for?
- For permission.

592
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:41,708
They know the Guild will strand any force
that lands here without its consent.

593
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,292
The Guild is protecting us?

594
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:45,208
They're afraid, Stil.

595
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,792
Afraid of what's to come.

596
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,792
They're searching for a way out.

597
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,083
They're searching for me.

598
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,167
What are we going to do?

599
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,292
Let them find me.

600
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,083
Come, Otheym.

601
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,750
I want you to choose several
of your best men.

602
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:34,625
Ones who you trust above all others.

603
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,958
Separate them from the rest
before we withdraw from here.

604
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,042
As you wish.

605
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:43,125
Send them to the reservoir
in the Habbanya Erg.

606
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:46,750
Have them collect the Water of Life
we've hidden there.

607
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:51,125
Muad'Dib, I don't understand.

608
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:53,625
Those are changed waters...

609
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:57,625
...hidden there in case something
should happen to the Reverend Mother...

610
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:01,625
Have the men find a pre-spice mass,
as large as possible.

611
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,500
Have them plant the waters
above the mass...

612
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:10,208
...and wait for my orders.

613
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:14,500
Do you realize
what you're asking me to do?

614
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,500
What you've asked shall be done.

615
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:50,167
The Baron insists
the southern areas are uninhabitable.

616
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,750
The Baron is mistaken.

617
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,667
Fremen?

618
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,250
There have been reports.

619
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,958
Only a few were investigated
according to Harkonnen documents.

620
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,958
Cost to profit too high apparently.

621
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,042
Many thopters were lost.

622
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:10,167
Even smugglers won't venture there.

623
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,250
Send a light attack force immediately.

624
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,542
I want ground reconnaissance.

625
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:23,542
Perhaps this Muad'Dib thinks
he can continue to attack us...

626
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:26,625
...then retreat into the wilderness
where we dare not follow.

627
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,333
I'm about to strangle his options.

628
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,000
Let all Fremen who pass here...

629
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:03,708
...pause and pay homage to the shrine
of Duke Leto Atreides...

630
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:08,875
...and all those who have died
in the service of justice.

631
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,583
Gurney.

632
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,458
Now all we need is a storm.

633
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,333
A great-grandmother of a storm.

634
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:59,625
Seems you'll have one soon enough.

635
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:05,042
From here the future will open,
the clouds will part to reveal its glory.

636
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:07,125
And it gives me no peace.

637
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:11,042
I've seen what you've seen, Paul.

638
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:14,917
I know what's coming,
what you're about to let loose...

639
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:18,208
...not just here on Arrakis,
but across the entire universe...

640
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,125
But I am powerless to stop it.

641
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,708
Are you?

642
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,417
A terrible purpose awaits us, Mother.

643
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:32,292
This vast organism we call humanity
is about to reinvent itself...

644
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,583
...from the ashes of its own complacency.

645
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,708
The sleeper has awakened.

646
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:41,292
Anything that tries to stop it
will be crushed.

647
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,208
Even the innocent.

648
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,583
There are no innocents anymore.

649
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,667
Your father
would never have spoken this way.

650
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,583
I am not my father.

651
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,292
You are his son.

652
01:02:56,875 --> 01:03:00,083
More than his son. Much more.

653
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,792
Thanks to you.

654
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,667
Take a good look at me, Mother.

655
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:17,250
See something I learned
after I took the Water of Life.

656
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:19,750
Look into my eyes.

657
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,042
Look back through them, into my blood.

658
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:30,250
Harkonnen blood.

659
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,250
Flowing in mine.

660
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,333
It flows from you.

661
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:38,333
I won't believe it.

662
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,042
Who was your father?

663
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,333
- Tell me.
- You know I can't...

664
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,125
Who?

665
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,625
I don't know. I don't know.

666
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:50,417
- I have never known.
- Because they hid it from you.

667
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:52,917
Because they took me
when I was an infant.

668
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:55,333
Raised me in the Bene Gesserit ways...

669
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,500
...like all the others before and since.

670
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,208
None know their mothers, or their fathers.

671
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,917
The Baron Harkonnen, Mother,
you're his daughter.

672
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,208
The product of a clever seduction.

673
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:13,000
The handiwork of your precious
Bene Gesserit breeding programmes.

674
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,292
I'm his grandson.

675
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:35,500
They wanted to control things.

676
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,083
They couldn't control you.

677
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,667
You changed everything.

678
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,875
You had a son and now I'm here.

679
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,750
The one they were seeking.

680
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:56,250
But I've arrived before my time,
and they're just beginning to realize it.

681
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,125
They're coming.

682
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,083
Check that room.

683
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,083
Over here.

684
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:49,167
Leto!

685
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:32,625
Muad'Dib?

686
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,500
What is it?

687
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,792
Our son is dead.

688
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,083
Will you look at that thing?

689
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,292
I count nine levels.

690
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:54,292
The fools brought
the whole palace with him.

691
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:58,583
My dear Emperor,
I'm about to shatter your sanity.

692
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,458
Then I'm going to destroy you.

693
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,958
Not a thopter in the sky.

694
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,667
Everything's being pulled in and tied down.

695
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,750
They know a storm is coming.

696
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,958
Time to let them know I'm here.

697
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:21,667
The Sardaukar Captain,
alive and unharmed as you ordered.

698
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,750
I am about to set you free.

699
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,042
And you must take this with you.

700
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:50,708
These are terms for surrender.

701
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,542
They killed my son!

702
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:56,625
I can't do this.

703
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:58,125
You have no choice.

704
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,000
Don't be afraid.

705
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,208
Good.

706
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,417
Clean him up.

707
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:15,208
Give him one of the Sardaukar uniforms
we've taken.

708
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:17,500
Full-rank insignia.

709
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:21,000
Let him face his master with dignity.

710
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:29,583
You're mad! Do you know that?

711
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:33,875
After you return with the Emperor's
answer then we can discuss who is mad.

712
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:47,667
The arrogance! The utter lunacy!

713
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,667
Your Majesty, if I may suggest...

714
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:53,667
...the time has come to loose the forces
of the Empire against this scum.

715
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,875
Shut your mouth.

716
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:59,042
It's you I have to thank for this mess.

717
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:01,667
You and your hapless family, Baron.

718
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:08,250
I really don't think that this is the time
to revisit old strategies.

719
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,750
I said quiet!

720
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,625
So, he wants an answer, does he?

721
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,208
So, here he is, the fat Baron himself.

722
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,708
He isn't much, is he?

723
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:06,375
What is this? Some kind of midget?

724
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,583
My dear Baron.

725
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:17,875
Meet the sister
of the one they call Muad'Dib.

726
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:26,958
Their shields are going up.

727
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,167
They've given us their answer.

728
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,375
The thumpers have been activated.

729
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,458
It's time, Gurney.

730
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,250
Your Majesty, I had no idea.

731
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,250
He's lying, of course.

732
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,333
Quiet, child.

733
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,542
Make him afraid some more.

734
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:53,333
It's time to bring this sorry episode
to a close.

735
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,625
Time for your brother to surrender,
as the prize for your life.

736
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:02,833
No. I don't take orders from you, old man.

737
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:10,042
It's not wise to be so impudent, child.

738
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:14,833
You do not want to feel
the full force of my power.

739
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:18,625
I am beyond your power. Ask her.

740
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,417
Kill her.

741
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:24,833
Kill her now.

742
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:27,708
She's the Abomination.

743
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:31,625
The one the ancients warned us about.

744
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,208
What is this?

745
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,792
Look at her, Father.

746
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,917
Can you not see it?

747
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,292
She is the daughter of Duke Leto.

748
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:46,792
She is Atreides.

749
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,792
Her brother is the duke's son, Paul.

750
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,000
He is the Muad'Dib.

751
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,167
Impossible.

752
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,875
Have faith.
The endgame has already been written.

753
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:06,875
Do it, Gurney.

754
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:11,667
Do it now!

755
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,250
Kill her! She's in my mind!

756
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,458
Kill her!

757
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,167
My brother comes.

758
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:32,750
The shield wall is breached, Your Majesty.

759
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,542
The perimeter shields
won't hold against that.

760
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:27,708
Majesty, we must fall back to space
and reform.

761
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:33,083
Give her body to the storm!

762
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,792
Let the storm have what it can take.

763
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,375
I have her, Your Majesty!

764
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:46,167
Goodbye, Grandfather.

765
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:49,167
You've finally met
the Atreides' Gom Jabbar.

766
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:35,833
Majesty, we must retreat!

767
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,917
Prepare my shuttle.

768
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,333
Stilgar!

769
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,167
This way.

770
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:19,000
Some of the dying
asked to see the Reverend Mother.

771
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,708
She is with them.

772
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:01,167
This was my parents' room.

773
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:12,458
What little peace they had,
after we came to Arrakis, was here.

774
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:17,042
Tell me again about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

775
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,750
Where water falls from the sky...

776
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:31,250
...and plants grow so thick
you can't walk in between them.

777
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,750
As Arrakis will be one day.

778
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:42,750
Paid for with the blood of our people.

779
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,125
Our fathers.

780
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:51,833
Our son.

781
01:23:57,917 --> 01:24:00,333
He can never be replaced, Chani.

782
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:07,292
But there will be other children.

783
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,583
I promise.

784
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,167
Is it over?

785
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:39,875
Almost.

786
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,792
Perhaps my respected kinsman...

787
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:04,750
...thinks he has things his own way now.

788
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:09,667
There is a massed armada
of the great houses in the space...

789
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:12,042
...over Arrakis, young Atreides.

790
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,917
I have but to give the word.

791
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,375
Your word means nothing anymore.

792
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:20,333
I am the Emperor!

793
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:22,542
Not for long.

794
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:35,917
Dispatch orders to your navigators.

795
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:41,125
You are to depart our space
and return the fleet to its homes at once.

796
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:46,208
The Guild does not take your orders.

797
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:49,625
Tell them to look into the future.

798
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,333
They will see me staring back at them...

799
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,292
...ready to give the order.

800
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:07,417
The order to destroy
all spice production on this planet.

801
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,417
My men are waiting in the desert.

802
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:17,583
There is a particularly large
and volatile pre-spice mass there.

803
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:20,083
I need but raise my finger...

804
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,875
...and the nest will be flooded
with the changed Water of Life.

805
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,208
Jessica!

806
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:27,875
What have you done to us?

807
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:30,000
Spreading death among the makers.

808
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,083
Killing a cycle of life.

809
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:35,167
Creating a chain reaction
which will grow and grow...

810
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:37,458
...until there are no makers left.

811
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:41,458
Until there is no spice left.

812
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,458
Jessica, silence him!

813
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,583
Silence him yourself.

814
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:48,750
Can he do this?

815
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,875
They know I can do this.

816
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,875
That's what they've feared the most.

817
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:59,458
They've been monitoring the signals
my men have been sending.

818
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:05,458
They know precisely where we are
and what we can do.

819
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:13,125
Without the spice
the navigators will become blind...

820
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:15,917
...the Bene Gesserit will lose all powers...

821
01:27:15,917 --> 01:27:19,250
...and all commerce
among the great houses will cease!

822
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,125
Civilization will end.

823
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:27,833
If I am not obeyed...

824
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,833
...the spice will not flow.

825
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:37,333
But it will be suicide.

826
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:50,583
I think we both know the way out
of this difficulty, don't we?

827
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:55,917
- Paul.
- Do not interfere, Mother.

828
01:27:55,917 --> 01:27:58,292
This is for the good of us all.

829
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:00,375
Never.

830
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:05,083
An adventurer like him.
A traitor to the Empire.

831
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:09,000
Father, here is a man fit to be your son.

832
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:13,292
Do you really think
I'd agree to such a thing?

833
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:14,792
What choice do we have?

834
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:16,667
Kanly.

835
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,958
I invoke kanly.

836
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,750
Which one is that?

837
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:32,250
The Baron's other nephew, my Lord.

838
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,250
Feyd.

839
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,167
A cold-blooded killer.

840
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,958
So it comes down to this.

841
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,542
It is my right...

842
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:48,542
...as the Baron now of House Harkonnen,
I demand satisfaction.

843
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:52,625
So you're what's left of the house
that killed my father.

844
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,333
It's down to us.

845
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:56,542
Here we settle this vendetta
once and for all.

846
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:59,542
He's a Harkonnen animal, Muad'Dib.

847
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:01,042
He's right, Milord.

848
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:02,417
Let me kill him.

849
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,625
It will be my gift to you.

850
01:29:04,917 --> 01:29:10,125
Is the great Muad'Dib such a coward
that he sends others to do his dirty work?

851
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:11,708
Otheym.

852
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,333
Does this one fight in the Emperor's name?

853
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:23,708
If Feyd wishes it, he will meet you
with my blade in his hand.

854
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,292
I wish it!

855
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,417
May thy knife chip and shatter.

856
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:09,375
Paul, don't do it.

857
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:30,417
Would you like the Emperor's truthsayer
to prepare your spirit for its journey?

858
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:34,583
Or have you gone too native?

859
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,375
Maybe you'd like that little pet up there,
the pretty one...

860
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:43,708
...to say a few pagan rites?

861
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:47,083
Before I claim her.

862
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,083
I am not afraid.

863
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:28,125
Nothing to say, Atreides?

864
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,333
Perhaps you'll answer this.

865
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:38,583
So you see, Atreides?

866
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,292
Your death, fool.

867
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:44,750
The poison will stop your muscles,
and my knife will finish you.

868
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,042
It's over...

869
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,458
...Cousin.

870
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:50,083
Irulan.

871
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:53,708
You cannot stop this thing.

872
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:57,792
The spice must flow.

873
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:45,333
You see her standing there,
so haughty, so confident.

874
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:50,375
Let us hope she finds solace
in her writing and her books.

875
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,375
She'll have little else.

876
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:59,833
She may have my son's name,
but it is we...

877
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:02,958
...the ones who carry
the name of concubine...

878
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:05,958
...that history will call "wives".

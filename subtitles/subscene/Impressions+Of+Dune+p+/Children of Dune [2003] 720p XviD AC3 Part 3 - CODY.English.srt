1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,680
History is written
on the sands of Arrakis...

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,600
where rebellion and civil war
continue to breed...

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,280
fed by Alia's brutal tyranny
and repression...

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,680
as she sinks deeper into
the abomination of her own ghosts...

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,000
unable to recognize the forces
conspiring against her...

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,160
unaware of the whirlwind...

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,520
sweeping towards her
across the desert.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
Well...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,880
who's gonna explain this to me?

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,920
Who's gonna tell me why
I have rioting in my streets...

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
why my name is being used as a curse?

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,560
You simple fools.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,440
The royal twins are missing
from Sietch Tabr.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,680
Lady Jessica
has been abducted off-world.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,480
Rebel alliances are being formed
by tribes to the south.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,800
And now we have anarchy
in the streets of Arakeen!

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,480
You are to blame.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
Go.

19
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:28,101
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Perhaps you should rest, milady.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,560
It's difficult to think clearly
when one is exhausted by stress.

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,320
Leave me. I'm fine.

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,440
Such a pity, eh?

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,760
Why did you send
that lovely boy away?

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm not in the mood to indulge
your lurid perversions tonight.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,680
Are they mine
or simply yours in disguise?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,840
After all, I'm only enjoying...

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,800
what you started.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Is that so?

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,760
Don't forget, child.
I'm not really here.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm simply the manifestation...

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,560
of what you already are.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Go away! Go away!

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,960
Who else knows they are
requesting sanctuary here?

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,920
The Spacing Guild, of course.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
They would provide transport
with Idaho's bribes.

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,120
The Bene Gesserit will surely be
informed, if they don't know already.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,480
Then Alia will be forced
to implicate us in this adventure.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
She'll have to make it appear
as if we arranged the whole thing.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,840
We should refuse them safe harbor...

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,760
return them to Arrakis and wash
our hands of the entire matter.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
On the contrary, Tyek.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,720
Perhaps we should think
of Lady Jessica's visit...

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,320
as an endowment, not a threat.

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,760
The woman has many talents, I've read.
Perhaps they could be of some use to us.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
You mean to you.

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,640
I see no reason why I shouldn't continue
my education by all means necessary.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Any woman who can seduce
Duke Leto Atreides...

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,080
and a planet of desert Fremen
is not to be trifled with.

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,040
Are you suggesting
she might try to seduce me?

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Don't play the fool, Farad'n.

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360
She would be a dangerous guest.

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,240
But... a grateful one.

54
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,160
He may have a point.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
May the wind strip the flesh
from your bones.

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,360
May Shai-Hulud
clear the path before you.

57
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Sachar-Nabai.
When we meet again.

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,720
My skin is not my own.

59
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,960
The Golden Path is dangerous, Son.

60
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
It's the choice I couldn't take...

61
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
the desert storm
that cannot be stopped.

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,840
You will become that storm...

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,560
my son-

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
the whirlwind.

65
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,960
And nothing will be able
to stop you...

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,360
not even yourself.

67
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
This is for Leto.

68
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,920
We've confirmed that it was
Ghanima's knife that killed Palimbasha.

69
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,680
And the communicator he was wearing?

70
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,960
Off-world manufacture for sure.

71
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,120
We found a transceiver implanted
in a tiger's neck.

72
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,080
And we also found this in the desert.

73
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,800
Should I arrange transport
to the palace?

74
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,240
No!

75
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,800
Whoever will benefit
from the death of these children...

76
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,080
will not rest until
they're sure they've succeeded.

77
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,520
Until the time is right...

78
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,240
she'll be safer here than anywhere.

79
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
Sand trout.

80
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
So you know your desert farming,
young Atreides.

81
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,280
That's right, Atreides.
Don't be foolish.

82
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,400
We have your water in our cup.

83
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
Alive? She's alive?

84
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
That clever bitch Ghanima
survived our tigers.

85
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,840
We must improvise quickly.

86
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,680
Tell our man in the Atreides palace,
the priest Javid...

87
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,560
he must stir Alia's pot some more.

88
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Yes, Princess.

89
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,120
They left our priest's body
where we would be sure to find it.

90
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,000
He was assassinated by Fremen rebels
from a sietch near Hirbana Erg.

91
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,320
He was traveling with diplomatic
immunity when they attacked.

92
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,880
They carved blasphemy
into his skin, milady.

93
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,360
Horrible, profane curses
about you and your family.

94
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
"Cursed be the name Atreides.

95
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,200
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

96
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,720
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

97
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths. "

98
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,560
The obscenities
of desert rebels, Holiness.

99
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,040
An example must be made...

100
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,960
to warn other tribes what happens...

101
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,240
if they persist
in this insurrection.

102
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
No mercy.

103
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,200
I want all traces of
the rebel sietch wiped out.

104
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
You will be Leto...

105
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
son of Muad'Dib.

106
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,480
I am Sabiha.

107
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
I am meant to watch over you.

108
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Yes, and no doubt kill me
if I try to escape.

109
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,640
That won't happen.

110
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,800
Drink.

111
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I warn you, any attempt at witchery
shall result in immediate execution.

112
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,240
We are seeking safe harbor,
not an opportunity for treachery.

113
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,520
So you say.
But why should we risk...

114
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,720
sheltering fugitives
from the Imperium?

115
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,160
Who says that we are fugitives?

116
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,600
Your confrontation with Alia
has already taken on...

117
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,200
mythic proportions, Lady Jessica.

118
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Several Fremen tribes are known to be
in open revolt against the Quizrate.

119
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,920
Civil war seems imminent.

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
My grandchildren will prevent that.

121
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Not if they're dead.

122
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm sorry, Jessica Atreides...

123
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,760
to be the bearer of bad news, but...

124
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,960
it seems your grandchildren
have been the victims...

125
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
of a well-planned
assassination plot.

126
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,120
- Assassination?
- Our reports indicate...

127
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,080
the Atreides twins went missing
from Sietch Tabr.

128
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,360
They were attacked in the desert.

129
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,960
Leto was killed.

130
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,640
They're not sure
what became of the girl.

131
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,440
We have reason to believe Alia herself
may have planned the killings.

132
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,680
- That is impossible.
-Jessica.

133
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,800
It's well known your daughter's
on the verge of abomination.

134
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
Since Muad'Dib's heirs
were of age...

135
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,160
they were soon to be invested
with all the powers of his government.

136
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,160
Alia's role as regent
was coming to an end unless-

137
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,280
unless your grandchildren
could be eliminated...

138
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
and the blame laid on her enemies.

139
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
On us.

140
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,160
Events on Arrakis are spinning
wildly out of control...

141
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,080
Jessica Atreides.

142
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,240
Now, we can retreat and watch
the empire collapse on top of us...

143
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,680
or we can give each other sanctuary.

144
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,520
I can protect you
from Alia's reach...

145
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
and you can protect me
from her madness.

146
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,080
And how do I do that?

147
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,200
By announcing publicly that we did not
kidnap you, as Alia now alleges-

148
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,520
that you came of your own free will,
an emissary of the Bene Gesserit...

149
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,480
sent to...

150
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,200
take over the education of my son.

151
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,120
You want me to teach him
as the Bene Gesserit are taught?

152
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,280
An offer I could not resist.

153
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,520
Your mentat is conspicuous
by his silence.

154
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
One must be careful to evaluate...

155
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,440
who has the advantage
in such situations.

156
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
Perhaps there is
mutual advantage all around.

157
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
Stilgar refuses
to allow Ghanima to travel...

158
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
saying she's not strong enough...

159
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,440
saying her safety
cannot be guaranteed.

160
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,840
- He has offered sanctuary.
- He is naib of the sietch.

161
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,880
- We cannot overrule his wishes.
- We'll see about that.

162
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,080
The activities at Tabr
are curious and provocative.

163
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,240
No one is allowed to visit or depart
without Stilgar's permission.

164
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,240
They're planning to go over
to the rebels.

165
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,920
That's unlikely.

166
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,840
We know Stilgar
has initiated dialogue...

167
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,520
with the insurgent naibs to the south,
but only as emissary.

168
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Continue your surveillance
of Sietch Tabr.

169
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,120
I want to know who's coming
and who's going...

170
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,560
and where all the communications
are directed.

171
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,400
Time to pay Stilgar a visit.

172
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
If you hadn't taken them from
the city in the first place...

173
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
- this never would have happened.
- I am their guardian, Alia.

174
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
Are you suggesting she wouldn't
be safe at the palace with me?

175
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,360
I am demanding that she not be used
as a pawn in a civil war.

176
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,680
You know as well as I that Ghanima
must be returned to the court.

177
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,240
She's right, Irulan.

178
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,960
As long as I designate
Sietch Tabr neutral territory...

179
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,400
no violence may be committed
by any party to this conflict.

180
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,240
However, holding Ghanima against
the imperial regent's will...

181
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,280
could be considered abduction.

182
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,920
As naib of this sietch...

183
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,480
I surrender Ghanima to
the imperial regent on one condition-

184
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,280
that the Princess Irulan
accompany her.

185
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,320
If any harm comes
to either the princess...

186
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
or the royal heir...

187
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,440
the neutrality of this tribe
will be forfeit...

188
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,600
and allegiance
to the imperial throne...

189
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,040
disavowed.

190
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,960
Agreed.

191
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,880
I want the girl ready.
We leave for Arakeen immediately.

192
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Forgive me, Irulan.

193
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,120
I may have placed you
in grave danger.

194
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,640
Keep feeding him more and more.

195
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,560
The more we feed him,
the deeper his trance.

196
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,440
The deeper the trance,
the more dangerous the trance.

197
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,600
-He's stronger than we thought.
-Then we must increase what we give him.

198
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
By the time we're through,
he'll be as mad as Alia.

199
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,360
What are you doing to me?

200
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,480
That's spice essence!

201
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
Do you hear them-
the voices in your head?

202
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Are you crazy yet, like your aunt?

203
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,640
Does that frighten you?

204
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,320
Not as much as
it will frighten you, Atreides.

205
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,280
Listen to me, Leto.

206
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
Put the weapon away, Cast Out.

207
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,520
That is what you are, isn't it?

208
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,040
Adopting the chameleon colors
of a smuggler tribe...

209
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,480
in order to keep
your true identity secret.

210
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,360
Allowing us to survive.
Trading spice.

211
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,600
That's not all, is it?

212
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,720
You're breeding sand trout.

213
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,040
I've seen the holding pens.

214
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,760
Selling worms off-planet, you hope to
break the Atreides monopoly on spice.

215
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,960
It is dangerous for you
to know these things.

216
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,920
More dangerous for you.

217
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,120
None of your worms survive long
away from Dune.

218
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,440
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

219
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
You're already saturated with spice.

220
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,440
And it can no longer harm me.

221
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,440
I have survived the crucible, Sabiha.

222
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,480
I have silenced the voices
within who would have possessed me.

223
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,760
Only I remain now
to do what I must do.

224
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,720
And what is that?

225
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,320
Save the desert.

226
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
My skin is not my own.

227
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,960
I can't- I can't do it.

228
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,920
You can. You will.

229
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm here. I try to see myself there,
but I can't.

230
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,600
- I can't.
- Patience.

231
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,720
Concentrate on visualizing
the flow of time.

232
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,920
It must move, not you.

233
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,840
It would have been easier
to begin this when you were younger.

234
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm surprised you never asked
for a Bene Gesserit teacher before.

235
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,760
They'd have leapt at the opportunity
to put you in their debt.

236
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,440
My mother had other training
in mind for me when I was younger.

237
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,920
- You can still learn.
- If I'm patient?

238
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,960
You must learn
each and every muscle...

239
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,200
as if it were a single string
on a baliset.

240
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,360
When you learn how
to play them individually...

241
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,760
you'll know how
to play them together.

242
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,360
The union of opposites,
isn't it, Jessica?

243
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,000
Recognizing the essential
instability of our universe...

244
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,880
one must learn to make it
one's own creation.

245
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,880
It is the Bene Gesserit way.

246
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,280
So you haven't forgotten
everything you were taught.

247
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,360
You need a bath.

248
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,280
We'll continue tomorrow.

249
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,800
He is a slow learner.

250
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,800
On the contrary, he's making more
progress than I would have expected...

251
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,840
in so short a time.

252
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,760
And you?

253
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,000
I know what I intend to get
out of this relationship, Wencisia.

254
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,160
What is it you expect?

255
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Our houses are at
their crossroads, Jessica-

256
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
families weakened from within.

257
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
You and I both confront the greatest
danger from those closest to us.

258
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,960
You have a daughter
from whom you are estranged.

259
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,320
I have a son
in whom I have little confidence.

260
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,720
What do you expect me
to do about that?

261
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,720
Simply...

262
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,720
consider the union of opposites.

263
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,320
We hear rumors
of your granddaughter.

264
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,000
- Ghanima?
- It seems she has survived.

265
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
Alia has taken her from Stilgar,
but Irulan is with her.

266
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,600
Get to the point, Wencisia.

267
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,760
An alliance.

268
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
Corrino and Atreides.

269
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
An alliance through marriage.

270
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,280
Under your tutelage.

271
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,560
Farad'n could be fashioned
into an acceptable mate...

272
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,440
for someone as special
as your granddaughter.

273
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,040
He has his talents,
and he's a fast learner, as you say.

274
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,840
Worse things could happen...

275
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,240
than an alliance
between old enemies.

276
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,920
Your son was clever enough
to see its potential once.

277
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,720
Surely you can see
the need for it now.

278
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,160
The idea repulses me.

279
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Surely your mentat reasoning
can see the value in it.

280
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,920
That an Atreides would willingly
marry into the house...

281
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,840
that has vowed its destruction-
it's madness!

282
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
That's exactly what my son did
when he married Irulan.

283
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,240
Politics ruled that decision,
and it averted a war.

284
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Do you not see the similarity
to our present situation?

285
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,880
Do you really thinkAlia
will agree to a marriage...

286
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,240
between Ghanima and Farad'n?

287
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,440
She is the reason you must be the one
to deliver this proposal.

288
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,160
She loved you once, Duncan, and
there's a part of her that still does.

289
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,240
You're the only one who might
reach that part of her...

290
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,160
that still knows who she is.

291
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,760
She's lost to me now.

292
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,920
You saw the evidence of that yourself.

293
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,120
You could be saving the life
of Paul's daughter, Duncan.

294
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
As long as Ghani lives,
she's a threat to Alia.

295
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,520
If we can make my daughter
believe that her niece...

296
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
is the means to eliminating
an even greater threat...

297
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,720
we can save her life...

298
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,680
and buy precious time.

299
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,960
I assume you see merit
to this marriage proposal...

300
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,040
since you gambled your own safety
to deliver it personally.

301
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,720
Merit and risk.

302
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,920
You must decide which bears
the greater weight.

303
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,880
My priests object to the idea.

304
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Because they are
myopic and parochial...

305
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,000
interested only in preserving
their own power.

306
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
Be careful, Duncan.

307
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,440
You're already standing
on the precipice.

308
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,120
It is no secret desert rebels probe
your defenses with increased success.

309
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,280
Riots here in Arakeen are the subject
of much discussion off-world.

310
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,040
Whispers of weakness and disarray
are spreading amongst the great houses.

311
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,760
Rumors encouraged by my enemies
to spread doubt and fear.

312
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,680
The jackals are gathering, Alia.

313
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
An alliance between
Corrino and Atreides...

314
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,040
would serve as reassurance
and a warning.

315
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
Prepare a formal response
to House Corrino.

316
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,240
We will allow negotiations
for a union...

317
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,480
between Ghanima
and Prince Farad'n to begin.

318
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,000
But make it clear,
Atreides interests will dominate.

319
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,840
Leave me.

320
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,040
Only my husband may remain.

321
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,480
I should have you executed
for what you did.

322
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,240
My diplomatic immunity
as Corrino envoy...

323
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,640
would make that an unwise decision.

324
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,640
Why did you come back here?

325
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,920
My allegiance to House Atreides
would permit nothing less.

326
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,040
I played no part in your decision?

327
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,280
I struggled not to allow it.

328
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,880
You can't remain at the keep.

329
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,840
I must banish you
for your treachery.

330
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,480
Otherwise, people would question
my judgement, my ruthlessness.

331
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,320
A quality you must demonstrate
often these days, no doubt.

332
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,560
They're difficult days, Duncan.

333
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,760
Lonely days.

334
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,360
I've missed you.

335
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,400
Where would you have me go?

336
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,840
Sietch Tabr.
Neutral territory.

337
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,120
Stilgar is trying to broker a peace
between the Quizrate and the rebels.

338
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,040
Perhaps your mentat qualities
can be useful.

339
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,880
At least you'll be safe there.

340
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,200
There is no one to restrain Alia.

341
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,200
Her forces are probing deeper and deeper
into the southern regions...

342
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,080
attacking rebel sietches
wherever she thinks they are.

343
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,040
And still, there are riots
in the streets of Arakeen itself.

344
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,480
And what of the boy Leto?
What do they say about him?

345
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,800
If he survived the assassin,
he did not survive the desert.

346
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,920
Worms, storms-
There won't be a body.

347
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,120
Where are you going?

348
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,280
- To look for the boy.
- That cannot be permitted.

349
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,720
We never had any intention of helping
someone like you, enemy of ours.

350
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,360
Cursed be your name, Atreides.

351
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,360
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

352
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,320
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

353
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,760
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths.

354
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,320
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm...

355
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
is the worm.

356
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,480
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

357
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,680
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

358
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,160
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

359
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,320
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

360
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,640
I will not fear!
Fear is the mind killer!

361
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,800
I will face my fear!
I will let it pass through me!

362
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,720
I will not fear!

363
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,440
I could have killed you.

364
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,400
It wouldn't have been that easy.

365
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,760
I wanted to believe you.

366
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,120
I wanted to believe that
I could do it, but I didn't.

367
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,480
I couldn't.
I didn't truly think it was possible.

368
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,760
And then my mind melted away.

369
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,640
I gave up fighting you,
and it happened.

370
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,080
It wasn't me you were fighting.

371
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,800
It was myself.

372
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,360
All that I've learned- all the
nonsense I've imprisoned myself with-

373
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
I feel-

374
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,360
I feel like I'm being reborn...

375
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,320
like I'm standing on the threshold
of something extraordinary.

376
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,680
Para-Bindu balance, Farad'n.

377
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,000
But only on the threshold.

378
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,760
- Patience?
- Yes, patience.

379
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,920
Remember...

380
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,840
it's one thing to gain control
of your perceptions...

381
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,640
quite another to gain control
of your desires.

382
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,080
And if I succeed?

383
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,840
You'll find reality to be quite
a bit different than you thought.

384
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,640
My skin is not my own.

385
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,920
Must you insist on
sneaking away like this?

386
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,600
I still feel him, Irulan.

387
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,880
His presence. Sometimes I even think
I can hear his laughter in the wind.

388
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,720
Mocking your decision
to marry Farad'n, I hope.

389
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,080
Why should he mock it?

390
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,760
I cannot stand by and let you be used
as a pawn in Alia's schemes.

391
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Is that what you think,
that I'm being used?

392
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,680
That I've agreed to this marriage
as part of some conspiracy with Alia?

393
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,800
No. But I know you, Ghani.

394
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,680
There is more to your decision
than anyone else believes.

395
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,080
Alia wants my grandmother back.

396
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,080
Farad'n is simply the means.

397
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,680
But what do you want?

398
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,040
Farad'n's blood on
the wedding sheets, not mine.

399
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,800
You cannot remain neutral
any longer, Stilgar.

400
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,000
You must ally your tribe
with the rebel forces.

401
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,520
Never! Rebellion against
the sister of Muad'Dib...

402
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,240
would bring the greatest dishonor
I could imagine.

403
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,960
There is no more sister of Muad'Dib.
She's gone-

404
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
lost to the evil that possesses her.

405
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,520
And as long as you refuse
to believe it, you wear its collar.

406
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,080
Enough!
You are the guest of my tribe.

407
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,320
I have given you my countenance.

408
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,240
But I swear, if you provoke me further
with talk of insurrection...

409
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,480
I will have your water!

410
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,440
What is it, Tariq?

411
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,840
- Why have we stopped?
- Desert demon.

412
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,160
In human form.

413
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,240
There are no such things.

414
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,760
Your guide has released the worm.

415
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,160
We have a little time
before he returns.

416
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,560
You made it stop.

417
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,320
The worm obeyed your command.

418
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,600
Yes.

419
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,560
They say Leto Atreides is dead...

420
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,000
killed by Corrino treachery.

421
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,760
A myth I have allowed to persist
until I am ready.

422
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
For what?

423
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,240
To undo what's been done
in your name... Father.

424
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,040
You have no idea who I am.

425
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,360
This is your ring, Father.

426
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,680
Passed from Duke Leto to you,
and then unto me.

427
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,400
How far has it gone...

428
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,360
this thing you've done to yourself?

429
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,160
I am a desert creature.

430
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,840
Was there no other way?

431
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
There was only one way
to bring about The Golden Path.

432
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,400
You cannot control the future.

433
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,920
A man named Muad'Dib
should have heeded that advice.

434
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,240
Do you think Muad'Dib couldn't see
the thing that you want to do?

435
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,360
Do you think he didn't
confront the possibility?

436
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,640
Muad'Dib was afraid.

437
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,600
He was trapped
by his own prophecy...

438
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,880
a victim of what he knew
he could not choose.

439
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,720
So I have chosen...

440
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,120
to make a world where humankind
can create its own future...

441
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,800
from moment to moment...

442
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,800
free of one man's vision...

443
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,760
free from the perversion
of the prophet's words...

444
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,960
and free of future
pre-determined.

445
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,760
This does not belong to me.

446
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,640
How many nights I have sat
on a dune just like this...

447
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,920
imagining a night just like this...

448
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,400
with my father.

449
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,920
Just the two of us...

450
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,840
talking and- and laughing.

451
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,840
And how many nights I have gone to sleep
on the cold floor of the sietch...

452
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,160
dreaming of his arms around me...

453
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,200
sheltering me from everything
I was afraid of...

454
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
everything I could not understand.

455
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,480
Are you still a good Fremen?

456
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,400
Yes.

457
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,880
Then will you permit...

458
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,920
a blind man...

459
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960
to go out into the desert...

460
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,600
and find peace on his own terms?

461
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,200
Not yet.

462
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,600
Cursed be the name Atreides.

463
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,120
Body shield. Armed.

464
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,840
Eight of nine new settlements
have been abandoned.

465
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,440
Many of the old sietch communities
are becoming overrun with refugees.

466
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,440
The holy regent demands that you abandon
your pledge of neutrality.

467
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,760
Ally your forces with hers and
put an end to this damnable rebellion.

468
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,120
Alia is Fremen.

469
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,400
She knows she cannot make
such a demand on me...

470
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,560
or on any other naib!

471
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,400
You can no longer remain
above the fight, Stilgar.

472
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,520
Your feeble attempts to mediate
have accomplished nothing.

473
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,960
It is time for you to choose.

474
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,560
Are you with the empire
or against it?

475
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,560
It is not a choice
I will make because...

476
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,520
some fop of a priest demands it.

477
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,360
Well, perhaps the royal consort...

478
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,840
can talk some sense
into this obstinate fool.

479
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,440
I can do better than that.

480
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,680
The "royal cuckold" thanks you
for this opportunity.

481
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,920
Stilgar will now make his choice.

482
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,320
You have violated sanctuary.

483
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,840
You have defiled...

484
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,880
the honor of my people.

485
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,280
No, Stil.

486
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,880
I have just cut the collar
from around your neck.

487
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,880
That was the right choice, Stil.

488
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,280
Two deaths for the Atreides...

489
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,120
the second one for no better reason
than the first.

490
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,200
It was a sign.

491
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,000
He forced our hand.

492
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,120
Now Alia will be forced
to move against us.

493
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,920
He has taken the tribe
into the desert.

494
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,840
No one knows where...

495
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,560
but his only refuge
will be with the rebels.

496
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,520
Idaho acted impulsively, milady.
He was-

497
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,480
Was my husband!

498
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,480
Kanly...

499
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,640
vendetta...

500
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,240
on Stilgar and all of his tribe
that joined him.

501
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,560
Let them be hunted down
like desert rabbits.

502
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,280
Yes, yes. Kill them.

503
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,760
I want their skins
when they're caught.

504
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,640
Nice touch, yes.
Very creative.

505
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,680
This is the one
we took on the south face.

506
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,600
He came across the bled
from the south wall.

507
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,040
So, they say you rode a worm here.

508
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,200
A 20-thumper ride.

509
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,400
- And yet, you are not Fremen.
- They taught me well.

510
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,600
Rumors across the desert
say you're dead, Gurney Halleck.

511
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,760
There are many
who wished it were true.

512
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,160
The sons of Esmar Tuek
are not among them, old friend.

513
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,240
We've been waiting on you,
Gurney Halleck.

514
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,080
- How did you know I'd come here?
- My father told me.

515
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,280
Your father?

516
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,200
Well, in the desert,
sheltered once is sheltered always.

517
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,080
After the Harkonnen invasion,
these were the men who protected you...

518
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,960
before you were finally
reunited with Muad'Dib.

519
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,520
A reunion which allowed me
to join his rebellion...

520
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,400
against Shaddam
and the imperial forces.

521
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,440
Another rebellion awaits you,
Gurney Halleck.

522
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,880
My loyalty is to House Atreides.

523
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,560
I am House Atreides.

524
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,160
And what of your aunt?

525
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,840
My aunt is lost-

526
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,480
lost to forces
she could not control...

527
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,000
to forces who want
to destroy House Atreides.

528
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,280
What have you done to yourself?

529
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,280
I have made a choice...

530
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,360
accepted a destiny, nothing more.

531
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,120
My eyes can see it...

532
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,600
but my mind refuses to believe it.

533
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,520
Believe it, Gurney.

534
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,560
Remember the words of my father
and my grandfather, your duke.

535
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,040
They spoke to you of desert power.

536
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,560
I am desert power...

537
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,160
and nothing can stop
what is going to happen.

538
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,680
We are here to honor
the throne of Muad'Dib...

539
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,200
and his sister, the holy regent.

540
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,360
We are here to honor his esteemed
daughter with the presentation...

541
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,600
of our son, Prince Farad'n...

542
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,160
heir to the throne
of House Corrino.

543
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,680
We offer our deepest condolences
on the loss of your brother.

544
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,680
Perhaps the union of our houses...

545
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,800
can put an end to the treachery
that took his life...

546
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,200
treachery that was bred
on Salusa Secundus.

547
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,680
What did you say?

548
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,560
I am ashamed to say that the animals
that killed Leto, son of Muad'Dib...

549
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,400
were created and trained
on my planet.

550
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,880
And the regent of House Corrino
knew of this?

551
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,760
- She planned it.
- How dare you!

552
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,080
I'll dare quite a few things
from now on, Mother.

553
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,880
You've been quite adept
at making decisions in my name...

554
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,040
decisions which I've found
extremely distasteful.

555
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,640
You insolent bastard.

556
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,720
Let's not discuss
your weaknesses now, Mother.

557
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,880
I forbid you to say another word.

558
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,120
You forbid nothing.

559
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,440
As heir to the throne of House Corrino,
I am now the author of my own decisions.

560
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,640
My mother is stripped of all accounts
and privileges of the House Corrino.

561
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,800
She is no longer
sovereign regent of this family.

562
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,200
She is, from this moment forward,
banished.

563
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,320
You're more of a man
than I'd ever thought possible.

564
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,120
And you can spend the rest of your days
pondering that in utter darkness.

565
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,400
Patience is a virtue I have
in abundance, if you haven't noticed.

566
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,040
Hold.

567
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,440
Did you have anything to do
with the death of my brother?

568
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,200
I knew nothing of the plot against him
until it was too late.

569
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,560
Forgive me.
I am at your mercy.

570
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,240
This is my wedding present to you.

571
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,200
I have nothing else.
No dowry.

572
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,480
Only the truth.

573
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,000
I believe him.

574
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,600
Take her. Leave him.

575
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Maybe he'll amuse us
with more intrigue...

576
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,760
and double-cross in the days to come.

577
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,480
Don't you find it interesting,
Jessica...

578
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,320
how the sins of the mother
bloom in the children they bear?

579
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,560
She's weakened by madness.

580
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,560
She still commands
the imperial armies.

581
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,520
They are retreating to the city...

582
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,360
trapped by the shield wall
from which they are vulnerable.

583
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,280
They say the price on your head
keeps going up.

584
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,000
Then I say unto you...

585
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,000
send men...

586
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,320
to summon worms!

587
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,560
Then let us go...

588
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,640
to Arakeen...

589
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,800
to collect it.

590
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,240
Manut.

591
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,280
A storm.

592
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,280
Not a storm.

593
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,800
- I must get word to the palace.
- Yeah.

594
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
Don't be afraid, Gurney-Man.

595
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,320
There is no way...

596
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,640
to hasten
what is meant to be.

597
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,000
When the time is right...

598
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,600
he will find us.

599
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,080
Who are you?

600
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,360
Who I am
doesn't matter anymore.

601
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,440
It matters to me.

602
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,120
Do you think I would have
left this place if I had known?

603
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,880
Do you think I would have abandoned you
if I knew you were still alive?

604
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,880
You did what you
were meant to do.

605
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,480
Tell me.

606
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,800
Let me hear you say it.

607
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,040
Tell me it isn't true.

608
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,960
I couldn't live...

609
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,400
if I knew I had forsaken you.

610
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,640
Paul Atreides is no more,
Gurney-Man.

611
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,080
The desert winds have erased
all trace of his passage here.

612
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,600
And soon...

613
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,080
Muad'Dib must follow.

614
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,040
Please, Gurney, I'm tired...

615
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,520
hungry.

616
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,840
Get me some food.

617
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,200
Ah, Stil. So predictable.

618
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,000
It's as if they're daring you
to confront them...

619
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,240
challenging you
to commit troops, thopters.

620
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,680
They think I've retreated to the
sanctuary of the city where I'm trapped.

621
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,920
It's a tactic learned from my brother
when he defeated Shaddam...

622
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,160
and took backArrakis.

623
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,720
Poor Stil.

624
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,320
If you only knew
it is you who are trapped...

625
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,840
not I.

626
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,600
They are still over a day's ride
from Arakeen.

627
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,240
Fine.

628
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,200
I'm going back to the palace.

629
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,880
I have a wedding to attend.

630
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,440
Leave me.

631
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,680
Do as I say!

632
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,600
There's no need for that
with me, Ghanima.

633
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,240
Our plan worked.

634
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,760
You're alive!

635
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,960
I knew it.

636
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,120
Oh, I have missed you.

637
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,720
I'm sorry, Ghanima.

638
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,240
I'm so sorry.

639
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,520
I had to let you think that I was dead.
It was the only way-

640
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,920
the only way that I could start
what must now be finished.

641
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,800
Idolaters! Blasphemers!

642
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,760
You'll spoil this place!

643
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,640
The desert will swallow you!

644
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,280
His words are sacrilege.
His presence must not be tolerated.

645
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,640
You must give the order, Holy One.

646
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,440
You must send us to take him.

647
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,960
Caution, darling.
Do not act impulsively.

648
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,640
Not yet.

649
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,320
He is an outrage
to the religion of Muad'Dib.

650
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,960
But that's the point, my darling.

651
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,120
We must know for sure whether
he really is your brother...

652
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,600
mustn't we?

653
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,760
It would not do to make
a martyr of him just yet.

654
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,440
Who is it
that calls for Muad'Dib?

655
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,400
Help us, Muad'Dib.

656
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,800
Muad'Dib's words are the wind.

657
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,800
They vanish...
like water on the sand.

658
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,280
I'll give you Muad'Dib's words.

659
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,320
I'll rub your faces in them!

660
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
I am the voice
from the wilderness...

661
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,040
and I bring you a warning.

662
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,240
The water we spread upon the desert
has become blood.

663
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,480
Blood... upon the land
which was once clean and pure.

664
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,120
We have provoked the desert...
forsaken its ways.

665
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,400
We have succumbed
to mindless ritual...

666
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,560
and seductive ceremony...

667
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,960
placed faith in those
who crush dissent...

668
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,200
enrich themselves with power...

669
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,480
commit atrocity.

670
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,040
All in the name
of righteousness!

671
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,520
All in the name...

672
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,000
of Muad'Dib.

673
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,080
We have fouled the nest...

674
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,680
and it is killing us.

675
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,640
But I have seen another path...

676
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,200
a golden path-

677
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,160
the path Muad'Dib could not take.

678
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,240
I have stood upon the sand...

679
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,200
and I have seen a beast rise up.

680
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,400
And upon the head of that beast...

681
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,040
is the name of salvation...

682
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,200
come to spill water
upon the sand...

683
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,120
come to lead us back...

684
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,520
to a dry and thirsty land.

685
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,800
Only one blasphemy remains...

686
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,720
and that blasphemy...

687
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,600
is Alia!

688
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,880
Forgive me...

689
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,200
Sister.

690
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,880
It's in your hands now...

691
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,760
Son.

692
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,600
Where is she?

693
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,640
Behold me, family!

694
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,480
I am Leto!

695
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,800
Lion of Atreides...

696
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,720
returned from the desert
to announce Sachar Nabai-

697
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,640
The Golden Path-

698
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,800
to rid humanity of the perversions
done in Muad'Dib's name...

699
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,360
and to save it from the abomination
known as Alia.

700
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,840
Seize him!

701
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,200
The time has come, Aunt.

702
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,800
You must face the future.

703
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,760
I'll drink your blood!

704
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,600
Alia, stop it!
Stop yourself!.

705
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,240
You sorry bitch!

706
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,000
You Bene Gesserit whore!

707
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,680
Did you think
you could escape my vengeance?

708
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,760
Did you think
I was defeated forever?

709
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,080
I have her, daughter-
your precious Alia.

710
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,240
She's mine! I won!

711
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,360
Demon! Let her make
her own choice!

712
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,880
Mommy... please help me.

713
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,400
Help yourself.

714
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,680
Yes.! Yes, do it.
Sink it in.

715
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,160
Bathe our hands
in his hot blood.

716
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,240
No.! Darling.! Stop.! Stop.!

717
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,400
Stop.! We're so close.!

718
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,920
I love you. I can save you.
Don't stop now. We're so close.

719
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,520
I want my brother.

720
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,280
You'll not change your mind
and return with me to Caladan?

721
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,520
I must remain here, my lady...

722
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,680
at Sietch Tabr with Stilgar.

723
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,880
He will need my help
to bring peace back to this land.

724
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,040
- And you?
- I have no home but here.

725
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,760
Besides, there will be children again,
and they will need me.

726
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,000
Dear friend.

727
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,640
Alia's water.

728
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,880
Take it into the desert and spread it
upon the open sand in the midday sun.

729
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,040
It is our way.

730
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,000
Are you going back
to Sietch Tabr?

731
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,960
I wish to return
to our old ways.

732
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,920
The desert's dying, Stil.

733
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,800
And the Fremen, too, I'm afraid.

734
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,920
We're about to go through
the crucible...

735
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,480
but we'll come out
the other side.

736
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,040
We always arise
from our own ashes.

737
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,920
Everything returns later in its...
changed form.

738
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,440
Your grandfather's ring...

739
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,840
and your father's.

740
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,800
And now the Fremen's...

741
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,360
to remind you of Muad'Dib...

742
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,760
to remind you
that all humans make mistakes...

743
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,280
and that all leaders
are but human.

744
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,920
He runs and runs and runs.

745
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,960
And when he's exhausted himself...

746
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,560
he returns to me...

747
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,040
puts his head in my lap...

748
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,520
and asks me to help him
find a way to die.

749
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,360
But why does he want to die?

750
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,160
To save himself...

751
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,680
from the sacrifices
he must make-

752
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,320
sacrifices for the future of us all.

753
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,000
Then there is a place for me
in this future?

754
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,880
Your blood was spared
the day Leto came back to me.

755
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,480
What of our marriage then?

756
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,520
As my mother was not wife...

757
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,840
you shall never be husband.

758
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,200
Politics.

759
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,000
Politics.

760
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,120
But in time, there may be love...

761
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,200
which is more
than my brother will have.

762
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,200
One of us
had to accept the agony.

763
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,440
He was always the stronger.

764
01:22:15,341 --> 01:22:22,541
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

765
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,320
History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.

766
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,640
A chapter has ended...

767
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,640
swept away by the whirlwind.

768
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,200
One door has closed...

769
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,040
but another has opened.

770
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,680
And on the other side...

771
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,160
our future.

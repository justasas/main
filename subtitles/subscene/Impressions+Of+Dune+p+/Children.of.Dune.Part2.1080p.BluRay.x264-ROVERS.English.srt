STILGAR: We've learned much
these past few days.

00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:42,183
It was meant to look like
rebel Fremen.

towards the Atreides

But I don't believe it.

547

Why?

548

During interrogation,

549
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,517
the ones we captured
cried out the name Jacurutu,

550
00:41:56,518 --> 00:42:00,017
and then died.

of Jacurutu Sietch

We could never find out whether
the place actually existed.

The name Jacurutu is a synonym
for evil, Jessica.

558
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:21,852
The Iduali tribe
came from there.

559
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,939
They were water stealers...

560
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,602

under Fremen law -

00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:31,353

was declared taboo.

No Fremen was allowed
to look for it.

00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,479
But legend persists
that not all the Iduali were wiped out,

570
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,688
that some escaped
to become known as the Cast Out.

571
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,437

that these Cast Out

572

for what happened the other day?

makes my blood run cold.

They want to drive you out,

611
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:37,901
but I only want a tiny
little corner for myself,

612
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,068
an occasional moment
with your senses.

613
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:44,527
An occasional taste,
an occasional touch.

Oh, yes, yes, all that.

619
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,360
Yes, of course
I would've killed you.

620
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:00,193
I mean, you and your brother
stood in my way,

621
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,069

622
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,610

and I am yours to command.

626
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:18,829
And how little I ask in return.

627
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,493

628
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:36,446
To command?

00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:38,196
Oh, yes, yours.

00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:40,946

There will be nothing
standing in our way.

634
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,071
The voices in my head...

635
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:53,612
Will be silenced.

636
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:56,487

Will be destroyed.

637
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:00,863

in the way of our powers.

638
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:06,072
From this moment on
the future is ours.

639
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:09,458
(Both laugh)

640
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:36,657
It comes
just like you summoned it.

641
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,752
No, it summoned me, Stil.

642
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:42,792
And may I ask why...

643
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:48,573
...you risked a sand crossing
at night without bodyguards?

644
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,707
Come, come, Stil.

645
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:54,823
How often
do you ride the sands anymore

646
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:57,782
when you want, where you want?

647
00:47:57,783 --> 00:47:59,324
Calling a worm

648
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:02,574
instead of running
with a flock of 'thopters?

649
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:07,783
How often... how often do you
arm the thumper and just go,

650
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:11,124
like the Fremen you used to be?

651
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:16,575
"Used to be"?

652
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:18,330
Mmm?

653
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:23,617
You know, in many corners
of the universe,

654
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:25,787
this delicate thing...

655
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,627
...is considered
a wondrous beauty.

656
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:34,825
But here, here it's a symbol...

657
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:38,283
...a symbol of the corruption
infecting Arrakis.

658
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:40,950
It wouldn't exist but for
the changes we're enforcing

659
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,492
on this place.

660
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:45,867
Changes
inspired by your father.

661
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:48,159
No, that's the official
Stilgar speaking,

662
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,701
the Government Stilgar.

663
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:51,242
The Fremen Stilgar

664
00:48:51,243 --> 00:48:53,743
is still repulsed
at this alien life, isn't he?

665
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:55,249
Huh.

666
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,368
I have a serious problem, Stil.

667
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:01,874
So I've gathered.

668
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:08,546
The problem with me
is the problem with this place.

669
00:49:09,953 --> 00:49:13,793
My father,
he left so many things undone.

670
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,500
I don't understand.

671
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:21,453
A good ruler doesn't need
to be a prophet, Stil.

672
00:49:21,454 --> 00:49:22,993
Not even godlike.

673
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:27,744
A good ruler has to be sensitive
to the ones he rules.

674
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,285
Mm-hm.

675
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:34,286
The ancient meaning
of the Fremen word 'Naib'

676
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:36,337
is 'servant of the sietch'.

677
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,536
When the owner dies,
the crysknife dissolves, yes?

678
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:45,043
It is our legend.

679
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:50,795
Muad'Dib has dissolved
but his crysknife has not.

680
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,586
Stil, a new path must be taken.

681
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,921
One that may require me
to demystify my own father...

682
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:04,418
...to destroy his legacy.

683
00:50:05,997 --> 00:50:11,205
These are not sentiments
I'd share with your aunt

684
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:13,288
or her priests, young lord.

685
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:14,959
Beware Alia, Stil.

686
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:18,798
She's no longer your friend.

687
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:25,465
And, Stil, you must promise
to protect Ghanima.

688
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:29,205
If anything should happen
to me - anything -

689
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,422
my sister will be your only hope.

690
00:50:49,665 --> 00:50:51,171
You were in the desert?

691
00:50:53,832 --> 00:50:57,373
Yes, I, uh... I couldn't sleep.

692
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:59,290
I could have kept you company.

693
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,248
You were sleeping.

694
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,082
I didn't want to disturb you.

695
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,914
You used to...

696
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:07,956
...all the time.

697
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:10,206
We'd sneak out
of the sietch together.

698
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,915
No-one ever knew.

699
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:14,713
Sometimes we wouldn't be back
till dawn.

700
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,832
I had to talk to Stilgar.

701
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:20,760
Oh, I see.

702
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,469
Ghanima, we may have to face
some of what's coming apart.

703
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,881
That doesn't mean
you have to face it alone.

704
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:48,500
The Atreides man
named Gurney Halleck

705
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:52,750
is being sent to the desert
to ask questions.

706
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:54,792
Sooner or later,

707
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:57,583
he will encounter someone
who can be bought.

708
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,458
Then we must make sure
he buys the right answers.

709
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:03,542
What shall I do

the possibility of possession,

He has visions...

755
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:31,217
...of a pilgrimage
deep into the desert.

756
00:55:31,218 --> 00:55:34,228
A journey to a faraway place...

757
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,929
...where he sees our father...

758
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:43,509
...and speaks to him
of how things must change.

759

How?

761
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:51,938
He can't tell me.

762
00:55:55,094 --> 00:55:57,552
I think he's holding things
back from me.

763
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,969
But I know this -
it's not possession

764

more and more repression.

803

Exactly as we want.

804
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:36,517

805
00:58:36,518 --> 00:58:38,642
the more fear and confusion
we harvest.

807

the more Fremen
she drives into the south,

808

they will openly rebel.

out of the way,

810
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:50,644

more vulnerable than ever.

no danger.

1
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,828
<i>Twelve years of war.</i>

2
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:36,025
<i>Twelve years since Emperor Shaddam</i>
<i>the Fourth was defeated...</i>

3
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,766
<i>and Paul Muad'dib's wild Fremen</i>
<i>spread out across the universe...</i>

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,436
<i>exterminating all that remained</i>
<i>of the old imperial armies...</i>

5
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,707
<i>colonizing the planets</i>
<i>of the known universe...</i>

6
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,012
<i>one by one under his rule...</i>

7
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,382
<i>sweeping away anything...</i>

8
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,944
<i>and anyone who resisted.</i>

9
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,926
<i>Millions have been defeated.</i>

10
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,027
<i>Millions more have been slaughtered.</i>

11
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,538
<i>There are no innocents anywhere.</i>

12
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,773
<i>And the name of Muad'dib</i>
<i>is no longer a prayer.</i>

13
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,871
<i>For many, it is now a curse.</i>

14
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,952
The mercy of Muad'dib...

15
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,120
is on our worst enemies.

16
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,824
The compassion of Muad'dib--

17
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,093
Commander Farok,
the conversions have begun.

18
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,931
Anyone refusing the peace of Muad'dib
will be executed.

19
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,698
So it is written.

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,708
You who deny the glory of Muad'dib...

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,267
are condemned to death.

22
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,641
Sir, your son--

23
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,944
He's been wounded.

24
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,476
My eyes! My eyes!

25
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,645
I'm blind, Father. I'm blind!

26
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,325
Don't give me to the desert, Father.
Please!

27
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,418
Don't send me to die.

28
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,038
<i>If history teaches us anything...</i>

29
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,768
<i>it is simply this</i>--

30
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:00,108
<i>Every revolution carries within it</i>
<i>the seeds of its own destruction.</i>

31
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,014
<i>And empires that rise will one day fall.</i>

32
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,055
<i>Arrakis.</i>

33
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,955
<i>Dune.</i>

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,995
<i>Once the wasteland of the universe...</i>

35
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,860
<i>now an imperial capital.</i>

36
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,164
<i>For it is here and only here</i>
<i>that giant worms still roam...</i>

37
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,501
<i>creating spice...</i>

38
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,009
<i>still the greatest treasure</i>
<i>in the universe...</i>

39
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,806
<i>still the cause of conspiracy...</i>

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,871
<i>betrayal and murder.</i>

41
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,829
- The holy sister!
- Alia!

42
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,543
In the beginning, we were all empty.

43
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,980
Ignorant of all things.

44
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,544
We did not know the power
that resides in every place.

45
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,748
And in all time.

46
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,224
He is the power that awakens the soul.

47
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,784
And brings us joy.

48
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,827
Muad'dib! I don't suppose you feel
it's necessary to inform me...

49
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,958
when you go on these walkabouts.

50
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,629
You'd only try and stop me... again.

51
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,639
- The streets are full of danger.
- Truth is in the streets, Stil...

52
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,473
not in this parade of sycophants
who flutter around this palace...

53
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,480
with their meaningless statistics
and empty ritual.

54
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,574
Ritual is the way by which
men are enlightened, Muad'dib.

55
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,915
Tell me, Korba...

56
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,752
when was it you reinvented yourself from
Fremen Fedaykin to religious fanatic?

57
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,261
The day you defeated Shaddam
and his armies, Muad'dib.

58
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,455
The day I saw the future.

59
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,661
The city's filled
with adventurers, Muad'dib.

60
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,697
Not to mention agents of
the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit...

61
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,006
and the former imperial family.

62
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,241
Surely they conspire to something
a little more elegant...

63
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,182
than assassination
on the streets of Arakeen.

64
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,714
You are vulnerable, Muad'dib.

65
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,952
No matter how powerful
you have become...

66
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,993
you cannot escape this simple fact.

67
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,694
You're right about one thing, Stil.

68
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,198
There is no escape.

69
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,024
I'm not asleep.

70
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,032
I thought the doctors said
you were supposed to rest.

71
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:03,268
As long as you insist on wandering
the city like some off-world pilgrim...

72
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,505
I will never be able to rest.

73
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,013
Are you going to lecture me too?

74
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,623
While I was walking,
I stepped in a puddle.

75
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,328
An open pool of water in the street.

76
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:39,308
Muad'dib has brought many wonders
to Arrakis, the people say.

77
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,370
Muad'dib spends water like a madman.

78
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,975
That's what they say, Chani.

79
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,351
The old Fremen.

80
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,447
I hear them...

81
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,856
in the streets when I walk.

82
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,823
We've become water-fat.

83
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,765
They resent the wonders
I've brought to their desert.

84
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,740
They resent me.

85
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,346
You know what I'd pay
to end these wars?

86
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:28,124
To separate myself from this...

87
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,254
damnable myth I've become?

88
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,059
What's to stop you?

89
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,435
Command it, Muad'dib.

90
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,201
After all, you are the emperor.

91
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,548
Even if I vanished tomorrow,
the revolution would follow my ghost.

92
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,883
This is not a clean place.

93
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,460
It's time to return to the desert.

94
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,623
We were happy there.

95
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,316
<i>Father.</i>

96
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,498
<i>I'm waiting and I'm ready.</i>

97
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,432
<i>To know the future</i>
<i>is to be trapped by it.</i>

98
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,507
<i>But knowing there's a trap</i>
<i>is the first step in evading it.</i>

99
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,878
<i>It's the first step</i>
<i>along the Golden Path.</i>

100
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:01,180
<i>I'm the answer.</i>
<i>I'm ready, Father.</i>

101
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,682
<i>And I am ready, Father.</i>

102
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,756
<i>The answer's standing</i>
<i>right in front of you...</i>

103
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,262
<i>in the Golden Path.</i>

104
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,051
Is there no other way?

105
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,381
Everywhere we turn,
his power confronts us.

106
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,655
- He's a curse.
- He's a messiah.

107
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,720
You can't launch a frontal attack
on a messiah.

108
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,426
Even if you succeed,
their martyrdom remains.

109
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,401
But he is human,
and because he is human...

110
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,700
he has his weaknesses.

111
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,037
So, what do you suggest, Princess?

112
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,374
Something subtle. Something...

113
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,811
unexpected.

114
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,415
A ghost, perhaps.

115
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,412
May I introduce our friend,
Reverend Mother, Scytale of the Tleilaxu.

116
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,016
Get to the point, Wencisia.

117
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,857
I haven't traveled all the way
to the edge of the universe...

118
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,424
to discuss nonsense
with a face dancer.

119
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,404
You Bene Gesserit are desperate to
regain control of Muad'dib's bloodline...

120
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,306
and because you want to break
his monopoly on spice.

121
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,470
He who controls the spice
controls the universe.

122
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,037
As long as Muad'dib controls Arrakis...

123
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,083
we are all at his mercy.

124
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,678
And that's why I intend
to destroy that domination...

125
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,951
and return the imperial throne
to the planet Kaitain...

126
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,050
and the Corrino family,
where it rightfully belongs.

127
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,859
Face dancers, sex toys...

128
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,401
musicians, technicians--

129
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,395
Whatever the need...

130
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,566
we have the breed.

131
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,743
- Good gods!
- Good chemistry is more like it.

132
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,614
Duncan Idaho.

133
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,153
Yes, the Atreides hero.

134
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,884
Paul Muad'dib's most beloved
friend and teacher.

135
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,085
But Idaho is dead.

136
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,253
Killed by your father's Sardukar.

137
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,561
Even in defeat, my father's men
did not abandon wisdom, Reverend Mother.

138
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,628
A few precious pieces
of Idaho's ruined flesh...

139
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,105
hidden away, saved...

140
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,304
awaiting just the right time,
the right place.

141
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,473
Perfect duplicate. Perfect ghola.

142
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,540
A perfect gift for a lonely emperor.

143
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,485
A time bomb waiting
for the trigger to explode.

144
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,513
- You intend to kill Muad'dib?
- Exactly.

145
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,789
But that will mean chaos.

146
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,958
- Spice production will be disrupted.
- Learn the lesson my father ignored.

147
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,433
It's not who controls the spice...

148
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,666
but who has the ability to disrupt
the spice who controls the universe.

149
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,037
But what makes you think...

150
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,442
Muad'dib will ever accept this... ghost?

151
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,447
I'm leaving it up to the Spacing Guild.

152
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,512
And what of the trigger?

153
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,553
The device to set the time bomb off?

154
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,555
Leave that to me.

155
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,268
Test after test, and still nothing.

156
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,336
I'm healthy, strong.

157
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,573
No matter what they do,
the doctors can't find the reason...

158
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,376
why I'm unable to conceive.

159
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,384
What does Muad'dib say?

160
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,218
Muad'dib is afraid.

161
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,784
He fears for me
if I have another child.

162
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,285
I can feel it.

163
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,026
He may be right to fear.

164
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,762
Someone has been feeding you a poison.

165
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,599
It's the only possibility left.

166
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,105
But the doctors
have never found evidence.

167
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,599
They wouldn't.

168
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,669
Its traces are subtle, confusing.

169
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,307
Of the most sophisticated chemistry.

170
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,045
Beyond their knowledge.

171
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,484
Surely from off-world.

172
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,782
But...

173
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,621
there are remedies.

174
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,161
The ancient Fremen diet...

175
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,824
which might overcome
the contraceptive's effects.

176
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,869
But it's dangerous.

177
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,963
You would be required to eat greater
and greater quantities of spice.

178
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,940
And if you conceive...

179
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,807
it will accelerate your pregnancy.

180
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,083
But the question remains...

181
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,712
who has been able to feed you
the contraceptives for so long?

182
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,053
Be that as it may...

183
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,424
this is a question that cannot be
delayed any longer.

184
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,123
The great houses are still demanding...

185
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,224
that a constitution be on the agenda...

186
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,735
at the next convention of the Lansraad.

187
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,033
It's nothing but a ruse...

188
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,736
contrived by enemies of House Atreides
to conceal far more sinister motives.

189
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,278
Perhaps we could offer the appearance
of a constitution.

190
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,173
Something ceremonial.

191
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,478
It doesn't need to be real.

192
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,718
Deceit, after all,
is a legitimate tool of statecraft.

193
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
Bravo, sister-in-law.

194
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,954
I couldn't have said it better.

195
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,497
Yes, perhaps something
at the local level.

196
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,033
Something impotent,
virtually meaningless.

197
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,830
No!

198
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,303
Atreides power
must never be marginalized...

199
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,704
by the chaos of democracy.

200
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,642
- I'm sure my brother agrees.
- <i>Father.</i>

201
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,481
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

202
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,222
<i>You must decide.</i>

203
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,186
<i>The first step. You can't wait.</i>

204
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,854
<i>Along the Golden Path.</i>

205
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,455
<i>The answer's standing</i>
<i>right in front of you.</i>

206
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,797
<i>But you must decide.</i>

207
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,579
Alia knows my mind.
I forbid a constitution.

208
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,744
Order in council this day,
et cetera, et cetera.

209
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,219
Irulan, are you taking this down?

210
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,950
Yes, my lord.

211
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,222
We will deliver the formal declaration
when the Guild ambassador arrives...

212
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,526
to present his credentials.

213
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,657
Then...

214
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,224
if there's nothing more--

215
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,974
A Guild embassy, Muad'dib?

216
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,848
On Arrakis?

217
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,948
The Council of Naibs
won't like this, Muad'dib.

218
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,354
We remember well...

219
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,158
how the Guild brought those
who oppressed us...

220
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,200
how they blackmailed us for spice...

221
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,462
to keep our secrets from our enemies.

222
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,595
Think I'd forgotten, Stil?

223
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,305
This... decision troubles me, Muad'dib.

224
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,212
There's something...

225
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,147
reckless about it.

226
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,515
Not reckless.

227
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,247
Necessary.

228
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,987
You'll know my reasons soon enough.

229
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,961
No. I trust you'll convince the naibs...

230
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,260
of the wisdom in this.

231
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,513
<i>A Guild ambassador,</i>
<i>here on Arrakis.</i>

232
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:28,015
<i>Muad'dib's decision strikes some</i>
<i>as mysterious, even dangerous.</i>

233
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,055
<i>But Muad'dib never does anything</i>
<i>without reason.</i>

234
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,624
I should spill your water on the sand
for what you've done.

235
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,665
I know it was you, Irulan.

236
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,060
You're the only one
who could have hidden the poison.

237
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,230
Don't lie!

238
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,036
You will insult him if you lie.

239
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,035
It is my right to bear the royal heir.

240
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,706
It is your duty to play a role.
Nothing more.

241
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,182
- I am his wife!
- You have his name.

242
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,048
I am the one he calls "wife."

243
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,120
Do you think you are the only woman
who truly loves him?

244
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,324
But I am the only woman he loves.

245
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,900
I could cuckold him.

246
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,002
Dare him to expose me.

247
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,480
Cuckold him all you like...

248
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,021
as long as you're discreet.

249
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,148
He won't deny you.

250
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,753
But no child, Irulan. Ever.

251
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,609
So, what do you think, Tyekanik?

252
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,783
Does my little prince have what it takes
to lead a Sardukar army one day?

253
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,452
There are many ways
to lead an army, Princess.

254
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,392
Being a warrior is only one of them.

255
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,162
And not necessarily the best.

256
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,069
Prince Farad'n. Your turn.

257
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,638
Muad'dib's decision to accept
a Guild ambassador...

258
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,736
is causing much unrest on Arrakis.

259
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,542
Good.

260
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,979
Once the face dancer is insinuated
into Muad'dib's palace...

261
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,949
we shall light the fuse...

262
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,322
and the Idaho ghola will do its work.

263
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,055
Mom? Mommy?

264
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,191
- What is this?
- I'm sorry, Princess.

265
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,395
The future emperor, crying?

266
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,462
I don't want to be an emperor.
Let someone else do it.

267
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,871
Nonsense.

268
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,267
Wipe your tears. Here.
Getting all over me now.

269
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,439
All right. Now, go back to your men.

270
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,676
Go back. Go.

271
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,448
Do you want the men to see you crying?
Do you want them to think you're weak?

272
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,148
I don't care.

273
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,728
Well, I do.

274
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,195
So now you will go back...

275
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,463
and this time...

276
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,003
you will do it properly.

277
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,800
Won't you?

278
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,083
Commander Farok,
hero of the Naraj campaign.

279
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:25,523
I bring you greetings from
your new friends on Salusa Secundus.

280
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,185
Hurry. The eyes of Muad'dib
are everywhere.

281
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:42,398
These are seats once occupied
in sietch by Muad'dib...

282
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,910
during the days when he taught us
the weirding way.

283
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,413
It is some time since you've seen him.

284
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,882
I think he's forgotten
I ever existed.

285
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,855
He's blind. Your son.

286
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,329
At the Battle of Naraj.

287
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,196
I wonder if Muad'dib knows...

288
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,202
how many have been maimed
in his name.

289
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,372
I couldn't leave him to the desert.

290
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,069
Even I violated the old laws.

291
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,908
The laws of men have gone.

292
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,906
The laws of a god have replaced them.

293
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,449
We were a noble people once.

294
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,252
We had a proper sietch.

295
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,285
I owned a chrysknife.

296
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,659
My own share of spice.

297
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,164
I was a rider of worms.

298
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,700
And then Muad'dib came...

299
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,262
with his witch mother.

300
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,902
And he promised to fulfill
Liet's prophesy.

301
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,037
And we followed.

302
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,675
- You joined his jihad?
- Do you know why?

303
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:04,620
I heard there was a thing called a sea.

304
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:09,092
Men came back from Muad'dib's wars,
and they said they had seen it.

305
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,958
And did you find your sea?

306
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,233
It healed me of jihad.

307
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,861
Now I'm ready
to help rid the universe...

308
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,373
of the cancer that is Muad'dib!

309
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,499
And that is Othyem's daughter?

310
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,505
Lichna.

311
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,876
If you bring her to Muad'dib...

312
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,814
he will never refuse to see her.

313
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,576
I was hoping that's what you'd say.

314
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,536
Lichna. I will enjoy
being called Lichna.

315
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,479
What is the meaning of this?

316
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,284
Helen Gaius Mohiam
of the Bene Gesserit...

317
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,825
you have violated
Muad'dib's eternal order...

318
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,758
never to set foot
on Arrakis again.

319
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,059
I am not on Arrakis.
I am in free space.

320
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:24,124
There is no such thing as free space
where Muad'dib rules.

321
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,950
I abase myself before the emperor.

322
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,920
We welcome you to our court,
Edric of the Spacing Guild...

323
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,787
and to a new understanding
between us.

324
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,192
Please allow me the honor
of presenting His Majesty...

325
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,493
with a small token of our esteem.

326
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:45,311
According to our investigators,
this one was killed here on Arrakis...

327
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:49,012
the body recovered
after the unfortunate conflict...

328
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,147
between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.

329
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:59,186
Terrible wounds required many months
of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.

330
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,496
We acquired him as a gift
befitting an emperor.

331
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,343
What is your name, ghola?

332
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,507
They say it was Duncan Idaho.

333
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,642
Idaho is dead!

334
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,153
This thing...

335
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,122
is a horror!

336
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,351
Send him away!

337
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,360
And do you enjoy the name?

338
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,727
It stirs up curious feelings.

339
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,527
You don't know who you are?

340
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,134
I know nothing of my past, sire.

341
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,535
How is this one trained?

342
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,668
It amused the Tleilaxu
to train him as a mentat.

343
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,407
I beg you, my lord!
Let me take its water.

344
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,485
Find quarters in the keep
for the ghola, Stil.

345
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,548
We accept this gift in the spirit
with which it was given.

346
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,153
Majesty, there is the matter
of Reverend Mother Mohiam.

347
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,063
She was removed from our highliner
by your agents...

348
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,259
in violation of our neutrality.

349
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,599
Be careful, Ambassador.

350
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,036
To be neutral is to be indifferent.

351
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:19,475
You would do well to disassociate
yourself from those who are not.

352
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:25,508
As you will learn, Edric,
my sister has the pulse of the court.

353
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,642
Be advised.

354
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,167
Reverend Mother.

355
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,995
I shudder to see you
in such circumstances.

356
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,234
I've been in worse.

357
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,743
Did the cards answer all your questions?

358
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,345
Answers only breed more questions.

359
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,319
What is important is how
one navigates between the two.

360
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,656
So, you haven't forgotten
everything we taught you.

361
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,991
Has the emperor explained
why I'm to be detained?

362
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,637
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.

363
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,765
But I hope it won't be too long.

364
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,436
We understand.

365
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,649
The sisterhood is aware of my delay?

366
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:35,652
They have changed your schedule
in light of the situation.

367
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,019
I'll be patient then.

368
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,019
You seem to be adapting to life here
quite well.

369
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,991
I have made my peace with it.

370
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,833
I hope your training has been a help.

371
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,998
A comfort.

372
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,874
One day, even Muad'dib
will know the good you've done.

373
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,136
For us all.

374
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,380
Do you know how dangerous that was?

375
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,252
Eleven blades, Paul!

376
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,915
Eleven!

377
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,027
The finest swordsmen in the imperium
have not gone up against more than nine.

378
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,058
Experienced swordsmen would never
have been so reckless.

379
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,196
This is why you invaded my privacy?

380
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,139
To disapprove of my recklessness?

381
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,473
- A body was found in the desert.
- A young woman.

382
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,243
- A Fremen.
- Fremen?

383
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,377
Decapitated and her hands removed.

384
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,819
So someone was afraid she'd be found
before the desert does its work.

385
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,520
I want you to examine the scene
the way our mother taught us.

386
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,465
You will take the ghola mentat with you.

387
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,494
I assume you can handle him.

388
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,706
I should arrange a thopter.

389
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,972
Poisoned!

390
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,104
- How can you tell?
- The molting of the skin.

391
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,445
Clearly the effect of rapid
neurological atrophy.

392
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,677
A Tleilaxu specialty.

393
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,588
Tleilaxu? Face dancers.

394
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,387
This is a dead Fremen girl, my lady.

395
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,089
What if there are no women
reported missing amongst the Fremen?

396
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,598
Othyem's daughter, my lord.

397
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,765
- Lichna.
- It's been years since I've seen you.

398
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,467
And my father.

399
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,572
I must beg Muad'dib's forgiveness
for this intrusion, but...

400
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,619
I am the smoke who banishes sleep
in the night.

401
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,948
Sit.

402
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,460
Deliver your warning then.

403
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,699
You must visit my father...

404
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,832
as soon as possible, milord.

405
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,878
- There is a plot against you.
- There are many plots against me.

406
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,776
This is a Fremen plot.

407
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,680
My father has information for you.

408
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,718
But he's weak.

409
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,754
He's sick.

410
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,086
He needs you to visit
so he can tell you.

411
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,325
Why didn't he tell you
so you could tell me?

412
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:48,297
He feared I might be captured
before seeing you.

413
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,664
If I know nothing,
I can divulge nothing.

414
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,837
I leave for Othyem's tonight.

415
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,378
Othyem has missed... his old friend.

416
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,206
A face dancer.

417
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,842
- Good one too.
- Let me take its water.

418
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,045
No, Stil.

419
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,180
This must play out the way I've seen it.

420
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,436
Cursed be thy name, Atreides.

421
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,446
Your time has finally come.

422
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,215
The stoneburner is set and ready.

423
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,351
Let the others know
Muad'dib is in the streets.

424
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,327
Go.

425
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,965
So, you've come, then.

426
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,750
We meet again, Muad'dib.

427
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,296
Answering the call of the Fedaykin.

428
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,808
I carry your water burden, Othyem.

429
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,548
Command me.

430
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,041
I caught the spitting disease
in Tarahill.

431
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,137
- The tribe will take my water soon.
- Let me summon my doctors.

432
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,778
We've had doctors as good as any
Muad'dib could provide.

433
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,586
There's treachery, Muad'dib.

434
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,084
I'm ashamed to say it.

435
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,494
The Fremen plot against you.

436
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,096
They want time to stop.

437
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,332
They want things
the way they used to be.

438
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:18,307
Bijaz has told me their names.
He was a gift to me...

439
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,138
after our victories on Tarahill.

440
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,008
I am a person, not a gift.

441
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,707
Cheap to feed but costly to fill.

442
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,182
Empty me as you will, sire.

443
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,311
He always prattles on like that.
He's a good spy.

444
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,185
You should take him tonight.

445
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,158
Our enemies will think I'm selling him
to you because I need the money.

446
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,354
To be gone is to be bygone.

447
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,397
Let bygones be bygones.

448
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,627
And Bijaz and Muad'dib
must be gone by now.

449
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,871
He's right, Muad'dib.
It's not safe for you to be here.

450
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,405
These are troubled times, old friend.

451
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,577
It was better
when we were alone in the desert...

452
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,741
with only the Harkonnen
as our enemies.

453
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,094
There's a thin line
between enemy and friend.

454
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,358
Where that line stops,
there's no beginning...

455
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,365
and no end.

456
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,774
Bygones be bygones,
let them fall where they may.

457
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,003
This has been a dirty day.

458
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,343
The wind speaks of demons.

459
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,815
That is not the wind.

460
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,428
Stoneburner.

461
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,669
Don't look at it, my lord!
You can't look at it!

462
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,969
My eyes!

463
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,907
It's worse in the Old Quarter.
Stoneburner for sure.

464
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,916
- What about Muad'dib?
- We are just entering the area now.

465
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,562
My eyes!

466
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,073
Milord! Is that you?

467
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,310
Here! I'm over here!

468
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,578
Take this one
and get him to the keep immediately.

469
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,122
Your eyes--

470
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,556
Do it, Fedaykin.
Do it now!

471
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,618
This way.

472
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,794
My lord.

473
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,957
Your eyes.

474
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,729
My eyes are gone, Stil.

475
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,973
My gods! Muad'dib.

476
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,670
Calm, Stil.

477
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,305
They blinded my body...

478
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,248
but not my vision.

479
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,955
There are men who need
your help, Fedaykin! Here and here!

480
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,158
The law, Muad'dib.

481
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,457
We live by Atreides law now, Stil.

482
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,064
None of these men
are to be taken out into the desert.

483
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,167
Anyone who wants is to be fitted
with Tleilaxu eyes.

484
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,347
Not eyes, yet he sees.

485
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,253
He has sight without eyes.

486
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,750
You knew this would happen.

487
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,856
It had to be.

488
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,825
Why?

489
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,555
Why?

490
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,368
For our son.

491
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,364
How long have you known?

492
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,667
I have always known.

493
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,247
It was just a matter of when.

494
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,049
Forgive me, Chani.

495
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,549
There was no way I could spare us this.

496
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,786
I waited as long as I could.

497
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,923
We will return to our desert, my love.

498
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,996
To the sietch where our son
will be born.

499
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,369
I'm afraid, Muad'dib.

500
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,808
I suddenly feel like
we have so little time.

501
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,514
We have eternity.

502
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,419
You have eternity.

503
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,529
I have only now.

504
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,510
So you are Bijaz.

505
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,881
Would I were Bijou and not Bijaz.

506
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,387
A jewel is prettier than a horse's ass.

507
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,281
You're a mockery then.

508
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,952
A trick of nature
meant to confuse and annoy.

509
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,662
Annoy, yes.

510
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,896
Confuse, no. Is wind a trick?

511
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,904
Then you are the wind.

512
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,065
No, I am words in the wind.

513
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,506
Words that are names.

514
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,340
Names that are death.

515
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,208
He knows.

516
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,751
- What does he mean?
- What I mean is what I say.

517
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,790
And what I say is what I mean.

518
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,625
Time for accounting,
unless you come just to mocker me.

519
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,289
My brother says you know
the names of the traitors.

520
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,769
Poor Muad'dib. Poor Bijaz.

521
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:11,240
<i>Betrayed and betrayer</i>
<i>together at last</i>

522
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,705
You will give me the names
of those who would betray us.

523
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,408
Very well, then.
Let's start with your priests.

524
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,417
He has another agenda.

525
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,680
How do you know?

526
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,415
I sense it.

527
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,925
Senses are dangerous.
They can be fooled.

528
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,484
Only a machine
functions without senses.

529
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,325
Are you a machine, ghola?

530
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm a mentat.
I trust only logic and statistics.

531
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,235
Not mysticism and prophesy.

532
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,975
My brother had a mentat teacher
who talked like that.

533
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,704
Hawat.

534
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,179
You remember.

535
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,052
- You did that on purpose.
- You remember.

536
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,652
I feel.

537
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,054
There is a difference.

538
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,654
Is there?

539
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:13,193
It frightens you, doesn't it?
The memory.

540
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,934
You're afraid you'll remember
who you were.

541
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,700
No ghola has ever been restored
to his former being, child.

542
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,541
I'm no child.

543
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,276
I awakened to consciousness
in my mother's womb.

544
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,047
I have memories of many women
alive inside of me.

545
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,852
I know what they knew.
I feel what they felt.

546
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,452
But I can handle it. Can you?

547
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,263
Palace Fedaykin are everywhere.

548
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,775
By the time Alia is through,
a common pickpocket won't be safe.

549
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,836
The fools even had a stoneburner
and they couldn't succeed.

550
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,405
Our spies have no idea
who was responsible.

551
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,748
It could have been Fremen rebels
from the deep desert.

552
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:07,085
It could have been an element within
the Quizrate itself. We may never know.

553
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,253
- What about Scytale?
- He maintains his masquerade.

554
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:17,164
- And the dwarf?
- Confined to the keep. Who knows where.

555
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,135
Then our plan is still in place.

556
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,166
He's alive.

557
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,395
Gurney, tell me he's alive.

558
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,700
He is alive.

559
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,402
But he's blind.

560
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,538
It was a stoneburner.
Stilgar suspects Fremen.

561
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,206
Alia? Chani?

562
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,944
All safe.

563
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,479
Blind. Blind.

564
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:16,856
There are rumors that Paul can still see
despite his blindness.

565
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,363
Vision-sight.
They say it's a miracle.

566
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,558
- Another brick for the myth of Muad'dib.
- My lady?

567
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,796
Arrange with the Guild ambassador
immediate transport to Arrakis.

568
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,667
I don't think that would be wise.

569
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,673
It was only a matter of time
before this happened.

570
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,675
It might not be long
before it happens again.

571
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,405
And you would not want to encourage it.

572
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,913
Ah, forgive me, my lady.

573
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,577
But those who would rid themselves of
Muad'dib would only be more provoked...

574
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,745
by the arrival of his mother.

575
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,255
If Paul needed you,
he would surely send for you.

576
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:07,841
We go forward. We come back.

577
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,106
We go forward. We come back.

578
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,343
<i>Don't be afraid, Father.</i>
<i>The answer's right in front of you.</i>

579
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,216
- The Golden Path.
- <i>But you must decide.</i>

580
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,754
<i>It's the only way.</i>

581
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,863
What troubles you, my lord?

582
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,560
The future.

583
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,097
You're drunk on too much time.

584
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,505
I'm drunk on too much me.

585
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,106
Do you know how many people have died
since I became emperor?

586
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,951
Even your empire must live its time...
and then die.

587
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,954
That's why you're here, isn't it?

588
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:57,215
Is that what you've seen?
In your visions?

589
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,388
It's obvious to anyone who can see.

590
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,165
It's what the Tleilaxu
have written upon you--

591
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,395
to kill me.

592
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,034
What is it, Stil?

593
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,238
I have just received word
from Salusa Sucundus.

594
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,039
Shaddam is dead.

595
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,690
It was very generous of Muad'dib
to permit his wife...

596
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:40,759
to attend the funeral
of his mortal enemy.

597
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:45,365
How grateful you must be for the safety
my sacrifice assured our father...

598
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,071
and you.

599
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,149
Not one major house represented!
Not one!

600
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:59,382
Muad'dib would not allow
any formal delegations, milady.

601
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:04,120
As far as he was concerned, your father
died the day he was defeated on Arrakis.

602
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:08,153
My father was the 81st
Padishaw emperor. A colossus!

603
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,632
Who is this bastard Atreides
but some Bedouin charlatan?

604
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,762
Do not underestimate the power
of Muad'dib's prescience, milady.

605
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,071
Your father did,
to his great misfortune.

606
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,010
My father was betrayed by you...

607
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,639
and your simpering Spacing Guild.

608
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,820
And those witches of the Bene Gesserit.
And for what? For spice.

609
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,948
You abandoned your emperor for spice.

610
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,118
We cannot guide our ships
without it, milady.

611
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:42,426
And that is why you will help me
kidnap a worm and bring it here.

612
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,561
I mean no disrespect, Princess...

613
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,969
but take a worm from Arrakis?

614
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,839
Even if the Idaho ghola succeeds, there
is still the sister to contend with.

615
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:58,108
We must be prepared with other means
to diminish the Atreides' power.

616
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,480
You want to bring a worm here?

617
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:06,454
Salusa Sucundus might prove hospitable
to the great worms of Arrakis.

618
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:10,459
If they thrived,
a new spice cycle could begin.

619
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,427
And?

620
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:16,659
Atreides monopoly would be broken.

621
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,633
Plans within plans.

622
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,499
If Muad'dib ever suspected
such a gambit...

623
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:26,338
he would smash this planet
and the Corrino name into oblivion.

624
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,969
We're already in oblivion.

625
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,846
Kidnap a worm from Arrakis.

626
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,082
The spice must flow.

627
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,189
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

628
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,869
The doctors say her metabolism
has accelerated.

629
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,971
The pregnancy is proceeding
faster than normal.

630
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:55,211
It will be a dangerous birth.

631
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,552
Beloved. I'm sorry.

632
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,679
I've distracted you.

633
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,660
If only you could
distract me forever.

634
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,903
My body's confusing me, Muad'dib.

635
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:55,034
My life burns faster.

636
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:58,672
I'm so hungry, always hungry.

637
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,952
Make arrangements, Stil. We leave
for the sietch as soon as possible.

638
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,423
The baby will be born there.
Inform my sister.

639
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:45,123
- How long have you been there?
- Long enough.

640
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,633
Are you sick, my lady?

641
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,002
You don't know what it's like
to hunt the future.

642
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:06,175
You've taken spice. Too much.

643
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:11,744
My brother needs me, Duncan,
and my vision is incomplete.

644
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:16,349
I need to remember.
I need to remember the future.

645
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:20,657
- I'm going to summon doctors.
- No. No.

646
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,633
Don't leave me.
I just need to--

647
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,498
just to--

648
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,205
I can't move.

649
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,914
What are you doing to me?

650
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,150
I am playing.
You were made to be played.

651
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,386
Like Othyem. Poor fellow.

652
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,826
Had a terrific struggle with you.

653
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,558
The flesh did not want
to come back.

654
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:02,329
- You are Tleilaxu.
- Born and bred... in the same tank.

655
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,067
Just we two... in the same tank.

656
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,633
First me, then you-- then you.

657
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,737
You're trying
to bring out the violence in me.

658
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,882
Oh, no. Not yet.

659
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:21,117
The script is written,
but the stage is not set.

660
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,160
But one day soon,
the emperor will come to you...

661
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:32,463
a mask of grief
obscuring his face.

662
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:42,309
And he'll say, "She's gone.
She is gone."

663
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,439
And then you will finally
know what you're expected to do.

664
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:53,352
- <i>She is gone.</i>
- <i>She is gone, Duncan.</i>

665
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:58,325
Now it's time to forget what
you remember when day becomes night.

666
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,524
<i>Forgetting is not having</i>
<i>till the words are right</i>

667
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,920
What do you see with those eyes?

668
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,155
What everyone sees.

669
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:05,156
We're leaving for the sietch
this morning.

670
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,358
- And I'll be left behind.
- Appropriate, I'd say...

671
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,959
considering what you've done.

672
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,932
I never meant to hurt Chani
or you.

673
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,567
I just--

674
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,718
I've given orders
no harm is to come to you...

675
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:38,492
no matter what happens.

676
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,859
- Is she--
- She's well...

677
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,995
for the moment.

678
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,466
I've been cruel to you, Irulan.

679
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,374
- I don't want your pity.
- I'm offering none.

680
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,778
Simply telling you the truth.

681
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,547
You were destined, conditioned.

682
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,078
I understand only too well.

683
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,682
Destined to be used.

684
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:16,724
- By you?
- By your father. By the Bene Gesserit.

685
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,599
By the Spacing Guild.
To protect them from me.

686
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:29,610
And they'll get their wish,
though not exactly as they'd like it.

687
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,411
I don't understand.

688
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:40,148
The time of plots and revenge
is coming to an end.

689
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,183
You must have a chance
to find peace.

690
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,787
I'm gonna give you that chance.

691
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,298
It's ironic.

692
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:55,098
Your selfish, clumsy attempts
to mother an imperial heir...

693
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,230
actually prolonged Chani's life.

694
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:03,172
And for that, I'm grateful.
Forever.

695
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:35,738
Muad'dib, is it truly necessary
to bring the face dancer and the dwarf--

696
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:40,271
They have their parts to play, Stil,
just like you and me.

697
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:50,113
- Chani and I will take this one.
- Muad'dib--

698
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:53,184
I know the way better
than anyone else, Stil...

699
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,059
except, perhaps, you.

700
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,100
You must remain here,
as we agreed.

701
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,000
Time to settle accounts.

702
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:48,340
- Stay where you are.
- What's the meaning of this?

703
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:01,127
You plotted
against Muad'dib, Korba.

704
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,860
You conspired against your emperor.
You're under arrest for treason.

705
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,670
I am a Fremen. I demand
to be judged by Fremen law.

706
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:17,769
You will be, Korba. You will be.

707
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,802
I used to hunt these here
when I was little.

708
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,472
It's amazing, the simple pleasures
one has as a child.

709
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:57,680
But the desert is leaving now,
taking simple pleasure with it.

710
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:04,853
I wonder if my father would approve
of the future he inspired.

711
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,921
A storm comes, my lady.

712
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,626
I am a desert creature, ghola.

713
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,225
I know when to hide.

714
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,142
Paul said he would join you as soon
as the naib council is concluded.

715
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:31,953
You called him Paul,
his Atreides name.

716
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:38,518
I did. A memory intruded
where none should have been.

717
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:43,327
Then there are more.
And it frightens you.

718
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,459
Duncan's memories.
They scare you.

719
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:53,000
Are they Duncan's memories
or the inventions of those who made me?

720
01:11:55,044 --> 01:12:00,346
When the moment comes to decide,
you will know.

721
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,516
My lady.

722
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:08,753
It was the birth, my lord. They said
her body was drained by the speed of it.

723
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:22,110
These are your children, Muad'dib.
Both are alive and strong.

724
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,704
- "Children"?
- Twins, my lord.

725
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:28,545
A boy and a girl.

726
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,507
I never saw children.

727
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,148
Beloved.

728
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,922
Forgive me.

729
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:52,597
There are some things
no one can bear...

730
01:17:55,103 --> 01:18:00,735
problems in this universe
for which there are no answers...

731
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,045
for which nothing can be done,
nothing.

732
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,750
I am sorry.

733
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,286
Nothing in this universe...

734
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,429
is as great...

735
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,061
as my love for you.

736
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,122
I can't see.

737
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,397
My lord? My lord!

738
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,136
She's gone.

739
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:15,645
She is gone, Duncan.
She is gone, Duncan.

740
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,088
<i>Then you will finally know</i>
<i>what you are expected to do.</i>

741
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,165
<i>You're expected to do.</i>

742
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:49,206
This was the moment
you came back to me, Duncan.

743
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,493
Stay where you are, both of you.

744
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:04,225
I warn you. A face dancer can move
faster than you can possibly imagine.

745
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,233
So, it is truly you.

746
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,071
Duncan Idaho of the Atreides.

747
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,169
A ghola can regain his past.

748
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,379
Tell me.
What do you remember?

749
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:29,482
- Tell him.
- Everything. My childhood.

750
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,755
My youth. My death.

751
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:39,495
We did it. We did it. Majesty,
don't you see what this means?

752
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,901
You can have her back again,
your beloved Chani.

753
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,201
The proof is standing right
in front of you.

754
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:49,471
We can restore the flesh
and the spirit. We can recreate her.

755
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,739
This was your plan all along.

756
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,873
Plots within plots, my lord.
You should know this better than anyone.

757
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:58,181
We've been trying for decades
to achieve this.

758
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:02,713
Make an alliance with us,
Muad'dib, the Tleilaxu.

759
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:06,488
Let us restore your beloved Chani.

760
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,859
<i>Live content and safe</i>
<i>for the rest of your life...</i>

761
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,467
with her, with your children.

762
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,267
<i>With her, with your children.</i>

763
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,134
My lord, please don't
listen to this blasphemy.

764
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,305
Don't move, Duncan Idaho.

765
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:29,248
You kill me, and you're
killing Muad'dib's children.

766
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:34,982
You can feel it, can't you, Muad'dib?

767
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:41,719
Can't you?
You can hear her.

768
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:46,290
- <i>I'm afraid, Muad'dib.</i>
- Calling your name.

769
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:59,803
<i>Father. Don't be afraid, Father.</i>

770
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,213
I'm here, Father,
as you knew I would be.

771
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,481
We go forward. We go back.
Don't be afraid.

772
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:09,887
We're pre-born, my sister and I,
thanks to our mother and the spice.

773
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:13,860
Thanks to you.
Father, yes, it is me.

774
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,031
We go forward. We go back.

775
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,468
<i>We are pre-born, my sister and I,</i>
<i>thanks to you.</i>

776
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:26,667
<i>My eyes. Let me see for you.</i>

777
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,767
I can do it.
I can bring her back to you.

778
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,779
Use my eyes, Father.
Use my eyes.

779
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,281
My eyes. Let me see for you.
Let me see for you.

780
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,716
- <i>Use them.</i>
- I can do it.

781
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:42,348
I can bring her back.
Let us give you back your love.

782
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:08,476
- The children! The children!
- They are safe, Muad'dib.

783
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:22,056
I meddled in the future,
in all possible futures...

784
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,592
trying to create them.

785
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:33,498
Instead, they created me,
and I became trapped by it.

786
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:37,705
Yes, but knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

787
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,748
The first step
along the Golden Path.

788
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:46,113
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer is right in front of you.

789
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,530
Finally, I am free.

790
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,350
<i>History is written</i>
<i>on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

791
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:27,922
<i>Those who wished an end</i>
<i>to House Atreides have failed.</i>

792
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:33,659
<i>No longer an emperor,</i>
<i>no longer a god...</i>

793
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:38,900
<i>a simple blind Fremen wanders alone</i>
<i>into the desert to die.</i>

794
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:44,143
They say he has gone on a journey...

795
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:49,248
into the land where men walk
without footprints.

796
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,845
He will not be found...

797
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:56,556
yet all men will find him.

798
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,585
I wonder if that's what he wanted.

799
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:13,204
I need you, Duncan,
more than ever.

800
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,606
Stay with me.

801
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:08,986
<i>Muad'dib is gone,</i>
<i>but his children remain...</i>

802
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:12,157
<i>and conspiracies continue to breed.</i>

803
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:18,030
<i>The saga of Dune is far from over.</i>

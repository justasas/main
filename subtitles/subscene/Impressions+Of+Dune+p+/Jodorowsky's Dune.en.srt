1
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,951
<i>What is the goal of the life?</i>

2
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:02,165
<i>It's to create yourself a soul.</i>

3
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,712
<i>For me, movies are an art...</i>

4
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>...more than an industry.</i>

5
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:16,095
<i>And it's the search of the human soul...</i>

6
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,140
<i>...as painting, as literature, as poetry.</i>

7
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,937
<i>Movies are that for me.</i>

8
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>I wanted to make a film...</i>

9
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>...that would give the people
who took LSD at that time...</i>

10
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:04,352
<i>...the hallucinations that you get with
that drug, but without hallucinating.</i>

11
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,816
<i>I did not want LSD to be taken,
I wanted to fabricate the drug's effects.</i>

12
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>This film was going to change
the public's perceptions.</i>

13
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>My ambition with</i> Dune <i>was tremendous.</i>

14
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,715
<i>So, what I wanted
was to create a prophet.</i>

15
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:38,386
I want to create a prophet...

16
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:43,433
...to change the young minds
of all the world.

17
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:48,980
For me, <i>Dune</i> will be
the coming of a god.

18
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:54,235
<i>Artistical, cinematographical god.</i>

19
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,072
<i>For me, it was not to make a picture.</i>

20
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,825
<i>It was something deeper.</i>

21
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,495
I wanted to make something sacred...

22
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:10,418
...free, with new perspective.

23
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,712
Open the mind!

24
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,676
Because I feel, in that time,
myself, inside a prison.

25
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,889
My ego, my intellect,
I want to open!

26
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,352
And I start the fight to make <i>Dune.</i>

27
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>You needed a touch of madness to do it.</i>

28
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,044
<i>You can't have a masterpiece
without madness.</i>

29
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,087
<i>Pink Floyd? Dalí...</i>

30
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,006
<i>...or Orson Welles or others!</i>

31
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,343
Maybe <i>Dune</i> had too much madness?

32
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,305
But a movie that doesn't have
a bit of madness...

33
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,474
...is not going to conquer the whole world.

34
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,727
I was in Paris with my wife
at Jodorowsky's house...

35
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:10,978
...and having dinner...

36
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,107
...and very late into the evening...

37
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,820
...he goes if I wanted to see <i>Dune.</i>

38
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,780
And I was like:

39
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,115
"I didn't know you made it."

40
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,826
And he goes, well, he did.

41
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,370
And he pulls out, you know,
the famous <i>Dune</i> book...

42
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:31,833
...that apparently only exists--
Two copies left in the universe.

43
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,585
<i>And I then sat with him
in front of me...</i>

44
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,129
...for a <i>very long time
and just went through the book...</i>

45
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,716
<i>...and he would explain
his thoughts and his ideas.</i>

46
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,718
<i>And, you know,
when I heard about the team...</i>

47
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,638
<i>...that he had assembled
to make this movie...</i>

48
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,599
<i>...sitting there at night,
2 a.m. at his house...</i>

49
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,727
...seeing the book,
looking at the images...

50
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,439
...and hearing Jodorowsky telling me...

51
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,859
...what was gonna happen
in every scene.

52
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,652
<i>So, in a way...</i>

53
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,030
<i>...I'm the only guy who actually
ever saw Jodorowsky's</i> Dune.

54
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,075
I am the only spectator...

55
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,910
...that has seen the movie.

56
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,037
And I'm gonna tell you something.

57
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,665
It's awesome.

58
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,959
Dune <i>is probably
the greatest movie never made.</i>

59
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,794
It continues to influence us...

60
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,963
...and will go on influencing
generations to come...

61
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:24,218
...despite the fact that it doesn't exist,
we cannot rent it, we cannot watch it.

62
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,762
What if the first film of that nature...

63
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,890
...had been <i>Dune</i> and not <i>Star Wars</i>?

64
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,017
Would the whole...

65
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:35,104
...mega-bucks blockbuster structure...

66
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,606
...have been altered?

67
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:40,234
I think there's this cliche phrase
about movies being ahead of their time.

68
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,822
I think Jodorowsky's <i>Dune</i> might've been
the most ahead-of-its-time movie ever.

69
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,825
I don't think that in the history of cinema...

70
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:52,204
...there was ever a film that was taken
that far, only to end up not being made.

71
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,206
To become a different film,
since a film was made...

72
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,376
...that had nothing to do with those
two and a half years of work.

73
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,629
If Alejandro's <i>Dune</i>
could've been made...

74
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,258
...it would've been bigger than <i>2001</i>.

75
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,010
It was built up...

76
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:09,597
...to be the greatest achievement
in science fiction...

77
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,933
...and it just evaporated...

78
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,229
...into a billion small,
black pieces of space.

79
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,234
<i>In the beginning, I was making theater.</i>

80
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,533
<i>In Mexico, I make 100 theater plays.</i>

81
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,623
<i>In 10 years,
I make the avant garde theater.</i>

82
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,459
Ionesco, Beckett, Strindberg.

83
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,669
Adaptation--

84
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,421
Modern adaptations of Shakespeare,
I do.

85
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,632
One day I will make a picture.

86
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,324
<i>From the beginning
of his film career...</i>

87
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,994
...what he was doing
was driving people crazy.

88
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,997
<i>His first film,</i> Fando y Lis...

89
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,416
<i>...it premiered in Acapulco
at a film festival...</i>

90
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,544
<i>...and there was an actual full-scale riot.
People went crazy.</i>

91
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,838
<i>It was so nuts
that Mexico banned the film.</i>

92
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,343
<i>When I came to pictures...</i>

93
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,013
...I <i>came like</i> a <i>virgin.</i>

94
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:37,059
<i>Without to know technical movement.</i>

95
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,812
<i>I didn't know lens, the number.
I didn't know.</i>

96
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:49,697
<i>We shoot</i> Fando y Lis<i>, hiding of unions.</i>

97
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,077
<i>In Mexico,
a young director cannot make picture...</i>

98
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,664
<i>...without the permission
of the old director unions.</i>

99
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:03,002
I say, "What I need to take
the permission to make art?"

100
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,881
Artists need to be free! I do my picture!

101
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,759
<i>Then was a great scandal later, eh?</i>

102
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,387
Because I broke all the unions, I did it!

103
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,230
I was opening the mind of the industry.

104
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,942
<i>Be prepared to live the most
wonderful experience of your life.</i>

105
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,287
El Topo <i>is miraculous...</i>

106
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,832
<i>...and terrible.</i>

107
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,793
<i>It's violent.</i>

108
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,093
El Topo <i>is more than spectacle.</i>

109
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,428
<i>It is an experience for all of your life.</i>

110
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,609
<i>El Topo</i> really was the original
midnight movie, the original cult film...

111
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:12,738
...the first movie that played exclusively
at midnight screenings...

112
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,158
...and drew a loyal cult audience.

113
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,577
<i>What I find extraordinary about</i> El Topo...

114
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,206
<i>...is it's his first major movie,
and Jodorowsky's producing...</i>

115
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,625
<i>...writing and directing
and playing the</i> lead...

116
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,504
...and he gives himself
that immortal line, "I am God."

117
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>I was exposed to it
in the underground cinema in New York.</i>

118
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,640
<i>And after that, we had the courage
to attempt to distribute it in France...</i>

119
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:45,396
<i>...and it was an incredible success for
this movie that was quite revolutionary...</i>

120
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,817
...and a natural friendship was born
between Alejandro and me.

121
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,777
Thanks to the success of <i>El Topo...</i>

122
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,447
...I got one million dollars
to make <i>The Holy Mountain.</i>

123
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,122
<i>I did whatever I wanted.</i>

124
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,999
<i>I didn't have a producer...</i>

125
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,004
<i>...no critic, no one to mess with me.</i>

126
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,883
<i>I did what I wanted
and it was The How Mountain.</i>

127
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,526
<i>Holy Mountain</i> really is
an extraordinary film.

128
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,530
It feels like a work of art
that's come from a parallel world.

129
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,575
<i>A totally different version
of the film industry...</i>

130
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,369
<i>...where there really are no limits.</i>

131
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:48,250
<i>I gave the movie to Michel Seydoux
in France.</i>

132
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,504
And, oh, surprise, in Europe it attracted
a great number of people...

133
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,341
<i>...it was playing openly.</i>

134
00:11:56,091 --> 00:12:01,096
<i>In Italy that year, it was the
number two movie behind James Bond.</i>

135
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,100
The Holy Mountain <i>was incredible.</i>

136
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:15,444
<i>So my ambition grew.</i>

137
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,849
<i>Michel Seydoux called me from Paris
and say to me:</i>

138
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,229
<i>"</i>Holy Mountain <i>is a success.
I want to make a new picture with you.</i>

139
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,356
<i>Do whatever you want!"</i>

140
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,698
I have never made movies
or transactions...

141
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,783
...unless there was something
more to them.

142
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,287
A relationship between human beings
is what makes the difference.

143
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,458
<i>He said,
"I want to produce you anything.</i>

144
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,419
<i>What do you want to do?"</i>

145
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:15,629
I say, "<i>Dune</i>!"

146
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,172
And he say, "Yes."

147
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,928
<i>Why?</i>

148
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,473
<i>Because the book was the most beautiful
science-fiction book.</i>

149
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,935
<i>It was the bible of science fiction
for all the big devotees.</i>

150
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,771
Because the book had been
a worldwide publishing success...

151
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,274
<i>...that you could find in every country.</i>

152
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,988
I didn't read <i>Dune</i>. But I have
a friend who say me it was fantastic.

153
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,199
I don't know why I say <i>Dune.</i>
I can say <i>Don Quixote...</i>

154
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,245
...or I can said <i>Hamlet</i>.
I don't know anything.

155
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,830
I say <i>Dune.</i>

156
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,834
Dune <i>is this sprawling space epic...</i>

157
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,878
<i>...that focuses on the planet Arrakis.</i> ..

158
00:13:56,045 --> 00:14:00,716
<i>...a desert planet, where this spice,
melange, is found.</i>

159
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,718
<i>This consciousness-expanding drug...</i>

160
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,804
...which is one of the most important
commodities in the universe.

161
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,307
This makes Dune into a planet...

162
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:11,101
...of extraordinary strategic importance.

163
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,188
Almost, I guess, the galactic version
of Afghanistan.

164
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,317
<i>Paul Atreides is a young noble.
Paul gets cast out of his house...</i>

165
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:21,445
<i>...and leads a revolution
of the Fremen...</i>

166
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,656
<i>...the local natives on Arrakis,
to take over the planet...</i>

167
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:28,243
<i>...from the evil, colonial Harkonnens,
who are controlling</i> it...

168
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,081
<i>...and to sort of return power
of the spice to the people.</i>

169
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,375
So, of course,
the idea of imbibing a spice...

170
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,544
...that opens time and space to you:

171
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,339
That couldn't have been more right
for that moment.

172
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,467
And so that's why it's a--
it's a weird Hollywood film.

173
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,553
Like, it's a weird idea for Hollywood
to ever tangle with <i>Dune.</i>

174
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,555
Hollywood sold us the rights for nothing...

175
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,767
...mockingly on the inside, I believe...

176
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,021
...thinking that we would never
be able to carry out such a thing.

177
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,194
<i>It was a great undertaking
to do the script.</i>

178
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,784
<i>Michel Seydoux brought me to France.</i>

179
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,412
<i>He rented a castle, a huge castle...</i>

180
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,083
<i>...and I was in that castle
dedicated solely to</i> Dune.

181
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,213
<i>Frank Herbert created a world in</i> Dune...

182
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,925
...but he never said exactly what it was.

183
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:29,221
And you have a hundred pages
of literature...

184
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,474
...where you go on to discover,
with great difficulty...

185
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,393
...what the book is about.

186
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:41,316
It's very-- It's like-- I compare it
to Proust in French literature.

187
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,902
It's literary, it's great literature.

188
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,616
<i>The first 100 pages...</i>

189
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,119
...you understand almost nothing.

190
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,706
It's insinuations.

191
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:01,795
To bring literature to image
is completely difficult.

192
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:08,343
You need to create another world,
the optical world.

193
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,929
It's not the literary, auditive world.

194
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,269
<i>All the time, even in the...
In the little details...</i>

195
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:23,400
...I <i>was trying to find
the spiritual meaning of that picture.</i>

196
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,163
<i>Now I have my script.</i>

197
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,250
I need to find the warriors.

198
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,630
The warriors to do it.

199
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,760
Every person who will work in this picture
will be a spiritual warrior.

200
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,137
The best I will find.

201
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,182
He had the genius to make...

202
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,852
...a storyboard with Moebius.

203
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,028
I find a comic book.
The comic book was...

204
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,447
...Blueberry.

205
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,159
<i>Cowboy book, drawing by Giraud.</i>

206
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,539
I start to see, but that guy is my camera!

207
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>Who is this?</i>

208
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,961
<i>Giraud was the most fantastic
figure artist.</i>

209
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,380
He could draw anything.
Giraud was probably...

210
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,302
...France's most famous
and most talented art--

211
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,137
Bandes dessinées artist.

212
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,139
This is the person I need.

213
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,810
Where I will find this person? Where?

214
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,565
In that time was not Internet
to find any person.

215
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,692
I need to find this person.

216
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,824
I went to see my agent, publicity agent...

217
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,994
...and there he was. By chance.

218
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,870
He was there.

219
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,789
He say, "I am Moebius."

220
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>"When I drawing science fiction,
I am not Giraud, I am Moebius."</i>

221
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:10,090
And I say to him,
"You are the person! Come with me!"

222
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,680
<i>Drawing by drawing, I shoot the picture.</i>

223
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>I need 3000 drawings.</i>

224
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,274
<i>Point of view. Movement of the camera.</i>

225
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,486
<i>Dialogue.
The relation between the actors.</i>

226
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,407
<i>I use Moebius like a camera.</i>

227
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,330
<i>I take Moebius, I say,
"Now you advance." "Now you travel."</i>

228
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,667
<i>"Now you make a close-up."</i>

229
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,841
I have Moebius, who was a genius.
Moebius was a genius.

230
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:58,221
Because he was not only an artist
with an incredible capacity...

231
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,641
...but he was very quick.

232
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,357
Was superhuman. He was...

233
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,651
...quickly, rapido, incredible.

234
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,027
And then I could shoot.

235
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,864
Every day, we start to shoot...

236
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:21,453
At 8:00, we come, we prepare everything.
I think at 9:30 we start to shoot.

237
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>I made the picture with drawings.</i>

238
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,565
<i>And then in the costume, I say to him--
I describe what I wanted.</i>

239
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,694
<i>He immediately:</i>

240
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,031
<i>Quick, more than a computer.
He was incredible.</i>

241
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,189
Everything became magic
when we was doing this picture.

242
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,025
Everything, everything.

243
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:43,493
<i>Dune</i>, my <i>Dune</i>, start with a long shot.

244
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:49,791
I admire the long shot
of Orson Welles' <i>Touch of Evil.</i>

245
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,212
<i>The camera go, go, go,
traverse the street, go.</i>

246
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,759
<i>It's a fantastic big, long shot.</i>

247
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,013
<i>And then I wanted to start</i> Dune
<i>with a long shot...</i>

248
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,769
...better than the long shot
of Orson Welles.

249
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,979
I wanted to go farthest.

250
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:16,485
And then all the shot
is traversing the whole universe.

251
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:21,573
You go there and you traverse
all the galaxy, all the galaxy...

252
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,368
...and in traversal of the galaxy,
you see a pirate...

253
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:33,543
...robbing a convoy of spice, by example.
Battles. And you go, you go...

254
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,754
<i>ls a long shot.</i>

255
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,368
Having looked at some
of the storyboards...

256
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,871
...and being aware of what
he was trying to accomplish...

257
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,831
...I don't know how
he could've done it in '75.

258
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,791
<i>His vision was so huge...</i>

259
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,961
<i>...so beyond what anybody else
was doing at that time...</i>

260
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,048
...you look back at what George Lucas
struggled to accomplish...

261
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,008
...in '77 with <i>Star Wars...</i>

262
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,636
...and here's Jodorowsky
a couple years before that...

263
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:51,431
...going with things that Lucas wasn't
even gonna try in the prequel films.

264
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,600
I mean, it's just-- It's enormous.

265
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,729
We need to find the person
who will make the special effects.

266
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,690
<i>I say, "Moebius, we fly
to California, to Los Angeles...</i>

267
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,027
<i>...to the appointment
of Douglas Trumbull."</i>

268
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,076
<i>At that time, in the early '70s...</i>

269
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:15,121
...why, Doug Trumbull was probably
the premier visual-effects guy around...

270
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,919
...and everyone had known
his work on <i>2001.</i>

271
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:25,423
He was a very honored,
very important person.

272
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,927
<i>He receive me. He was interesting.</i>

273
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,136
<i>Was a business.</i>

274
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,266
My gosh. Hey.

275
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,025
Hey-

276
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,287
Yeah.

277
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,710
We went to see Trumbull...

278
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,297
...but he gives himself so big importance.

279
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,342
We was speaking, he answered...

280
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,637
...40 times the telephone.
Forty times.

281
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:19,728
He was speaking
with so big vanity of himself.

282
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:24,607
He was a big technician.
But for me, was not a spiritual person.

283
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,863
He have nothing to do in the creation
of a film who was a prophet.

284
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,158
He will make a technical film, no?

285
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:38,329
Trumbull, had a very specific way
he wanted to work...

286
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,166
...and <i>Kubrick had given him
pretty much carte blanche...</i>

287
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,793
...to <i>do what he wanted to do
within certain bounds...</i>

288
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,089
...so some filmmakers
who wanted to control more...

289
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:51,176
...what the visual style was...

290
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,678
...were a bit put off by that.

291
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:57,223
And then I say,
"I cannot work with you."

292
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,809
And we went out.

293
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:05,023
<i>Moebius was astonished, say,
"How you can say no to the biggest...</i>

294
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,984
...technician of Hollywood?"

295
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,154
I say, "it is like that."

296
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,157
<i>I cannot use him.
He is not my spiritual warrior.</i>

297
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,581
<i>And then we was walking in the street,
Hollywood...</i>

298
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:27,921
<i>...there was a little cinema, a little theater.
And there was a science-fiction picture...</i>

299
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,130
...Dark Star.

300
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,016
<i>And when I see the picture,
"That is the guy!"</i>

301
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:44,854
<i>O'Bannon.</i>

302
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,276
We will search for this person.
This person will be the person.

303
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,073
<i>Dan was from rural Missouri...</i>

304
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,743
...the Ozarks, and he didn't even have
a phone until he was, like, 10.

305
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,205
The first time he talked on the phone.

306
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:06,459
He read Mark Twain stories
and didn't realize they were old.

307
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,337
He thought they were, like,
contemporary stories.

308
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,549
So he's kind of a guy out of time,
in a very strange way.

309
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,468
But he was always attracted
to science fiction and whatnot.

310
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,514
For me, the art was before,
later the technique.

311
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,933
And that was O'Bannon.

312
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,185
<i>I thought I was pretty well prepared
for him.</i>

313
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:31,317
<i>I thought I had a very clear image of him
as this very erudite lunatic.</i>

314
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:35,738
<i>And I was steeling myself
for the interview.</i>

315
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,324
<i>In</i> El Topo<i>,
he had this long hair...</i>

316
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,703
<i>...down to his shoulders and a big beard
and he was a raving lunatic.</i>

317
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,081
<i>He acted in his own films.
And I was greeted at the door...</i>

318
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,418
...by <i>this charming,
continental gentleman.</i>

319
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,421
<i>Clean shaven, with styled hair.</i>

320
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,715
<i>He goes back and he gets
out of his suitcase...</i>

321
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,676
<i>...comes outwith this little piece
of folded-up newspaper, and says:</i>

322
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,137
<i>"This is special marijuana."</i>

323
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,014
<i>I said, "Oh, boy!"</i>

324
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,309
<i>All I remember is,
I was getting incredibly relaxed...</i>

325
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,312
<i>...and then I was looking
straight into his eyes...</i>

326
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,480
<i>...when all of a sudden...</i>

327
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,985
<i>...at the conclusion of a sentence,
he said, "Like this!"</i>

328
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,654
<i>And, Wham, out from his face...</i>

329
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:20,658
<i>...shot these radiating lines
of patterns...</i>

330
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,620
<i>...which proceeded to produce
around his head...</i>

331
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,916
...a <i>circular, shimmering mandala
or kaleidoscope-like pattern...</i>

332
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,835
<i>...with his face in the center
and his eyes fixed on mine...</i>

333
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,504
<i>...and the rest of the room
vanishing into oblivion.</i>

334
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:36,132
<i>And then his whole--
He relaxed all of his features.</i>

335
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,426
<i>The eyes,
which had been staring into mine...</i>

336
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,512
<i>...like something supernatural,
all of a sudden relaxed.</i>

337
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,391
<i>Lids came down and the face smiled
and it changed back.</i>

338
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,186
<i>The 20 years came back
onto his face.</i>

339
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,147
<i>And the hallucinogenic visual effect
and the mental effect...</i>

340
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,816
<i>...dispersed immediately. Just:</i>

341
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:58,196
<i>And I was completely dazzled.
I was dazed at the experience.</i>

342
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,282
<i>He said, "All right, I want you to do
the special effects."</i>

343
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,952
<i>And I said, "All right."
I said, "Well, hell, yes!"</i>

344
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,204
<i>He said, "Good."
I'll never forget his words.</i>

345
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,915
<i>He says, "Now sell everything you own
and come to Paris.</i>

346
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,875
<i>Prepare to have your life changed."</i>

347
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,254
And then he came to Paris.

348
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,051
And that was-- I have two warriors:
Moebius and O'Bannon.

349
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,053
I need to find the others.

350
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:27,016
<i>The first actor is the father,
the Duke Leto.</i>

351
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:45,702
<i>David Carradine had starred
in a very popular television series...</i>

352
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,912
...in <i>which</i> he was a warrior...

353
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,789
<i>...who was taught by masters
from the Orient.</i>

354
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,959
<i>It was influenced by</i> El Topo.

355
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:59,632
Then, when Carradine knew
that I wanted him, he came...

356
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,259
...he came running.

357
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,973
<i>I waited for him in Los Angeles,
in a hotel room.</i>

358
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,934
I had bought vitamin E.

359
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,647
Like, this E vitamin. Half a kilo.

360
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:22,113
In order to take one pill every day
to have the strength.

361
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,574
<i>Carradine came to my room,
the first thing he</i> saw...

362
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,077
<i>...was the pot of E vitamin.</i>

363
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,829
He say, "Oh, E vitamin!"

364
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,752
And he drink all my pills of vitamin E!

365
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:40,381
Like is a monstrosity! Sixty dollars was!

366
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,137
Well, was a big beginning.

367
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,514
And then I say,
"We need to work together!

368
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,808
You are the person I am searching!"

369
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,651
I wanted a musical group
for every planet.

370
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,573
<i>Pink Floyd.
They will make the music of Leto.</i>

371
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,246
<i>Pink Floyd have</i> a <i>record,</i>
Dark <i>Side of the</i> Moon.

372
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,791
<i>For me, that is the human being,
like the moon.</i>

373
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,251
<i>One side is brilliant, light.</i>

374
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,380
And the other side who is black,
the unconscious...

375
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,925
...what is mysterious, what is deep.

376
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,845
It happened during a meeting.

377
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,140
<i>"Pink Floyd?"
Gibon said, "Okay, I'll go!"</i>

378
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:35,728
<i>He called Pink Floyd's agent.
He said, "Could I meet with you?"</i>

379
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,689
<i>So one day we went to London.</i>

380
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,402
They were in the middle of finishing
the mixing...

381
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,905
...of Dark <i>Side</i> of the Moon,
at Abbey Road, the famous studio.

382
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:53,413
And I remember, we got there...

383
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,499
...and they were very standoffish...

384
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,543
...pop stars, very distant.

385
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,797
They was eating. They was eating...

386
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,217
...hamburgers.
Four guys eating hamburgers.

387
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,886
"Hello," they say, "Hello!"

388
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,099
And nothing, I could not speak,
they was eating.

389
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:16,394
All of a sudden, Jodo--
We called him Jodo.

390
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,189
Jodo said,
"No. They're pissing me off. Let's go!"

391
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,483
I start to insulted them.

392
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,030
"How you don't understand
I offer to you...

393
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:34,370
...the most important picture
in the history of the humanity!

394
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,789
We will change the world!

395
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,167
And you are eating...

396
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,713
Eating Big Macs. How?"

397
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,217
And then they stop
and they speak with me.

398
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,305
And after that, it went very, very well.

399
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,764
Very, very well, yeah.

400
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,768
And we was speaking to make
a big album with the music of <i>Dune.</i>

401
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,980
Could be fantastic, no?

402
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,111
<i>In my version, the Duke Leto...</i>

403
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,116
...he is castrated.

404
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,911
And then how he will do a son?

405
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,205
<i>And then his wife...</i>

406
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:21,667
...a marvelous woman, a wise woman...

407
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:28,090
<i>...and the guy have a love, a cosmic love
when he see this woman.</i>

408
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,426
<i>And how he will make a child?</i>

409
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:34,263
<i>And she take a drop of his blood...</i>

410
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:40,144
<i>...and she change the blood into semen...</i>

411
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:46,859
<i>...and then we see the drop of blood
going inside the vagina, the uterus...</i>

412
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>...and we will follow the blood...</i>

413
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:55,493
<i>...the blood coming and go inside
the ovum and explodes there.</i>

414
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,207
<i>She get pregnant with a drop of blood.</i>

415
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,209
<i>That's What I did.</i>

416
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:12,635
<i>What will have if you are not
the son of a sexual pleasure...</i>

417
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,097
<i>...but of a spiritual pleasure?</i>

418
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,186
<i>And from this spiritual love,
he will create Paul.</i>

419
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,524
<i>Paul was a young boy...</i>

420
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:32,071
<i>...but is not a normal boy. Was a mutant.</i>

421
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:35,908
<i>With a big soul and strength.</i>

422
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,245
Where I will find that boy?

423
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,538
My son.

424
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,171
Today you are 7 years old.

425
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,673
Now you are a man.

426
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,010
Bury your first toy and
your mother's picture.

427
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:05,563
I work with him in <i>El Topo</i>,
now he have 12 year old.

428
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,109
<i>I say, "You will make Paul,
but you need to prepare as a warrior."</i>

429
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:13,571
He said, "We're gonna make <i>Dune</i>
and I want you to play...

430
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,909
...the part of Paul,
and you're gonna have to prepare."

431
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:23,080
I prepare my son, to do the role exactly...

432
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:27,418
...as the Duke Leto prepare his son.

433
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:32,965
"So, yes, you're gonna have to learn
karate and make acrobatics...

434
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:37,595
...and your mind has to develop a lot,"
you know.

435
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,931
"You have to be a genius."
He wanted me to be the character.

436
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,975
I find teacher for him.

437
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,103
I have a very strong person...

438
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,730
<i>...Jean-Pierre Vignau.</i>

439
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,902
<i>When we started, he was 12.</i>

440
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,738
There I trained him in karate,
karate jujitsu, Japanese style.

441
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,782
That's all the fist-foot techniques...

442
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,161
...joint locks, floor pins, standing pins...

443
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,289
...a combination of karate,
judo, aikido and atemi-jitsu.

444
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:11,253
He learned how to fight with his hands,
with knife, with swords.

445
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,588
He learn all that.

446
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:19,011
<i>And he was ready to do Paul
as a real "Paul."</i>

447
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:26,143
I trained Brontis six hours a day,
seven days a week for two years.

448
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,980
That was painful. That was--
And Jean-Pierre, he has no mercy.

449
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,608
No, really. He was--
No, he was, you know--

450
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,485
We worked together.
He had no mercy.

451
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,163
<i>And all the person say to me,
"But what you did?</i>

452
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,750
<i>But why you are trying
to change the mind...</i>

453
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,087
...of <i>child and to make</i>
a <i>superior person?"</i>

454
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,927
<i>I say, "No, I was only
awakening the creativity."</i>

455
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,265
<i>I opened his mind.</i>

456
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,225
<i>That's what I was doing.</i>

457
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,687
<i>I don't know if I changed his life.</i>

458
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,773
Now I am thinking, "Why I did that?"

459
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,442
Sacrifice my son.

460
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:21,907
But in that time, I say, if I need to out
my arms in order to make that picture...

461
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,452
...I will cut my arms. I will do it.

462
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:28,205
I was believing that to make a picture...

463
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:35,171
...who will give a mutation
to the young minds...

464
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:39,508
...was sacred.
You need to sacrifice yourself.

465
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,678
I was even ready to die doing that.

466
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,932
<i>Well, Jodo's a bit like a dictator
or a cult leader...</i>

467
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,934
<i>...in assembling his army around him.</i>

468
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,395
<i>Part of Jodo's genius
was in picking those people...</i>

469
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,731
...and finding, absolutely,
the right people...

470
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,066
...for designing the spaceships,
the clothes...

471
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,319
...for designing the whole look
of his world.

472
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,405
<i>I think he sees the potential
of science fiction.</i>

473
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:06,911
<i>For me, science fiction
was like a huge theater...</i>

474
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,580
<i>...like a huge work of art.</i>

475
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,795
Every spaceship was a being...

476
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,049
...like an insect, like a fabulous bird.

477
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,385
<i>That was the spaceship I wanted.</i>

478
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>Foss, I knew him in the covers
of science-fiction books.</i>

479
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:34,939
<i>They were ships with souls, like beings.</i>

480
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,025
It had to be Chris Foss.

481
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,199
This company called Camera One...

482
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,742
...made contact with me.

483
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,120
They said,
"We're doing a film here in France...

484
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:54,124
...and we've seen your work in
a science-fiction bookshop here in Paris.

485
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,169
And would you like to come over,
have a chat with us...

486
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,088
...and see if we could do something?"

487
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,799
And on that basis, I went to Paris.

488
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,015
<i>So I'm there.
All I know is I'm staying the night...</i>

489
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,601
<i>...and then, finally,
I was introduced to Alejandro.</i>

490
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,770
Here is this slightly strange man.

491
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,064
First thing he does,
he goes through my bags...

492
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,651
...starts pulling the bits out.
And then he realizes that it's my bag.

493
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,988
He thought it was his girlfriend's.
That's not the best beginning.

494
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:28,325
<i>Then they say to me, "You're gonna see
a film that Alejandro made."</i>

495
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,996
<i>I'm on my own,
watching the strangest film in the world...</i>

496
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:38,294
...and right in the middle of it,
here's this bloke crapping a golden turd.

497
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,588
You are excrement.

498
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,299
You can change yourself into gold.

499
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,886
And this is my introduction
to this whole environment.

500
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,889
And I suppose already...

501
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:54,101
...Alejandro had some sort of pull,
some sort of enigma.

502
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,020
I'd obviously found it quite strange.

503
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,230
And they said,
"We want you to come back.

504
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,983
We want you to live here.
You will be part of us."

505
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,694
And basically,
I was then installed in Paris...

506
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,280
...and shoehorned into Parisian life...

507
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,575
...and it was an absolute
eye-opener.

508
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,243
Dan loved Paris.

509
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,413
When he first got there,
he thought it was very cramped...

510
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,208
...and tiny and didn't understand it,
and he was very tall for France.

511
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,336
<i>But he loved it.</i>

512
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,172
Well, he wrote me love letters...

513
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,550
...and he wrote me
his impression letters.

514
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,350
Here's one from September 10th of '75.

515
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,852
He says,
"I'm sending along photocopies...

516
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,855
...of some preliminary sketches
of vehicles for the film.

517
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,983
<i>We've got two artists working,
a Frenchman named Jean Giraud...</i>

518
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,319
...and <i>an Englishman
named Christopher Foss.</i>

519
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:46,904
<i>The former did comic books...</i>

520
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:49,448
...and the latter book covers
before coming on <i>Dune.</i>

521
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:53,118
Both are young. As I've mentioned,
the whole staff of this picture is young.

522
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,246
Jodorowsky, at 46, is the oldest."

523
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,999
In that time, I was like a prophet,
I was enlightened.

524
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:04,463
And I gave to them the feeling
they are not only making a picture.

525
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,841
They are making something important
for humanity.

526
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,135
They have a mission. They was warriors.

527
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,931
Alejandro was the guru.
He completely motivated you, you know.

528
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,016
And I still say yes to this day...

529
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,268
...I did some of my most
unusual paintings...

530
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,896
...and I'm very proud of them.
He was very supportive.

531
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,106
Very supportive.

532
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,244
<i>Alejandro motivated me
to such an extent...</i>

533
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:38,247
<i>...I used to go in at weekends
just to finish paintings.</i>

534
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,291
<i>I've got this memory
of coming up with the pirate spaceship...</i>

535
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,045
<i>...over a weekend.
It's been mortally wounded...</i>

536
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:48,132
<i>...and all this spice is spilling out of it.</i>

537
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,390
<i>And it's got a camouflage
which matches the asteroid.</i>

538
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,641
<i>It was just like a fish.</i>

539
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,811
<i>If it stayed very still,
no one could see it.</i>

540
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,396
<i>And then, this was the whole--</i>

541
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,940
<i>I remember seeing that
very clearly in my head...</i>

542
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:08,318
<i>you think you're looking at</i> a <i>rock,
as if you were under the</i> sea...

543
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,156
<i>...and then suddenly something moves,
and you realize that it's an object.</i>

544
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,962
Still haven't read the book, no.
I have no idea what the actual story is.

545
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,006
None whatsoever.

546
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:34,303
It all came via Alejandro
and the script. Yeah, yeah.

547
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,929
So, as far as I'm concerned...

548
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:39,516
...the story of <i>Dune</i>
is what Alejandro told me it was.

549
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:43,854
In an ideal world,
he wouldn't have needed a script.

550
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,023
You could've sat Alejandro down...

551
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,026
...and he would've talked the story,
you know?

552
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,236
He would've said the words,
he would've said:

553
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,988
"Now we're in this landscape."

554
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:55,991
<i>We've got these scenes
in the desert.</i>

555
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,827
<i>The heat would be so intense,
but the sky would be blue...</i>

556
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,163
<i>...a blistering blue.</i>

557
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,668
<i>And Jesus, you were transported.</i>

558
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,468
Alejandro always had
quite clear ideas.

559
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:00,055
He'd do his little piece of theater.
He'd say, "These are the Sardaukar.

560
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:03,934
This is what they're like."
He would play you music, and then--

561
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:07,271
But it was wonderful,
because he sort of left you--

562
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:11,108
He motivated you,
but then he left you to interpret it.

563
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:16,572
I was searching for...
For the light of genius in every person...

564
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:21,243
...with an enormous respect,
an enormous respect.

565
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,289
And then, every day
I was feeding them in order to...

566
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:29,251
To be free, to do the best of them.

567
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:32,713
On other films, they just leave you
to your own devices.

568
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,425
Sometimes, you think they're not even
interested in what you're doing.

569
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:38,010
And here was Alejandro...

570
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,596
...who was passionate
about the whole project.

571
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:45,267
Every morning, I give a big speech...

572
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:51,398
...like the person who make
football or rugby...

573
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,067
...a speech with the players:

574
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:58,322
Every morning, I make my speech.

575
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,158
In order to say,
"Do it, what you need to do...

576
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:04,494
...really, because this will be important."

577
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:13,170
<i>I actually started life--
I was going to be an architect.</i>

578
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:15,422
<i>And that's what you see
in the palace...</i>

579
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,884
<i>...you know, which is, it's--
You could physically build it.</i>

580
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,511
<i>Because the story of my life is,
anything I design...</i>

581
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:24,556
<i>...it's entirely buildable.
And if you look, there's a detail.</i>

582
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:29,144
<i>Look, you've got the walls
with weeping water, all very stylized.</i>

583
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:33,732
<i>I designed it knowing exactly
how they would build the set.</i>

584
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,943
<i>I probably said, "Oh, yes, Alejandro.</i>

585
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,029
<i>We will do this in fiberglass,
we will cast it like this."</i>

586
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:43,200
<i>So I knew exactly how to do it
and how to get the effect.</i>

587
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,456
In that time,
I was seducing Dalí...

588
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:53,669
...because I wanted Dalí
as the mad emperor of the galaxy.

589
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,051
Dalí, to us, he seemed to be
the only emperor of the world...

590
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:05,597
...with that extraordinary talent,
with his speech and his wording.

591
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:12,604
Can nobody understand Dalí because
myself, never understand my work.

592
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:17,526
Never Dalí understand
one painting of Dalí...

593
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:22,114
...because Dalí only create enigmas.

594
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,533
Dalí was something, eh?

595
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:33,000
<i>The first time we went to New York
was with Michel Seydoux.</i>

596
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,131
<i>We went to the St. Regis because
Michel Seydoux liked the St. Regis Hotel.</i>

597
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:43,802
And we discovered that Dalí
was also at the St. Regis Hotel!

598
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,470
By chance.

599
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,764
<i>I was reading a book about the Tarot.</i>

600
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,811
And then I take a page
where the Hanged Man...

601
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:59,359
I write, "I want to see you because
I will make a picture with you."

602
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:04,698
He like it. To have this kind of invitation.
He say, "I will see you.

603
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:06,992
<i>I wait you in the bar."</i>

604
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:12,289
<i>The bar had a 6-meter long painting...</i>

605
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,083
<i>...pre-Rafaelite, where there was a king...</i>

606
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:21,673
...and the nobles had a face
like they were hiding something.

607
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,887
Dalí told me, "I like it here because
there is a 6-meter painting...

608
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,638
...dedicated to a fart."

609
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:36,480
Dalí told me,
"We are going to see each other in Paris.

610
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,357
I am going to think about it."

611
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:55,999
In Paris, on the Champs Elysées,
there was a very fancy restaurant...

612
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,211
<i>...and he was there with his court.</i>

613
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:03,632
<i>He had 12--
Twelve persons at the table and him.</i>

614
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:07,844
"Sit down.
I want to ask something to you."

615
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:09,846
"What, Mr. Dalí?"

616
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:16,144
"When we was young, myself and
Picasso, we went to the beach.

617
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:19,606
And we open the door of the car...

618
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,984
...always in the sand, we find a clock."

619
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,987
Clock, no?

620
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:30,617
"Do you find, in your life,
a clock in the sand?"

621
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,996
And I say, "What I can answer?"

622
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,040
It was very quick, like this, because...

623
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,751
...all the 12 person
are awaiting my question.

624
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:43,213
Because if I say I find,
all the time, clocks...

625
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:48,385
...I will be a vanity person. Ridiculous.

626
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:52,514
If I say I never find a clock,
I will be a poor guy.

627
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,559
And suddenly came to me, I say:

628
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,186
"I never find a clock.

629
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,981
But I lost a lot."

630
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,692
Really?

631
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:07,904
"Okay!" And then,
"I wait you in Barcelona!"

632
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,243
<i>It was a game.</i>

633
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:19,916
Also, Jodorowsky was part
of the surrealist movement...

634
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,543
...and Dalí liked that.

635
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,796
So it was a game between them.

636
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,048
Who would win the game?

637
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,634
He was going through his first adventure
with Amanda Lear...

638
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:34,097
...this sort of extraordinarily sexy person.

639
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,558
<i>Nobody ever knew
if it was a man or a woman...</i>

640
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,687
<i>...a completely incredible character.</i>

641
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,733
<i>A sort of muse, a poet's muse.</i>

642
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,738
Whenever someone like
Jodorowsky or...

643
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,618
Would come to see him,
it was a bit ambiguous.

644
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,953
There was a sort of respect.

645
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,955
Yes, of course,
you have success with your work...

646
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,374
...but there was also
a little jealousy, I think.

647
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,626
He was a bit jealous.

648
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,587
And you had to meet him,
you had to tame him...

649
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,797
...and he needed to tame you.

650
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:11,092
So he would make you go
through these initiations each time.

651
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:16,932
Of course, Dalí had absolutely no idea
what <i>Dune</i> was about.

652
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:20,685
He had never read the book.
He didn't know who Frank Herbert was.

653
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,812
<i>He didn't know what</i> Dune
<i>was talking about.</i>

654
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,650
So I had to clue him a little bit, because
I liked Frank Herbert and I liked <i>Dune.</i>

655
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,236
And I said to him,
"You know, this is a great thing.

656
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:33,281
It's not just a science fiction.
There's a whole philosophy."

657
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:36,034
<i>He wasn't interested in all that,
I realized that.</i>

658
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,078
She treated me very well...

659
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,080
...and she became an ally...

660
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,999
...because I promised her the role
of Princess Irulan.

661
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,423
Yes, I think that was hysterical.

662
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,843
Because Dalí said, "Yeah,
and Amanda must play the princess."

663
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,556
So they all look at me,
"Well, is she an actress?"

664
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,849
"Oh, yes, of course.
she'll play the princess."

665
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:04,896
She said,
"Be careful because Dalí is destructive.

666
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,899
If he says 'yes', he is going to do
everything to destroy the film."

667
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,734
Dalí said,
"Can I have a helicopter?"

668
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,405
To him, to have a helicopter
was the maximum of, you know...

669
00:51:13,572 --> 00:51:15,574
"Yeah, yeah,
you can have many helicopters."

670
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,159
"Can I have a burning giraffe?"

671
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:21,329
"Well, what about...?"
"Burning. I want burning."

672
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,373
"All right, we'll have burning giraffe.

673
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,584
We'll have elephants,
whatever you want."

674
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:33,550
And slowly, you know, the budget
of the movie was going up and up and up.

675
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:36,720
We're talking hundreds of thousands,
millions of dollars.

676
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,307
Dalí say to me, "I will work with you...

677
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:44,269
...but I want to be the actor...

678
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,980
Best paid actor in Hollywood.

679
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:52,527
I want $100,000 per hour."

680
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:55,905
I went back and told Alejandro,
"We're never going to make it!"

681
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,116
But I couldn't pay him
"the most in the world."

682
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,326
That would be impossible.

683
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,994
Then step by step...

684
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,579
...because we were stubborn
and because Alejandro would tell me...

685
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,789
...that Dalí was the only one
who could play the emperor...

686
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,292
...the totalitarian emperor...

687
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,921
...we had the idea of paying him...

688
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,715
...by the minutes used.

689
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,884
I go to see Alejandro...

690
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,594
...and ask, "How many minutes
is he going to be filmed?

691
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,929
How many minutes
will he be in the movie?"

692
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:25,060
Alejandro says,
"Maximum five, probably three."

693
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:26,895
So I said, "That's the idea!"

694
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:30,899
I go back to see Dalí and I say,
"I will pay you $100,000 per minute!"

695
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:36,196
He says, "That's brilliant!
I will be the $100,000 a minute actor!"

696
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:42,202
I said, "I will take a mold of you,
hyper-realistic...

697
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:45,288
...and I will make
the emperor of the galaxy...

698
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:50,627
...he is so afraid to be killed,
he have a robot. And the robot will act."

699
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,636
And Dalí said, "Yes, if you give me
the sculpture for my museum."

700
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,307
"Okay." And then like this, I have Dalí.

701
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:12,941
And Dalí, in our conversation,
show me a catalog of Giger.

702
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,986
And he say to me,
"I think this person have a talent."

703
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:21,032
I see that, I see-- But is incredible!

704
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,661
Is what I am searching for
the Harkonnen, for the bad guys.

705
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:29,249
<i>The gothic planet, gothic characters.</i>

706
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:33,002
And then I went to search Giger.

707
00:53:56,735 --> 00:54:04,868
Paris was where Jodorowsky and
Dan O'Bannon saw my work displayed...

708
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:15,962
...and they wanted me to join them.

709
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,636
Giger had never done movies.

710
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,890
I said, "You have to make movies."

711
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:32,896
It was completely new to me
and incredibly fascinating.

712
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:37,567
<i>I say to Giger, "I need you as you are.</i>

713
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:43,072
You are searching in the deepest
darkness of the soul.

714
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,575
<i>And that is good. That is your art.</i>

715
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:49,788
<i>Your art is-- For me, is an ill art.</i>

716
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:53,708
Marvelous, ill art,
necessary for the Baron Harkonnen."

717
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:59,714
I met Jodorowsky for the first time
in Paris.

718
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:05,804
This was the evening when he attended...

719
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,349
...a Magma concert.

720
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:19,859
<i>For the Harkonnen planet,
I chose here in Paris...</i>

721
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,695
<i>...a very famous group in that time,
is Magma.</i>

722
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:28,326
<i>Magma was gothic, military...</i>

723
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,329
...terrible.

724
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,379
I knew nothing about the project,
or the idea...

725
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,968
...or the book for that matter.
I learned about all of that afterward.

726
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:49,764
<i>Alejandro Jodorowsky didn't give us
any direction on the music.</i>

727
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:51,933
<i>I believe he trusted us.</i>

728
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:58,231
Now, I had an idea because he had
described the planet, the Harkonnen.

729
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,358
I knew that they were not really
the good guys...

730
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,485
...that they were more like the bad guys.

731
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,737
So it was rather easy
to imagine because...

732
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:10,118
<i>...Magma made music
that was rather violent...</i>

733
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:12,495
<i>...typically hard, things like that.</i>

734
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,295
I was just amazed by the quality...

735
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:26,593
...and I told them I felt just like
Christ when he was on the cross.

736
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:31,306
I was fulfilled,
it was fascinating, the music.

737
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:38,688
I was using the best musicians
of this time, from rock.

738
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,871
<i>I wanted Mick Jagger to play
Feyd-Rautha, a character.</i>

739
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:05,757
How am I going to contact this person...

740
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:10,178
...who is not going to be impressed that
I have the great power to make a movie?

741
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:15,725
He is in the peak of his fame, of his glory.
How?

742
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:19,896
And I was invited to an event in Paris.

743
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,732
It was a big gathering
of the Parisian bourgeoisie...

744
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,068
...and at the other side of the room,
a big room...

745
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:29,113
...I don't know,
maybe 150 square meters...

746
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,741
...was Mick Jagger.

747
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:35,828
I saw him from a distance
and I think he saw me...

748
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:38,998
...and I saw him walking,
he started walking--

749
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,293
He started walking between the people...

750
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:45,088
...and then I realized
that he was coming to me.

751
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:48,925
He crossed the room
and he stood in front of me.

752
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:51,594
<i>And I told him, "I want you for my movie."</i>

753
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,806
<i>And he said only one word, "Yes."</i>

754
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:01,229
I was often invited
to Andy Warhol's Factory...

755
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,773
...Candy Darling, and all those people.

756
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,945
<i>There I met Udo Kier,
who was Andy Warhol's great actor.</i>

757
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:16,953
<i>He had played great roles,
and he said that he would act for me.</i>

758
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:46,501
<i>Baron Harkonnen is a big, big monster...</i>

759
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:51,881
<i>...who have anti-gravitational implants...</i>

760
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:54,884
<i>...and he is in the air all the time
because he is too heavy.</i>

761
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,264
Orson Welles.

762
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:11,275
Orson Welles had a bad reputation...

763
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:15,988
...because they said
that he liked to drink and eat...

764
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,908
...so much that he ate at the movies.

765
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:24,205
He ate a lot, and then he did not
finish the movies, he was moody.

766
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:29,210
But I said, "No, Orson Welles
is a genius, he is the one."

767
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:35,216
<i>And since he liked to eat, they say he goes
to the gastronomic restaurants in Paris.</i>

768
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:39,595
<i>Therefore, I sent a secretary to ask...</i>

769
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:44,100
...in <i>all the gastronomic restaurants
in Paris:</i>

770
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,478
"Where does Orson Welles eat?"

771
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,607
And we discover a restaurant
and then he was eating.

772
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:55,111
Six bottles of wine. He was eating.

773
01:00:55,278 --> 01:01:00,950
And then I asked to the chef,
"What is the best wine he want?"

774
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:04,412
He say, "That."
Then, "Send him a bottle."

775
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:08,082
And then, he drink the bottle
and he want to speak with me.

776
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,380
And then, I speak with all the respect,
because was for me was an idol.

777
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:19,844
He say, "I don't want to do it.
I don't want any more."

778
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,932
I say to him, "I will propose something.

779
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:29,687
If you do the picture, even if
we pay what you want as an actor...

780
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:35,943
...I will hire the chef of this restaurant
and you will eat, as here, every day."

781
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,820
And he say, "I do it."

782
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:47,246
I had the artworks from the movie...

783
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:53,669
...which I got from Moebius, who drew
the storyboard, where one can see...

784
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:57,173
<i>...the Harkonnen Castle.</i>

785
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:02,470
<i>The castle was the big Baron Harkonnen,
no? The big sculpture.</i>

786
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,807
That was where Baron Harkonnen lived.

787
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,852
In himself! The big ego, no?

788
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:17,193
The castle open the mouth,
a tongue go there, out...

789
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,113
...and the spaceship came in the tongue.

790
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,450
And then he say:

791
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:44,845
<i>I was fascinated by the creation
of the Harkonnen people...</i>

792
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:51,727
<i>...and when I airbrushed five paintings...</i>

793
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:57,692
<i>...I gave my best to create these designs.</i>

794
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:26,637
<i>In order to go to the castle,
there is a way with tubes.</i>

795
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:31,017
<i>Enormous tubes. Come out knife.</i>

796
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:39,191
And then in order to go to the Baron
Harkonnen, you need to walk this way...

797
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:44,238
"escaping of the big knife
who want to destroy you.

798
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:50,411
If attacked, then the spears would be
set in motion and impale the people...

799
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:57,585
...who stood in the way
on the pathway up the castle.

800
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:04,342
And in fact this Harkonnen fortress
was never in the novel.

801
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:11,474
So this was somehow
in Alejandro Jodorowsky's translation...

802
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:18,481
...his interpretation of the story.

803
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:52,306
When Paul get killed,
he doesn't die because...

804
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:57,186
...the Messiah is all the humanity
can get enlightened.

805
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:10,366
<i>In the end, his mind is the mind
of every person. He's a plural being.</i>

806
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:14,870
I am the others. The others are me.

807
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:29,135
By killing the hero near the end...

808
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:33,097
...you also open this way
of identifying yourself.

809
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:35,683
So you're not identifying
yourself with a hero...

810
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,519
...a character, but you start
identifying yourself also...

811
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,396
...with a universal consciousness.

812
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:52,074
<i>He dies, really physically,
but he becomes everyone.</i>

813
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,998
And then, if the whole humanity
get enlightened...

814
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:01,959
...the Earth changed.

815
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,257
<i>The planet of sand...</i>

816
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:14,597
...start to grow plant, animals,
be like a paradise.

817
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:36,368
Dune is a Messiah of the planets
because is a planet with consciousness.

818
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:38,662
With the same consciousness of Paul.

819
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,290
And the planet go to the universe...

820
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,292
<i>...to illuminate the other planets.</i>

821
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:50,883
<i>I changed the end of the book,
evidently!</i>

822
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,385
In the book, it's a continuation.

823
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:56,138
The planet never changed.

824
01:06:57,515 --> 01:07:01,602
Is not awake,
with a cosmic consciousness.

825
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:04,855
It's not a Messiah, the planet. I did that.

826
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,983
<i>It's different. It was my</i> Dune.

827
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:14,698
<i>When you make a picture,
you must not respect the novel.</i>

828
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:17,701
It's like you get married, no?

829
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,497
You go with the wife,
white, the woman is white...

830
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:26,168
...you take the woman, if you respect
the woman, you will never have child.

831
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:31,090
You need to open the costume and to...

832
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,926
To rape the bride.

833
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:38,264
And then you will have your picture.

834
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:43,519
I was raping Frank Herbert,
raping, like this!

835
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,063
But with love, with love.

836
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,693
And then I came with that.

837
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,448
<i>It was such a beautiful object.</i>

838
01:07:56,615 --> 01:08:00,202
<i>So well done and at the time,
there were no photocopies.</i>

839
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:02,746
<i>It was just photos of each drawing.</i>

840
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,456
In color...

841
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,917
<i>...so well done...</i>

842
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:12,256
...with so much detail about
the costumes, about the techniques used.

843
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:16,010
Every studio have one book like this.
Every studio.

844
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:19,096
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal,
everything, all them...

845
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:23,225
...Michel Seydoux give a book like that.

846
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:28,564
This approach was chosen
precisely because...

847
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:33,193
...I was thinking they might have
a certain distrust of Jodorowsky.

848
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,115
But since we were showing the camera
angles, since we explained each scene...

849
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,659
...the way we wanted to film it...

850
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,661
...they should have been relieved.

851
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,081
But they weren't. It wasn't enough.

852
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:57,426
<i>In Los Angeles, I wasn't optimistic.</i>

853
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,597
The thing is that sometimes
the French and the Americans...

854
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,683
...have difficult relationships, you know.

855
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,769
Well, we have had.

856
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:12,900
We were almost at the finish line,
but we had to find the last $5 million.

857
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:17,237
The film cost $15 million.
Well, we estimated it as $15...

858
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,868
<i>We had been invited to Walt Disney
studios by the chairman of the board.</i>

859
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:27,122
<i>He looked through the project and said:</i>

860
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:30,834
"This is a wonderful project...

861
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,420
...but it is like the Concorde.

862
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:37,299
It's an exceptional plane,
but over here, never!"

863
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:42,429
And there I said to myself that
we were going to face a lot of problems.

864
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:45,349
<i>Hollywood prefers ideas
which they can relate to...</i>

865
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,685
<i>...things which sound like
two other current movies.</i>

866
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,978
<i>If you can tell them
it's like Jurassic Park...</i>

867
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:52,147
<i>...crossed with Twilight
or, you know...</i>

868
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:55,859
<i>...The Hobbit crossed with
The</i> Killing <i>Fields, it makes more sense.</i>

869
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:58,654
To come in with something
which is more complex...

870
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:01,281
...which has adult themes
and a degree of ambiguity...

871
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:06,829
...and especially a film which has
spiritual and metaphysical ideas...

872
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:10,165
...is something which has
most studios running scared.

873
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,794
<i>They always received us
in a very friendly way...</i>

874
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:16,880
<i>...but it was always the same answer.</i>

875
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,051
When we would give them the book,
they were very impressed.

876
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,178
They had never seen anything like it.

877
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:28,976
<i>Each time, they would tell us,
"it's superb. It's very well constructed.</i>

878
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,522
<i>You've solved the technical problems
of those special effects.</i>

879
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:35,858
<i>It's economically reasonable.</i>

880
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:39,611
But we don't get your director."

881
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,489
They are not qualified
to judge this material.

882
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:44,700
They are not designers
or artists themselves.

883
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:48,370
Most of those guys are accountants.
They want to know the bottom line.

884
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:53,584
Hollywood did not visualize
science fiction that way.

885
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:56,962
It was in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey...</i>

886
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:59,423
...or in small B movies.

887
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:04,470
But a huge movie, that would cost
millions of dollars with all the effects.

888
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,889
They did not conceive of that.

889
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,599
Maybe it was a bit long as well.

890
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:13,437
Maybe the film was a bit too long.

891
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:20,903
They asked me to make a picture
one hour and a half, for the theaters.

892
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:24,740
And myself, "No, why the time?"
I will make a picture...

893
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,619
...of 12 hours! Or 20 hours!

894
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:31,079
The worry was that it would go
way over budget...

895
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,833
...and it wouldn't have an audience...

896
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,961
...because no one would want to sit
through that long a film.

897
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:41,423
So those things should have been
at least talked through...

898
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:44,176
...I think,
before a presentation was made...

899
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:46,512
...because someone
should have known...

900
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:50,307
...that the studio people would be...

901
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,351
There would be a red ﬂag
all the time...

902
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,603
...about how bizarre it was.

903
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,897
The totally outrageous side
of Jodorowsky...

904
01:11:57,064 --> 01:12:01,610
...especially after
<i>The Holy Mountain</i> and <i>El Topo...</i>

905
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,405
...did not give them faith that he could
lead this very ambitious project.

906
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:09,701
Because $15 million in the middle
of the '70s was a lot of money.

907
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:13,580
And that was their answer, even though
they found everything else to be perfect.

908
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:15,791
Everything was great,
except the director.

909
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,460
You have to be like a poet.

910
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:22,214
Your movie must be just as you
think of it and just as you want it.

911
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:27,302
Do not take comments to change this
or that from this person or the other. No!

912
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,849
The movie has to be just like I dream it.

913
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:37,563
The picture need to be exactly
as I am dreaming the picture.

914
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:40,732
Is a dream. Don't change my dream.

915
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:42,985
<i>I believe deep down...</i>

916
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,487
...that people did not
do this film in America...

917
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,322
...because they were afraid of him.

918
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:49,658
They were afraid of his imagination,
his mind...

919
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,120
...they were afraid
what it was gonna do to them.

920
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:55,914
I think that is the real reason
why it never got made...

921
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:58,333
...because people were scared.

922
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:02,754
This system make of us slaves.

923
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:06,425
Without dignity. Without depth.

924
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:12,014
With a devil in our pocket.

925
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:16,518
This incredible money are in the pocket.

926
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:20,230
This money. This shit.

927
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:25,235
This nothing.
This paper who have nothing inside.

928
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,656
Movies have heart.

929
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,660
Have mind.

930
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,955
Have power.

931
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,708
Have ambition.

932
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,086
I wanted to do something like that.
Why not?

933
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:54,222
<i>It was canceled at the point
where all of the planning...</i>

934
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,726
<i>...that could be done on paper
had been done...</i>

935
01:13:57,893 --> 01:14:00,854
<i>...and we were ready
to start constructing sets.</i>

936
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:04,733
They were taking a hiatus
before they went to Algeria to shoot.

937
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:08,236
And he was sent back here
to do some research on film stock...

938
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:14,743
...and then he got the call,
said it's over.

939
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,078
No money.

940
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:19,748
<i>And he went crazy.
Everything was in Paris.</i>

941
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:23,377
<i>Everything he owned was in Paris.
He'd sold his car.</i>

942
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,254
<i>So he was crashed on our couch,
and he stayed there...</i>

943
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:29,049
...for about two weeks
until he drove everybody nuts.

944
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:33,929
Complete disaster that was never made,
complete disaster.

945
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:36,264
It would have been
quite extraordinary.

946
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:41,103
I was disappointed.
Sure I was disappointed, you know.

947
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:43,772
Because if the film was made--
There was like--

948
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,692
You know, it's like you have a...

949
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,527
A dreamed life.

950
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:52,322
My life could have been
this and that. Right?

951
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:57,452
Very disappointed. Very disappointed
because we all believed in it.

952
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,746
I believed in it.

953
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:02,624
Alejandro was very, I think-- I think...

954
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:05,085
...very, very, very hurt,
very disappointed.

955
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,295
It's a big failure for him.

956
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,506
Now, this is my take on it...

957
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:11,925
...but I think he didn't feel like...

958
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:16,930
...doing something else
after such a project...

959
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,267
...which was the project of his life,
I believe. That's my feeling.

960
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,728
I think that the humiliation...

961
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,981
...that Alejandro Jodorowsky suffered,
in not having been chosen...

962
01:15:26,148 --> 01:15:30,986
...in having been eliminated for being
too original, being too surrealistic...

963
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,696
<i>...that is a permanent injury.</i>

964
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:35,824
<i>I think that Jodorowsky
carries that in his heart for life.</i>

965
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:45,083
<i>I was convinced that it would be
something great.</i>

966
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:50,422
But then Dino De Laurentiis' daughter...

967
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:54,593
...came along and took the project
away from us...

968
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,471
...and gave it to David Lynch.

969
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:17,866
And when I heard that David Lynch
will direct that...

970
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:22,454
...I have a pain because I admire
David Lynch. He can do it!

971
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:26,958
He is the only one in this moment
who can do it that and he will do it!

972
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:33,048
I suffer because was my dream.
Another person will do that...

973
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:35,634
...maybe better than me.

974
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:39,930
And then when the picture,
they will show the picture here...

975
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:44,226
...I say I will not go to see that
because I will die.

976
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:50,107
And my sons say, "No, we are warriors.
You need to come and to see that."

977
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:55,695
And then they take me,
like an ill person I came to the theater.

978
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:01,493
Even I think I will cry.
And I start to see the picture...

979
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,288
...and step by step, step by step,
step by step...

980
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:08,917
...I became happy
because the picture was awful!

981
01:17:10,961 --> 01:17:12,254
We come for you!

982
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:18,969
Is a failure!

983
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:23,223
Well, it's a human reaction, no?

984
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,644
Is not beautiful,
but I have that reaction.

985
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:33,859
I say, "ls not possible. ls not David Lynch
because he is a big artist."

986
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,153
ls the producer who did that.

987
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,823
I've never seen the movie and I never will.

988
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,786
Jodorowsky was ahead
of his time.

989
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:47,164
The big problem
was that he was bringing in...

990
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:51,001
...a lot of ideas which take people
decades to process.

991
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:54,171
When you want to change
the consciousness of the audience...

992
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,591
...you want to change the consciousness
of the Hollywood executives...

993
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,801
<i>...and alter the whole ecology...</i>

994
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:03,597
<i>...you have to be extremely patient,
like Kynes the planetologist.</i>

995
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,141
<i>These things take
thousands of years.</i>

996
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:10,478
<i>And very slowly these ideas
might permeate the system.</i>

997
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:13,148
But Jodo was try--
Was hoping it would happen...

998
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:15,942
...within his lifetime,
that it would happen now...

999
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:19,654
...and the truth of the matter is
that it may take generations...

1000
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:25,243
...before movies actually aspire
to the level that Jodo is wishing for.

1001
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:31,082
From this supposed failure,
come a lot of creation.

1002
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:37,380
In the life, thing come, you say "yes."

1003
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:40,175
Thing go away, you say "yes."

1004
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:42,135
We don't do <i>Dune</i>? Yes!

1005
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:45,180
That is, yes, we don't do it!

1006
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,932
And then so what?

1007
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,476
And then so what?

1008
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:55,649
<i>Dune</i> is in the world like a dream,
but dreams change the world also.

1009
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:58,693
<i>Dune</i> is like Paul, so <i>Dune</i> was--

1010
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,570
Its throat was cut, of the film.

1011
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,031
The film wasn't made,
the film was killed.

1012
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:06,201
But, you know,
you can hear in some films:

1013
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:09,704
<i>"I am</i> Dune<i>, I am</i> Dune<i>, I am</i> Dune.

1014
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:11,122
I think it was a guide.

1015
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,374
A guide for some.

1016
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:17,212
In any case, I am convinced
that our storyboard...

1017
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,047
...made the rounds
in the halls of Hollywood.

1018
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,592
I can't imagine that isn't the case.
It pleases me to imagine that.

1019
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,177
You always have to see the positive.

1020
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,972
The original <i>Star Wars</i>, the '77 film...

1021
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:31,893
...there's a lot of visual reference from
what Jodorowsky laid out on paper.

1022
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,062
<i>Just the way his sword fights
were designed.</i>

1023
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:36,064
<i>There's a huge amount of influence.</i>

1024
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:43,697
<i>There's a scene of Paul dueling
with a robot and doing training...</i>

1025
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:47,867
...and <i>it's</i> a <i>lot like Luke
dueling with the ball...</i>

1026
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:49,911
...in the Millennium Falcon.

1027
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:51,329
What I found interesting...

1028
01:19:52,747 --> 01:19:54,833
...is there's shots
from the robot's P.O.V...

1029
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,002
...where the robot has
a heads-up display...

1030
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,671
<i>...where he's analyzing
the environment around him.</i>

1031
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:04,968
And I was thinking about it, and I can't
think of an earlier iteration of this scene...

1032
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,595
...which we've all seen now
a thousand times.

1033
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:10,932
<i>The Terminator looking at somebody
and analyzing their face.</i>

1034
01:20:13,435 --> 01:20:17,605
It's one of these things where
this is a movie that never got made...

1035
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:21,818
...but it has its fingerprints all over so many
other movies that came afterwards.

1036
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:23,189
Giger. He make the monster of <i>Alien.</i>

1037
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:29,362
Why he make the monster of <i>Alien?</i>

1038
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:31,072
Because Dan O'Bannon.

1039
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>O'Bannon create Alien.</i>

1040
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:42,500
<i>They take Moebius,
they take Giger, Foss.</i>

1041
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:52,177
And Hollywood start to use my group.

1042
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:55,263
Was very fantastic.

1043
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:59,350
<i>Dune</i> is this massive asteroid...

1044
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:01,436
...that has a near miss with Earth...

1045
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:03,938
...but it still manages
to seed the Earth...

1046
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,648
...with all these amazing spores.

1047
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:08,401
<i>In a world where Jodorowsky's</i>
Dune <i>doesn't happen...</i>

1048
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,612
<i>...maybe</i> Alien <i>doesn't happen,
and when</i> Alien <i>doesn't happen...</i>

1049
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:12,280
...Blade Runner <i>doesn't happen.</i>

1050
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:14,449
<i>There's no</i> Blade Runner<i>,
there's no</i> William Gibson.

1051
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,618
<i>There's no</i> Matrix<i>, there's no--
All these other things...</i>

1052
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:19,621
<i>...that sort of come
organically down this line.</i>

1053
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:22,165
A lot of people took images
and ideas with them...

1054
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,459
...and incorporated them
into other projects...

1055
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:27,921
...so it always leads back
to Jodorowsky.

1056
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:32,133
<i>When you get involved in the process
of bringing a beast like this to life...</i>

1057
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,928
...and when you don't get the chance
to realize that...

1058
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:38,139
...to put the thing on screen,
it goes on living inside your head.

1059
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:40,058
You never get a chance
to exorcise it.

1060
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:43,228
And a story like that
can stick around and stick around...

1061
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,146
...and goes on haunting your dreams...

1062
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:47,857
...for the rest of your life
unless you can get it out.

1063
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:51,402
And then Moebius say to me,
"What you will do? You will die?"

1064
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,739
No, I will not die.

1065
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:58,201
For me to fail is only to change the way.

1066
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,495
If we don't do that...

1067
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:04,123
...the <i>Dune</i>we was doing is...

1068
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:10,129
The roots are the <i>Dune</i> of Herbert.
But this <i>Dune</i> is us.

1069
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:13,675
Is the optical. ls a creation.

1070
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:18,721
And then, I will use everything
I put in <i>Dune</i> to make comics.

1071
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:21,224
I say to Moebius,
"Why we don't do a comic?"

1072
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,351
And I start to dictate The Inca/.

1073
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:27,981
A lot of images that are in here
are in here.

1074
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:56,301
And then I find an Argentine,
a Spanish, Juan Gimenez.

1075
01:24:56,467 --> 01:25:01,889
<i>And there I make all the spaceship
I design for</i> Dune <i>are in The Metabarons.</i>

1076
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:07,312
<i>Even the Duke Leto.
I made him castrated by a bull...</i>

1077
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:11,983
<i>...and we find the sorcerer
who will take a drop of his blood...</i>

1078
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,568
<i>...in order to make the child.</i>

1079
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:18,281
<i>I did it here, is here, like I was shooting!
I did it.</i>

1080
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:23,745
<i>I start with</i> Dune<i>, but I go farther, no?
Farther.</i>

1081
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:28,249
I continue and I did it, my work.

1082
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:39,093
I think <i>Dune</i> will be fantastic
if somebody take this script...

1083
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,262
...even if I am not alive...

1084
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:44,390
...and do a picture in animation.

1085
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:46,809
Now is possible.

1086
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,395
<i>I can die, they can do my picture.</i>

1087
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:55,276
I have 84 years, but I am still creating.

1088
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:56,611
I am not:

1089
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:02,992
All my life I create,
and is more and more and more.

1090
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,119
The mind is like a universe.

1091
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,998
It's constantly expanding.

1092
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:12,919
Like the universe,
exactly like the universe, open the mind.

1093
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:17,340
<i>The opening of the mind is every day,
is open.</i>

1094
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:24,055
<i>That was this picture. Open the mind
of all the persons who worked there.</i>

1095
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:28,142
<i>From the producer to the artists.
From the workers...</i>

1096
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:33,398
<i>...for every one was an opening
of the mind, this work.</i>

1097
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:38,778
<i>Was ambitious, but not too.
Was ambitious.</i>

1098
01:26:38,945 --> 01:26:41,948
<i>Myself, I have the ambition
to live 300 years.</i>

1099
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:47,078
<i>I will not live 300 years.
Maybe I will live one year more.</i>

1100
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,830
<i>But I have the ambition.</i>

1101
01:26:49,372 --> 01:26:52,125
<i>Why you will not have ambition?</i>

1102
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:54,335
<i>Why?</i>

1103
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:59,048
<i>Have the greatest ambition possible.</i>

1104
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:02,260
<i>You want to be immortal?
Fight to be immortal.</i>

1105
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,179
<i>Do it.</i>

1106
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:10,518
<i>You want to make
the most fantastic art of movie? Try.</i>

1107
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:14,564
<i>If you fail, is not important.</i>

1108
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:17,358
<i>We need to try.</i>

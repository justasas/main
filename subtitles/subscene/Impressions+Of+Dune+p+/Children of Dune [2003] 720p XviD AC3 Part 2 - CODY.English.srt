1
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:16,695
History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.

2
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,295
Muad'Dib is gone...

3
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:22,695
but his children remain...

4
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,095
almost grown...

5
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:28,935
and about to face the consequences
of their father's legacy...

6
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:34,615
a legacy fiercely guarded
by their aunt, Alia...

7
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:40,175
even as she struggles with the ominous
destiny of her own birthright.

8
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:52,176
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

9
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:21,215
Here I am.
Here I remain.

10
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:23,775
The Golden Path.

11
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:27,615
The path I couldn't take.

12
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:31,895
It's up to you now, my son.

13
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,615
The Golden Path is dangerous, son.

14
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,655
Leto.

15
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:04,255
I was hoping to see a worm.

16
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:06,935
You know they never come
close enough to see anymore.

17
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,055
The water has driven them away.

18
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,695
Everything's changing, Ghani.

19
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:18,175
Changing too fast.

20
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,855
You've had another vision,
haven't you?

21
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,335
My skin wasn't my own.

22
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,655
I was running across the desert
just so fast...

23
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,055
just running and running...

24
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,335
to Jacarutu.

25
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,215
I saw him there again,
our father.

26
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,855
- You sure it was him?
- Yes.

27
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:48,575
And he spoke of the Golden Path.

28
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:52,335
It frightens me.

29
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,135
I'm afraid of what it could mean
about us.

30
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,695
- We're not like Alia, Ghani.
- Are you sure?

31
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:07,095
Will you tell our grandmother all this
when we see her?

32
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:10,895
I don't know.
What do you think?

33
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:14,375
It might be wise
to understand her a bit better...

34
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,895
before we allow her
to understand us.

35
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,615
They've come for us.

36
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,575
Haven't they, Irulan?

37
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:43,495
I expect you both to be
courteous and respectful.

38
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,975
None of your sly comments.
She's a Bene Gesserit...

39
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:47,775
and she'll know if you're
keeping things from her.

40
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:49,215
Why should we
keep anything from her?

41
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,095
Do we have anything worth keeping?

42
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:54,535
That's what I mean, Leto.

43
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:57,215
Stilgar and I are almost
at our limits with your wit.

44
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:58,495
Worm sign.

45
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,775
I didn't see anything.

46
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,575
Perhaps a slightly higher altitude
would be advisable, Leto.

47
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,735
My father used to love being this close
to the ground when he flew.

48
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:25,215
And you, of course,
know this intuitively, don't you?

49
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,735
Just like how you knew to fly
without any training.

50
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:30,575
Don't forget your Bene Gesserit
training, Stepmother.

51
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:32,335
Fear is the mind killer.

52
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:35,615
I'm afraid she's about
to let it pass through her.

53
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,575
It's beautiful.

54
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,575
Simply beautiful.

55
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:31,375
Have we gone too far?
Have we forgotten?

56
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:11,135
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless his coming and his going.

57
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,375
May his passing cleanse the world.
May he keep the world for his people.

58
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:19,615
- Ba-Li-Kaifa.
- That wasn't funny.

59
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,135
Duncan!

60
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:10,255
Love!

61
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,375
You've taken
too much spice again.

62
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,495
I've opened a bottomless pit.

63
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:18,735
A swarm of locusts
is flying up to harass me.

64
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:22,775
Why can't I see, Duncan? Why?

65
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,615
See what?

66
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,415
The future.
My vision is incomplete.

67
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:32,775
The future. It's there, Duncan,
just out of reach.

68
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,775
Why am I always being pulled back?

69
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:38,575
Perhaps you should ask yourself
why is it necessary to see it.

70
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,295
- Don't patronize me.
- I don't patronize.

71
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:47,775
I care. That's all.

72
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:55,255
Why is she coming, Duncan?
Why now?

73
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,335
So that's it.

74
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:01,095
After all these years since she saw
her grandchildren on Caladan.

75
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,615
And in six months,
they will be of age.

76
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:06,415
Reason for me, Duncan.

77
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,215
Be my mentat for a moment,
not my husband.

78
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,495
No Bene Gesserit acts
without preordained plans...

79
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,095
without well-planned deceit.

80
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:21,215
And my mother, for all her independence,
is still a Bene Gesserit-Adept.

81
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,495
Clouds.

82
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:53,335
Moisture in the air.

83
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:56,415
- It seems almost a sacrilege.
- You sound like a Fremen.

84
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:00,175
I haven't forgotten the years
I spent among them.

85
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:02,935
I haven't forgotten
the honesty of their ways.

86
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:06,575
At times I wish
I'd never learned them.

87
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:13,375
I hate this planet, Gurney.
It took both the men I loved.

88
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:17,415
And it's still a place
of great danger, milady.

89
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:22,375
Rumors of assassination plots
are too numerous to ignore.

90
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,215
Stilgar has sent word
that even Fremen may be involved.

91
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,575
Desert partisans who blame you...

92
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,615
for Paul's interference
in the ecology of this planet.

93
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,695
I'm so weary of rumors.

94
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:37,855
They are the lifeblood of this empire,
I'm afraid.

95
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:43,055
Reason enough this trip
should have been delayed.

96
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:08,095
This way!

97
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,295
The tigers track the robes flawlessly.

98
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,615
Our friend Palimbasha
has done his job well.

99
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:56,055
It appears your patience
is about to be rewarded, milady.

100
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,215
Yes. I've waited many years, Tyek...

101
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:02,255
for just the right moment
to finish the Atreides.

102
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,375
Patience has been my only nourishment.

103
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:10,375
Our allies on Arrakis
continue to instigate civil unrest.

104
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:14,095
Alia's hold on power
is beginning to slip.

105
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:19,375
And now we have the means
to deal with Muad'Dib's twins.

106
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,215
- I hope milady is satisfied.
- Oh, I won't be satisfied...

107
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:24,655
until every bastard Atreides
is crushed...

108
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:28,535
beneath the jackboots
of the Corrino Sardukar.

109
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:46,935
Like the desperate pacing of giant cats
in the zoos of ancient times.

110
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,895
I wouldn't know.

111
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,335
I'm not the scholar you are,
young prince.

112
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:53,695
Back and forth.

113
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:58,495
Back and forth until they made
themselves sick, just like this worm.

114
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,335
Just like my mother...

115
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,815
with her futile schemes
to regain power for the House Corrino.

116
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:09,935
Your mother is an ambitious woman,
my prince.

117
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,175
Her ambitions tend to be
undisturbed by reality, I'm afraid.

118
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:18,575
You don't share her desire to regain
your grandfather's throne for yourself?

119
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:22,335
Only a fool covets power without
appreciating its delicate uses...

120
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,255
or fearing its inherent perils.

121
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:29,975
The world of Shaddam the Fourth
remains only in crumbling history books.

122
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:34,055
We hate the empire that defeated it,
but have no idea what we'd like instead.

123
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,295
The kind of society we once had,
I assume.

124
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,575
My mother may believe that's possible,
Tyek, but I'm not so sure.

125
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,855
I'm just not so sure.

126
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,815
I heard about your little stunt
in the desert.

127
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,455
Well, I prefer to think of it
as expert flying, but carry on.

128
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,055
With your encouragement.

129
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,495
Our father's memories
are very instructive.

130
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:58,295
Well, I suppose I should be grateful
I don't have to tell your grandmother...

131
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,215
you were lost to a worm
before she was supposed to see you.

132
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:04,255
That would have been an unpleasant task,
wouldn't it?

133
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:07,175
It's rumored my mother has resumed
her allegiance to the Bene Gesserit...

134
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:10,575
and you both know what the Sisterhood
thinks of those of us who are pre-born.

135
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,895
And you want us to pretend
to be something we're not?

136
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:15,095
I expect you to protect yourselves.

137
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:19,135
No more talk of your father's memories
or his spirit or his animus.

138
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:21,775
Surely one can distinguish
between being pre-born-

139
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:23,455
And being possessed.

140
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,815
For some, that's a distinction without
a difference. For us, that's dangerous.

141
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,735
But what if she's coming as mother...

142
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,775
as grandmother,
and not as Bene Gesserit inquisitor?

143
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:34,615
You share her memories, Alia. Surely,
her motives can't be that complex.

144
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:39,815
If my mother wasn't that complex,
neither of you would be here.

145
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,655
She would never have
betrayed her training.

146
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,615
She never would have had a son.

147
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,255
I would have been her firstborn,
not your father.

148
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:53,695
And none of this
would have happened.

149
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:57,895
I warn you,
enemies often appear as angels.

150
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,175
I hope you two
can tell the difference.

151
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,975
We're going to lose her.

152
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,335
We already have.

153
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:29,575
You're nervous, aren't you?

154
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,575
Why should I be?

155
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:34,015
You haven't seen her for many years.

156
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:37,855
Your grandmother and I
had an unsettled relationship.

157
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:42,455
But you wanted her affection,
didn't you?

158
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:46,375
Affection wasn't possible
under the circumstances...

159
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,975
but I am due some respect
after all this time.

160
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,255
Stil, please.

161
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,775
When you first came here
many years ago...

162
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:07,735
Muad'Dib told me his father said...

163
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:11,095
" Beauty has finally arrived...

164
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,695
to hold back the wilderness. "

165
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:19,575
In his honor, may I borrow
your duke's words today.

166
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:22,855
Good friend.

167
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,855
The imperial regent, my lady.

168
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,215
It's been so long.

169
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,815
Of course, you recognize
your grandchildren...

170
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,935
even after all this time.

171
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:43,095
I hope we can find time
to shed formality...

172
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,895
and get to know each other again.

173
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,415
The mother of Muad'Dib
has returned to us.

174
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,975
You must offer them
your blessing, Grandmother.

175
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:04,415
I see the hypocrisy of ritual
still thrives.

176
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:07,055
Sometimes it is necessary
to accommodate ritual-

177
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,655
In order to survive it.

178
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,415
Mother!

179
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,695
Reverend Mother.

180
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,535
I bring you a warning.

181
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,015
The blessings of Muad'Dib
have been corrupted.

182
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,615
The religion of Muad'Dib
is not Muad'Dib.

183
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:10,015
He renounces it...
as he renounces you.

184
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,615
All of you!

185
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,655
Muad'Dib is dead!

186
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:26,575
And sand will cover this place.

187
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,615
Sand will cover you.

188
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,055
Take them alive! Alive!

189
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,015
Get out!

190
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,015
Jacarutu!

191
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:22,175
It's impossible to guard against every
madman willing to suicide himself.

192
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,095
We try to limit
Alia's public appearances.

193
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:26,015
Are we sure she was the target?

194
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:29,655
In these times, anyone in
the royal family could be vulnerable.

195
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:33,495
I seem to recall times not long ago
that were not so different.

196
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:38,335
- And we survived them.
- As we will survive them again.

197
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:42,095
I heard the voices in the crowd
calling out Muad'Dib.

198
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,735
We don't know where he's from
or what his motives are.

199
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,215
They say he calls himself
the Preacher.

200
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,575
The people think he's Paul,
don't they, Stil, this Preacher?

201
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:54,615
- Some do. Some need to.
- What do you think?

202
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:58,215
His kind are blown in from the desert
every day. Messianicvagabonds.

203
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:01,095
And Alia's priests tolerate such heresy?

204
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:03,815
Her priests would like to flay him alive
for the heresy he spews.

205
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:06,855
But she won't allow it.
"Oh," she says, "he's harmless. "

206
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:10,095
It's because she thinks
it might be true, isn't it?

207
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:21,055
Well, we hope you'll be comfortable.
Let us know if you need anything.

208
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:28,495
Paul's gone, my lady.
He walked into the desert.

209
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,895
Blind. Alone.

210
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,615
Shai Hulud came for him.

211
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,535
He is gone.

212
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:44,055
I want to supervise the interrogation
of those we found on the street.

213
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:46,855
I'd like Gurney to go with you,
if that's agreeable.

214
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:49,575
- It would be my honor, Stilgar.
- And my pleasure.

215
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,375
This was their room.

216
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:52,175
Alia kept it exactly as they did.

217
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:55,215
We used to play here
when we were little.

218
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:58,175
It made us feel close to them.

219
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:02,775
For a moment, you almost imagined
that's who we were.

220
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:05,175
Didn't you?

221
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:10,815
You almost let yourself believe
that we were... father and mother.

222
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:14,855
It was not an unpleasant moment.

223
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,375
I've missed so much.

224
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:27,775
You've never been far from us,
Grandmother.

225
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:31,215
Your presence is always strong
within us both.

226
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,655
I thought we agreed
to let her rest first.

227
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:44,095
Seeing my grandchildren
is all the rest I need.

228
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:47,095
And there will be time enough
for our reunion, Grandmother.

229
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:50,015
Now is the time
for you and your daughter.

230
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,335
- They're complicated.
- Yes. What did you expect?

231
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,295
They're Paul's children.

232
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,255
He would be proud.

233
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,415
You've done well.

234
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:15,735
You look...

235
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,695
wonderful.

236
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:19,815
I try my best.

237
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:22,055
My people expect it.

238
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:28,335
The greening of the desert is proceeding
faster than I ever imagined.

239
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:31,815
Paul used to say
the only permanence is change.

240
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:35,695
I wasn't prepared for how much
the desert's retreating.

241
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:38,815
Only the great mother wilderness
of the south remains untouched.

242
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:40,855
We still meet with some resistance.

243
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:42,695
As I've noticed.

244
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,215
Some of the older naibs
have withdrawn from our council...

245
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,615
and taken their tribes
to the far regions.

246
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,775
We're better off without them.

247
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:54,215
- Some remain to attack you directly.
- We know how to deal with our enemies.

248
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:59,935
It must be so hard, the responsibility.

249
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:04,535
The loneliness.

250
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:09,215
- What can you know of loneliness?
- I've had my share.

251
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:12,295
Is that why you're here then,
'cause you're lonely?

252
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,975
I came to see my grandchildren,
to see you.

253
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:19,175
Don't try to conceal anything
from me, Mother.

254
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:24,135
I can read truth in the slightest tick
of human behavior.

255
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,535
This was your gift to me, remember?

256
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:31,855
It's in my blood. In my blood before
I was even born, thanks to you.

257
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:33,255
Don't interrupt me.

258
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:36,695
I am the regent of this empire.
I rule in Paul's name for his children.

259
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:40,815
I am the supreme authority here.
You abandoned me...

260
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:44,575
to fend for myself after Paul died.

261
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:47,615
I was only 15, Mother.

262
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:51,975
You had Stilgar. You had Duncan.
You had the Council of Naibs.

263
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:54,975
No one could challenge you.

264
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:57,055
You knew how I felt about this place.

265
00:26:57,135 --> 00:27:01,415
And yet here you are,
after all these years, to judge me.

266
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,775
Just like that wicked
Bene Gesserit bitch who taught you.

267
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:07,735
- We were right to kill her.
- Abomination.

268
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,975
Abomination.
That's what she called me.

269
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:19,775
- Alia, I can't undo the past.
- But I can influence the future.

270
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:23,455
Paul taught me that well enough.
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

271
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:28,135
You're afraid I have Paul's vision,
his power.

272
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,535
No, my darling.

273
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:41,775
I am afraid that you will get lost
trying to achieve it.

274
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,495
I hate you.

275
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:51,055
I love you.

276
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:54,175
I will never forgive you.

277
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,695
Blasphemers!

278
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:36,015
Idolaters!

279
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,335
You fool yourselves...

280
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:43,615
with images of things
you cannot possibly understand.

281
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,095
You cripple yourselves
with these toads...

282
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:49,655
of ritual and ceremony.

283
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,295
They give you only fear.

284
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,735
And in return...

285
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:58,375
you give them obedience.

286
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,855
But I give you a warning.

287
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:09,255
Those who accept self-deception...

288
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:13,655
shall perish by that self-deception.

289
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,975
And those who pray for dew
at the desert's edge...

290
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:21,615
shall bring forth the deluge.

291
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:37,815
Milady.

292
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:42,895
Don't torture yourself.
He's mad.

293
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:47,255
He's a mere thunderclap in the night,
startling for a moment, then gone.

294
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,215
And if I asked you to kill him,
would you?

295
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,175
I wouldn't hesitate.

296
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:01,095
But I would advise against it.

297
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,615
I'd say it's not time
to move against the Preacher yet.

298
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:07,615
- Listen to him, darling.
- Let him gain some currency.

299
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:11,295
- He's so handsome, isn't he?
- Let our enemies rally to his ideas.

300
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:13,615
The man has flaws.

301
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:16,135
When the time is right,
they can be used to discredit him.

302
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,175
Just what the doctor ordered.

303
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:22,135
Better he is disgraced than martyred.

304
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:27,095
You're always good medicine
for my distress, Javid.

305
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:30,135
Whatever the cause
of that distress, milady.

306
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,655
Reverend Mother.

307
00:31:55,935 --> 00:32:00,535
- They told me I might find you here.
- I was afraid it might be gone.

308
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:05,135
Paul- Muad'Dib
would never have permitted that.

309
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,095
He said your promise
to the old housekeeper Mapes...

310
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,415
would never be broken.

311
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,615
It seems a little silly now though,
doesn't it?

312
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:19,175
Considering the changes
that are everywhere.

313
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:24,855
People don't come to visit like they
used to, but still, it remains a symbol.

314
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:29,775
Symbolism is everywhere these days,
just like these weeds.

315
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:36,895
I'm truly happy to see you, Irulan.

316
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:40,575
Your devotion to my grandchildren
has been a comfort to me.

317
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:43,295
They are the source of my happiness.

318
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,535
And your occasional
exasperation, I hear.

319
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:49,015
They are... strong-willed.

320
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:52,855
As I would have expected,
considering.

321
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:56,175
And what else did you expect,
Reverend Mother...

322
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:59,295
considering?

323
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:02,055
I am- was a Bene Gesserit...

324
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:04,215
trained just as you were.

325
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:08,695
I know the Sisterhood has never lost
interest in the children's bloodlines.

326
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:11,735
Although they would never confide
as much to a defector like me.

327
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,335
Isn't it ironic, Irulan?

328
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:18,135
We're both Bene Gesserits...

329
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:22,615
who've deserted our sisterhood
for the same reason-

330
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,255
love.

331
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,415
Love of men who are now dead.

332
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:31,655
I did love your son, Jessica.

333
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:34,815
And I would have made him a good wife.

334
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:38,655
Instead I have satisfied myself
being a good teacher to his children.

335
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,095
And friend.

336
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,935
Nothing-

337
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:48,655
Nothing will harm them as long as
I can prevent it. Do you understand?

338
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:01,975
I don't know.

339
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:05,095
Perhaps it would be better
if I never became emperor.

340
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,735
I'm being selfish, I know.

341
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,375
But I think it's necessary
for me and Ghanima...

342
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:18,095
to have the freedom
to learn to live with what we are.

343
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,535
And what are you, Leto...

344
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:24,175
that you need this time
to find out about yourself?

345
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:30,895
Why don't you tell me?
That's why you're here, isn't it?

346
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,335
You remind me of your father.

347
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,775
And my grandfather?

348
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,815
My namesake.
Your beloved duke.

349
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:48,575
Such an admission would be
complicated, wouldn't it?

350
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:52,255
We may have to enter a realm of
intimacies that would make us both...

351
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:54,855
uncomfortable.

352
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,375
In a way, I find it reassuring...

353
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:02,775
that he lives on in you.

354
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,495
How little you understand
how he lives on in me.

355
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:08,935
Is that what you're struggling with?

356
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,375
Yes.

357
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,655
To know the future is to be
trapped by it, Grandmother.

358
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:25,855
My father knew it,
but he couldn't escape it.

359
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,775
I want more freedom than that.

360
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:35,935
A universe of surprises.
That is what I pray for.

361
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:39,815
Is such a universe possible
for someone like you?

362
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:42,575
Possible? Yes.

363
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:45,335
But is it desirable?

364
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:51,375
I have a difficult decision to make,
Grandmother.

365
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:56,615
Do I accept the Atreides mystique?

366
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,655
Dress myself in our myths?

367
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:03,855
Live for my subjects
and die for them...

368
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:06,295
or do I chose another path?

369
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:09,535
A Golden Path.

370
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:13,015
One that may change me,
change human destiny forever?

371
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:15,335
I don't understand.

372
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:19,215
No, I know you don't because
you do not understand time.

373
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,295
I can help you.

374
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:25,295
On the contrary, Grandmother.

375
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:30,095
It is I who will help you.

376
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,735
We must work together.

377
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:58,175
- We?
- Otherwise we're vulnerable.

378
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,695
- To what?
- Oh, stop being coy.

379
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:05,055
If you want to know how coy he is,
try playing this game with him.

380
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:14,815
This is not a game! Powerful forces
are conspiring against us.

381
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:18,735
Fremen rebels hate the way I'm cha-
we are changing their planet.

382
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:22,215
The damn Spacing Guild
can't tolerate our monopoly on spice.

383
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:24,655
They have no choice
but to accept it, Alia.

384
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:29,615
And now she is here.
I want to know what she wants.

385
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:33,295
No, Alia. What you want is for us
to engage in the spice trance.

386
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:38,055
Don't turn your backs
on your heritage.

387
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,055
Your father was
the greatest man in history.

388
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:45,055
He gave you such wonderful talents
that could be put to such great use.

389
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:49,135
- Why won't you use them?
- You want us to see things you cannot.

390
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:52,055
I need you to help me see.

391
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:55,095
To see the future.

392
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:59,535
Other lives hover in the enigma
of our consciousness, Alia.

393
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,095
Shared lives.

394
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:10,455
It's the curse of all pre-born.

395
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,575
They are the real danger.

396
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:18,135
Not the rebels, not the Guild,
not our grandmother.

397
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:21,255
You should understand that
better than most.

398
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:26,615
One day...

399
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:28,615
each of you...

400
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:31,975
will come face to face
with the horror of your own existence.

401
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:35,775
One day you will cry out for help.

402
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:40,175
One day each of you
will find yourself...

403
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,495
alone.

404
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:54,615
What if she's right?

405
00:38:58,615 --> 00:38:59,775
Check.

406
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,895
Alia, come back. Alia.!

407
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:19,815
Stop it.
Alia, listen to me.

408
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:21,695
No. Listen to me, Alia.!

409
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:41,655
All of you, out.! Do as I say.!
Leave her alone.!

410
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:44,535
Get out of here.!
Leave her to me.!

411
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:47,735
So, Granddaughter...

412
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:52,095
you finally meet a spiritual gom jabbar.

413
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:58,415
We've learned much these past few days.

414
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,655
It was meant to look like rebel Fremen.

415
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:05,615
Tribes harboring resentment towards
the Atreides and changes to Arrakis.

416
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,695
- But I don't believe it.
- Why?

417
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:12,095
During interrogation,
the ones we captured...

418
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:17,735
cried out the name Jacarutu
and then... died.

419
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:22,015
- You tortured them?
- Post-hypnotic suicide compulsion.

420
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:25,855
The sound of the word alone
simply stopped their hearts.

421
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:29,815
Leto and I heard rumors of
Jacarutu Sietch when we first came here.

422
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:32,335
We could never find out
whether the place actually existed.

423
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:36,095
The name Jacarutu
is a synonym for evil, Jessica.

424
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:40,735
The Edwali tribe came from there.
They were water stealers.

425
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:45,135
The most heinous criminals
under Fremen law.

426
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:48,215
The first and greatest sin.

427
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:58,255
But the Fremen tribes banded together
to declare war on the Jacarutu.

428
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:06,575
The Edwali were slaughtered.

429
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:09,415
Their water spread upon the sands.

430
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:12,735
Jacarutu Sietch was declared taboo.

431
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:15,775
No Fremen was allowed to look for it.

432
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:19,775
But legend persists that
not all the Edwali were wiped out...

433
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:25,175
that some escaped to become known
as the Cast Out.

434
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:28,335
And you believe that these Cast Out...

435
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,135
might be responsible
for what happened the other day?

436
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:35,055
The possibility
makes my blood run cold.

437
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:40,495
If the Cast Out exist, they would
camouflage themselves as something else.

438
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:44,135
We would not permit them
to live if we knew.

439
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:48,815
Gurney, contact your old smuggler
allies, the ones in the deep desert.

440
00:41:48,895 --> 00:41:52,575
See what they know about Jacarutu...

441
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:55,615
and the Cast Out.

442
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:59,815
If such a people still exist,
they could be our greatest threat.

443
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:04,855
I had full consciousness
long before birth.

444
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:09,975
Knowledge of all the lives
that came before.

445
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:16,575
The genetic rivers
flowing in my veins.

446
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,615
Reverend Mothers.

447
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,415
The Atreides.

448
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:29,495
My entire heritage...

449
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:33,895
alive... in me.

450
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:37,935
Ever present.

451
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:45,655
I had no defense against
their invasion of my mind.

452
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:50,095
And so you are stalked by fear.

453
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:52,975
Fear.

454
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,455
Always fear...

455
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:58,935
of judgement.

456
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:03,535
The pre-born are possessed.

457
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,815
The abomination.

458
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,935
Bene Gesserit rubbish.

459
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:13,335
If you succumb to the fear,
it will defeat you.

460
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:17,295
The trial of abomination
ends in death.

461
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:22,255
But we won't let that happen, will we?

462
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:24,175
We? You're dead!

463
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,375
I killed you.

464
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:31,255
Yes, you clever little minx,
you killed me and yet...

465
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,735
here I am.

466
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:36,455
Go away. Just go away!

467
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:38,895
Oh, but you need help,
Granddaughter.

468
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:42,735
The others in here,
they want your entire consciousness.

469
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:46,695
They want to drive you out, but I only
want a tiny little corner for myself...

470
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:48,615
an occasional moment with your senses.

471
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:53,015
Yeah. An occasional taste.
An occasional touch.

472
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:55,175
Oh, no one need ever know.

473
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:58,695
No! You murdered my father.

474
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:01,535
You tried to destroy my family.
You would have killed Paul.

475
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:05,655
Oh, yes, yes. All that, yes.
Of course I would have killed you.

476
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:09,735
I mean, you and your brother stood
in my way, but that's old business.

477
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:14,855
You won. I am dead.
Thanks to you, my darling...

478
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:18,735
I have only a fragile existence,
a mere memory self within you.

479
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:22,855
You are alive,
and I am yours to command.

480
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:26,215
And how little I ask in return.

481
00:44:37,095 --> 00:44:38,615
Mine?

482
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:43,055
To command?

483
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,295
Oh, yes. Yours.
Yours, my precious girl.

484
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:49,855
Think of what we can
accomplish together.

485
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,055
Your power and my experience.

486
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:56,095
There will be nothing
standing in our way.

487
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:59,535
- The voices in my head?
- Will be silenced.

488
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:02,895
- My enemies?
- Will be destroyed.

489
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:06,655
No one will stand in the way
of our powers.

490
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:12,255
From this moment on,
the future... is ours.

491
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:41,495
It comes...
just like you summoned it.

492
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:43,975
No. It summoned me, Stil.

493
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:50,335
And may I ask why
we risked a sand-crossing...

494
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:55,455
- at night without bodyguards?
- Come, come, Stil.

495
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,855
How often do you ride
the sands anymore...

496
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:01,295
when you want, where you want...

497
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:05,735
calling a worm instead of riding
with a flock of thopters?

498
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:08,215
How often-

499
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:12,175
How often do you arm the thumper
and just go...

500
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:14,815
like the Fremen you used to be?

501
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,615
Used to be?

502
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:25,695
Do you know
in many corners of the universe...

503
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:29,935
this delicate thing...

504
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:33,295
is considered a wondrous beauty?

505
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,575
But here-

506
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:37,735
here it's a symbol...

507
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:40,415
a symbol of the corruption
infecting Arrakis...

508
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:44,135
that wouldn't exist but for the changes
we're enforcing on this place.

509
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,255
Changes inspired by your father.

510
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:51,695
Now that's the official Stilgar
speaking, the government Stilgar.

511
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,975
The Fremen Stilgar is still repulsed
at this alien life, isn't he?

512
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:03,335
- I have a serious problem, Stil.
- So I've gathered.

513
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:10,535
The problem with me
is the problem with this place.

514
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:14,135
My father, he-
he left so many things undone.

515
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:16,735
I don't understand.

516
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:23,215
A good ruler doesn't need to be
a prophet, Stil, not even god-like.

517
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:27,495
A good ruler has to be
sensitive to the ones he rules.

518
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:35,775
The ancient meaning of the Fremen word
"naib" is "servant of the sietch. "

519
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:42,695
When the owner dies,
the chrysknife dissolves, yes?

520
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,175
It is our legend.

521
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:49,775
Muad'Dib has dissolved,
but his chrysknife has not.

522
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:56,055
Stil, a new path must be taken...

523
00:47:56,095 --> 00:48:00,135
one that may require me
to demystify my own father.

524
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,375
To destroy his legacy.

525
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:09,295
These are not sentiments
I'd share with your aunt...

526
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:11,495
or her priests, young lord.

527
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:14,935
Beware Alia, Stil.

528
00:48:15,015 --> 00:48:17,295
She's no longer your friend.

529
00:48:18,935 --> 00:48:21,215
And, Stil...

530
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:23,335
you must promise
to protect Ghanima.

531
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:26,375
If anything should happen to me-
anything-

532
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:28,775
my sister will be your only hope.

533
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,335
You were in the desert.

534
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:53,775
Yes. I- I couldn't sleep.

535
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:56,175
I could have kept you company.

536
00:48:56,255 --> 00:49:00,495
You were sleeping.
I didn't want to disturb you.

537
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:04,015
You used to. All the time.

538
00:49:04,095 --> 00:49:08,055
We'd sneak out of the sietch together.
No one ever knew.

539
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,735
Sometimes we wouldn't
be back till dawn.

540
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:14,055
I had to talk to Stilgar.

541
00:49:14,135 --> 00:49:16,415
Oh. I see.

542
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:23,335
Ghanima, we may have to face
some of what's coming apart.

543
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:26,775
That doesn't mean
you have to face it alone.

544
00:49:38,895 --> 00:49:43,175
The Atreides man
named Gurney Halleck...

545
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:47,375
is being sent to the desert
to ask questions.

546
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:51,615
Sooner or later, he will encounter
someone who can be bought.

547
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:54,135
Then we must make sure
he buys the right answers.

548
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,095
What shall I do
with the blind fool, Father?

549
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:59,935
He can still be useful.

550
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:05,215
Take him into the desert
until we need his sermons again.

551
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:08,415
Out of chaos comes civil war.

552
00:50:08,495 --> 00:50:11,775
Fremen and Atreides
destroying each other.

553
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:15,775
The water of our enemies
will feed our revenge.

554
00:50:15,855 --> 00:50:19,575
Our suffering will be repaid
a thousandfold.

555
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:25,935
Jacarutu.

556
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:52,975
I should never have left here.

557
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,775
It was a cowardly thing to do.

558
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:58,815
You lost so much here.

559
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,655
I know it.
Leto knows it.

560
00:51:01,695 --> 00:51:04,775
Even Alia must know it, in a way.

561
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,135
It helps, doesn't it?

562
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,655
The Litany Against Fear.

563
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:18,935
You were thinking it, weren't you?

564
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,975
Fear is the mind killer.

565
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:40,735
Ghani, I've decided
I want you to know my fear.

566
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:44,135
Fear I've kept hidden too long.

567
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:47,215
I fear for those who are pre-born.

568
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:50,255
Just before we came to Arrakis
the first time...

569
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:54,255
I brought a Reverend Mother
to meet your father.

570
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:57,495
- He was just a boy.
- I remem-

571
00:51:57,535 --> 00:51:59,615
I've been told.

572
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:07,775
The Reverend Mother brought a nerve
induction box, tested Paul with it.

573
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:10,015
I was forbidden to interfere.

574
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:13,975
He might have died.

575
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:18,935
But he survived.

576
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:24,975
Of course, you remember this
in a way that I cannot.

577
00:52:28,175 --> 00:52:30,615
Then that's what your fear is.

578
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:35,135
The memories I've inherited.
The possibility of possession.

579
00:52:35,215 --> 00:52:37,935
The possibility of abomination.

580
00:52:43,295 --> 00:52:44,855
Not you.

581
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:47,735
I'm sure of that now.

582
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:50,175
But you're not sure about Leto.

583
00:52:50,255 --> 00:52:52,255
Is he strong enough, Ghani?

584
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,695
Leto? Can he survive
what's coming?

585
00:52:56,775 --> 00:53:00,415
- What is it that's coming?
- The Sacr-Nabai.

586
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,655
The Golden Path.

587
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:10,415
Leto used those words
when he and I were together.

588
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:14,095
He has visions...

589
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:16,895
of a pilgrimage
deep into the desert...

590
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:20,935
a journey to a faraway place...

591
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:23,815
where he sees our father...

592
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,255
and speaks to him
of how things must change.

593
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:30,695
Change?

594
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,495
How?

595
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,935
He can't tell me.

596
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:42,135
I think he's holding things
back from me.

597
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:46,495
But I know this: It's not possession,
and it is not abomination.

598
00:53:47,535 --> 00:53:50,655
And when it is my brother's turn
to be tested...

599
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:54,175
he too will survive...

600
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:57,055
just as our father did.

601
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:02,775
The man has arrived to take you
deeper into the desert.

602
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,655
He says he will help you find
what you're looking for.

603
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:15,135
So now it has been decided
We'll go into the desert.

604
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:21,535
So you are the Atreides man,
Gurney Halleck.

605
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:25,775
I don't like it.

606
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:29,415
Why would the Corrino family
send gifts to Muad'Dib's children?

607
00:54:29,495 --> 00:54:33,215
An attempt to curry favor with
the future emperor and his sister.

608
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:36,455
You don't believe that
any more than I do, Duncan.

609
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:40,815
Nothing is ever as it seems
with my sister.

610
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,775
Even an innocent gift of clothing
can be dangerous.

611
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:47,495
But how?

612
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:51,975
I want these examined thoroughly.

613
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:56,695
Report back to me before they're given
to the children. Is that understood?

614
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:05,495
I can feel your suspicion, Duncan.

615
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,815
You're wondering if there is
something more complex in my motives.

616
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:12,575
The history of what brought a Corrino
princess into House Atreides...

617
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:14,135
is not easily forgotten.

618
00:55:14,215 --> 00:55:17,175
Plans within plans,
is that it, mentat?

619
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:22,335
Do you doubt my allegiance
to this family?

620
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:26,015
Allegiances once changed
can change again.

621
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:51,855
Our sources in the palace assure me...

622
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,495
the robes were delivered.

623
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:56,215
The catalyst is well-hidden.

624
00:55:56,935 --> 00:55:59,575
Little, precious Irulan
will never find them.

625
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:01,855
Well done.

626
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:04,735
Alia's paranoia is growing
stronger day by day.

627
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,415
She sees enemies everywhere.

628
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:09,055
And her only solution-

629
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:10,775
more and more repression.

630
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:12,975
Exactly as we want.

631
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,055
The more terror we sow,
the more fear and confusion we harvest.

632
00:56:16,095 --> 00:56:18,015
The more severely Alia responds...

633
00:56:18,095 --> 00:56:20,695
the more Fremen
she drives into the south...

634
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,735
the sooner they will openly rebel.

635
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:25,415
And then with the twins
out of the way...

636
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:27,895
Alia will be more vulnerable than ever.

637
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:34,135
But we mustn't let Farad'n know
about our plans until they're done.

638
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,055
He doesn't have the stomach for it.

639
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:41,375
How dare you?

640
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:45,575
These robes are gifts from
Prince Farad'n. A gesture of goodwill.

641
00:56:45,655 --> 00:56:48,335
An opportunity to ease
tension between the houses.

642
00:56:48,415 --> 00:56:50,775
Javid arranged for this himself.

643
00:56:50,815 --> 00:56:53,015
With the regent's approval, of course.

644
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:55,015
I had to satisfy myself.

645
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:57,055
Satisfy yourself?

646
00:56:57,135 --> 00:57:00,215
That there was
no subterfuge, no danger.

647
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,375
You insinuated yourself
into a diplomatic matter...

648
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:04,575
that's none of your business.

649
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,975
The safety of the twins
is every bit my business.

650
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,655
You bloodless bitch.

651
00:57:09,415 --> 00:57:12,415
How is it that I'm blessed with such an
extraordinary counselor as you, Irulan?

652
00:57:13,615 --> 00:57:16,895
What devious finger of fate
turned you from a Corrino toad...

653
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,575
into a simpering Atreides
sycophant?

654
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:20,215
That's enough!

655
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:22,175
No, it's not nearly enough.

656
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:26,175
From now on, my niece and nephew
are no longer under your care.

657
00:57:26,255 --> 00:57:29,815
- You can't do that.
- I am the regent of the empire.

658
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,615
I'm their guardian.
I rule in their name.

659
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:36,975
That's right.
And don't let them forget it.

660
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:47,855
Perhaps you should rest.

661
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:51,815
How can I rest, Mother, when I'm
surrounded by such incompetent fools?

662
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:56,215
Do you see what's become
of my world, Mother?

663
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,415
Do you see the chaos I must endure?

664
00:57:59,135 --> 00:58:00,735
Yes, I see it.

665
00:58:02,735 --> 00:58:04,895
I'm afraid I see it all too clearly.

666
00:58:04,975 --> 00:58:07,495
- Get rid of them.
- Get out.

667
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:08,575
All of you, out.

668
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,175
Come.

669
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:35,135
Still the same arrogant
Bene Gesserit cow.

670
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,335
You must forgive my daughter, Irulan.

671
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:55,575
She let temper get in the way
of judgment this afternoon.

672
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,535
She let her words run away with her.

673
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:02,015
Do not concern yourself with me.

674
00:59:02,095 --> 00:59:04,415
I know what it's like to be in her place.

675
00:59:04,495 --> 00:59:07,575
I know how lonely it can be sometimes.

676
00:59:09,175 --> 00:59:10,535
I understand.

677
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:12,855
At the same time, you're never alone.

678
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:16,055
There are always people who need you.

679
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,575
Life in a court can be suffocating.

680
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,415
Easy to lose your perspective.

681
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:24,095
I'm glad we can be honest.

682
00:59:24,175 --> 00:59:25,935
I feel that I can trust you.

683
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:29,815
My only concern is for their safety.

684
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:33,535
Take care of your own well-being.

685
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:37,175
Thank you for your concern.

686
00:59:37,215 --> 00:59:39,615
You're very important to me.

687
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:44,775
I will letAlia know that I bear no ill
feelings because of her harsh words.

688
00:59:44,855 --> 00:59:47,935
You're very understanding.

689
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:44,215
There they are. Those two.

690
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,255
Can you see them?

691
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:53,095
We have a shuttle waiting.

692
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:04,255
Leto, come.

693
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:12,455
Hurry.

694
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:19,055
Anybody who had a hand in helping
the twins get out of the city...

695
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:21,495
must be arrested and brought to me.

696
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,175
I will make an example
of all who defy me.

697
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:25,855
Get out!

698
01:01:35,855 --> 01:01:38,055
This is my mother's doing.

699
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:39,935
I want her dead.

700
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:43,775
- Now.
- No, my dear. Not just yet.

701
01:01:43,855 --> 01:01:47,655
Patience, my dear.
Patience and calm.

702
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:51,735
That is the palliative
for fury and despair.

703
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:53,735
Everyone is turning against me.

704
01:01:53,815 --> 01:01:56,455
Oh, don't worry, child.

705
01:01:56,535 --> 01:02:01,855
There are many clever ways to rid
oneself of a troublesome witch.

706
01:02:03,215 --> 01:02:06,175
Your efforts to the contrary, I suppose.

707
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,895
Well, unfortunately, my efforts
were, shall we say, interrupted...

708
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:15,135
by a wonderfully devious
and cruel little girl.

709
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:17,935
You took great pleasure
in the act, as I recall.

710
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:19,895
I had to admire your ruthlessness.

711
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:21,775
Had you only been a few years older-

712
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:24,855
Why am I even listening to you,
you perverted old fool?

713
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:29,695
Because I am here to help you.
Because I'm the only one you can trust.

714
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,615
What you must do
is take care of your mother in public.

715
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,695
Why don't you call in that lovely boy?

716
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,455
The priest.

717
01:02:41,535 --> 01:02:43,095
Javid, eh?

718
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:46,615
Mix business with pleasure perhaps?

719
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,335
You were right, Muriz.

720
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:07,455
Her paranoia deepens
with each passing hour.

721
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:11,375
- She's ordered immediate retaliation.
- Good.

722
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:15,255
The more the repression,
the greater the rebellion.

723
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:17,815
The greater the rebellion...

724
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:20,615
the sooner our enemies
slaughter each other.

725
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:23,975
Get word to that Corrino witch.

726
01:03:24,055 --> 01:03:27,015
Tell her we continue
to work our mischief.

727
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:56,095
Even though she's not
of council any longer...

728
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:58,735
I have asked Lady Jessica...

729
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:00,775
adored mother of Muad'Dib...

730
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:04,615
to join us for the ritual
of supplication.

731
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:11,855
We bring before the holy family
a Kedeshian troubadour...

732
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,375
a miserable wanderer...

733
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:15,815
who has lost everything
but the clothes on his back...

734
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,415
and now must beg the court for-

735
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:20,575
Mercy, Holy Mother.

736
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:27,575
I am Gadian Al-Fali...

737
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,295
naib of Sietch Gara Kulan.

738
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:33,215
My ladies, do not listen to this man.
His appeal is not approved.

739
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:36,295
I am here concerning
a matter of the desert.

740
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:42,015
A matter of the desert is a concern
of great magnitude, Fedaykin.

741
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:48,295
But, Reverend Mother-

742
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:59,735
Yes, milady.
I am Fedaykin.

743
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:02,175
Once offering his life
at the side of Muad'Dib.

744
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:04,375
This is not the proper forum for-

745
01:05:04,455 --> 01:05:07,575
We will hear this matter of the desert.

746
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:17,695
We have abandoned our friend
the desert, Holy Mother.

747
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:20,495
Shai Hulud no longer roams the sands.

748
01:05:20,575 --> 01:05:23,775
He cannot be found except in the empty
quarters, far from our people.

749
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:26,335
The superstitious of the inner desert...

750
01:05:26,415 --> 01:05:29,095
have always feared
the transformation of our land.

751
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,695
A land where nothing grew.

752
01:05:31,775 --> 01:05:33,455
Now there are plants.

753
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:36,535
They spread like maggots
upon the wound.

754
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,855
There are clouds in the sky...

755
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,535
and rain.

756
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:44,375
Precious mother of Muad'Dib,
rain from the sky of Dune.

757
01:05:44,455 --> 01:05:46,055
It is a death to us all.

758
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:50,535
We only do what Liet
and Muad'Dib intended us to do.

759
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:53,295
Would you challenge their holy words?

760
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,815
And what of the worms then?

761
01:05:56,895 --> 01:06:00,415
There will always be some desert,
some worms.

762
01:06:01,655 --> 01:06:04,455
As go the worms,
so goes the spice.

763
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:07,655
And if the spice does not flow,
what coin do we have to buy our way?

764
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,055
Silence!

765
01:06:09,135 --> 01:06:11,535
These are matters of state.

766
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:14,175
And you will not challenge
the wisdom of this government...

767
01:06:14,255 --> 01:06:16,055
to do what it decides is best.

768
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:20,215
The rabble of the desert must be
made to comply with our judgment.

769
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:22,335
It is we who rule here...

770
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:24,015
not the mob of the sands.

771
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:44,615
There are those of you who fear I have
returned to Arrakis as a Bene Gesserit.

772
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:52,375
That I have abandoned my loyalty to the
Atreides partnership with the desert.

773
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,175
But since the day the Fremen...

774
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:03,255
gave life to me and to my son...

775
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:07,735
I have always been Fremen.

776
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:12,175
And I will always be Fremen.

777
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,935
Be quiet!

778
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:18,295
We cannot abandon the desert.

779
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:21,055
My daughter is lying.

780
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:24,735
The worms will not survive
if the desert shrinks.

781
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:26,775
She knows this.

782
01:07:26,855 --> 01:07:29,055
Spice production will slow...

783
01:07:29,095 --> 01:07:31,895
until it is only a fraction
of what it has been.

784
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,495
And when that happens-

785
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:38,975
We'll have a corner on the scarcest
commodity in the universe.

786
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,975
You will have a corner in hell.

787
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:55,815
Fedaykin, we who have been scorched
know how to stand back to back.

788
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:57,895
I have men here, milady.

789
01:08:14,495 --> 01:08:16,615
When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...

790
01:08:16,695 --> 01:08:18,535
the whirlwind follows.

791
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:23,575
The Golden Path.
It's up to you now.

792
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:27,695
The desert storm
that can't be stopped.

793
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:30,775
The whirlwind.

794
01:08:30,855 --> 01:08:34,055
Leto, don't.

795
01:08:34,815 --> 01:08:36,735
The Golden Path is dangerous.

796
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,575
The path I couldn't take.

797
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,815
You were having
another vision, weren't you?

798
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:08,055
Events are moving faster
than we anticipated, Ghani.

799
01:09:09,095 --> 01:09:10,775
We have to go now.

800
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,815
To Jacarutu?

801
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:15,455
The answer is there. I know it.

802
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:20,855
We can't turn back.
We have to finish this.

803
01:09:20,935 --> 01:09:23,495
Muad'Dib, the god,
must be destroyed.

804
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:25,775
We must find the Golden Path.

805
01:09:25,855 --> 01:09:28,095
It's a dangerous path.

806
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:30,015
It's the only way out of the trap.

807
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:33,935
He saw it at the end.

808
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:36,455
Father's last vision.
He knew it was possible.

809
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:41,015
Don't you see?
That's why he left.

810
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,655
He left it to us.

811
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:44,935
You're not telling me
everything, are you?

812
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:47,775
There are things you've seen
that you keep from me.

813
01:09:47,815 --> 01:09:49,415
I can tell.

814
01:09:53,095 --> 01:09:56,055
Only things that
I don't even understand...

815
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,055
yet.

816
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,375
But I have faith, Ghani.

817
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:04,415
Faith that no matter what happens,
when the time comes...

818
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,455
we will both know what to do.

819
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:10,775
Are you sure we can make it?

820
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:16,135
I'm sure that if we don't try,
we'll have failed.

821
01:10:24,455 --> 01:10:26,055
I'm afraid.

822
01:10:28,935 --> 01:10:31,415
Fear is the mind killer.

823
01:10:31,495 --> 01:10:35,055
- I will face my fear.
- I will let it pass through me.

824
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,935
We are ready for tonight.

825
01:10:56,735 --> 01:11:00,335
-Have you seen that one?
-The one who's gone over to our enemies?

826
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:02,735
Without doubt. Palimbasha.

827
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,295
I saw him in the bazaar
atArakeen with the tigers.

828
01:11:07,695 --> 01:11:09,295
No doubt he has his part to play.

829
01:11:12,775 --> 01:11:13,735
You ready?

830
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:34,015
I find it ironic that we're using gifts
from our enemies as means of escape.

831
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:36,895
But you're enjoying
the charade anyway, aren't you?

832
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:38,575
- You know me too well.
- Yeah, too well.

833
01:11:38,655 --> 01:11:41,095
Which is why you must promise me
we'll only be as reckless as necessary.

834
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:42,615
Only as necessary.

835
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:01,335
It won't be long
before the alarm goes out.

836
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:04,615
There. The way to Jacarutu.

837
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,615
They'll never think
we've gone in that direction.

838
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:32,255
We can rest here until arrangements
are made to get you out of the city.

839
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,975
Unless something is done...

840
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,935
civil war is inevitable.

841
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,895
We must get a message to Stilgar.

842
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:59,175
He must call for a council of naibs.

843
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:03,215
We must bring a trial
of possession againstAlia.

844
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,055
You know what that will mean,
Reverend Mother.

845
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:10,615
She is your daughter.

846
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:15,095
I know what it means.

847
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:19,255
An official warrant
for the arrest of Fedaykin Al-Fali...

848
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:21,695
and his confederates
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

849
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:25,735
Post it in every city.
Send word to every sietch.

850
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,815
The conspiracy to murder
the imperial regent...

851
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:31,935
and kidnap the mother of Muad'Dib
must be crushed without mercy.

852
01:13:51,855 --> 01:13:54,815
Are you looking at me
or analyzing me, Duncan?

853
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:56,775
I'm gathering data.

854
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:58,455
You must find her, Duncan.

855
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:02,615
You must find her and return her to me.

856
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,975
Surely your data must
point to the danger I'm in.

857
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:10,495
We are in.

858
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:14,935
Perhaps your lover would be
a better comfort to you than I.

859
01:14:19,215 --> 01:14:22,175
I've made so many mistakes,
Duncan. So many mistakes.

860
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:24,695
Because I've been afraid.

861
01:14:24,735 --> 01:14:27,495
I'm ashamed of my weakness.

862
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:30,335
Please try to forgive me.

863
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,615
I lost my temper in there, Duncan.

864
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:35,935
I know it was a mistake,
but I can fix it.

865
01:14:36,895 --> 01:14:38,655
It was an accident
of fatigue, nothing else.

866
01:14:38,735 --> 01:14:40,735
I can make everyone understand.

867
01:14:40,815 --> 01:14:42,415
Everyone except her.

868
01:14:43,095 --> 01:14:45,455
You have to deal with her.

869
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,415
She is your mother.

870
01:14:48,495 --> 01:14:51,015
She is Bene Gesserit
no matter what she said in there.

871
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:54,135
And those damnable hags would like
nothing more than to put me to the test.

872
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,095
Please, Duncan.

873
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:57,775
Please.

874
01:14:57,855 --> 01:14:59,415
You're the only one I can trust.

875
01:15:00,415 --> 01:15:02,535
You're the only one
who loves me enough.

876
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:07,775
You must eliminate her.

877
01:15:09,535 --> 01:15:11,655
No harm must come
to House Atreides.

878
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:16,135
No matter what the cost.

879
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:38,615
You handled that well.

880
01:15:38,655 --> 01:15:40,255
Shut up.

881
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,615
As you wish, milady.

882
01:15:56,455 --> 01:15:59,615
We found their clothing
near the bakery, Stilgar.

883
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:01,735
We're certain they're
no longer in the sietch.

884
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:04,375
They must be wearing those robes
they brought from Arakeen.

885
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:07,775
But our search parties can't find
a single trace of them in the desert.

886
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:11,215
They won't. Not unless
the children want them to.

887
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:34,935
They do not appreciate
my presence here.

888
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:37,015
These are puritans,
Reverend Mother.

889
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,655
What they do not like
is what's become of their revolution.

890
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:42,735
Then I must convince them
that neither do I.

891
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:47,455
A messenger has arrived under
immunity of Stilgar. It is urgent.

892
01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:57,735
You have a message
from Sietch Tabr.

893
01:17:00,255 --> 01:17:02,055
Fali, hold!

894
01:17:04,175 --> 01:17:06,295
Your grandchildren are missing.

895
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,575
I'm to bring you to Sietch Tabr
as soon as possible.

896
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:10,735
You can't go with him, Holy Mother.

897
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:13,135
He is a ghola.

898
01:17:13,215 --> 01:17:15,895
He was my duke's most trusted warrior.

899
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:19,015
He died once, saving Muad'Dib's life...

900
01:17:19,095 --> 01:17:20,415
and mine.

901
01:17:20,495 --> 01:17:23,815
But he is Alia's husband.

902
01:17:23,895 --> 01:17:27,135
He is still Atreides.

903
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,495
It is my daughter who is not.

904
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,895
We don't have much time.

905
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:37,335
What about these Fedaykin
who have helped me?

906
01:17:37,415 --> 01:17:39,095
Alia has issued a warrant against them.

907
01:17:39,175 --> 01:17:41,535
- Crimes against the Imperium.
- Of course she has.

908
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:44,695
Stilgar has offered sanctuary
if they can make it to Tabr.

909
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:46,375
Then that is what you will do.

910
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:48,815
When the imperial agents
find this place...

911
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:51,575
there must be nothing left but
the wind howling through the rocks.

912
01:17:51,615 --> 01:17:53,295
As the Holy Mother commands.

913
01:17:57,615 --> 01:18:00,695
May Shai Hulud
clear the path before you.

914
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,015
Is it true about
my grandchildren, Duncan?

915
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:15,975
You would not have come
if you didn't believe it, milady.

916
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:25,975
Stilgar suspects they may have
seen this crisis coming.

917
01:18:26,015 --> 01:18:27,935
He fears they've gone
into the desert.

918
01:18:31,335 --> 01:18:33,775
I made many mistakes
with my daughter, Duncan.

919
01:18:35,735 --> 01:18:38,615
There have been many mistakes, milady.

920
01:18:38,655 --> 01:18:40,255
And I repeated most of them.

921
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,935
She will not survive
the trial of abomination.

922
01:19:00,855 --> 01:19:03,735
This is not the course
for the Sietch Tabr, is it?

923
01:19:03,775 --> 01:19:05,375
No, milady, it is not.

924
01:19:08,855 --> 01:19:11,615
Are you going to tell me
where you're taking me?

925
01:19:11,695 --> 01:19:15,655
Somewhere even Alia
won't think to look for us.

926
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:27,775
I don't think they saw us.

927
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:30,175
I don't think they were looking for us.

928
01:19:30,215 --> 01:19:31,815
We don't have much time.

929
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:44,316
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

930
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:03,575
We have to make
those rocks before sunset.

931
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:06,455
Search parties will be certain
to come out this far now.

932
01:20:11,095 --> 01:20:13,815
- That's not a worm.
- But an animal.

933
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:15,815
More than one.

934
01:20:39,575 --> 01:20:41,295
It's closer now.

935
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:43,255
Much closer.

936
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:14,575
Move!

937
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:48,735
- There's a cave up there.
- Run.

938
01:21:56,095 --> 01:21:57,455
Get in!

939
01:22:13,815 --> 01:22:17,455
The saga of Dune is far from over.

1
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,324
This is how it started.

2
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:25,642
During one of my most tranquil summers.

3
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,605
Tonight, I feel

4
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:32,488
half asleep in some sort of sweet reverie,

5
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:39,130
still very uncommon though,
because my brain seems to be

6
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:44,464
completely submerged in a kind of
half-sickening melancholy.

7
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,867
I can't tell if it's the moonlight
or the dawn,

8
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,504
but in my mind everything is blurred

9
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:59,366
and an irresistible laziness
pushes me up slowly towards my studio.

10
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,355
I think I'll be going to sleep very early.

11
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,716
Then suddenly at the door's entrance,

12
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:15,034
I see my everyday objects.

13
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,527
And all of a sudden I see a little postcard,

14
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:23,621
one of my adolescent obesessions.

15
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:37,325
Why not find in there something demonic;

16
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:41,494
if I could manage to tranform it,

17
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,778
so that this dying moonlight

18
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:48,162
could become one of the most violent images

19
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,528
my paranoid brain could
ever possibly provoke.

20
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:59,764
The bells are always a bad omen
where I live.

21
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,969
I decide to set

22
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:09,480
the postcard, enlarged,
at the far end of a chapel,

23
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:14,446
it will be some sort of unusual exorcism.

24
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:22,176
In summary: the moon,
the tip of the nose,

25
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,895
to the left the shaggy moustache,

26
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:31,204
constant tragedy of the human face

27
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,217
and the boat, the little boat

28
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:34,993
but of course

29
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:37,640
it could only be the contour of the nose.

30
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:30,315
Yes, yes and yes, fix your eyes,

31
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,749
spread your eyes wide
before this limpid water

32
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,022
and suddenly from this tranquility,

33
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:42,245
arises the fierce face,

34
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,934
nietzschean,

35
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:48,315
catastrophic,

36
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:51,218
which always preceeds

37
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:55,806
the most calm idyllic moments...

38
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,784
One, two, three, four, five!

39
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:02,156
Hitler will arise...

40
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:06,664
See the cruel mouth of Hitler!

41
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:22,101
See the eyes,

42
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:25,630
especially his right eye,

43
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,518
this kind of abominable tear,

44
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:37,365
personified by the ridiculous
petit pierrot

45
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:42,063
who strolls along the quays

46
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:47,131
imbued with the grievous ideologies

47
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,612
of Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

48
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:53,042
who has caused the misfortunes
of all revolutions

49
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:37,229
Teatro Museo Dalí
presents

50
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:47,915
Impressions of Upper Mongolia

51
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:58,580
Hommage to Raymond Roussel

52
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,153
A film by Salvador Dalí

53
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:36,977
Directed by José Montes Baquer

54
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:48,667
And now

55
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:53,682
we turn to the tranquility,
this time it is classic

56
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,265
rather than romantic;

57
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:59,119
the classic tranquility of the studio

58
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:04,239
where I am painting, patiently

59
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,911
and stereoscopically

60
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:11,236
the portrait of Gala and myself.

61
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:20,208
It is precisely in this supreme and immutable
tranquility of the Port Lligat

62
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,682
that as a way to reward

63
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:26,783
- REWARD, REWARD! -

64
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:30,733
Gala for her love and patience,

65
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,733
I decided to send

66
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:38,784
a team of explorers,

67
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,554
to illustrate, to rightfully
recompense her,

68
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,575
so she could see the land

69
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:49,594
we had so greatly desired,
of Upper Mongolia,

70
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:58,822
where my explorers will go
to seek out the pure white mushroom,

71
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:02,025
the hallucinogenic mushroom

72
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:07,889
which posseses all the geological virtues,

73
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:16,303
for geology is in itself
a total LSD trip.

74
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,570
Enter the museum,
enter the Dali theater-museum,

75
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:11,401
this consists of entering
through the printed circuit boards,

76
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:16,759
that is to say, the circuits
printed in gold

77
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:21,070
of the most intimate interior

78
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,956
of the brain of Salvador Dalí.

79
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,791
In Vermeer, the backgrounds
are always

80
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:22,620
mysterious maps

81
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,990
and it turns out to be
a Dalinian Paradox

82
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,186
to see in these Vermeers,

83
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,703
the two essential elements:

84
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,423
the letter, set against itself
from very far

85
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:38,433
explaining some sort of
unbelievable fairytale

86
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:42,123
and behind it,
the geographical possibility,

87
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,344
the fetishistic verification
of the possibilty to go there.

88
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,181
It is more precisely,
through a letter

89
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:07,155
that I learned about the existence
of a hallucinogenic civilisation

90
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:11,723
in Occidental Upper Mongolia

91
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:15,296
and it is exactly in this map,

92
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,201
mysterious, surely,

93
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:26,387
that we discovered the existence
of this strange geographical sector

94
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:32,764
where the famous white mushrooms exist,

95
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:33,894
soft,

96
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,789
hallucinogenic:

97
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:44,626
champlinclis histratatus
domus biancus.

98
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,356
Behold the great soft mushroom;

99
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,758
now it is moving

100
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:53,738
because we have filmed
in an accelerated manner.

101
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:59,800
I think we will soon see the island

102
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:09,237
which is the protagonist of the birth
of this strange mushroom

103
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:14,076
which has given birth
to a whole oneiric civilisation.

104
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,093
There we are.

105
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,174
Now we see the tip of the island,

106
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,073
a piece of the island,

107
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,646
and then, another which is
much more limpid and blue

108
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:34,988
and the island itself
is already disquieting.

109
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:39,028
Now I see some sort of vegetation

110
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:44,229
which seem like warriors
busy devouring one another

111
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:48,661
and which ressemble very much
prehistoric sketches

112
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,696
describing battles.

113
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,968
The "morros de cony",

114
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,867
this mimetic insect

115
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:08,254
which grows, precisely in this mushroom,

116
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,594
which could have very well been ripe,
but is all moldy.

117
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:14,948
These insects carry on their backs

118
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:20,329
the eggs which contain all the
hallucinogenic products

119
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,767
which are themselves
pentagonal or hexagonal.

120
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:42,474
It is LSD without the LSD

121
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,685
and instead of producing
concrete images,

122
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,986
celestial images;

123
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:54,459
as the angels of Elche descended
from his famous aracoelli,

124
00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:00,745
I conceived the celestial cupola
of Emille Piñeiro.

125
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,232
Once again

126
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:08,433
the obsession over these eggs

127
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:12,714
found by my explorers in Mongolia,

128
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:21,172
which crystallize, by way of a
paranoiac-critical prophecy,

129
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:26,734
crystallize in the cupola,

130
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:30,624
that will for the same price immortalize

131
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:34,739
our great architect Emilio Piñeiro

132
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,805
and it is nothing other
than the geodesic cupola

133
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:43,726
terrifying with its beauty,

134
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:46,530
apotheosic,

135
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,746
once again,

136
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:54,083
we can say, in an absolutely
categorical manner,

137
00:18:54,203 --> 00:19:00,617
folklore cuckolded by the universality

138
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:04,687
of the expedition to Upper Mongolia.

139
00:19:57,318 --> 00:20:01,298
Just as I was saying,
hypocritcally and precisely,

140
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:05,413
this oriental screen,
which is very beautiful but banal,

141
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:09,113
so there is no contrast with the other,

142
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:14,088
dates from the dynasty
of the hallucinogenic princess.

143
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,550
If the first document would arrive,

144
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,615
a wonderful portrait,
a precious box.

145
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:35,575
They seem to be true printed circuits
containing the egg

146
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:39,615
which grows within the great soft mushroom.

147
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:49,203
The great Mongol

148
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:55,218
is holding the flower
which preceeds this mushroom

149
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:57,705
and in his hand

150
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:00,159
is the precious box,
which we can barely see,

151
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,637
but which we have just appraised
for all its worth.

152
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,074
An instant...

153
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,411
one of the chairs - which is not a chair,
but really a throne,

154
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:16,124
the throne of the princess,

155
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:20,185
who is responsible for this
hallucinatory dynasty.

156
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,537
Warriors,

157
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:46,217
which seem to be warriors
but are the vegetation moving in the rain.

158
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:08,921
The famous mummy of the princess.

159
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:15,162
She is covered in six million
little plates of jade,

160
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:19,818
each of these plates contain
miniature letters

161
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:25,019
which reveal the secret of this dynasty,

162
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,642
the most mysterious of all;

163
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:30,672
each of these plates have been analyzed

164
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,565
and we discovered that

165
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,959
many of these plates contain the screen

166
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,685
which we will see integrated
in the film of our expedition.

167
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:50,596
As a result, during my visit to Cadaques

168
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:53,671
and in the intimacy of my work,

169
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:58,230
typical, archetypical
of Vermeer of Delft,

170
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:03,585
the explorers were searching

171
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:10,258
for the fabulous hallucinogenic
white mushroom

172
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:14,358
which they brought to me
from Upper Mongolia,

173
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,090
this mushroom, did nothing other than

174
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:24,561
truly, inescapably determine

175
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:29,011
all the styles of the Dalí Museum
in Figueres

176
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,441
and the proof is that this ceiling,

177
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:36,883
which was intended to be
the Palais del'Empordà

178
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:41,677
that is to say, an almost
folkloristic ceiling,

179
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,195
becomes universal

180
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:48,506
because it will be,
ultimately,

181
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,169
a premonition

182
00:23:52,945 --> 00:24:00,272
of the hyperesthetic,
hallucinogenic images

183
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:08,775
of my illustrious, minimal,
little ballpoint pen.

184
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:13,919
Open up your eyes,

185
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,853
because all that you are about to see

186
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:24,502
is the work the of paranoiac-
critical interpretation

187
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:31,376
of the brain of your modest
and proud servant.

188
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,421
Immediately after

189
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,174
the appearance of these strange capsules

190
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:26,431
which contain so many mysterious things;

191
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,863
we can see the lift-off,
the shadow of lift-off

192
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:37,014
of the planes; one of them transports
the photographic material,

193
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:41,536
the other, all the gathered information

194
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:48,601
this other carries scientists
and geologists.

195
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,445
The aurora.

196
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:06,104
We are surprised by the beauty of colors

197
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:11,194
which seem like a multitude
of gems and precious stones.

198
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:16,576
Below is a city with electric lights

199
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:19,154
for this place has already been modernized.

200
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:35,238
On the horizon, radars,

201
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:37,830
an unknown city,

202
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,030
we have passed it quickly

203
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,740
because this flight is almost clandestine

204
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:47,641
and everyone is asking themselves

205
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:52,425
when we will see the first
regions of the island.

206
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,065
Here now is the island.

207
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:59,719
It is on this island that the
mushrooms are born,

208
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,609
the mushrooms which are the
object of our expedition.

209
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,421
Here now is the sea,

210
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,644
or rather a lake...

211
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,712
one of the most important lakes.

212
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:23,738
It is full of vegetation;

213
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:26,272
our contraption is approaching

214
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:31,829
and we see one of these strange lands,
which is composed of white spots,

215
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,919
which are like fleas;

216
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:37,813
you can see what seems to be
little grains of penicillin,

217
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,125
of white mold,

218
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:45,594
those are gigantic mushrooms

219
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:52,625
and these mushrooms need six years to form.

220
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:55,700
The largest one found was eighteen meters,

221
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,723
this one,

222
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:59,679
eighteen meters high

223
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,541
and with the sole subtance of this mushroom,
reduced to powder

224
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:10,232
a whole civilisation of Upper Mongolia
was completely stupefied.

225
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:13,462
For these people could no longer distinguish

226
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:16,189
reality from their visions.

227
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:31,737
From time to time we have
this extraordinary thing

228
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:36,184
between the rocks,
ultramarine water,

229
00:29:36,304 --> 00:29:39,786
pure with profundity,

230
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,119
where

231
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,587
the fish has just been brought to us.

232
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:46,455
The other island, the second island

233
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:47,700
much smaller,

234
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,523
but it seems that this island
is completely sterile,

235
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:53,483
there are no more mushrooms.

236
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:56,318
Nevertheless, in the background,

237
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:59,296
white spots persist

238
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,942
because it is as if this landscape
were granulated,

239
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:10,803
garnished with possibilities
of pagodas.

240
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:11,890
And here they are.

241
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,395
This is the land

242
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:17,439
where we discovered
little constructions,

243
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,611
the reddish thing is a temple,

244
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:24,767
above, it is all red

245
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:27,677
because the mountains are full of shrubs

246
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:31,205
which at sunset truly seem to be fire.

247
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,311
The cliffs,

248
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,640
these cliffs are sandy

249
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,225
and it is possible that
the sand of these cliffs

250
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:45,741
is nothing but the finest powder

251
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:49,610
from thousands of gigantic mushrooms.

252
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,653
We live in a place

253
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:57,693
which is pulverised with substances,

254
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:01,783
a thousand times more powerful
than LSD and which

255
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:07,224
the caravans of the desert come to find

256
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:12,631
with the most painful and rudimentary
means, on the back of camels

257
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:17,445
and here I requested that the
photograph be amplified

258
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:23,932
because I would like to see the type of
people who are mounted on the camels.

259
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,229
Now we can see the caravan,

260
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:54,611
moving towards the place
where the grand princess can be found

261
00:31:54,731 --> 00:32:00,203
and who is now reduced to the most luxurious
and refined mummy that exists in this world.

262
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:04,670
We now see a kind of landscape which
we could almost say is from Cadaqués,

263
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,264
little rustic houses,

264
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:11,173
I see cypress, in the center
the Great Mongol

265
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:14,702
who holds in one hand
the precious chest,

266
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:17,576
a very pointed hat,

267
00:32:17,696 --> 00:32:22,230
and in the other hand
a flower that blossoms

268
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:29,969
every six years at the top of the
hallucinogenic mushroom.

269
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:45,045
Here now, one of the protagonists
of the film,

270
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,403
now we see the Great Mongol.

271
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:50,509
He is even carrying, I can see,
a lace frill,

272
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:53,724
we see the box,
we see his gesture,

273
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:58,045
he is the criminal responsible
for this civilization

274
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:02,427
for these people burst with the satisfaction

275
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,276
of the excess of images,

276
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,150
for their brains weren't able to endure it

277
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,249
and produced this extraordinary shock,

278
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,095
this catastrophy which we will soon see,

279
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:20,241
a kind of apocalypse of rocks

280
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:25,293
and stones to be analysed.

281
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:14,157
Here begins a screen,

282
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:19,574
produced by the brains of people
who were completely drugged

283
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:24,668
by the soft, white mushroom
from before.

284
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:37,421
You can see that the sky
is covered by kinds of objects,

285
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,657
pieces, fragments of falling geology,

286
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:45,987
but what is truly important here
is the center.

287
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:52,219
The great tamer who carries
a horizontal bar

288
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:59,159
and who is, like Orpheus, directing
the chaos we are seeing:

289
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,261
beings made of stones, animals

290
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:12,562
with several scattered limbs,
shredded by the preciosity of their matter.

291
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:25,991
At the very center is the mummy.

292
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:29,491
The head of the mummy,
when she was alive.

293
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,763
There is a kind of mad warrior

294
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:37,437
who is in the middle of battling another
who is falling with a decapitated head

295
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:43,064
while before the horizon,
at every corner,

296
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:50,071
floats this kind of cataclysm we are seeing.

297
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:12,407
Look, as always, at the serenity
of this face

298
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:19,516
in combination with the total indifference
of the Great Mongol.

299
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:00,432
Now this is simply

300
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,677
the most interesting part of the film,

301
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:06,297
they are pieces of maps.

302
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:09,146
The same thing Vermeer
did in his paintings,

303
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:14,723
of which never before had we seen
an explosion of bizarre objects,

304
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,305
each consisting of ultra concrete images.

305
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:23,260
You can see here people who are giving
each other gifts, who are on their knees,

306
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,139
to the right now will appear a big spider,

307
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:29,353
mutilated, without legs,

308
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,630
like a kind of Bourgogne snail,

309
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,552
with a long aggressive antenna.

310
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:40,536
But it is simply because someone
has just mutilated this spider,

311
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,486
and cut off all her legs.

312
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:50,085
And that is why there are people floating,
and fighting and walking,

313
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:54,042
half in sky, half underground,

314
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:57,627
half in the heights
which are still very hard,

315
00:37:57,747 --> 00:38:00,927
and in the milieu amédiste

316
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:03,973
once again this spider will disappear,

317
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:08,414
because all that we are seeing
is from Upper Mongolia,

318
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,817
but at the same time high cruelty.

319
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:34,002
The deep sea

320
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:41,384
which emerges, finally, into
quotidian reality

321
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:48,260
of fishermen of pearls
and unknown shells.

322
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:52,541
In the background, there is the port,
all the sails and all the boats

323
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,919
and in the foreground of this pile,

324
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,819
worthy of Leonardo da Vinci,

325
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:07,453
and the skies of an iridescent beauty
which remind us of the dreams of Bizet

326
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:10,378
who would have been enchanted
to put here

327
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:13,634
the famous pearl fishers of his prelude.

328
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:40,586
We see suddenly from this image

329
00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:45,066
so much dawn in this land

330
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:49,781
before the hallucinogenic invasion
of the princess,

331
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:56,520
it seems impossible that the battle
would arise again.

332
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,586
Another grand mural,
dating almost from

333
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,790
we could say, the prehistoric era,

334
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,640
in which we see beings that are running,

335
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,430
beings that are crying

336
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,092
beings that are fighting

337
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:21,748
and which are a truly visceral dawning

338
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:28,579
because all great paradise or all
great apocalypse, all great nirvana

339
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:33,149
is always commanded by a war.

340
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,306
Here is the horse,

341
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:44,792
which seems to be from the battle of Tétuan,

342
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,912
thanks to our specialists

343
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:51,741
we are able to spring
from this last battle,

344
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:54,875
which diminishes in intensity,

345
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:58,719
until the apparition

346
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:06,023
of the most tranquil lakes,

347
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:10,289
the mauve lake,
surrounded by green.

348
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,365
And suddenly...

349
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:35,733
Coup de théatre!

350
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:39,563
No, not coup de theatre:
Coup de cinéma!

351
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:43,991
For this little subliminal object,

352
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:47,715
this ballpoint pen from the Hotel
Saint Regis, which I kiss,

353
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:55,563
contains in its little, minute,
metallic section

354
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:01,695
all the film, all the hallucinogenic images

355
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:07,960
which Dalí has just imposed
on your brain.

356
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:14,553
Which... if we were not in this
dreadful time of pornography

357
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:18,989
I would slowly lower the ballpoint

358
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,094
down to the level of my little sex

359
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:28,700
and I would pour a few minute drops
of uric acid,

360
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:37,328
which, having eaten away the small,
divine and glowing part,

361
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:44,375
provoked the structures that your
humble and proud servant

362
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:50,830
has provoked, for you must know
that Dali is an agent provocateur,

363
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:53,437
and I repeat: has provoked this

364
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,959
during this whole time which your brain

365
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:05,326
has been shook by this marvelous
hommage to Upper Mongolia.

366
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:12,942
Long live this rare ballpoint!

367
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:17,084
War, war!

368
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:22,186
And triumph to the power of imagination!

369
00:45:58,788 --> 00:46:02,351
This ballpoint

370
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,604
contains the whole hommage
to Raymond Roussel,

371
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:14,081
the whole voyage, the whole expedition
to Upper Mongolia,

372
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:18,083
and the microstructures

373
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:22,264
which my team filmed
in a castle in Germany,

374
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:26,127
a castle worthy of the alchemists
of the middle ages,

375
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,488
this is what you have just seen.

1
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,625
<i>History is written
on the sands of Arrakis...</i>

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,722
<i>where rebellion and civil war
continue to breed...</i>

3
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,561
<i>fed by Alia's brutal tyranny
and repression...</i>

4
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:29,087
<i>as she sinks deeper into
the abomination of her own ghosts...</i>

5
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:37,761
<i>unable to recognize the forces
conspiring against her...</i>

6
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,026
<i>unaware of the whirlwind...</i>

7
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:43,497
<i>sweeping towards her
across the desert.</i>

8
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,122
Well...

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,189
who's gonna explain this to me?

10
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:57,455
Who's gonna tell me why
I have rioting in my streets...

11
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,658
why my name is being used as a curse?

12
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,388
You simple fools.

13
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,398
The royal twins are missing
from Sietch Tabr.

14
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:10,762
Lady Jessica
has been abducted off-world.

15
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,698
Rebel alliances are being formed
by tribes to the south.

16
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:18,166
And now we have anarchy
in the streets of Arakeen!

17
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,961
You are to blame.

18
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,065
Go.

19
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,524
Perhaps you should rest, milady.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,964
It's difficult to think clearly
when one is exhausted by stress.

21
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,829
Leave me. I'm fine.

22
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:54,259
Such a pity, eh?

23
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,664
Why did you send
that lovely boy away?

24
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:00,291
I'm not in the mood to indulge
your lurid perversions tonight.

25
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,856
Are they mine
or simply yours in disguise?

26
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:06,128
After all, I'm only enjoying...

27
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,167
what you started.

28
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:09,996
Is that so?

29
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,329
Don't forget, child.
I'm not really here.

30
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,959
I'm simply the manifestation...

31
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,330
of what you already are.

32
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,367
Go away! Go away!

33
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,432
Who else knows they are
requesting sanctuary here?

34
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,468
The Spacing Guild, of course.

35
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:41,092
They would provide transport
with Idaho's bribes.

36
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:46,032
The Bene Gesserit will surely be
informed, if they don't know already.

37
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,465
Then Alia will be forced
to implicate us in this adventure.

38
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,028
She'll have to make it appear
as if we arranged the whole thing.

39
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,192
We should refuse them safe harbor...

40
00:02:57,268 --> 00:03:00,234
return them to Arrakis and wash
our hands of the entire matter.

41
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,325
On the contrary, Tyek.

42
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,334
Perhaps we should think
of Lady Jessica's visit...

43
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,062
as an endowment, not a threat.

44
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,697
The woman has many talents, I've read.
Perhaps they could be of some use to us.

45
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,701
You mean to you.

46
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,792
I see no reason why I shouldn't continue
my education by all means necessary.

47
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:21,029
Any woman who can seduce
Duke Leto Atreides...

48
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:25,558
and a planet of desert Fremen
is not to be trifled with.

49
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:28,625
Are you suggesting
she might try to seduce me?

50
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:35,393
Don't play the fool, Farad'n.

51
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,534
She would be a dangerous guest.

52
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,535
But... a grateful one.

53
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,702
He may have a point.

54
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:53,898
May the wind strip the flesh
from your bones.

55
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:22,500
May Shai-Hulud
clear the path before you.

56
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,163
<i>Sachar-Nabai.
When we meet again.</i>

57
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,669
My skin is not my own.

58
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,234
The Golden Path is dangerous, Son.

59
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:18,170
It's the choice I couldn't take...

60
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:21,137
the desert storm
that cannot be stopped.

61
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:26,572
You will become that storm...

62
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,332
my son--

63
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,099
the whirlwind.

64
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:32,934
And nothing will be able
to stop you...

65
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,437
not even yourself.

66
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,274
This is for Leto.

67
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:02,268
We've confirmed that it was
Ghanima's knife that killed Palimbasha.

68
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:06,207
And the communicator he was wearing?

69
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:09,606
Off-world manufacture for sure.

70
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,905
We found a transceiver implanted
in a tiger's neck.

71
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,042
And we also found this in the desert.

72
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,270
Should I arrange transport
to the palace?

73
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,775
No!

74
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,476
Whoever will benefit
from the death of these children...

75
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,839
will not rest until
they're sure they've succeeded.

76
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,399
Until the time is right...

77
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:43,238
she'll be safer here than anywhere.

78
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,235
Sand trout.

79
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,574
So you know your desert farming,
young Atreides.

80
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:08,672
That's right, Atreides.
Don't be foolish.

81
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,944
We have your water in our cup.

82
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,410
<i>Alive? She's alive?</i>

83
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,905
That clever bitch Ghanima
survived our tigers.

84
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,707
We must improvise quickly.

85
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,712
Tell our man in the Atreides palace,
the priest Javid...

86
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,735
he must stir Alia's pot some more.

87
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,403
Yes, Princess.

88
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,879
<i>They left our priest's body
where we would be sure to find it.</i>

89
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:10,902
He was assassinated by Fremen rebels
from a sietch near Hirbana Erg.

90
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,344
He was traveling with diplomatic
immunity when they attacked.

91
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,210
They carved blasphemy
into his skin, milady.

92
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,838
Horrible, profane curses
about you and your family.

93
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,740
"Cursed be the name Atreides.

94
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,208
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

95
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,872
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

96
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,244
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths."

97
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,976
The obscenities
of desert rebels, Holiness.

98
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,644
An example must be made...

99
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,646
to warn other tribes what happens...

100
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,044
if they persist
in this insurrection.

101
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,771
No mercy.

102
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:06,314
I want all traces of
the rebel sietch wiped out.

103
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:11,814
You will be Leto...

104
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:14,644
son of Muad'Dib.

105
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,475
I am Sabiha.

106
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,208
I am meant to watch over you.

107
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:23,942
Yes, and no doubt kill me
if I try to escape.

108
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,948
That won't happen.

109
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,381
Drink.

110
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:49,077
I warn you, any attempt at witchery
shall result in immediate execution.

111
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,674
We are seeking safe harbor,
not an opportunity for treachery.

112
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:57,079
So you say.
But why should we risk...

113
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,378
sheltering fugitives
from the Imperium?

114
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,915
Who says that we are fugitives?

115
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:04,449
Your confrontation with Alia
has already taken on...

116
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:08,176
mythic proportions, Lady Jessica.

117
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,615
Several Fremen tribes are known to be
in open revolt against the Quizrate.

118
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:14,172
Civil war seems imminent.

119
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,978
My grandchildren will prevent that.

120
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:18,843
Not if they're dead.

121
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,916
I'm sorry, Jessica Atreides...

122
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,415
to be the bearer of bad news, but...

123
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,745
it seems your grandchildren
have been the victims...

124
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:30,340
of a well-planned
assassination plot.

125
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:35,178
- Assassination?
- Our reports indicate...

126
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:39,308
the Atreides twins went missing
from Sietch Tabr.

127
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,679
They were attacked in the desert.

128
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,410
Leto was killed.

129
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,143
They're not sure
what became of the girl.

130
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:50,116
We have reason to believe Alia herself
may have planned the killings.

131
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:53,480
- That is impossible.
- Jessica.

132
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:56,745
It's well known your daughter's
on the verge of abomination.

133
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,841
Since Muad'Dib's heirs
were of age...

134
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,350
they were soon to be invested
with all the powers of his government.

135
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:08,578
Alia's role as regent
was coming to an end unless--

136
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:12,879
unless your grandchildren
could be eliminated...

137
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:16,043
and the blame laid on her enemies.

138
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,708
On us.

139
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:24,213
Events on Arrakis are spinning
wildly out of control...

140
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,217
Jessica Atreides.

141
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:30,513
Now, we can retreat and watch
the empire collapse on top of us...

142
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:34,109
or we can give each other sanctuary.

143
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:37,083
I can protect you
from Alia's reach...

144
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,448
and you can protect me
from her madness.

145
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:45,984
And how do I do that?

146
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:51,311
By announcing publicly that we did not
kidnap you, as Alia now alleges--

147
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:55,841
that you came of your own free will,
an emissary of the Bene Gesserit...

148
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,851
sent to...

149
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,680
take over the education of my son.

150
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,817
You want me to teach him
as the Bene Gesserit are taught?

151
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,079
An offer I could not resist.

152
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:17,684
Your mentat is conspicuous
by his silence.

153
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,283
One must be careful to evaluate...

154
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,841
who has the advantage
in such situations.

155
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,408
Perhaps there is
mutual advantage all around.

156
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,583
Stilgar refuses
to allow Ghanima to travel...

157
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,744
saying she's not strong enough...

158
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,615
saying her safety
cannot be guaranteed.

159
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:46,175
- He has offered sanctuary.
- He is naib of the sietch.

160
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:50,345
- We cannot overrule his wishes.
- We'll see about that.

161
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,682
The activities at Tabr
are curious and provocative.

162
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:58,049
No one is allowed to visit or depart
without Stilgar's permission.

163
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,109
They're planning to go over
to the rebels.

164
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:01,846
That's unlikely.

165
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,852
We know Stilgar
has initiated dialogue...

166
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,716
with the insurgent naibs to the south,
but only as emissary.

167
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:11,549
Continue your surveillance
of Sietch Tabr.

168
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,552
I want to know who's coming
and who's going...

169
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,086
and where all the communications
are directed.

170
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:19,018
Time to pay Stilgar a visit.

171
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,078
<i>If you hadn't taken them from
the city in the first place...</i>

172
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:26,086
- this never would have happened.
- I am their guardian, Alia.

173
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:28,643
Are you suggesting she wouldn't
be safe at the palace with me?

174
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:32,517
I am demanding that she not be used
as a pawn in a civil war.

175
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,985
You know as well as I that Ghanima
must be returned to the court.

176
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,676
She's right, Irulan.

177
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:45,653
As long as I designate
Sietch Tabr neutral territory...

178
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:51,312
no violence may be committed
by any party to this conflict.

179
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:56,376
However, holding Ghanima against
the imperial regent's will...

180
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,511
could be considered abduction.

181
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:01,248
As naib of this sietch...

182
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:08,084
I surrender Ghanima to
the imperial regent on one condition--

183
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,985
that the Princess Irulan
accompany her.

184
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,146
If any harm comes
to either the princess...

185
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,449
or the royal heir...

186
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:19,511
the neutrality of this tribe
will be forfeit...

187
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,783
and allegiance
to the imperial throne...

188
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,287
disavowed.

189
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,314
Agreed.

190
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:32,454
I want the girl ready.
We leave for Arakeen immediately.

191
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:39,613
Forgive me, Irulan.

192
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:42,087
I may have placed you
in grave danger.

193
00:21:06,822 --> 00:21:09,687
Keep feeding him more and more.

194
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:11,722
The more we feed him,
the deeper his trance.

195
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,722
The deeper the trance,
the more dangerous the trance.

196
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,183
- He's stronger than we thought.
- Then we must increase what we give him.

197
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,681
By the time we're through,
he'll be as mad as Alia.

198
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,122
What are you doing to me?

199
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,356
That's spice essence!

200
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,916
Do you hear them--
the voices in your head?

201
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,149
Are you crazy yet, like your aunt?

202
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:05,951
Does that frighten you?

203
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,751
Not as much as
it will frighten you, Atreides.

204
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,483
<i>Listen to me, Leto.</i>

205
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,156
Put the weapon away, Cast Out.

206
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:03,518
That is what you are, isn't it?

207
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,150
Adopting the chameleon colors
of a smuggler tribe...

208
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,715
in order to keep
your true identity secret.

209
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:11,725
Allowing us to survive.
Trading spice.

210
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:14,055
That's not all, is it?

211
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:18,350
You're breeding sand trout.

212
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:20,756
I've seen the holding pens.

213
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,622
Selling worms off-planet, you hope to
break the Atreides monopoly on spice.

214
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,921
It is dangerous for you
to know these things.

215
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:30,016
More dangerous for you.

216
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,286
None of your worms survive long
away from Dune.

217
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,723
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

218
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,419
You're already saturated with spice.

219
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:41,981
And it can no longer harm me.

220
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:53,458
I have survived the crucible, Sabiha.

221
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,715
I have silenced the voices
within who would have possessed me.

222
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,219
Only I remain now
to do what I must do.

223
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,259
And what is that?

224
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,953
Save the desert.

225
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:30,761
My skin is not my own.

226
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:01,094
I can't-- I can't do it.

227
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,152
You can. You will.

228
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,094
I'm here. I try to see myself there,
but I can't.

229
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:11,129
- I can't.
- Patience.

230
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:18,526
Concentrate on visualizing
the flow of time.

231
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:21,890
It must move, not you.

232
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,162
It would have been easier
to begin this when you were younger.

233
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,788
I'm surprised you never asked
for a Bene Gesserit teacher before.

234
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:37,352
They'd have leapt at the opportunity
to put you in their debt.

235
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,192
My mother had other training
in mind for me when I was younger.

236
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:45,855
- You can still learn.
- If I'm patient?

237
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,953
You must learn
each and every muscle...

238
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,325
as if it were a single string
on a baliset.

239
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:54,624
When you learn how
to play them individually...

240
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:57,129
you'll know how
to play them together.

241
00:27:57,197 --> 00:28:00,856
The union of opposites,
isn't it, Jessica?

242
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:06,758
Recognizing the essential
instability of our universe...

243
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,785
one must learn to make it
one's own creation.

244
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:12,887
It is the Bene Gesserit way.

245
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:15,396
So you haven't forgotten
everything you were taught.

246
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:19,621
You need a bath.

247
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,630
We'll continue tomorrow.

248
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,393
He is a slow learner.

249
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:30,521
On the contrary, he's making more
progress than I would have expected...

250
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:32,621
in so short a time.

251
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:34,630
And you?

252
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:37,994
I know what I intend to get
out of this relationship, Wencisia.

253
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:41,286
What is it you expect?

254
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:47,763
Our houses are at
their crossroads, Jessica--

255
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:49,922
families weakened from within.

256
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:54,090
You and I both confront the greatest
danger from those closest to us.

257
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,756
You have a daughter
from whom you are estranged.

258
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,229
I have a son
in whom I have little confidence.

259
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,729
What do you expect me
to do about that?

260
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:04,787
Simply...

261
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,888
consider the union of opposites.

262
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:12,694
We hear rumors
of your granddaughter.

263
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:16,527
- Ghanima?
- It seems she has survived.

264
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:23,856
Alia has taken her from Stilgar,
but Irulan is with her.

265
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,557
Get to the point, Wencisia.

266
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,931
An alliance.

267
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,760
Corrino and Atreides.

268
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:35,457
An alliance through marriage.

269
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,657
Under your tutelage.

270
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,028
Farad'n could be fashioned
into an acceptable mate...

271
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,065
for someone as special
as your granddaughter.

272
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:46,791
He has his talents,
and he's a fast learner, as you say.

273
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:49,730
Worse things could happen...

274
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,254
than an alliance
between old enemies.

275
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:58,126
Your son was clever enough
to see its potential once.

276
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:01,063
Surely you can see
the need for it now.

277
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,663
The idea repulses me.

278
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:08,824
Surely your mentat reasoning
can see the value in it.

279
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,661
That an Atreides would willingly
marry into the house...

280
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,699
that has vowed its destruction--
it's madness!

281
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:17,891
That's exactly what my son did
when he married Irulan.

282
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,364
Politics ruled that decision,
and it averted a war.

283
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,399
Do you not see the similarity
to our present situation?

284
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:27,262
Do you really think Alia
will agree to a marriage...

285
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,697
between Ghanima and Farad'n?

286
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:37,223
She is the reason you must be the one
to deliver this proposal.

287
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:43,193
She loved you once, Duncan, and
there's a part of her that still does.

288
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,456
You're the only one who might
reach that part of her...

289
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:50,466
that still knows who she is.

290
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,366
She's lost to me now.

291
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,658
You saw the evidence of that yourself.

292
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,562
You could be saving the life
of Paul's daughter, Duncan.

293
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,595
As long as Ghani lives,
she's a threat to Alia.

294
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,360
If we can make my daughter
believe that her niece...

295
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:30,730
is the means to eliminating
an even greater threat...

296
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,733
we can save her life...

297
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,923
and buy precious time.

298
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:50,658
I assume you see merit
to this marriage proposal...

299
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:53,895
since you gambled your own safety
to deliver it personally.

300
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:56,662
Merit and risk.

301
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,963
You must decide which bears
the greater weight.

302
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:01,024
My priests object to the idea.

303
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,292
Because they are
myopic and parochial...

304
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,391
interested only in preserving
their own power.

305
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,957
Be careful, Duncan.

306
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:12,001
You're already standing
on the precipice.

307
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:16,899
It is no secret desert rebels probe
your defenses with increased success.

308
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:21,231
Riots here in Arakeen are the subject
of much discussion off-world.

309
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:25,132
Whispers of weakness and disarray
are spreading amongst the great houses.

310
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:30,066
Rumors encouraged by my enemies
to spread doubt and fear.

311
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:33,101
The jackals are gathering, Alia.

312
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,362
An alliance between
Corrino and Atreides...

313
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:38,664
would serve as reassurance
and a warning.

314
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:45,193
Prepare a formal response
to House Corrino.

315
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,235
We will allow negotiations
for a union...

316
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:49,564
between Ghanima
and Prince Farad'n to begin.

317
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:54,261
But make it clear,
Atreides interests will dominate.

318
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,301
Leave me.

319
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:01,597
Only my husband may remain.

320
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,695
I should have you executed
for what you did.

321
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:20,564
My diplomatic immunity
as Corrino envoy...

322
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:23,068
would make that an unwise decision.

323
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:26,193
Why did you come back here?

324
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,600
My allegiance to House Atreides
would permit nothing less.

325
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,829
I played no part in your decision?

326
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:36,229
I struggled not to allow it.

327
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,027
You can't remain at the keep.

328
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,092
I must banish you
for your treachery.

329
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,898
Otherwise, people would question
my judgement, my ruthlessness.

330
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:50,835
A quality you must demonstrate
often these days, no doubt.

331
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,166
They're difficult days, Duncan.

332
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,531
Lonely days.

333
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,863
I've missed you.

334
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:30,494
Where would you have me go?

335
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:34,094
Sietch Tabr.
Neutral territory.

336
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:37,501
Stilgar is trying to broker a peace
between the Quizrate and the rebels.

337
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,560
Perhaps your mentat qualities
can be useful.

338
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,560
At least you'll be safe there.

339
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,529
There is no one to restrain Alia.

340
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,698
Her forces are probing deeper and deeper
into the southern regions...

341
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,737
attacking rebel sietches
wherever she thinks they are.

342
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:12,828
And still, there are riots
in the streets of Arakeen itself.

343
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:16,429
And what of the boy Leto?
What do they say about him?

344
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:19,868
If he survived the assassin,
he did not survive the desert.

345
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:24,166
Worms, storms--
There won't be a body.

346
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,504
Where are you going?

347
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:32,868
- To look for the boy.
- That cannot be permitted.

348
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:38,568
We never had any intention of helping
someone like you, enemy of ours.

349
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,298
Cursed be your name, Atreides.

350
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:45,464
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

351
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:47,505
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

352
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:51,096
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths.

353
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:17,729
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm...

354
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,397
is the worm.

355
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:29,365
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

356
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,702
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

357
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:37,330
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

358
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,634
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

359
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:44,105
I will not fear!
Fear is the mind killer!

360
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:47,402
I will face my fear!
I will let it pass through me!

361
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,406
I will not fear!

362
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:37,004
I could have killed you.

363
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:40,098
It wouldn't have been that easy.

364
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:46,732
I wanted to believe you.

365
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,172
I wanted to believe that
I could do it, but I didn't.

366
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:52,697
I couldn't.
I didn't truly think it was possible.

367
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:56,104
And then my mind melted away.

368
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,073
I gave up fighting you,
and it happened.

369
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,573
It wasn't me you were fighting.

370
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:02,403
It was myself.

371
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:05,066
All that I've learned-- all the
nonsense I've imprisoned myself with--

372
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:06,732
I feel--

373
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:12,340
I feel like I'm being reborn...

374
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:18,570
like I'm standing on the threshold
of something extraordinary.

375
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,006
Para-Bindu balance, Farad'n.

376
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,507
But only on the threshold.

377
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:28,371
- Patience?
- Yes, patience.

378
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,740
Remember...

379
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:38,906
it's one thing to gain control
of your perceptions...

380
00:38:38,976 --> 00:38:41,806
quite another to gain control
of your desires.

381
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:45,375
And if I succeed?

382
00:38:46,543 --> 00:38:50,339
You'll find reality to be quite
a bit different than you thought.

383
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,476
My skin is not my own.

384
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,873
Must you insist on
sneaking away like this?

385
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,777
I still feel him, Irulan.

386
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:53,306
His presence. Sometimes I even think
I can hear his laughter in the wind.

387
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:56,276
Mocking your decision
to marry Farad'n, I hope.

388
00:40:56,345 --> 00:40:57,675
Why should he mock it?

389
00:40:57,745 --> 00:41:01,507
I cannot stand by and let you be used
as a pawn in Alia's schemes.

390
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:05,738
Is that what you think,
that I'm being used?

391
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:09,767
That I've agreed to this marriage
as part of some conspiracy with Alia?

392
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:14,039
No. But I know you, Ghani.

393
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:17,078
There is more to your decision
than anyone else believes.

394
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:19,543
Alia wants my grandmother back.

395
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:22,670
Farad'n is simply the means.

396
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:24,336
But what do you want?

397
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:33,043
Farad'n's blood on
the wedding sheets, not mine.

398
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:42,171
<i>You cannot remain neutral
any longer, Stilgar.</i>

399
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,502
You must ally your tribe
with the rebel forces.

400
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:49,204
Never! Rebellion against
the sister of Muad'Dib...

401
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:53,042
would bring the greatest dishonor
I could imagine.

402
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:56,943
There is no more sister of Muad'Dib.
She's gone--

403
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,343
lost to the evil that possesses her.

404
00:41:59,412 --> 00:42:01,674
And as long as you refuse
to believe it, you wear its collar.

405
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:05,406
Enough!
You are the guest of my tribe.

406
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,741
I have given you my countenance.

407
00:42:07,813 --> 00:42:12,836
But I swear, if you provoke me further
with talk of insurrection...

408
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:16,209
I will have your water!

409
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:54,712
What is it, Tariq?

410
00:42:56,614 --> 00:43:00,342
- Why have we stopped?
- Desert demon.

411
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:09,011
In human form.

412
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:11,172
There are no such things.

413
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:28,380
Your guide has released the worm.

414
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:35,079
We have a little time
before he returns.

415
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,647
You made it stop.

416
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:45,641
The worm obeyed your command.

417
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:49,047
Yes.

418
00:43:51,848 --> 00:43:55,281
They say Leto Atreides is dead...

419
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,814
killed by Corrino treachery.

420
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:00,677
A myth I have allowed to persist
until I am ready.

421
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:02,180
For what?

422
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:08,472
To undo what's been done
in your name... Father.

423
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,580
You have no idea who I am.

424
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,206
This is your ring, Father.

425
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:36,041
Passed from Duke Leto to you,
and then unto me.

426
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:11,141
How far has it gone...

427
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:13,205
this thing you've done to yourself?

428
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:16,115
I am a desert creature.

429
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:19,949
Was there no other way?

430
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,873
There was only one way
to bring about The Golden Path.

431
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,780
You cannot control the future.

432
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:32,539
A man named Muad'Dib
should have heeded that advice.

433
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:35,981
Do you think Muad'Dib couldn't see
the thing that you want to do?

434
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,175
Do you think he didn't
confront the possibility?

435
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,547
Muad'Dib was afraid.

436
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,742
He was trapped
by his own prophecy...

437
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:51,215
a victim of what he knew
he could not choose.

438
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:54,182
So I have chosen...

439
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,683
to make a world where humankind
can create its own future...

440
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:59,478
from moment to moment...

441
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,574
free of one man's vision...

442
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,673
free from the perversion
of the prophet's words...

443
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,083
and free of future
pre-determined.

444
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:14,044
This does not belong to me.

445
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:23,274
How many nights I have sat
on a dune just like this...

446
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,679
imagining a night just like this...

447
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,375
with my father.

448
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,148
Just the two of us...

449
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:41,184
talking and-- and laughing.

450
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:47,441
And how many nights I have gone to sleep
on the cold floor of the sietch...

451
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,915
dreaming of his arms around me...

452
00:46:50,985 --> 00:46:53,042
sheltering me from everything
I was afraid of...

453
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:55,607
everything I could not understand.

454
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:59,546
Are you still a good Fremen?

455
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,551
Yes.

456
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:06,241
Then will you permit...

457
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:08,341
a blind man...

458
00:47:08,418 --> 00:47:10,475
to go out into the desert...

459
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,345
and find peace on his own terms?

460
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:23,216
Not yet.

461
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:37,211
Cursed be the name Atreides.

462
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,909
Body shield. Armed.

463
00:48:02,553 --> 00:48:05,576
Eight of nine new settlements
have been abandoned.

464
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:09,313
Many of the old sietch communities
are becoming overrun with refugees.

465
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:15,551
The holy regent demands that you abandon
your pledge of neutrality.

466
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,076
Ally your forces with hers and
put an end to this damnable rebellion.

467
00:48:20,153 --> 00:48:23,586
Alia is Fremen.

468
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:26,983
She knows she cannot make
such a demand on me...

469
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:29,246
or on any other naib!

470
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,247
You can no longer remain
above the fight, Stilgar.

471
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,480
Your feeble attempts to mediate
have accomplished nothing.

472
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:39,019
It is time for you to choose.

473
00:48:39,087 --> 00:48:42,781
Are you with the empire
or against it?

474
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:44,877
It is not a choice
I will make because...

475
00:48:44,954 --> 00:48:48,977
some fop of a priest demands it.

476
00:48:53,154 --> 00:48:55,086
Well, perhaps the royal consort...

477
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:57,642
can talk some sense
into this obstinate fool.

478
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:09,746
I can do better than that.

479
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:14,146
The "royal cuckold" thanks you
for this opportunity.

480
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:22,716
Stilgar will now make his choice.

481
00:49:22,787 --> 00:49:27,311
You have violated sanctuary.

482
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:33,079
You have defiled...

483
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:35,211
the honor of my people.

484
00:49:37,022 --> 00:49:38,749
No, Stil.

485
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:41,447
I have just cut the collar
from around your neck.

486
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,814
That was the right choice, Stil.

487
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,417
Two deaths for the Atreides...

488
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:59,387
the second one for no better reason
than the first.

489
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:18,254
It was a sign.

490
00:50:18,322 --> 00:50:21,152
He forced our hand.

491
00:50:21,222 --> 00:50:26,484
Now Alia will be forced
to move against us.

492
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:31,484
<i>He has taken the tribe
into the desert.</i>

493
00:50:31,556 --> 00:50:33,488
No one knows where...

494
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:36,317
but his only refuge
will be with the rebels.

495
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:41,484
Idaho acted impulsively, milady.
He was--

496
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:43,545
Was my husband!

497
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:47,687
Kanly...

498
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,949
vendetta...

499
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:53,716
on Stilgar and all of his tribe
that joined him.

500
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:58,179
Let them be hunted down
like desert rabbits.

501
00:50:58,257 --> 00:50:59,984
<i>Yes, yes. Kill them.</i>

502
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,579
I want their skins
when they're caught.

503
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:05,555
<i>Nice touch, yes.
Very creative.</i>

504
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:34,785
This is the one
we took on the south face.

505
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:37,823
He came across the bled
from the south wall.

506
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:41,414
So, they say you rode a worm here.

507
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,649
A 20-thumper ride.

508
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:46,986
- And yet, you are not Fremen.
- They taught me well.

509
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:56,581
Rumors across the desert
say you're dead, Gurney Halleck.

510
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:58,816
There are many
who wished it were true.

511
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:04,449
The sons of Esmar Tuek
are not among them, old friend.

512
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:22,218
We've been waiting on you,
Gurney Halleck.

513
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:26,224
- How did you know I'd come here?
- My father told me.

514
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,484
Your father?

515
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:33,652
Well, in the desert,
sheltered once is sheltered always.

516
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:36,657
After the Harkonnen invasion,
these were the men who protected you...

517
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:39,657
before you were finally
reunited with Muad'Dib.

518
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:42,317
A reunion which allowed me
to join his rebellion...

519
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,324
against Shaddam
and the imperial forces.

520
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,485
Another rebellion awaits you,
Gurney Halleck.

521
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,047
My loyalty is to House Atreides.

522
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,818
I am House Atreides.

523
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:56,552
And what of your aunt?

524
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:59,319
My aunt is lost--

525
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:02,085
lost to forces
she could not control...

526
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:04,716
to forces who want
to destroy House Atreides.

527
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:07,087
What have you done to yourself?

528
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:09,147
I have made a choice...

529
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:11,316
accepted a destiny, nothing more.

530
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:14,216
My eyes can see it...

531
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,781
but my mind refuses to believe it.

532
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,791
Believe it, Gurney.

533
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,014
Remember the words of my father
and my grandfather, your duke.

534
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:26,615
They spoke to you of desert power.

535
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:31,317
I am desert power...

536
00:53:31,393 --> 00:53:34,018
and nothing can stop
what is going to happen.

537
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,085
We are here to honor
the throne of Muad'Dib...

538
00:56:42,162 --> 00:56:44,685
and his sister, the holy regent.

539
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:50,096
We are here to honor his esteemed
daughter with the presentation...

540
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:53,458
of our son, Prince Farad'n...

541
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:58,224
heir to the throne
of House Corrino.

542
00:57:00,663 --> 00:57:03,959
We offer our deepest condolences
on the loss of your brother.

543
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,092
Perhaps the union of our houses...

544
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:09,288
can put an end to the treachery
that took his life...

545
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:14,929
treachery that was bred
on Salusa Secundus.

546
00:57:19,863 --> 00:57:21,659
What did you say?

547
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:25,720
I am ashamed to say that the animals
that killed Leto, son of Muad'Dib...

548
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:27,626
were created and trained
on my planet.

549
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,219
And the regent of House Corrino
knew of this?

550
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:34,254
- She planned it.
- How dare you!

551
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,694
I'll dare quite a few things
from now on, Mother.

552
00:57:37,764 --> 00:57:40,628
You've been quite adept
at making decisions in my name...

553
00:57:40,697 --> 00:57:42,890
decisions which I've found
extremely distasteful.

554
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,520
You insolent bastard.

555
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:47,757
Let's not discuss
your weaknesses now, Mother.

556
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:52,062
I forbid you to say another word.

557
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:54,427
You forbid nothing.

558
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:58,930
As heir to the throne of House Corrino,
I am now the author of my own decisions.

559
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:03,294
My mother is stripped of all accounts
and privileges of the House Corrino.

560
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:05,524
She is no longer
sovereign regent of this family.

561
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:10,121
She is, from this moment forward,
banished.

562
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:26,896
You're more of a man
than I'd ever thought possible.

563
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:32,953
And you can spend the rest of your days
pondering that in utter darkness.

564
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:36,361
Patience is a virtue I have
in abundance, if you haven't noticed.

565
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:41,193
Hold.

566
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:57,232
Did you have anything to do
with the death of my brother?

567
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:01,163
I knew nothing of the plot against him
until it was too late.

568
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:06,758
Forgive me.
I am at your mercy.

569
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:11,623
This is my wedding present to you.

570
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:15,756
I have nothing else.
No dowry.

571
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:18,129
Only the truth.

572
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,222
I believe him.

573
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,064
Take her. Leave him.

574
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,224
Maybe he'll amuse us
with more intrigue...

575
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,425
and double-cross in the days to come.

576
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,389
Don't you find it interesting,
Jessica...

577
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:54,399
how the sins of the mother
bloom in the children they bear?

578
01:00:32,268 --> 01:00:34,257
<i>She's weakened by madness.</i>

579
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:36,323
She still commands
the imperial armies.

580
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,390
They are retreating to the city...

581
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,366
trapped by the shield wall
from which they are vulnerable.

582
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:45,400
They say the price on your head
keeps going up.

583
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:48,263
Then I say unto you...

584
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:50,323
send men...

585
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:53,799
to summon worms!

586
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,229
Then let us go...

587
01:00:58,301 --> 01:01:00,392
to Arakeen...

588
01:01:00,468 --> 01:01:02,627
to collect it.

589
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,390
Manut.

590
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,594
A storm.

591
01:01:14,668 --> 01:01:16,657
Not a storm.

592
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,627
- I must get word to the palace.
- Yeah.

593
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,661
Don't be afraid, Gurney-Man.

594
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,800
There is no way...

595
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,200
to hasten
what is meant to be.

596
01:03:05,837 --> 01:03:07,826
When the time is right...

597
01:03:10,603 --> 01:03:12,626
he will find us.

598
01:03:19,637 --> 01:03:21,467
Who are you?

599
01:03:22,204 --> 01:03:24,863
Who I am
doesn't matter anymore.

600
01:03:24,937 --> 01:03:27,062
It matters to me.

601
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,864
Do you think I would have
left this place if I had known?

602
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:34,802
Do you think I would have abandoned you
if I knew you were still alive?

603
01:03:34,871 --> 01:03:36,860
You did what you
were meant to do.

604
01:03:39,638 --> 01:03:41,661
Tell me.

605
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,067
Let me hear you say it.

606
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:46,399
Tell me it isn't true.

607
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,564
I couldn't live...

608
01:03:51,638 --> 01:03:54,070
if I knew I had forsaken you.

609
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:03,728
Paul Atreides is no more,
Gurney-Man.

610
01:04:05,205 --> 01:04:09,365
The desert winds have erased
all trace of his passage here.

611
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:15,128
And soon...

612
01:04:15,205 --> 01:04:17,694
Muad'Dib must follow.

613
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:22,864
Please, Gurney, I'm tired...

614
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:24,427
hungry.

615
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,962
Get me some food.

616
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:50,129
Ah, Stil. So predictable.

617
01:04:51,106 --> 01:04:54,095
It's as if they're daring you
to confront them...

618
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:57,467
challenging you
to commit troops, thopters.

619
01:04:58,538 --> 01:05:02,096
They think I've retreated to the
sanctuary of the city where I'm trapped.

620
01:05:02,172 --> 01:05:04,434
It's a tactic learned from my brother
when he defeated Shaddam...

621
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,767
and took back Arrakis.

622
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,396
Poor Stil.

623
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,134
If you only knew
it is you who are trapped...

624
01:05:12,206 --> 01:05:13,695
not I.

625
01:05:13,772 --> 01:05:16,603
They are still over a day's ride
from Arakeen.

626
01:05:17,506 --> 01:05:19,335
Fine.

627
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:21,395
I'm going back to the palace.

628
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,198
I have a wedding to attend.

629
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:49,762
Leave me.

630
01:05:55,307 --> 01:05:57,296
Do as I say!

631
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,804
There's no need for that
with me, Ghanima.

632
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,936
Our plan worked.

633
01:06:24,008 --> 01:06:25,496
You're alive!

634
01:06:26,841 --> 01:06:28,830
I knew it.

635
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,130
Oh, I have missed you.

636
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:38,398
I'm sorry, Ghanima.

637
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:42,070
I'm so sorry.

638
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:45,472
I had to let you think that I was dead.
It was the only way--

639
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:48,996
the only way that I could start
what must now be finished.

640
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:12,840
Idolaters! Blasphemers!

641
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,899
You'll spoil this place!

642
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,899
The desert will swallow you!

643
01:08:41,377 --> 01:08:45,639
His words are sacrilege.
His presence must not be tolerated.

644
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:48,073
You must give the order, Holy One.

645
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:49,972
You must send us to take him.

646
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:53,635
<i>Caution, darling.
Do not act impulsively.</i>

647
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,369
Not yet.

648
01:08:55,443 --> 01:08:58,170
He is an outrage
to the religion of Muad'Dib.

649
01:08:58,243 --> 01:09:00,937
<i>But that's the point, my darling.</i>

650
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,204
We must know for sure whether
he really is your brother...

651
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,766
mustn't we?

652
01:09:05,844 --> 01:09:09,072
It would not do to make
a martyr of him just yet.

653
01:09:47,678 --> 01:09:50,371
Who is it
that calls for Muad'Dib?

654
01:09:50,444 --> 01:09:52,433
Help us, Muad'Dib.

655
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:58,037
Muad'Dib's words are the wind.

656
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:03,270
They vanish...
like water on the sand.

657
01:10:05,045 --> 01:10:07,909
I'll give you Muad'Dib's words.

658
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:10,069
I'll rub your faces in them!

659
01:10:12,711 --> 01:10:14,802
I am the voice
from the wilderness...

660
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,037
and I bring you a warning.

661
01:10:19,945 --> 01:10:23,503
The water we spread upon the desert
has become blood.

662
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:30,003
Blood... upon the land
which was once clean and pure.

663
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:35,877
We have provoked the desert...
forsaken its ways.

664
01:10:35,945 --> 01:10:39,309
We have succumbed
to mindless ritual...

665
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:41,572
and seductive ceremony...

666
01:10:41,646 --> 01:10:45,078
placed faith in those
who crush dissent...

667
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:47,407
enrich themselves with power...

668
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:50,835
commit atrocity.

669
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:54,539
All in the name
of righteousness!

670
01:10:55,146 --> 01:10:57,135
All in the name...

671
01:10:58,779 --> 01:11:00,768
of Muad'Dib.

672
01:11:02,213 --> 01:11:03,974
We have fouled the nest...

673
01:11:05,746 --> 01:11:07,735
and it is killing us.

674
01:11:09,213 --> 01:11:12,906
But I have seen another path...

675
01:11:14,612 --> 01:11:16,602
a golden path--

676
01:11:19,513 --> 01:11:22,808
the path Muad'Dib could not take.

677
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:28,102
I have stood upon the sand...

678
01:11:29,113 --> 01:11:32,204
and I have seen a beast rise up.

679
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:36,603
And upon the head of that beast...

680
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,403
is the name of salvation...

681
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:47,841
come to spill water
upon the sand...

682
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,943
come to lead us back...

683
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:57,544
to a dry and thirsty land.

684
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,972
Only one blasphemy remains...

685
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,003
and that blasphemy...

686
01:12:06,347 --> 01:12:08,040
is Alia!

687
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:19,803
Forgive me...

688
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,308
Sister.

689
01:13:32,815 --> 01:13:34,804
It's in your hands now...

690
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,979
Son.

691
01:15:01,717 --> 01:15:04,080
Where is she?

692
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,581
Behold me, family!

693
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,777
I am Leto!

694
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:52,207
Lion of Atreides...

695
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:57,346
<i>returned from the desert
to announce Sachar Nabai--</i>

696
01:15:58,385 --> 01:16:00,374
The Golden Path--

697
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:05,773
to rid humanity of the perversions
done in Muad'Dib's name...

698
01:16:06,785 --> 01:16:11,547
and to save it from the abomination
known as Alia.

699
01:16:11,618 --> 01:16:13,107
Seize him!

700
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,649
The time has come, Aunt.

701
01:17:09,552 --> 01:17:11,381
You must face the future.

702
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:13,441
I'll drink your blood!

703
01:17:22,686 --> 01:17:24,709
Alia, stop it!
Stop yourself!

704
01:17:26,686 --> 01:17:29,551
You sorry bitch!

705
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,484
You Bene Gesserit whore!

706
01:17:33,553 --> 01:17:36,280
Did you think
you could escape my vengeance?

707
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,484
Did you think
I was defeated forever?

708
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:45,018
I have her, daughter--
your precious Alia.

709
01:17:45,086 --> 01:17:48,314
She's mine! I won!

710
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,609
Demon! Let her make
her own choice!

711
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:01,481
Mommy... please help me.

712
01:18:11,288 --> 01:18:13,481
Help yourself.

713
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:31,483
<i>Yes! Yes, do it.
Sink it in.</i>

714
01:18:31,554 --> 01:18:35,111
<i>Bathe our hands
in his hot blood.</i>

715
01:19:16,122 --> 01:19:18,952
<i>No! Darling! Stop! Stop!</i>

716
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:22,245
<i>Stop! We're so close!</i>

717
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:25,880
<i>I love you. I can save you.
Don't stop now. We're so close.</i>

718
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:13,415
I want my brother.

719
01:20:58,524 --> 01:21:02,115
You'll not change your mind
and return with me to Caladan?

720
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:05,489
I must remain here, my lady...

721
01:21:05,557 --> 01:21:07,716
at Sietch Tabr with Stilgar.

722
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:11,052
He will need my help
to bring peace back to this land.

723
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:15,387
- And you?
- I have no home but here.

724
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:20,316
Besides, there will be children again,
and they will need me.

725
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:33,080
Dear friend.

726
01:22:29,525 --> 01:22:31,014
Alia's water.

727
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:36,487
Take it into the desert and spread it
upon the open sand in the midday sun.

728
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:39,756
It is our way.

729
01:22:39,825 --> 01:22:41,814
Are you going back
to Sietch Tabr?

730
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:45,951
I wish to return
to our old ways.

731
01:22:46,026 --> 01:22:47,992
The desert's dying, Stil.

732
01:22:48,059 --> 01:22:50,991
And the Fremen, too, I'm afraid.

733
01:22:51,059 --> 01:22:54,253
We're about to go through
the crucible...

734
01:22:54,326 --> 01:22:56,884
but we'll come out
the other side.

735
01:22:56,959 --> 01:22:59,551
We always arise
from our own ashes.

736
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:03,615
Everything returns later in its...
changed form.

737
01:23:10,493 --> 01:23:12,482
Your grandfather's ring...

738
01:23:15,227 --> 01:23:18,091
and your father's.

739
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,149
And now the Fremen's...

740
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,849
to remind you of Muad'Dib...

741
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,418
to remind you
that all humans make mistakes...

742
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:31,085
and that all leaders
are but human.

743
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:14,452
He runs and runs and runs.

744
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:18,650
And when he's exhausted himself...

745
01:24:20,395 --> 01:24:22,384
he returns to me...

746
01:24:24,028 --> 01:24:26,017
puts his head in my lap...

747
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:30,682
and asks me to help him
find a way to die.

748
01:24:31,628 --> 01:24:33,651
But why does he want to die?

749
01:24:35,595 --> 01:24:37,618
To save himself...

750
01:24:39,128 --> 01:24:42,322
from the sacrifices
he must make--

751
01:24:42,395 --> 01:24:46,122
sacrifices for the future of us all.

752
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:48,922
Then there is a place for me
in this future?

753
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:52,952
Your blood was spared
the day Leto came back to me.

754
01:24:53,662 --> 01:24:55,651
What of our marriage then?

755
01:25:02,361 --> 01:25:05,089
As my mother was not wife...

756
01:25:05,162 --> 01:25:07,491
you shall never be husband.

757
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:09,954
Politics.

758
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:12,851
Politics.

759
01:25:14,129 --> 01:25:16,118
But in time, there may be love...

760
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:20,351
which is more
than my brother will have.

761
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:38,058
One of us
had to accept the agony.

762
01:25:39,462 --> 01:25:41,451
He was always the stronger.

763
01:25:50,629 --> 01:25:53,823
<i>History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

764
01:25:55,596 --> 01:25:58,323
<i>A chapter has ended...</i>

765
01:25:58,396 --> 01:26:00,385
<i>swept away by the whirlwind.</i>

766
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:04,119
<i>One door has closed...</i>

767
01:26:05,096 --> 01:26:07,085
<i>but another has opened.</i>

768
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,822
<i>And on the other side...</i>

769
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:13,452
<i>our future.</i>

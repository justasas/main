1
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,807
<i>History is written</i>
<i>on the sands of Arrakis...</i>

2
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,908
<i>where rebellion and civil war</i>
<i>continue to breed...</i>

3
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,751
<i>fed by Alia's brutal tyranny</i>
<i>and repression...</i>

4
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,280
<i>as she sinks deeper into</i>
<i>the abomination of her own ghosts...</i>

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,963
<i>unable to recognize the forces</i>
<i>conspiring against her...</i>

6
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,230
<i>unaware of the whirlwind...</i>

7
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,704
<i>sweeping towards her</i>
<i>across the desert.</i>

8
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,335
Well...

9
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,404
who's gonna explain this to me?

10
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,676
Who's gonna tell me why
I have rioting in my streets...

11
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,882
why my name is being used as a curse?

12
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,616
You simple fools.

13
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,629
The royal twins are missing
from Sietch Tabr.

14
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,996
Lady Jessica
has been abducted off-world.

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,935
Rebel alliances are being formed
by tribes to the south.

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:15,407
And now we have anarchy
in the streets of Arakeen!

17
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,205
You are to blame.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,313
Go.

19
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,783
Perhaps you should rest, milady.

20
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,231
It's difficult to think clearly
when one is exhausted by stress.

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,099
Leave me. I'm fine.

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,536
Such a pity, eh?

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,943
Why did you send
that lovely boy away?

24
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,574
I'm not in the mood to indulge
your lurid perversions tonight.

25
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,141
Are they mine
or simply yours in disguise?

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,417
After all, I'm only enjoying...

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,458
what you started.

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,288
Is that so?

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,625
Don't forget, child.
I'm not really here.

30
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,257
I'm simply the manifestation...

31
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,631
of what you already are.

32
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,676
Go away! Go away!

33
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,749
Who else knows they are
requesting sanctuary here?

34
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,787
The Spacing Guild, of course.

35
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,415
They would provide transport
with Idaho's bribes.

36
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,360
The Bene Gesserit will surely be
informed, if they don't know already.

37
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,795
Then Alia will be forced
to implicate us in this adventure.

38
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,364
She'll have to make it appear
as if we arranged the whole thing.

39
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,531
We should refuse them safe harbor...

40
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,576
return them to Arrakis and wash
our hands of the entire matter.

41
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,669
On the contrary, Tyek.

42
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,680
Perhaps we should think
of Lady Jessica's visit...

43
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,410
as an endowment, not a threat.

44
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,050
The woman has many talents, I've read.
Perhaps they could be of some use to us.

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,056
You mean to you.

46
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,151
I see no reason why I shouldn't continue
my education by all means necessary.

47
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,391
Any woman who can seduce
Duke Leto Atreides...

48
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,924
and a planet of desert Fremen
is not to be trifled with.

49
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,994
Are you suggesting
she might try to seduce me?

50
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,769
Don't play the fool, Farad'n.

51
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,917
She would be a dangerous guest.

52
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,921
But... a grateful one.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,094
He may have a point.

54
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,351
May the wind strip the flesh
from your bones.

55
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,981
May Shai-Hulud
clear the path before you.

56
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,648
<i>Sachar-Nabai.</i>
When we meet again.

57
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,195
My skin is not my own.

58
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,767
The Golden Path is dangerous, Son.

59
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,706
It's the choice I couldn't take...

60
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,676
the desert storm
that cannot be stopped.

61
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,116
You will become that storm...

62
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,878
my son--

63
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,647
the whirlwind.

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,484
And nothing will be able
to stop you...

65
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,990
not even yourself.

66
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,990
This is for Leto.

67
00:09:55,394 --> 00:10:00,024
We've confirmed that it was
Ghanima's knife that killed Palimbasha.

68
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,967
And the communicator he was wearing?

69
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,369
Off-world manufacture for sure.

70
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,671
We found a transceiver implanted
in a tiger's neck.

71
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
And we also found this in the desert.

72
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,053
Should I arrange transport
to the palace?

73
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,560
No!

74
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,264
Whoever will benefit
from the death of these children...

75
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,630
will not rest until
they're sure they've succeeded.

76
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,192
Until the time is right...

77
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,034
she'll be safer here than anywhere.

78
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,107
Sand trout.

79
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,450
So you know your desert farming,
young Atreides.

80
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,552
That's right, Atreides.
Don't be foolish.

81
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,827
We have your water in our cup.

82
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,317
<i>Alive? She's alive?</i>

83
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,817
That clever bitch Ghanima
survived our tigers.

84
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,622
We must improvise quickly.

85
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,631
Tell our man in the Atreides palace,
the priest Javid...

86
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,658
he must stir Alia's pot some more.

87
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,328
Yes, Princess.

88
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,816
<i>They left our priest's body</i>
<i>where we would be sure to find it.</i>

89
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,843
He was assassinated by Fremen rebels
from a sietch near Hirbana Erg.

90
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,288
He was traveling with diplomatic
immunity when they attacked.

91
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,161
They carved blasphemy
into his skin, milady.

92
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,792
Horrible, profane curses
about you and your family.

93
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,703
"Cursed be the name Atreides.

94
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,176
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

95
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,843
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

96
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,217
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths."

97
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,954
The obscenities
of desert rebels, Holiness.

98
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,627
An example must be made...

99
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,631
to warn other tribes what happens...

100
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,031
if they persist
in this insurrection.

101
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,761
No mercy.

102
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,309
I want all traces of
the rebel sietch wiped out.

103
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,873
You will be Leto...

104
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,706
son of Muad'Dib.

105
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,541
I am Sabiha.

106
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,276
I am meant to watch over you.

107
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,013
Yes, and no doubt kill me
if I try to escape.

108
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,021
That won't happen.

109
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,461
Drink.

110
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:47,173
I warn you, any attempt at witchery
shall result in immediate execution.

111
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,774
We are seeking safe harbor,
not an opportunity for treachery.

112
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,183
So you say.
But why should we risk...

113
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,484
sheltering fugitives
from the Imperium?

114
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,024
Who says that we are fugitives?

115
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,560
Your confrontation with Alia
has already taken on...

116
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,291
mythic proportions, Lady Jessica.

117
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:10,734
Several Fremen tribes are known to be
in open revolt against the Quizrate.

118
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,293
Civil war seems imminent.

119
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,100
My grandchildren will prevent that.

120
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,968
Not if they're dead.

121
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,044
I'm sorry, Jessica Atreides...

122
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,546
to be the bearer of bad news, but...

123
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,879
it seems your grandchildren
have been the victims...

124
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,476
of a well-planned
assassination plot.

125
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,319
- Assassination?
- Our reports indicate...

126
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,453
the Atreides twins went missing
from Sietch Tabr.

127
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,827
They were attacked in the desert.

128
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,560
Leto was killed.

129
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,295
They're not sure
what became of the girl.

130
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,272
We have reason to believe Alia herself
may have planned the killings.

131
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,639
- That is impossible.
- Jessica.

132
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,907
It's well known your daughter's
on the verge of abomination.

133
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,006
Since Muad'Dib's heirs
were of age...

134
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,519
they were soon to be invested
with all the powers of his government.

135
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:06,752
Alia's role as regent
was coming to an end unless--

136
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,057
unless your grandchildren
could be eliminated...

137
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,224
and the blame laid on her enemies.

138
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,891
On us.

139
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:22,402
Events on Arrakis are spinning
wildly out of control...

140
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,408
Jessica Atreides.

141
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:28,708
Now, we can retreat and watch
the empire collapse on top of us...

142
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,308
or we can give each other sanctuary.

143
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,285
I can protect you
from Alia's reach...

144
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,652
and you can protect me
from her madness.

145
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,195
And how do I do that?

146
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,527
By announcing publicly that we did not
kidnap you, as Alia now alleges--

147
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:54,061
that you came of your own free will,
an emissary of the Bene Gesserit...

148
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,073
sent to...

149
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,905
take over the education of my son.

150
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,047
You want me to teach him
as the Bene Gesserit are taught?

151
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,311
An offer I could not resist.

152
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,926
Your mentat is conspicuous
by his silence.

153
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,527
One must be careful to evaluate...

154
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,088
who has the advantage
in such situations.

155
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,658
Perhaps there is
mutual advantage all around.

156
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,844
Stilgar refuses
to allow Ghanima to travel...

157
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,007
saying she's not strong enough...

158
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,881
saying her safety
cannot be guaranteed.

159
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,445
- He has offered sanctuary.
- He is naib of the sietch.

160
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,619
- We cannot overrule his wishes.
- We'll see about that.

161
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,959
The activities at Tabr
are curious and provocative.

162
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,330
No one is allowed to visit or depart
without Stilgar's permission.

163
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,392
They're planning to go over
to the rebels.

164
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,131
That's unlikely.

165
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,139
We know Stilgar
has initiated dialogue...

166
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:06,007
with the insurgent naibs to the south,
but only as emissary.

167
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,844
Continue your surveillance
of Sietch Tabr.

168
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,849
I want to know who's coming
and who's going...

169
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,385
and where all the communications
are directed.

170
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,320
Time to pay Stilgar a visit.

171
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,384
<i>If you hadn't taken them from</i>
<i>the city in the first place...</i>

172
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,395
- this never would have happened.
- I am their guardian, Alia.

173
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,954
Are you suggesting she wouldn't
be safe at the palace with me?

174
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,832
I am demanding that she not be used
as a pawn in a civil war.

175
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,304
You know as well as I that Ghanima
must be returned to the court.

176
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,997
She's right, Irulan.

177
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:43,981
As long as I designate
Sietch Tabr neutral territory...

178
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,646
no violence may be committed
by any party to this conflict.

179
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:54,715
However, holding Ghanima against
the imperial regent's will...

180
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,852
could be considered abduction.

181
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,591
As naib of this sietch...

182
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:06,434
I surrender Ghanima to
the imperial regent on one condition--

183
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,338
that the Princess Irulan
accompany her.

184
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,502
If any harm comes
to either the princess...

185
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,806
or the royal heir...

186
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,872
the neutrality of this tribe
will be forfeit...

187
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,147
and allegiance
to the imperial throne...

188
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,653
disavowed.

189
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,683
Agreed.

190
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,828
I want the girl ready.
We leave for Arakeen immediately.

191
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,994
Forgive me, Irulan.

192
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,470
I may have placed you
in grave danger.

193
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,097
Keep feeding him more and more.

194
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,134
The more we feed him,
the deeper his trance.

195
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,137
The deeper the trance,
the more dangerous the trance.

196
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,607
- He's stronger than we thought.
- Then we must increase what we give him.

197
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,126
By the time we're through,
he'll be as mad as Alia.

198
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,574
What are you doing to me?

199
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,811
That's spice essence!

200
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,377
Do you hear them--
the voices in your head?

201
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,612
Are you crazy yet, like your aunt?

202
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,417
Does that frighten you?

203
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,219
Not as much as
it will frighten you, Atreides.

204
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,971
<i>Listen to me, Leto.</i>

205
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,735
Put the weapon away, Cast Out.

206
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,099
That is what you are, isn't it?

207
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,734
Adopting the chameleon colors
of a smuggler tribe...

208
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,301
in order to keep
your true identity secret.

209
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,314
Allowing us to survive.
Trading spice.

210
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,646
That's not all, is it?

211
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,946
You're breeding sand trout.

212
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,354
I've seen the holding pens.

213
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:23,224
Selling worms off-planet, you hope to
break the Atreides monopoly on spice.

214
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,525
It is dangerous for you
to know these things.

215
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,623
More dangerous for you.

216
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,895
None of your worms survive long
away from Dune.

217
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,335
- Not yet.
- Not ever.

218
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,035
You're already saturated with spice.

219
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,600
And it can no longer harm me.

220
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,088
I have survived the crucible, Sabiha.

221
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,350
I have silenced the voices
within who would have possessed me.

222
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,860
Only I remain now
to do what I must do.

223
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,902
And what is that?

224
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,598
Save the desert.

225
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,486
My skin is not my own.

226
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,849
I can't-- I can't do it.

227
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,910
You can. You will.

228
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:07,857
I'm here. I try to see myself there,
but I can't.

229
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,894
- I can't.
- Patience.

230
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:17,298
Concentrate on visualizing
the flow of time.

231
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,666
It must move, not you.

232
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,947
It would have been easier
to begin this when you were younger.

233
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,576
I'm surprised you never asked
for a Bene Gesserit teacher before.

234
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,143
They'd have leapt at the opportunity
to put you in their debt.

235
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,988
My mother had other training
in mind for me when I was younger.

236
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,654
- You can still learn.
- If I'm patient?

237
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,754
You must learn
each and every muscle...

238
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,130
as if it were a single string
on a baliset.

239
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,432
When you learn how
to play them individually...

240
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,939
you'll know how
to play them together.

241
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,670
The union of opposites,
isn't it, Jessica?

242
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,578
Recognizing the essential
instability of our universe...

243
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,609
one must learn to make it
one's own creation.

244
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,713
It is the Bene Gesserit way.

245
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,224
So you haven't forgotten
everything you were taught.

246
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,453
You need a bath.

247
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,464
We'll continue tomorrow.

248
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,233
He is a slow learner.

249
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,364
On the contrary, he's making more
progress than I would have expected...

250
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,466
in so short a time.

251
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,477
And you?

252
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,844
I know what I intend to get
out of this relationship, Wencisia.

253
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,140
What is it you expect?

254
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,623
Our houses are at
their crossroads, Jessica--

255
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,784
families weakened from within.

256
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,956
You and I both confront the greatest
danger from those closest to us.

257
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,626
You have a daughter
from whom you are estranged.

258
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,101
I have a son
in whom I have little confidence.

259
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,604
What do you expect me
to do about that?

260
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,664
Simply...

261
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,767
consider the union of opposites.

262
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,578
We hear rumors
of your granddaughter.

263
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,415
- Ghanima?
- It seems she has survived.

264
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,751
Alia has taken her from Stilgar,
but Irulan is with her.

265
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,455
Get to the point, Wencisia.

266
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,834
An alliance.

267
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,665
Corrino and Atreides.

268
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,364
An alliance through marriage.

269
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,566
Under your tutelage.

270
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,939
Farad'n could be fashioned
into an acceptable mate...

271
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,979
for someone as special
as your granddaughter.

272
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:45,709
He has his talents,
and he's a fast learner, as you say.

273
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,651
Worse things could happen...

274
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,178
than an alliance
between old enemies.

275
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,055
Your son was clever enough
to see its potential once.

276
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,995
Surely you can see
the need for it now.

277
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,599
The idea repulses me.

278
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,763
Surely your mentat reasoning
can see the value in it.

279
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,603
That an Atreides would willingly
marry into the house...

280
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,644
that has vowed its destruction--
it's madness!

281
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,839
That's exactly what my son did
when he married Irulan.

282
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,316
Politics ruled that decision,
and it averted a war.

283
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,354
Do you not see the similarity
to our present situation?

284
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,219
Do you really think Alia
will agree to a marriage...

285
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,657
between Ghanima and Farad'n?

286
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:36,190
She is the reason you must be the one
to deliver this proposal.

287
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,166
She loved you once, Duncan, and
there's a part of her that still does.

288
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,434
You're the only one who might
reach that part of her...

289
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,446
that still knows who she is.

290
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,354
She's lost to me now.

291
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,649
You saw the evidence of that yourself.

292
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,570
You could be saving the life
of Paul's daughter, Duncan.

293
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,608
As long as Ghani lives,
she's a threat to Alia.

294
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,377
If we can make my daughter
believe that her niece...

295
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,750
is the means to eliminating
an even greater threat...

296
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,755
we can save her life...

297
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,951
and buy precious time.

298
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,697
I assume you see merit
to this marriage proposal...

299
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,937
since you gambled your own safety
to deliver it personally.

300
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,707
Merit and risk.

301
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,010
You must decide which bears
the greater weight.

302
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,073
My priests object to the idea.

303
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,346
Because they are
myopic and parochial...

304
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,447
interested only in preserving
their own power.

305
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,015
Be careful, Duncan.

306
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,061
You're already standing
on the precipice.

307
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,964
It is no secret desert rebels probe
your defenses with increased success.

308
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:20,300
Riots here in Arakeen are the subject
of much discussion off-world.

309
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,205
Whispers of weakness and disarray
are spreading amongst the great houses.

310
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:29,144
Rumors encouraged by my enemies
to spread doubt and fear.

311
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,182
The jackals are gathering, Alia.

312
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,445
An alliance between
Corrino and Atreides...

313
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,750
would serve as reassurance
and a warning.

314
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,286
Prepare a formal response
to House Corrino.

315
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,330
We will allow negotiations
for a union...

316
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,661
between Ghanima
and Prince Farad'n to begin.

317
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:53,363
But make it clear,
Atreides interests will dominate.

318
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,408
Leave me.

319
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,706
Only my husband may remain.

320
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,820
I should have you executed
for what you did.

321
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,692
My diplomatic immunity
as Corrino envoy...

322
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,198
would make that an unwise decision.

323
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,326
Why did you come back here?

324
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,736
My allegiance to House Atreides
would permit nothing less.

325
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,969
I played no part in your decision?

326
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,372
I struggled not to allow it.

327
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,175
You can't remain at the keep.

328
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,243
I must banish you
for your treachery.

329
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:47,052
Otherwise, people would question
my judgement, my ruthlessness.

330
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,992
A quality you must demonstrate
often these days, no doubt.

331
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,325
They're difficult days, Duncan.

332
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,695
Lonely days.

333
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,044
I've missed you.

334
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,690
Where would you have me go?

335
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,294
Sietch Tabr.
Neutral territory.

336
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,704
Stilgar is trying to broker a peace
between the Quizrate and the rebels.

337
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,766
Perhaps your mentat qualities
can be useful.

338
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,770
At least you'll be safe there.

339
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,755
There is no one to restrain Alia.

340
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,929
Her forces are probing deeper and deeper
into the southern regions...

341
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,971
attacking rebel sietches
wherever she thinks they are.

342
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,066
And still, there are riots
in the streets of Arakeen itself.

343
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,670
And what of the boy Leto?
What do they say about him?

344
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,113
If he survived the assassin,
he did not survive the desert.

345
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:23,415
Worms, storms--
There won't be a body.

346
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,756
Where are you going?

347
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,125
- To look for the boy.
- That cannot be permitted.

348
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,831
We never had any intention of helping
someone like you, enemy of ours.

349
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,564
Cursed be your name, Atreides.

350
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,734
Burning be on you for the abomination
you have visited on our desert.

351
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,777
You shall have no soul, no spirit.

352
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:50,371
You shall not be permitted
to come up from the depths.

353
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:17,030
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm...

354
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,700
is the worm.

355
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,678
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

356
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:33,019
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

357
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,651
I will not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

358
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,958
I will face my fear.
I will let it pass through me.

359
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,432
I will not fear!
Fear is the mind killer!

360
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,732
I will face my fear!
I will let it pass through me!

361
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,738
I will not fear!

362
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,383
I could have killed you.

363
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,480
It wouldn't have been that easy.

364
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,121
I wanted to believe you.

365
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,563
I wanted to believe that
I could do it, but I didn't.

366
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,091
I couldn't.
I didn't truly think it was possible.

367
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,502
And then my mind melted away.

368
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,473
I gave up fighting you,
and it happened.

369
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,974
It wasn't me you were fighting.

370
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,807
It was myself.

371
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,473
All that I've learned-- all the
nonsense I've imprisoned myself with--

372
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,140
I feel--

373
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,754
I feel like I'm being reborn...

374
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,990
like I'm standing on the threshold
of something extraordinary.

375
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,428
Para-Bindu balance, Farad'n.

376
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,934
But only on the threshold.

377
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,800
- Patience?
- Yes, patience.

378
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,174
Remember...

379
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,346
it's one thing to gain control
of your perceptions...

380
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,249
quite another to gain control
of your desires.

381
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,821
And if I succeed?

382
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,790
You'll find reality to be quite
a bit different than you thought.

383
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,984
My skin is not my own.

384
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,433
Must you insist on
sneaking away like this?

385
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,342
I still feel him, Irulan.

386
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:52,878
His presence. Sometimes I even think
I can hear his laughter in the wind.

387
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,851
Mocking your decision
to marry Farad'n, I hope.

388
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,251
Why should he mock it?

389
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:01,087
I cannot stand by and let you be used
as a pawn in Alia's schemes.

390
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,322
Is that what you think,
that I'm being used?

391
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:09,355
That I've agreed to this marriage
as part of some conspiracy with Alia?

392
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:13,631
No. But I know you, Ghani.

393
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,673
There is more to your decision
than anyone else believes.

394
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,140
Alia wants my grandmother back.

395
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,270
Farad'n is simply the means.

396
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,938
But what do you want?

397
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:32,654
Farad'n's blood on
the wedding sheets, not mine.

398
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,791
<i>You cannot remain neutral</i>
<i>any longer, Stilgar.</i>

399
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,125
You must ally your tribe
with the rebel forces.

400
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,831
Never! Rebellion against
the sister of Muad'Dib...

401
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,672
would bring the greatest dishonor
I could imagine.

402
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,577
There is no more sister of Muad'Dib.
She's gone--

403
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,979
lost to the evil that possesses her.

404
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,313
And as long as you refuse
to believe it, you wear its collar.

405
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:05,048
Enough!
You are the guest of my tribe.

406
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,386
I have given you my countenance.

407
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:12,486
But I swear, if you provoke me further
with talk of insurrection...

408
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,862
I will have your water!

409
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,403
What is it, Tariq?

410
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,038
- Why have we stopped?
- Desert demon.

411
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,716
In human form.

412
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,879
There are no such things.

413
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,104
Your guide has released the worm.

414
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,809
We have a little time
before he returns.

415
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,382
You made it stop.

416
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,382
The worm obeyed your command.

417
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,791
Yes.

418
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,031
They say Leto Atreides is dead...

419
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,567
killed by Corrino treachery.

420
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,433
A myth I have allowed to persist
until I am ready.

421
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,937
For what?

422
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:08,235
To undo what's been done
in your name... Father.

423
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,350
You have no idea who I am.

424
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,984
This is your ring, Father.

425
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,831
Passed from Duke Leto to you,
and then unto me.

426
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,966
How far has it gone...

427
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,032
this thing you've done to yourself?

428
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,945
I am a desert creature.

429
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,782
Was there no other way?

430
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,710
There was only one way
to bring about The Golden Path.

431
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,620
You cannot control the future.

432
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:32,385
A man named Muad'Dib
should have heeded that advice.

433
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,830
Do you think Muad'Dib couldn't see
the thing that you want to do?

434
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,026
Do you think he didn't
confront the possibility?

435
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,400
Muad'Dib was afraid.

436
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,601
He was trapped
by his own prophecy...

437
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:51,079
a victim of what he knew
he could not choose.

438
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:54,049
So I have chosen...

439
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,552
to make a world where humankind
can create its own future...

440
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,350
from moment to moment...

441
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,448
free of one man's vision...

442
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,551
free from the perversion
of the prophet's words...

443
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,965
and free of future
pre-determined.

444
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,930
This does not belong to me.

445
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:23,169
How many nights I have sat
on a dune just like this...

446
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,578
imagining a night just like this...

447
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,278
with my father.

448
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,058
Just the two of us...

449
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,097
talking and-- and laughing.

450
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,360
And how many nights I have gone to sleep
on the cold floor of the sietch...

451
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,838
dreaming of his arms around me...

452
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,967
sheltering me from everything
I was afraid of...

453
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,534
everything I could not understand.

454
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,477
Are you still a good Fremen?

455
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,484
Yes.

456
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,179
Then will you permit...

457
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,281
a blind man...

458
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,417
to go out into the desert...

459
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,292
and find peace on his own terms?

460
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,170
Not yet.

461
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:37,179
Cursed be the name Atreides.

462
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,882
Body shield. Armed.

463
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,572
Eight of nine new settlements
have been abandoned.

464
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:09,312
Many of the old sietch communities
are becoming overrun with refugees.

465
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:15,557
The holy regent demands that you abandon
your pledge of neutrality.

466
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:20,086
Ally your forces with hers and
put an end to this damnable rebellion.

467
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,599
Alia is Fremen.

468
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:27,000
She knows she cannot make
such a demand on me...

469
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,265
or on any other naib!

470
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,270
You can no longer remain
above the fight, Stilgar.

471
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,506
Your feeble attempts to mediate
have accomplished nothing.

472
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,048
It is time for you to choose.

473
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:42,813
Are you with the empire
or against it?

474
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,911
It is not a choice
I will make because...

475
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,015
some fop of a priest demands it.

476
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,130
Well, perhaps the royal consort...

477
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,689
can talk some sense
into this obstinate fool.

478
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,805
I can do better than that.

479
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,209
The "royal cuckold" thanks you
for this opportunity.

480
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,787
Stilgar will now make his choice.

481
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:27,387
You have violated sanctuary.

482
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,161
You have defiled...

483
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,295
the honor of my people.

484
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,836
No, Stil.

485
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,537
I have just cut the collar
from around your neck.

486
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,913
That was the right choice, Stil.

487
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,521
Two deaths for the Atreides...

488
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,494
the second one for no better reason
than the first.

489
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,380
It was a sign.

490
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,281
He forced our hand.

491
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:26,618
Now Alia will be forced
to move against us.

492
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,623
<i>He has taken the tribe</i>
<i>into the desert.</i>

493
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,629
No one knows where...

494
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,461
but his only refuge
will be with the rebels.

495
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,633
Idaho acted impulsively, milady.
He was--

496
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,696
Was my husband!

497
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,842
Kanly...

498
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,106
vendetta...

499
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,877
on Stilgar and all of his tribe
that joined him.

500
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,344
Let them be hunted down
like desert rabbits.

501
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,151
<i>Yes, yes. Kill them.</i>

502
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,748
I want their skins
when they're caught.

503
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,727
<i>Nice touch, yes.</i>
<i>Very creative.</i>

504
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,986
This is the one
we took on the south face.

505
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,027
He came across the bled
from the south wall.

506
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,622
So, they say you rode a worm here.

507
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,859
A 20-thumper ride.

508
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,199
- And yet, you are not Fremen.
- They taught me well.

509
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:56,803
Rumors across the desert
say you're dead, Gurney Halleck.

510
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,041
There are many
who wished it were true.

511
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:04,679
The sons of Esmar Tuek
are not among them, old friend.

512
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,466
We've been waiting on you,
Gurney Halleck.

513
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,475
- How did you know I'd come here?
- My father told me.

514
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,737
Your father?

515
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,911
Well, in the desert,
sheltered once is sheltered always.

516
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,919
After the Harkonnen invasion,
these were the men who protected you...

517
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,922
before you were finally
reunited with Muad'Dib.

518
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,584
A reunion which allowed me
to join his rebellion...

519
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,594
against Shaddam
and the imperial forces.

520
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,758
Another rebellion awaits you,
Gurney Halleck.

521
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,323
My loyalty is to House Atreides.

522
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,097
I am House Atreides.

523
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,833
And what of your aunt?

524
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,603
My aunt is lost--

525
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,372
lost to forces
she could not control...

526
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,005
to forces who want
to destroy House Atreides.

527
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,379
What have you done to yourself?

528
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,441
I have made a choice...

529
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,612
accepted a destiny, nothing more.

530
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,515
My eyes can see it...

531
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,082
but my mind refuses to believe it.

532
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,094
Believe it, Gurney.

533
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,322
Remember the words of my father
and my grandfather, your duke.

534
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,926
They spoke to you of desert power.

535
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,632
I am desert power...

536
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,336
and nothing can stop
what is going to happen.

537
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,588
We are here to honor
the throne of Muad'Dib...

538
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,190
and his sister, the holy regent.

539
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:50,606
We are here to honor his esteemed
daughter with the presentation...

540
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,972
of our son, Prince Farad'n...

541
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:58,742
heir to the throne
of House Corrino.

542
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,483
We offer our deepest condolences
on the loss of your brother.

543
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,619
Perhaps the union of our houses...

544
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,817
can put an end to the treachery
that took his life...

545
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,464
treachery that was bred
on Salusa Secundus.

546
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,200
What did you say?

547
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,265
I am ashamed to say that the animals
that killed Leto, son of Muad'Dib...

548
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,173
were created and trained
on my planet.

549
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,769
And the regent of House Corrino
knew of this?

550
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,808
- She planned it.
- How dare you!

551
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,251
I'll dare quite a few things
from now on, Mother.

552
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,188
You've been quite adept
at making decisions in my name...

553
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,452
decisions which I've found
extremely distasteful.

554
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,084
You insolent bastard.

555
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,324
Let's not discuss
your weaknesses now, Mother.

556
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,633
I forbid you to say another word.

557
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,000
You forbid nothing.

558
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:59,508
As heir to the throne of House Corrino,
I am now the author of my own decisions.

559
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:03,876
My mother is stripped of all accounts
and privileges of the House Corrino.

560
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,108
She is no longer
sovereign regent of this family.

561
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:10,710
She is, from this moment forward,
banished.

562
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,501
You're more of a man
than I'd ever thought possible.

563
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:33,564
And you can spend the rest of your days
pondering that in utter darkness.

564
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,976
Patience is a virtue I have
in abundance, if you haven't noticed.

565
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,812
Hold.

566
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,867
Did you have anything to do
with the death of my brother?

567
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,802
I knew nothing of the plot against him
until it was too late.

568
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:07,402
Forgive me.
I am at your mercy.

569
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:12,272
This is my wedding present to you.

570
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:16,409
I have nothing else.
No dowry.

571
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,785
Only the truth.

572
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,891
I believe him.

573
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:39,740
Take her. Leave him.

574
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,902
Maybe he'll amuse us
with more intrigue...

575
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,105
and double-cross in the days to come.

576
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,075
Don't you find it interesting,
Jessica...

577
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:55,090
how the sins of the mother
bloom in the children they bear?

578
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,987
<i>She's weakened by madness.</i>

579
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,055
She still commands
the imperial armies.

580
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,124
They are retreating to the city...

581
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:43,104
trapped by the shield wall
from which they are vulnerable.

582
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,141
They say the price on your head
keeps going up.

583
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,007
Then I say unto you...

584
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,069
send men...

585
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,548
to summon worms!

586
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:58,983
Then let us go...

587
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,148
to Arakeen...

588
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,385
to collect it.

589
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,156
Manut.

590
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,364
A storm.

591
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,429
Not a storm.

592
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,410
- I must get word to the palace.
- Yeah.

593
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,525
Don't be afraid, Gurney-Man.

594
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,672
There is no way...

595
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,074
to hasten
what is meant to be.

596
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,707
When the time is right...

597
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,512
he will find us.

598
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,361
Who are you?

599
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,761
Who I am
doesn't matter anymore.

600
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,962
It matters to me.

601
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,768
Do you think I would have
left this place if I had known?

602
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,709
Do you think I would have abandoned you
if I knew you were still alive?

603
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,769
You did what you
were meant to do.

604
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,575
Tell me.

605
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,984
Let me hear you say it.

606
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,318
Tell me it isn't true.

607
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,488
I couldn't live...

608
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,996
if I knew I had forsaken you.

609
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,664
Paul Atreides is no more,
Gurney-Man.

610
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:10,306
The desert winds have erased
all trace of his passage here.

611
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,075
And soon...

612
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,643
Muad'Dib must follow.

613
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,819
Please, Gurney, I'm tired...

614
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,383
hungry.

615
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,924
Get me some food.

616
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,110
Ah, Stil. So predictable.

617
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:55,080
It's as if they're daring you
to confront them...

618
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,456
challenging you
to commit troops, thopters.

619
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:03,089
They think I've retreated to the
sanctuary of the city where I'm trapped.

620
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,429
It's a tactic learned from my brother
when he defeated Shaddam...

621
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,765
and took back Arrakis.

622
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,395
Poor Stil.

623
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:13,137
If you only knew
it is you who are trapped...

624
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,699
not I.

625
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,610
They are still over a day's ride
from Arakeen.

626
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,345
Fine.

627
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,407
I'm going back to the palace.

628
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,214
I have a wedding to attend.

629
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,802
Leave me.

630
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,343
Do as I say!

631
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,865
There's no need for that
with me, Ghanima.

632
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,009
Our plan worked.

633
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,571
You're alive!

634
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,908
I knew it.

635
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,236
Oh, I have missed you.

636
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,544
I'm sorry, Ghanima.

637
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,220
I'm so sorry.

638
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,625
I had to let you think that I was dead.
It was the only way--

639
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:50,153
the only way that I could start
what must now be finished.

640
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:14,020
Idolaters! Blasphemers!

641
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,081
You'll spoil this place!

642
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,084
The desert will swallow you!

643
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:46,851
His words are sacrilege.
His presence must not be tolerated.

644
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,288
You must give the order, Holy One.

645
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,189
You must send us to take him.

646
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,855
<i>Caution, darling.</i>
<i>Do not act impulsively.</i>

647
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,591
Not yet.

648
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,395
He is an outrage
to the religion of Muad'Dib.

649
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,164
<i>But that's the point, my darling.</i>

650
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,435
We must know for sure whether
he really is your brother...

651
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,998
mustn't we?

652
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,307
It would not do to make
a martyr of him just yet.

653
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,647
Who is it
that calls for Muad'Dib?

654
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,711
Help us, Muad'Dib.

655
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,320
Muad'Dib's words are the wind.

656
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:04,559
They vanish...
like water on the sand.

657
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,202
I'll give you Muad'Dib's words.

658
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,364
I'll rub your faces in them!

659
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,102
I am the voice
from the wilderness...

660
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,339
and I bring you a warning.

661
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:24,811
The water we spread upon the desert
has become blood.

662
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:31,318
Blood... upon the land
which was once clean and pure.

663
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:37,198
We have provoked the desert...
forsaken its ways.

664
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,633
We have succumbed
to mindless ritual...

665
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,898
and seductive ceremony...

666
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:46,408
placed faith in those
who crush dissent...

667
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,739
enrich themselves with power...

668
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,170
commit atrocity.

669
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,878
All in the name
of righteousness!

670
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,476
All in the name...

671
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,113
of Muad'Dib.

672
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,322
We have fouled the nest...

673
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,087
and it is killing us.

674
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:14,263
But I have seen another path...

675
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,962
a golden path--

676
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,175
the path Muad'Dib could not take.

677
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,474
I have stood upon the sand...

678
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,580
and I have seen a beast rise up.

679
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:37,983
And upon the head of that beast...

680
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,787
is the name of salvation...

681
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,232
come to spill water
upon the sand...

682
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,338
come to lead us back...

683
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,945
to a dry and thirsty land.

684
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,376
Only one blasphemy remains...

685
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,410
and that blasphemy...

686
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,451
is Alia!

687
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,225
Forgive me...

688
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,735
Sister.

689
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,300
It's in your hands now...

690
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,482
Son.

691
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,664
Where is she?

692
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,176
Behold me, family!

693
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,404
I am Leto!

694
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,838
Lion of Atreides...

695
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,982
returned from the desert
to announce <i>Sachar Nabai</i>--

696
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:02,013
The Golden Path--

697
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:07,417
to rid humanity of the perversions
done in Muad'Dib's name...

698
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:13,197
and to save it from the abomination
known as Alia.

699
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,758
Seize him!

700
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:09,354
The time has come, Aunt.

701
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,090
You must face the future.

702
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,152
I'll drink your blood!

703
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,431
Alia, stop it!
Stop yourself!

704
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,277
You sorry bitch!

705
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:35,214
You Bene Gesserit whore!

706
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,013
Did you think
you could escape my vengeance?

707
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,220
Did you think
I was defeated forever?

708
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:46,760
I have her, daughter--
your precious Alia.

709
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,059
She's mine! I won!

710
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,358
Demon! Let her make
her own choice!

711
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:03,239
Mommy... please help me.

712
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:15,250
Help yourself.

713
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:33,270
<i>Yes! Yes, do it.</i>
<i>Sink it in.</i>

714
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,902
<i>Bathe our hands</i>
<i>in his hot blood.</i>

715
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,786
<i>No! Darling! Stop! Stop!</i>

716
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,082
<i>Stop! We're so close!</i>

717
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,720
<i>I love you. I can save you.</i>
<i>Don't stop now. We're so close.</i>

718
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,302
I want my brother.

719
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:04,050
You'll not change your mind
and return with me to Caladan?

720
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,427
I must remain here, my lady...

721
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,656
at Sietch Tabr with Stilgar.

722
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:12,996
He will need my help
to bring peace back to this land.

723
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:17,335
- And you?
- I have no home but here.

724
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:22,269
Besides, there will be children again,
and they will need me.

725
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,045
Dear friend.

726
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,036
Alia's water.

727
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:38,514
Take it into the desert and spread it
upon the open sand in the midday sun.

728
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,787
It is our way.

729
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,847
Are you going back
to Sietch Tabr?

730
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,988
I wish to return
to our old ways.

731
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,031
The desert's dying, Stil.

732
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:53,033
And the Fremen, too, I'm afraid.

733
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,298
We're about to go through
the crucible...

734
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,931
but we'll come out
the other side.

735
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,601
We always arise
from our own ashes.

736
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:05,669
Everything returns later in its...
changed form.

737
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,545
Your grandfather's ring...

738
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,159
and your father's.

739
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,219
And now the Fremen's...

740
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,923
to remind you of Muad'Dib...

741
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,495
to remind you
that all humans make mistakes...

742
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,166
and that all leaders
are but human.

743
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:16,576
He runs and runs and runs.

744
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,778
And when he's exhausted himself...

745
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,515
he returns to me...

746
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,152
puts his head in my lap...

747
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,822
and asks me to help him
find a way to die.

748
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:35,793
But why does he want to die?

749
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,764
To save himself...

750
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:44,473
from the sacrifices
he must make--

751
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:48,277
sacrifices for the future of us all.

752
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:51,079
Then there is a place for me
in this future?

753
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,113
Your blood was spared
the day Leto came back to me.

754
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,815
What of our marriage then?

755
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,262
As my mother was not wife...

756
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,667
you shall never be husband.

757
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,132
Politics.

758
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,032
Politics.

759
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,302
But in time, there may be love...

760
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,539
which is more
than my brother will have.

761
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,264
One of us
had to accept the agony.

762
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,660
He was always the stronger.

763
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:56,044
<i>History is written</i>
<i>on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

764
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,549
<i>A chapter has ended...</i>

765
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,613
<i>swept away by the whirlwind.</i>

766
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,350
<i>One door has closed...</i>

767
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,319
<i>but another has opened.</i>

768
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,059
<i>And on the other side...</i>

769
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,692
<i>our future.</i>

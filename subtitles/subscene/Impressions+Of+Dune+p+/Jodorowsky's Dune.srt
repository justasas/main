1
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,951
<i>What is the goal of the life?</i>

2
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:02,165
<i>It's to create yourself a soul.</i>

3
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,712
<i>For me, movies are an art...</i>

4
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>more than an industry.</i>

5
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:16,095
<i>And it's the search of the human soul...</i>

6
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,140
<i>as painting, as literature, as poetry.</i>

7
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,938
<i>Movies are that for me.</i>

8
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>I wanted to make a film...</i>

9
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:59,180
<i>that would give the people
who took LSD at that time...</i>

10
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:04,352
<i>the hallucinations that you get
with that drug, but without hallucinating.</i>

11
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,816
<i>I did not want LSD to be taken,
I wanted to fabricate the drug's effects.</i>

12
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>This film was going to change
the public's perceptions.</i>

13
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,001
<i>My ambition with Dune was tremendous.</i>

14
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,715
<i>So, what I wanted was to create a prophet.</i>

15
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:38,386
I want to create a prophet...

16
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:43,433
to change the young minds
of all the world.

17
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:48,980
<i>For me, Dune will be the coming of a God.</i>

18
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:54,235
<i>Artistical, cinematographical God.</i>

19
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,072
<i>For me, it was not to make a picture.</i>

20
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,825
<i>It was something deeper.</i>

21
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,495
I wanted to make something sacred...

22
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:10,418
free, with new perspective.

23
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,712
Open the mind!

24
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,676
Because I feel, in that time, myself,
inside a prison.

25
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,889
My ego, my intellect, I want to open!

26
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,353
<i>And I start the fight to make Dune.</i>

27
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>You needed a touch of madness to do it.</i>

28
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,044
<i>You can't have a masterpiece without madness.</i>

29
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,088
<i>Pink Floyd? Dali...</i>

30
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,006
<i>or Orson Welles or others!</i>

31
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,343
<i>Maybe Dune had too much madness?</i>

32
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,305
But a movie that doesn't have a bit of madness...

33
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,474
is not going to conquer the whole world.

34
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,825
I don't think that in the history of cinema...

35
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:52,205
there was ever a film that was taken that far,
only to end up not being made.

36
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,207
To become a different film,
since a film was made...

37
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,376
that had nothing to do with those
two and a half years of work.

38
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,235
<i>In the beginning, I was making theater.</i>

39
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,534
<i>In Mexico, I make 100 theater plays.</i>

40
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,623
<i>In 10 years, I make the avant garde theater.</i>

41
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,459
Ionesco, Beckett, Strindberg.

42
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,421
Modern adaptations of Shakespeare, I do.

43
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,632
One day I will make a picture.

44
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,343
<i>When I came to pictures...</i>

45
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,013
<i>I came like a virgin.</i>

46
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:37,059
<i>Without to know technical movement.</i>

47
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,812
<i>I didn't know lens, the number.
I didn't know.</i>

48
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:49,697
<i>We shoot Fando Y Lis, hiding of unions.</i>

49
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,077
<i>In Mexico, a young director
cannot make picture...</i>

50
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,664
<i>without the permission
of the old director unions.</i>

51
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:03,002
I say, "What, I need to take
the permission to make art?"

52
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,881
Artists need to be free! I do my picture!

53
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,759
<i>Then was a great scandal later, eh?</i>

54
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,387
Because I broke all the unions, I did it!

55
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,231
I was opening the mind of the industry.

56
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,303
<i>I was exposed to it
in the underground cinema in New York.</i>

57
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,640
<i>And after that, we had the courage
to attempt to distribute it in France...</i>

58
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:45,396
<i>and it was an incredible success for this movie
that was quite revolutionary...</i>

59
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,817
and a natural friendship was born
between Alejandro and me.

60
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,777
<i>Thanks to the success of El Topo...</i>

61
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,448
<i>I got one million dollars to make
The Holy Mountain.</i>

62
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,122
<i>I did whatever I wanted.</i>

63
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,999
<i>I didn't have a producer...</i>

64
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,004
<i>no critic, no one to mess with me.</i>

65
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:15,083
<i>I did what I wanted
and it was The Holy Mountain.</i>

66
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:48,250
<i>I gave the movie to Michel Seydoux in France.</i>

67
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,505
And, oh, surprise, in Europe
it attracted a great number of people...

68
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,341
<i>it was playing openly.</i>

69
00:11:56,092 --> 00:12:01,097
<i>In Italy that year,
it was the number two movie behind James Bond.</i>

70
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,101
<i>The Holy Mountain was incredible.</i>

71
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:15,444
<i>So my ambition grew.</i>

72
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,850
<i>Michel Seydoux called me from Paris
and say to me:</i>

73
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,229
<i>"Holy Mountain is a success.
I want to make a new picture with you.</i>

74
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,356
<i>Do whatever you want!"</i>

75
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,698
I have never made movies or transactions...

76
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,783
unless there was something more to them.

77
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,287
A relationship between human beings
is what makes the difference.

78
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,459
<i>He said, "I want to produce you anything.</i>

79
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,419
<i>What do you want to do?"</i>

80
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:15,629
<i>I say, "Dune!"</i>

81
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,173
And he say, "Yes."

82
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,928
<i>Why?</i>

83
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,474
<i>Because the book was
the most beautiful science-fiction book.</i>

84
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,935
<i>It was the bible of science fiction
for all the big devotees.</i>

85
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,771
Because the book had been
a worldwide publishing success...

86
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,274
<i>that you could find in every country.</i>

87
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,988
<i>I didn't read Dune.
But I have a friend who say me it was fantastic.</i>

88
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,200
<i>I don't know why I say Dune.
I can say Don Quixote...</i>

89
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,245
or I can said Hamlet.
I don't know anything.

90
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:49,830
<i>I say Dune.</i>

91
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,556
Hollywood sold us the rights for nothing...

92
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,767
mockingly on the inside, I believe...

93
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,021
thinking that we would never be able
to carry out such a thing.

94
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,194
<i>It was a great undertaking to do the script.</i>

95
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,784
<i>Michel Seydoux brought me to France.</i>

96
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,412
<i>He rented a castle, a huge castle...</i>

97
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,083
<i>and I was in that castle
dedicated solely to Dune.</i>

98
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,213
<i>Frank Herbert created a world in Dune...</i>

99
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,925
but he never said exactly what it was.

100
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:29,221
And you have a hundred pages of literature...

101
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,474
where you go on to discover,
with great difficulty...

102
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,393
what the book is about.

103
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,317
It's very- It's like-
I compare it to Proust in French literature.

104
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,902
It's literary, it's great literature.

105
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,617
<i>The first 100 pages...</i>

106
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,119
you understand almost nothing.

107
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,706
It's insinuations.

108
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:01,795
To bring literature to image
is completely difficult.

109
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:08,344
You need to create another world,
the optical world.

110
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,929
It's not the literary, auditive world.

111
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,269
<i>All the time, even in the...
in the little details...</i>

112
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,400
<i>I was trying to find
the spiritual meaning of that picture.</i>

113
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,163
<i>Now I have my script.</i>

114
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,250
I need to find the warriors.

115
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,630
The warriors to do it.

116
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:49,760
Every person who will work in this picture
will be a spiritual warrior.

117
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,137
The best I will find.

118
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,182
He had the genius to make...

119
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,852
a storyboard with Moebius.

120
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,028
I find a comic book.
The comic book was...

121
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,447
<i>Blueberry.</i>

122
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,159
<i>Cowboy book, drawing by Giraud.</i>

123
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,539
I start to see, but that guy is my camera!

124
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>Who is this?</i>

125
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,140
This is the person I need.

126
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,810
Where I will find this person? Where?

127
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,565
In that time was not Internet
to find any person.

128
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,692
I need to find this person.

129
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,824
I went to see my agent, publicity agent...

130
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,994
and there he was. By chance.

131
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,871
He was there.

132
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,789
He say, "I am Moebius."

133
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>"When I drawing science fiction,
I am not Giraud, I am Moebius."</i>

134
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:10,090
And I say to him,
"You are the person! Come with me!"

135
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,680
<i>Drawing by drawing, I shoot the picture.</i>

136
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>I need 3000 drawings.</i>

137
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,274
<i>Point of view. Movement of the camera.</i>

138
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,487
<i>Dialogue. The relation between the actors.</i>

139
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,407
<i>I use Moebius like a camera.</i>

140
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,330
<i>I take Moebius, I say,
"Now you advance." "Now you travel."</i>

141
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,667
<i>"Now you make a close-up."</i>

142
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,841
I have Moebius, who was a genius.
Moebius was a genius.

143
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:58,222
Because he was not only an artist
with an incredible capacity...

144
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,641
but he was very quick.

145
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,357
Was superhuman. He was...

146
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,651
<i>quickly, rapido, incredible.</i>

147
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,027
And then I could shoot.

148
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,864
Every day, we start to shoot...

149
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:21,453
at 8:00, we come, we prepare everything.
I think at 9:30 we start to shoot.

150
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>I made the picture with drawings.</i>

151
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,566
<i>And then in the costume, I say to him-
I describe what I wanted.</i>

152
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,694
<i>He immediately:</i>

153
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:58,031
<i>Quick, more than a computer.
He was incredible.</i>

154
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,189
Everything became magic
when we was doing this picture.

155
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,026
Everything, everything.

156
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:43,493
<i>Dune, my Dune, start with a long shot.</i>

157
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:49,791
<i>I admire the long shot
of Orson Welles' Touch of Evil.</i>

158
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,212
<i>The camera go, go, go,
traverse the street, go.</i>

159
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,759
<i>It's a fantastic big, long shot.</i>

160
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,013
<i>And then I wanted to start Dune
with a long shot...</i>

161
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,769
better than the long shot of Orson Welles.

162
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,979
I wanted to go farthest.

163
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:16,485
And then all the shot
is traversing the whole universe.

164
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:21,573
You go there and you traverse
all the galaxy, all the galaxy...

165
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,369
and in traversal of the galaxy,
you see a pirate...

166
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:33,543
robbing a convoy of spice, by example.
Battles. And you go, you go...

167
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,754
<i>Is a long shot.</i>

168
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,729
We need to find the person
who will make the special effects.

169
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,690
<i>I say, "Moebius, we fly
to California, to Los Angeles...</i>

170
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,027
<i>to the appointment of Douglas Trumbull."</i>

171
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:25,423
He was a very honored,
very important person.

172
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,927
<i>He receive me. He was interesting.</i>

173
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,137
<i>Was a business.</i>

174
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,710
We went to see Trumbull...

175
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,298
but he gives himself so big importance.

176
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,342
We was speaking, he answered...

177
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,637
4O times the telephone. Forty times.

178
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:19,728
He was speaking with so big vanity of himself.

179
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:24,608
He was a big technician.
But for me, was not a spiritual person.

180
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:29,863
He have nothing to do in the creation of a film
who was a prophet.

181
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,158
He will make a technical film, no?

182
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:57,224
And then I say, "I cannot work with you."

183
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,809
And we went out.

184
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:05,023
<i>Moebius was astonished, say,
"How you can say no to the biggest...</i>

185
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,984
technician of Hollywood?"

186
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,154
I say, "It is like that."

187
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,157
<i>I cannot use him.
He is not my spiritual warrior.</i>

188
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,581
<i>And then we was walking in the street, Hollywood...</i>

189
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:27,921
<i>there was a little cinema, a little theater.
And there was a science-fiction picture...</i>

190
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,130
Dark Star.

191
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,016
<i>And when I see the picture,
"That is the guy!"</i>

192
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,854
<i>O'Bannon.</i>

193
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,277
We will search for this person.
This person will be the person.

194
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,514
For me, the art was before, later the technique.

195
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,933
And that was O'Bannon.

196
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,254
And then he came to Paris.

197
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:20,051
And that was- I have two warriors:
Moebius and O'Bannon.

198
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,053
I need to find the others.

199
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:27,016
<i>The first actor is the father,
the Duke Leto.</i>

200
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:45,702
<i>David Carradine had starred
in a very popular television series...</i>

201
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,912
<i>in which he was a warrior...</i>

202
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,789
<i>who was taught by masters from the Orient.</i>

203
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,959
<i>It was influenced by El Topo.</i>

204
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:59,632
Then, when Carradine knew
that I wanted him, he came...

205
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,259
he came running.

206
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,973
<i>I waited for him in Los Angeles,
in a hotel room.</i>

207
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,934
I had bought vitamin E.

208
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,647
Like, this E vitamin. Half a kilo.

209
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,113
In order to take one pill every day
to have the strength.

210
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,574
<i>Carradine came to my room,
the first thing he saw...</i>

211
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,077
<i>was the pot of E vitamin.</i>

212
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,829
He say, "Oh, E vitamin!"

213
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,752
And he drink all my pills of vitamin E!

214
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,381
Like is a monstrosity! Sixty dollars was!

215
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,137
Well, was a big beginning.

216
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,515
And then I say,
"We need to work together!

217
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,808
You are the person I am searching!"

218
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,652
I wanted a musical group for every planet.

219
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,573
<i>Pink Floyd.
They will make the music of Leto.</i>

220
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:12,247
<i>Pink Floyd have a record,
Dark Side of the Moon.</i>

221
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,791
<i>For me, that is the human being,
like the moon.</i>

222
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,252
<i>One side is brilliant, light.</i>

223
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,380
And the other side who is black, the unconscious...

224
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,925
what is mysterious, what is deep.

225
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,845
It happened during a meeting.

226
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,140
<i>"Pink Floyd?"
Gibon said, "Okay, I'll go!"</i>

227
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:35,728
<i>He called Pink Floyd's agent.
He said, "Could I meet with you?"</i>

228
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,690
<i>So one day we went to London.</i>

229
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,402
They were in the middle of finishing the mixing...

230
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,905
<i>of Dark Side of the Moon,
at Abbey Road, the famous studio.</i>

231
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:53,413
And I remember, we got there...

232
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,499
and they were very standoffish...

233
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,543
pop stars, very distant.

234
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,797
They was eating. They was eating...

235
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,217
hamburgers. Four guys eating hamburgers.

236
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,886
"Hello," they say, "Hello!"

237
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,099
And nothing, I could not speak,
they was eating.

238
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:16,394
All of a sudden, Jodo-
We called him Jodo.

239
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,189
Jodo said,
"No. They're pissing me off. Let's go!"

240
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,483
I start to insulted them.

241
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,031
"How you don't understand I offer to you...

242
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:34,370
the most important picture
in the history of the humanity!

243
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,789
We will change the world!

244
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,167
And you are eating...

245
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,713
eating Big Macs. How?"

246
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,217
And then they stop
and they speak with me.

247
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,305
And after that, it went very, very well.

248
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,765
Very, very well, yeah.

249
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,769
<i>And we was speaking to make a big album
with the music of Dune.</i>

250
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,980
Could be fantastic, no?

251
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,111
<i>In my version, the Duke Leto...</i>

252
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,116
he is castrated.

253
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,911
And then how he will do a son?

254
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,205
<i>And then his wife...</i>

255
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:21,668
a marvelous woman, a wise woman...

256
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:28,091
<i>and the guy have a love,
a cosmic love when he see this woman.</i>

257
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,426
<i>And how he will make a child?</i>

258
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:34,263
<i>And she take a drop of his blood...</i>

259
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:40,144
<i>and she change the blood into semen...</i>

260
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:46,859
<i>and then we see the drop of blood
going inside the vagina, the uterus...</i>

261
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>and we will follow the blood...</i>

262
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:55,493
<i>the blood coming and go inside the ovum
and explodes there.</i>

263
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,207
<i>She get pregnant with a drop of blood.</i>

264
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,209
<i>That's what I did.</i>

265
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:12,635
<i>What will have if you are not the son
of a sexual pleasure...</i>

266
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,097
<i>but of a spiritual pleasure?</i>

267
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,186
<i>And from this spiritual love,
he will create Paul.</i>

268
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,524
<i>Paul was a young boy...</i>

269
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:32,071
<i>but is not a normal boy. Was a mutant.</i>

270
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:35,908
<i>With a big soul and strength.</i>

271
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,245
Where I will find that boy?

272
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,538
My son.

273
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,172
Today you are 7 years old.

274
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,673
Now you are a man.

275
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,010
Bury your first toy and your mother's picture.

276
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:05,563
<i>I work with him in El Topo,
now he have 12 year old.</i>

277
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,109
<i>I say, "You will make Paul,
but you need to prepare as a warrior."</i>

278
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:23,080
I prepare my son, to do the role exactly...

279
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:27,418
as the Duke Leto prepare his son.

280
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,975
I find teacher for him.

281
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,103
I have a very strong person...

282
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,730
<i>Jean-Pierre Vignau.</i>

283
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,902
<i>When we started, he was 12.</i>

284
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,738
There I trained him in karate,
karate jujitsu, Japanese style.

285
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,782
That's all the fist-foot techniques...

286
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,161
joint locks, floor pins, standing pins...

287
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,289
a combination of karate,
judo, aikido and atemi-jitsu.

288
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:11,254
He learned how to fight with his hands,
with knife, with swords.

289
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,588
He learn all that.

290
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:19,011
<i>And he was ready to do Paul
as a real "Paul."</i>

291
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:26,143
I trained Brontis six hours a day,
seven days a week for two years.

292
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:46,163
<i>And all the person say to me,
"But what you did?</i>

293
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,750
<i>But why you are trying
to change the mind...</i>

294
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,087
<i>of child and to make a superior person?"</i>

295
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,927
<i>I say, "No, I was only
awakening the creativity."</i>

296
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,265
<i>I opened his mind.</i>

297
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,225
<i>That's what I was doing.</i>

298
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,687
<i>I don't know if I changed his life.</i>

299
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,773
Now I am thinking, "Why I did that?"

300
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,442
Sacrifice my son.

301
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:21,908
But in that time, I say, if I need to cut my arms
in order to make that picture...

302
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,452
I will cut my arms. I will do it.

303
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:28,205
I was believing that to make a picture...

304
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:35,171
who will give a mutation
to the young minds...

305
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:39,508
was sacred. You need to sacrifice yourself.

306
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,678
I was even ready to die doing that.

307
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:06,911
<i>For me, science fiction
was like a huge theater...</i>

308
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,580
<i>like a huge work of art.</i>

309
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,795
Every spaceship was a being...

310
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:20,049
like an insect, like a fabulous bird.

311
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,386
<i>That was the spaceship I wanted.</i>

312
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>Foss, I knew him in the covers
of science-fiction books.</i>

313
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:34,939
<i>They were ships with souls, like beings.</i>

314
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,025
It had to be Chris Foss.

315
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,588
You are excrement.

316
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,299
You can change yourself into gold.

317
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,999
In that time, I was like a prophet,
I was enlightened.

318
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:04,463
And I gave to them the feeling
they are not only making a picture.

319
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,842
They are making something important for humanity.

320
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,136
They have a mission. They was warriors.

321
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:16,572
I was searching for...
for the light of genius in every person...

322
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,243
with an enormous respect,
an enormous respect.

323
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,289
And then, every day
I was feeding them in order to...

324
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:29,251
to be free, to do the best of them.

325
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:45,267
Every morning, I give a big speech...

326
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:51,398
like the person who make football or rugby...

327
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,068
a speech with the players.

328
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:58,322
Every morning, I make my speech.

329
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,158
In order to say,
"Do it, what you need to do...

330
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:04,495
really, because this will be important."

331
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:49,456
In that time, I was seducing Dali...

332
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:53,669
because I wanted Dali
as the mad emperor of the galaxy.

333
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:01,051
Dali, to us, he seemed to be
the only emperor of the world...

334
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:05,597
with that extraordinary talent,
with his speech and his wording.

335
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:12,604
Can nobody understand Dali because myself,
never understand my work.

336
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:17,526
Never Dali understand
one painting of Dali...

337
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:22,114
because Dali only create enigmas.

338
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,533
Dali was something, eh?

339
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:33,000
<i>The first time we went to New York
was with Michel Seydoux.</i>

340
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:39,131
<i>We went to the St. Regis because
Michel Seydoux liked the St. Regis Hotel.</i>

341
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:43,802
And we discovered that Dali
was also at the St. Regis Hotel!

342
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,471
By chance.

343
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,764
<i>I was reading a book about the Tarot.</i>

344
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:52,811
And then I take a page where the Hanged Man...

345
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:59,359
I write, "I want to see you because
I will make a picture with you."

346
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:04,698
He like it. To have this kind of invitation.
He say, "I will see you.

347
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:06,992
<i>I wait you in the bar."</i>

348
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:12,289
<i>The bar had a 6-meter long painting...</i>

349
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,083
<i>pre-Rafaelite, where there was a king...</i>

350
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:21,673
and the nobles had a face
like they were hiding something.

351
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,887
Dali told me, "I like it here because
there is a 6-meter painting...

352
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,639
dedicated to a fart."

353
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:36,480
Dali told me,
"We are going to see each other in Paris.

354
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:38,357
I am going to think about it."

355
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:55,999
In Paris, on the Champs Elysées,
there was a very fancy restaurant...

356
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,211
<i>and he was there with his court.</i>

357
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:03,632
<i>He had 12-
Twelve persons at the table and him.</i>

358
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:07,844
"Sit down. I want to ask something to you."

359
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:09,846
"What, Mr. Dali?"

360
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:16,144
"When we was young, myself and Picasso,
we went to the beach.

361
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:19,606
And we open the door of the car...

362
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:22,985
always in the sand, we find a clock."

363
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,988
Clock, no?

364
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:30,617
"Do you find, in your life,
a clock in the sand?"

365
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,997
And I say, "What I can answer?"

366
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,040
It was very quick, like this, because...

367
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,751
all the 12 person are awaiting my question.

368
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:43,213
Because if I say I find,
all the time, clocks...

369
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:48,385
I will be a vanity person. Ridiculous.

370
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:52,514
If I say I never find a clock,
I will be a poor guy.

371
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,559
And suddenly came to me, I say:

372
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:58,186
"I never find a clock.

373
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,981
But I lost a lot."

374
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:07,904
"Okay!" And then,
"I wait you in Barcelona!"

375
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,243
<i>It was a game.</i>

376
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:19,916
Also, Jodorowsky was part
of the surrealist movement...

377
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,543
and Dali liked that.

378
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,796
So it was a game between them.

379
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,049
Who would win the game?

380
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,635
He was going through his first adventure
with Amanda Lear...

381
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:34,097
this sort of extraordinarily sexy person.

382
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,558
<i>Nobody ever knew
if it was a man or a woman...</i>

383
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,687
<i>a completely incredible character.</i>

384
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,733
<i>A sort of muse, a poet's muse.</i>

385
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:05,587
And you had to meet him,
you had to tame him...

386
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,798
and he needed to tame you.

387
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:11,093
So he would make you go
through these initiations each time.

388
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,078
She treated me very well...

389
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,080
and she became an ally...

390
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,999
because I promised her the role
of Princess Irulan.

391
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:04,896
She said,
"Be careful because Dali is destructive.

392
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,899
If he says 'yes', he is going to do
everything to destroy the film."

393
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:40,307
Dali say to me, "I will work with you...

394
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:44,269
but I want to be the actor...

395
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,980
best paid actor in Hollywood.

396
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:52,527
I want $100,000 per hour."

397
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:55,906
I went back and told Alejandro,
"We're never going to make it!"

398
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,116
But I couldn't pay him
"the most in the world."

399
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,326
That would be impossible.

400
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:00,994
Then step by step...

401
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,579
because we were stubborn
and because Alejandro would tell me...

402
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,790
that Dali was the only one
who could play the emperor...

403
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,292
the totalitarian emperor...

404
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,922
we had the idea of paying him...

405
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,715
by the minutes used.

406
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,884
I go to see Alejandro...

407
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,594
and ask, "How many minutes
is he going to be filmed?

408
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,930
How many minutes will he be in the movie?"

409
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:25,060
Alejandro says,
"Maximum five, probably three."

410
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:26,895
So I said, "That's the idea!"

411
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:30,899
I go back to see Dali and I say,
"I will pay you $100,000 per minute!"

412
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:36,196
He says, "That's brilliant!
I will be the $100,000 a minute actor!"

413
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:42,202
I said, "I will take a mold of you,
hyper-realistic...

414
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:45,288
and I will make the emperor of the galaxy...

415
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:50,627
he is so afraid to be killed,
he have a robot. And the robot will act."

416
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:59,636
And Dali said, "Yes, if you give me
the sculpture for my museum."

417
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,307
"Okay." And then like this, I have Dali.

418
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:12,941
And Dali, in our conversation,
show me a catalog of Giger.

419
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,987
And he say to me,
"I think this person have a talent."

420
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:21,032
I see that, I see-
But is incredible!

421
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,661
Is what I am searching for the Harkonnen,
for the bad guys.

422
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:29,249
<i>The gothic planet, gothic characters.</i>

423
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:33,003
And then I went to search Giger.

424
00:53:56,735 --> 00:54:04,868
Paris was where Jodorowsky and Dan O'Bannon
saw my work displayed...

425
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:15,962
and they wanted me to join them.

426
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:23,637
Giger had never done movies.

427
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,890
I said, "You have to make movies."

428
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:32,896
It was completely new to me
and incredibly fascinating.

429
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:37,567
<i>I say to Giger, "I need you as you are.</i>

430
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:43,073
You are searching in the
deepest darkness of the soul.

431
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,575
<i>And that is good. That is your art.</i>

432
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:49,788
<i>Your art is-
For me, is an ill art.</i>

433
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:53,708
Marvelous, ill art,
necessary for the Baron Harkonnen."

434
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:59,714
I met Jodorowsky for the first time in Paris.

435
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:05,804
This was the evening when he attended...

436
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:09,349
<i>a Magma concert.</i>

437
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:19,859
<i>For the Harkonnen planet,
I chose here in Paris...</i>

438
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,696
<i>a very famous group in that time, is Magma.</i>

439
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:28,326
<i>Magma was gothic, military...</i>

440
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,329
terrible.

441
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,379
I knew nothing about the project,
or the idea...

442
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,968
or the book for that matter.
I learned about all of that afterwards.

443
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:49,764
<i>Alejandro Jodorowsky didn't give us
any direction on the music.</i>

444
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:51,933
<i>I believe he trusted us.</i>

445
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:58,231
Now, I had an idea because
he had described the planet, the Harkonnen.

446
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,358
I knew that they were not really the good guys...

447
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,485
that they were more like the bad guys.

448
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,738
So it was rather easy to imagine because...

449
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:10,118
<i>Magma made music that was rather violent...</i>

450
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:12,495
<i>typically hard, things like that.</i>

451
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:20,295
I was just amazed by the quality...

452
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:26,593
and I told them I felt just like Christ
when he was on the cross.

453
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,306
I was fulfilled, it was fascinating, the music.

454
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:38,688
I was using the best musicians
of this time, from rock.

455
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,871
<i>I wanted Mick Jagger to play
Feyd-Rautha, a character.</i>

456
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:05,757
How am I going to contact this person...

457
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:10,178
who is not going to be impressed
that I have the great power to make a movie?

458
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:15,725
He is in the peak of his fame,
of his glory. How?

459
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:19,896
And I was invited to an event in Paris.

460
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,732
It was a big gathering of the Parisian bourgeoisie...

461
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,068
and at the other side of the room,
a big room...

462
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:29,114
I don't know, maybe 150 square meters...

463
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,741
was Mick Jagger.

464
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:35,829
I saw him from a distance
and I think he saw me...

465
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:38,998
and I saw him walking,
he started walking-

466
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,293
He started walking between the people...

467
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:45,088
and then I realized
that he was coming to me.

468
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:48,925
He crossed the room
and he stood in front of me.

469
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:51,594
<i>And I told him,
"I want you for my movie."</i>

470
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,806
<i>And he said only one word, "Yes."</i>

471
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:01,229
I was often invited to Andy Warhol's Factory...

472
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,773
Candy Darling, and all those people.

473
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,945
<i>There I met Udo Kier,
who was Andy Warhol's great actor.</i>

474
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:16,953
<i>He had played great roles,
and he said that he would act for me.</i>

475
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:46,501
<i>Baron Harkonnen is a big, big monster...</i>

476
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:51,881
<i>who have anti-gravitational implants...</i>

477
00:59:52,048 --> 00:59:54,884
<i>and he is in the air all the time
because he is too heavy.</i>

478
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,265
Orson Welles.

479
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:11,276
Orson Welles had a bad reputation...

480
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:15,989
because they said
that he liked to drink and eat...

481
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,908
so much that he ate at the movies.

482
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:24,205
He ate a lot, and then he did not
finish the movies, he was moody.

483
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:29,210
But I said, "No, Orson Welles
is a genius, he is the one."

484
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:35,216
<i>And since he liked to eat, they say he goes
to the gastronomic restaurants in Paris.</i>

485
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:39,595
<i>Therefore, I sent a secretary to ask...</i>

486
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:44,100
<i>in all the gastronomic restaurants in Paris:</i>

487
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,478
"Where does Orson Welles eat?"

488
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,607
And we discover a restaurant
and then he was eating.

489
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:55,111
Six bottles of wine. He was eating.

490
01:00:55,278 --> 01:01:00,950
And then I asked to the chef,
"What is the best wine he want?"

491
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:04,412
He say, "That."
Then, "Send him a bottle."

492
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:08,082
And then, he drink the bottle
and he want to speak with me.

493
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,380
And then, I speak with all the respect,
because was for me was an idol.

494
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:19,844
He say, "I don't want to do it.
I don't want any more."

495
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:24,932
I say to him, "I will propose something.

496
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:29,687
If you do the picture,
even if we pay what you want as an actor...

497
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:35,943
I will hire the chef of this restaurant
and you will eat, as here, every day."

498
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,820
And he say, "I do it."

499
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:47,246
I had the artworks from the movie...

500
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:53,669
which I got from Moebius, who drew the storyboard,
where one can see...

501
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:57,173
<i>the Harkonnen Castle.</i>

502
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:02,470
<i>The castle was the big Baron Harkonnen, no?
The big sculpture.</i>

503
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,808
That was where Baron Harkonnen lived.

504
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,852
In himself! The big ego, no?

505
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:17,193
The castle open the mouth,
a tongue go there, out...

506
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,114
and the spaceship came in the tongue.

507
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:44,846
<i>I was fascinated by the creation
of the Harkonnen people...</i>

508
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:51,727
<i>and when I airbrushed five paintings...</i>

509
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:57,692
<i>I gave my best to create these designs.</i>

510
01:03:22,175 --> 01:03:26,637
<i>In order to go to the castle,
there is a way with tubes.</i>

511
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:31,017
<i>Enormous tubes. Come out knife.</i>

512
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:39,192
And then in order to go to the Baron Harkonnen,
you need to walk this way...

513
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:44,238
escaping of the big knife
who want to destroy you.

514
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:50,411
If attacked, then the spears would be set in motion
and impale the people...

515
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:57,585
who stood in the way
on the pathway up the castle.

516
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:04,342
And in fact this Harkonnen fortress
was never in the novel.

517
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:11,474
So this was somehow
in Alejandro Jodorowsky's translation...

518
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:18,481
his interpretation of the story.

519
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:52,306
When Paul get killed, he doesn't die because...

520
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:57,186
the Messiah is all the humanity
can get enlightened.

521
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:10,366
<i>In the end, his mind is the mind
of every person. He's a plural being.</i>

522
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:14,870
I am the others. The others are me.

523
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,998
And then, if the whole humanity get enlightened...

524
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,959
the Earth changed.

525
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,257
<i>The planet of sand...</i>

526
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:14,597
start to grow plant, animals,
be like a paradise.

527
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:36,369
<i>Dune is a Messiah of the planets
because is a planet with consciousness.</i>

528
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:38,663
With the same consciousness of Paul.

529
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,290
And the planet go to the universe...

530
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,292
<i>to illuminate the other planets.</i>

531
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:50,883
<i>I changed the end of the book, evidently!</i>

532
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,386
In the book, it's a continuation.

533
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:56,138
The planet never changed.

534
01:06:57,515 --> 01:07:01,602
Is not awake, with a cosmic consciousness.

535
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:04,855
It's not a Messiah, the planet. I did that.

536
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,983
<i>It's different. It was my Dune.</i>

537
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:14,699
<i>When you make a picture,
you must not respect the novel.</i>

538
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:17,702
It's like you get married, no?

539
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,497
You go with the wife, white,
the woman is white...

540
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:26,168
you take the woman, if you respect the woman,
you will never have child.

541
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:31,090
You need to open the costume and to...

542
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,926
to rape the bride.

543
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:38,264
And then you will have your picture.

544
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:43,519
I was raping Frank Herbert,
raping, like this!

545
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,063
But with love, with love.

546
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,693
And then I came with that.

547
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,449
<i>It was such a beautiful object.</i>

548
01:07:56,615 --> 01:08:00,202
<i>So well done and at the time,
there were no photocopies.</i>

549
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:02,747
<i>It was just photos of each drawing.</i>

550
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,457
In color...

551
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,917
<i>so well done...</i>

552
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:12,256
with so much detail about the costumes,
about the techniques used.

553
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:16,010
Every studio have one book like this.
Every studio.

554
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:19,096
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal,
everything, all them...

555
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:23,225
Michel Seydoux give a book like that.

556
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:28,564
This approach was chosen precisely because...

557
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:33,194
I was thinking they might have
a certain distrust of Jodorowsky.

558
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,115
But since we were showing the camera angles,
since we explained each scene...

559
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,659
the way we wanted to film it...

560
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,661
they should have been relieved.

561
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,081
But they weren't. It wasn't enough.

562
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:57,426
<i>In Los Angeles, I wasn't optimistic.</i>

563
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,597
The thing is that sometimes
the French and the Americans...

564
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,683
have difficult relationships, you know.

565
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,769
Well, we have had.

566
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:12,900
We were almost at the finish line,
but we had to find the last $5 million.

567
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:17,238
The film cost $15 million.
Well, we estimated it as $15...

568
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:22,868
<i>We had been invited to Walt Disney studios
by the chairman of the board.</i>

569
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:27,122
<i>He looked through the project and said:</i>

570
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:30,835
"This is a wonderful project...

571
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,420
but it is like the Concorde.

572
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:37,299
It's an exceptional plane,
but over here, never!"

573
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:42,429
And there I said to myself that
we were going to face a lot of problems.

574
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,794
<i>They always received us
in a very friendly way...</i>

575
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:16,881
<i>but it was always the same answer.</i>

576
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,051
When we would give them the book,
they were very impressed.

577
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,178
They had never seen anything like it.

578
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:28,976
<i>Each time, they would tell us,
"It's superb. It's very well constructed.</i>

579
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:33,522
<i>You've solved the technical problems
of those special effects.</i>

580
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:35,858
<i>It's economically reasonable.</i>

581
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:39,612
But we don't get your director."

582
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:53,584
Hollywood did not visualize
science fiction that way.

583
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:56,962
<i>It was in 2001: A Space Odyssey...</i>

584
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:59,423
or in small B movies.

585
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:04,470
But a huge movie, that would cost
millions of dollars with all the effects.

586
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:06,889
They did not conceive of that.

587
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,599
Maybe it was a bit long as well.

588
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:13,437
Maybe the film was a bit too long.

589
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:20,903
They asked me to make a picture
one hour and a half, for the theaters.

590
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:24,740
And myself, "No, why the time?"
I will make a picture...

591
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,619
of 12 hours! Or 20 hours!

592
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,897
The totally outrageous side of Jodorowsky...

593
01:11:57,064 --> 01:12:01,610
<i>especially after
The Holy Mountain and El Topo...</i>

594
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:05,406
did not give them faith that he could lead
this very ambitious project.

595
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:09,702
Because $15 million in the middle of the '70s
was a lot of money.

596
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:13,580
And that was their answer, even though
they found everything else to be perfect.

597
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:15,791
Everything was great, except the director.

598
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,460
You have to be like a poet.

599
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:22,214
Your movie must be just as you think of it
and just as you want it.

600
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:27,302
Do not take comments to change this or that
from this person or the other. No!

601
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,849
The movie has to be just like I dream it.

602
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:37,563
The picture need to be exactly
as I am dreaming the picture.

603
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:40,733
Is a dream. Don't change my dream.

604
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:02,755
This system make of us slaves.

605
01:13:03,297 --> 01:13:06,425
Without dignity. Without depth.

606
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:12,014
With a devil in our pocket.

607
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:16,518
This incredible money are in the pocket.

608
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:20,230
This money. This shit.

609
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:25,235
This nothing.
This paper who have nothing inside.

610
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,656
Movies have heart.

611
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,660
Have mind.

612
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,955
Have power.

613
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,708
Have ambition.

614
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,087
I wanted to do something like that.
Why not?

615
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:57,452
Very disappointed. Very disappointed
because we all believed in it.

616
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,746
I believed in it.

617
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,506
Now, this is my take on it...

618
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:11,925
but I think he didn't feel like...

619
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:16,930
doing something else after such a project...

620
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:20,267
which was the project of his life, I believe.
That's my feeling.

621
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,728
I think that the humiliation...

622
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:25,981
that Alejandro Jodorowsky suffered,
in not having been chosen...

623
01:15:26,148 --> 01:15:30,986
in having been eliminated for being too original,
being too surrealistic...

624
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,696
<i>that is a permanent injury.</i>

625
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:35,824
<i>I think that Jodorowsky carries that
in his heart for life.</i>

626
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:45,083
<i>I was convinced that it would be
something great.</i>

627
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:50,422
But then Dino De Laurentiis' daughter...

628
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:54,593
came along and took the project
away from us...

629
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,471
and gave it to David Lynch.

630
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:17,866
And when I heard that David Lynch
will direct that...

631
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:22,454
I have a pain because I admire David Lynch.
He can do it!

632
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:26,959
He is the only one in this moment
who can do it that and he will do it!

633
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:33,048
I suffer because was my dream.
Another person will do that...

634
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:35,634
maybe better than me.

635
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:39,930
And then when the picture,
they will show the picture here...

636
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:44,226
I say I will not go to see that
because I will die.

637
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:50,107
And my sons say, "No, we are warriors.
You need to come and to see that."

638
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:55,696
And then they take me,
like an ill person I came to the theater.

639
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:01,493
Even I think I will cry.
And I start to see the picture...

640
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,289
and step by step, step by step,
step by step...

641
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:08,917
I became happy because the picture was awful!

642
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:18,969
Is a failure!

643
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:23,223
Well, it's a human reaction, no?

644
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,644
Is not beautiful, but I have that reaction.

645
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:33,859
I say, "Is not possible. Is not David Lynch
because he is a big artist."

646
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:36,153
Is the producer who did that.

647
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,823
I've never seen the movie and I never will.

648
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:31,083
From this supposed failure,
come a lot of creation.

649
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:37,381
In the life, thing come, you say "yes."

650
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:40,175
Thing go away, you say "yes."

651
01:18:40,342 --> 01:18:42,135
<i>We don't do Dune? Yes!</i>

652
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:45,180
That is, yes, we don't do it!

653
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,932
And then so what?

654
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,476
And then so what?

655
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:55,649
<i>Dune is in the world like a dream,
but dreams change the world also.</i>

656
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:11,123
I think it was a guide.

657
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,374
A guide for some.

658
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:17,212
In any case, I am convinced
that our storyboard...

659
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,047
made the rounds in the halls of Hollywood.

660
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,592
I can't imagine that isn't the case.
It pleases me to imagine that.

661
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,177
You always have to see the positive.

662
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:23,189
<i>Giger. He make the monster of Alien.</i>

663
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:29,362
<i>Why he make the monster of Alien?</i>

664
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:31,072
Because Dan O'Bannon.

665
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>O'Bannon create Alien.</i>

666
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:42,500
<i>They take Moebius, they take Giger, Foss.</i>

667
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:52,177
And Hollywood start to use my group.

668
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:55,263
Was very fantastic.

669
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:51,403
And then Moebius say to me,
"What you will do? You will die?"

670
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:54,739
No, I will not die.

671
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:58,201
For me to fail is only to change the way.

672
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,495
If we don't do that...

673
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:04,124
<i>the Dune we was doing is...</i>

674
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:10,130
<i>The roots are the Dune of Herbert.
But this Dune is us.</i>

675
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:13,675
Is the optical. Is a creation.

676
01:24:14,134 --> 01:24:18,722
<i>And then, I will use everything
I put in Dune to make comics.</i>

677
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:21,224
I say to Moebius,
"Why we don't do a comic?"

678
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,351
<i>And I start to dictate The Incal.</i>

679
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:27,981
A lot of images that are in here
are in here.

680
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:56,301
And then I find an Argentine,
a Spanish, Juan Gimenez.

681
01:24:56,468 --> 01:25:01,890
<i>And there I make all the spaceship I design
for Dune are in The Metabarons.</i>

682
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:07,312
<i>Even the Duke Leto.
I made him castrated by a bull...</i>

683
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:11,983
<i>and we find the sorcerer
who will take a drop of his blood...</i>

684
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,568
<i>in order to make the child.</i>

685
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:18,281
<i>I did it here, is here, like I was shooting!
I did it.</i>

686
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:23,745
<i>I start with Dune,
but I go farther, no? Farther.</i>

687
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:28,249
I continue and I did it, my work.

688
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:39,093
<i>I think Dune will be fantastic
if somebody take this script...</i>

689
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,262
even if I am not alive...

690
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:44,390
and do a picture in animation.

691
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:46,810
Now is possible.

692
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,395
<i>I can die, they can do my picture.</i>

693
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:55,276
I have 84 years, but I am still creating.

694
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:56,611
I am not...

695
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:02,992
All my life I create,
and is more and more and more.

696
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,119
The mind is like a universe.

697
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,998
It's constantly expanding.

698
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:12,919
Like the universe,
exactly like the universe, open the mind.

699
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:17,340
<i>The opening of the mind
is every day, is open.</i>

700
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:24,055
<i>That was this picture. Open the mind
of all the persons who worked there.</i>

701
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:28,142
<i>From the producer to the artists.
From the workers...</i>

702
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:33,398
<i>for every one was an opening
of the mind, this work.</i>

703
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:38,778
<i>Was ambitious, but not too. Was ambitious.</i>

704
01:26:38,945 --> 01:26:41,948
<i>Myself, I have the ambition
to live 300 years.</i>

705
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:47,078
<i>I will not live 300 years.
Maybe I will live one year more.</i>

706
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,830
<i>But I have the ambition.</i>

707
01:26:49,372 --> 01:26:52,125
<i>Why you will not have ambition?</i>

708
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:54,335
<i>Why?</i>

709
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:59,048
<i>Have the greatest ambition possible.</i>

710
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:02,260
<i>You want to be immortal?
Fight to be immortal.</i>

711
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,179
<i>Do it.</i>

712
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:10,518
<i>You want to make
the most fantastic art of movie? Try.</i>

713
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:14,564
<i>If you fail, is not important.</i>

714
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:17,358
<i>We need to try.</i>

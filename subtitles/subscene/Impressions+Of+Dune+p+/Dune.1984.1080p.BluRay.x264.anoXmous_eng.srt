1
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:54,042
A beginning is
a very delicate time.

2
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:59,478
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.

3
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,475
The Known Universe is

4
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:05,387
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam lV,

5
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,368
my father.

6
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:11,652
In this time, the most precious
substance in the Universe

7
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:14,156
is the spice melange.

8
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,534
The spice extends life.

9
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:22,727
The spice expands
consciousness.

10
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:27,209
The spice is vital
to space travel.

11
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,754
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

12
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:34,216
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

13
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:37,094
use the orange spice gas,

14
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:41,161
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

15
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,725
That is,

16
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:47,526
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

17
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:52,141
Oh, yes.
l forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,236
The spice exists

19
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:58,533
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

20
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:03,329
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

21
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,373
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts

22
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:09,503
are a people
known as the Fremen,

23
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:12,713
who have long held a prophecy,

24
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,924
that a man would come,

25
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:19,725
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

26
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:25,111
The planet is Arrakis.

27
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:29,106
Also known as Dune.

28
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,726
A secret report
within the Guild.

29
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,156
Four planets have
come to our attention

30
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:06,641
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

31
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:10,676
Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.

32
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:14,868
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

33
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:19,581
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

34
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,466
Planet Kaitain,

35
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:25,013
home of the Emperor of
the Known Universe.

36
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:29,349
Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain

37
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,978
to demand details
from the Emperor.

38
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,743
The spice must flow.

39
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:22,945
Father?

40
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:25,345
Lrulan, you must leave.

41
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:50,556
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,165
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,310
I shall want telepathy
during his visit

44
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,396
and a report
when we're finished.

45
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:00,890
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

46
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,133
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,528
The Bene
Gesserit witch must leave.

48
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,800
Leave us.

49
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,191
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,370
We are alone.

51
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:41,584
We have just
folded space from Ix.

52
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,993
Yes?

53
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,255
How was your journey?

54
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:49,176
Many machines on Ix.

55
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,052
New machines.

56
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,409
Oh?

57
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,234
Yes.

58
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,633
Better than those on Richese.

59
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,688
You are transparent.

60
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,526
I see many things.

61
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,863
I see plans within plans.

62
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:14,408
I see two great houses,

63
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:19,209
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.

64
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,083
I see you behind it.

65
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,251
Yes.

66
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:28,215
You must share with us.

67
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,676
The Atreides House is
building a secret army

68
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,594
using a technique
unknown to us.

69
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:36,566
A technique involving sound.

70
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:39,433
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

71
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,602
He could threaten me.

72
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:43,187
I have ordered House Atreides

73
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,606
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,

74
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,859
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

75
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,444
House Atreides will not refuse

76
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:53,488
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

77
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,240
Then, at an appointed time,

78
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:58,368
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis

79
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,121
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

80
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,790
I have promised the baron

81
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,752
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

82
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:11,256
So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.

83
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,561
Yes.

84
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:15,377
One small point.

85
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,263
Here it comes.

86
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:21,350
We, ourselves,
foresee a slight problem

87
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:24,103
within House Atreides.

88
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:28,691
Paul. Paul Atreides.

89
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,319
You mean, of course, Duke
Leto Atreides, his father?

90
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,073
I mean Paul Atreides.

91
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:39,775
We want him killed.

92
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,539
I did not say this.

93
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,501
I am not here.

94
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,378
I understand.

95
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:23,041
Why would they
want the Duke's son killed?

96
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,327
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.

97
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,057
On Caladan.

98
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,396
The powerful
Bene Gesserit sisterhood,

99
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:50,898
for 90 generations,

100
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,942
has been manipulating
bloodlines

101
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,194
to produce
the Kwisatz Haderach.

102
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,862
A super being.

103
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:59,574
On Caladan, Jessica,

104
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,075
a member of the sisterhood

105
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:04,411
and the bound concubine of
Duke Leto Atreides

106
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:07,707
had been ordered to
bear only daughters.

107
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,709
Because of her love
for the Duke,

108
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,089
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son.

109
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:18,009
Paul. Paul Atreides.

110
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,948
Here we are now. Caladan.

111
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,648
And 19 light-years beyond.

112
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,984
Beyond Bene Tleilax.

113
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,111
The training
planet of the Mentats,

114
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,738
the human computers.

115
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,199
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

116
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,535
There, Arrakis.

117
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,205
Spice Mining.

118
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,914
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand,

119
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,709
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

120
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,255
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

121
00:11:55,922 --> 00:12:00,722
Weather. See storms'.
No Precipitation.

122
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:04,650
Never one drop
of rain on Arrakis.

123
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,727
And the Harkonnens are near.
There.

124
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,312
Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

125
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:13,814
The enemy.

126
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:16,942
The Baron Harkonnen
has sworn to destroy House Atreides,

127
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:20,281
and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.

128
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:42,176
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

129
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:47,014
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

130
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,849
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

131
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,726
Those sounds

132
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,105
could be imitated!

133
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,941
L'd know the difference.

134
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,696
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

135
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,282
My father sent you to test me.

136
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:06,701
Music, then?

137
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,452
No music.

138
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,529
I'm packing this
for the crossing.

139
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,915
Shield practice.

140
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,041
Shield practice?

141
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,627
Gurney, we had
practice this morning.

142
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:17,753
I'm not in the mood.

143
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,547
Not in the mood?

144
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,091
Mood's a thing for
cattle and love play.

145
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,217
Not fighting!

146
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,096
I'm sorry, Gurney.

147
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,295
Not sorry enough.

148
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,441
What's wrong with Gurney?

149
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:40,985
He's not faking this.

150
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,470
Now, guard yourself for true!

151
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,959
Is this what you seek?

152
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,845
Good.

153
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,265
The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

154
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:15,124
But, uh, look down.

155
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:20,024
We'd have joined
each other in death.

156
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:24,091
You did seem finally
to get in the mood.

157
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,621
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

158
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,290
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

159
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,940
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.

160
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,215
Things have been
so serious here lately.

161
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,031
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

162
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,378
Arrakis is real.

163
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:54,131
The Harkonnens are real.

164
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,644
Doctor Yueh.

165
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,773
Do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

166
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,318
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

167
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,239
Only 125 meters long.

168
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,031
Only?

169
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:11,158
There have been documented
sightings of worms

170
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,959
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

171
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:20,001
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

172
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,712
The desert belt
and the south polar region

173
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,839
are marked forbidden.

174
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,841
How do the Fremen
survive there?

175
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,093
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

176
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,471
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

177
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,682
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

178
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,716
The eyes.

179
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,572
Yes.

180
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:42,348
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

181
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,567
Could the spice
affect us in other ways?

182
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,902
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

183
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:48,103
For one,

184
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,989
the Harkonnens would not have

185
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,474
given up their CHOAM Company
contract so easily.

186
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,384
The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.

187
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,419
But behind them,
l suspect, is the Emperor.

188
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,901
You'll make a formidable duke.

189
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,252
Now, remember,

190
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,348
the first step
in avoiding a trap

191
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,392
is knowing of its existence.

192
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:21,604
I know, but if it is a trap

193
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,897
then why are we going?

194
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,401
We have our new army.

195
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,257
Doctor Yueh,

196
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,396
put the weirding module on him.

197
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,078
Well.

198
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,680
Clear and lock the room!

199
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,496
Detachment, stand down.

200
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,828
Activate a fighter.

201
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,101
Make the range two meters.

202
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,962
Precise control.

203
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,942
Duncan!

204
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,375
Paul, l was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

205
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,928
I have to go on ahead, alone,

206
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,470
l won't be seeing you
for a while.

207
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,848
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

208
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,642
It's something for your father.

209
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,146
He wants to talk to you.

210
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,316
I'll see you on Arrakis.

211
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,442
May the hand of God
be with you.

212
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,041
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

213
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,754
Father.

214
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,570
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

215
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,940
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

216
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,976
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

217
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,220
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.

218
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,983
Makes me feel very proud.

219
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,799
I want you to be proud of me.

220
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,553
I'll miss the sea.

221
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,881
But a person
needs new experiences.

222
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:19,343
They jar something deep inside

223
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,304
allowing him to grow.

224
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,974
Without change,

225
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:30,937
something sleeps inside us,

226
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,982
and seldom awakens.

227
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,907
The sleeper must awaken.

228
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:10,842
Arrakis, Dune.

229
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,574
Desert Planet.

230
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,932
I will kill you.

231
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,293
The second moon.

232
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,489
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

233
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,013
l know she
has come to test him.

234
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:52,603
No man has ever been
tested with the box.

235
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,450
Tonight, I may lose my son.

236
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:24,759
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

237
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,885
Jessica!

238
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,262
It meant so much to him.

239
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,382
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

240
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,727
Desires don't come into this.

241
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,270
An Atreides daughter

242
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,355
could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir

243
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,608
and sealed the breach.

244
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,675
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

245
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,179
I vowed never to
regret my decision.

246
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,245
I'll pay for
all my own mistakes.

247
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,584
And your son will pay with you.

248
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,723
Arrakis, Dune,

249
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,579
Desert Planet.

250
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,849
Moving.

251
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,317
We'll salvage what we can.

252
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,560
But l can tell you, dear God,

253
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,498
for the father, nothing.

254
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,751
For the father, nothing?

255
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,296
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

256
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,882
The Universe's super being?

257
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,168
How dare you!

258
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,888
My greatest student.

259
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:57,425
And my greatest disappointment.

260
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,150
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

261
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,777
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

262
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,696
I want to see you
in your mother's chambers

263
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,730
in one-quarter
of an hour.

264
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,016
Paul.

265
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,529
This is very important.

266
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,319
Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?

267
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,332
For the father, nothing?

268
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,586
Vas.

269
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,940
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

270
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,673
She's going to observe you.

271
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,926
Please.

272
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,491
Jessica,

273
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,138
you know it must be done.

274
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,225
Your Reverence.

275
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,852
What does she fear?

276
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,770
What about my father?

277
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,075
Paul,

278
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:29,642
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

279
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,330
Now, you,

280
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,292
come here.

281
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,784
She's using the Voice.

282
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,128
No.

283
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,580
Some strength there.

284
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,259
Surprising.

285
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,730
Come here!

286
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,805
Here.

287
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,716
Come here.

288
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,709
Do you see this?

289
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,006
Put your right hand in the box.

290
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,955
What's in the box?

291
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,206
Pain.

292
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,667
Stop.

293
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,567
Put your hand in the box.

294
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,427
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

295
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:41,548
This one kills only animals.

296
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,309
Are you suggesting
the Duke's son is an animal?

297
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,355
Let us say, l suggest
you may be human.

298
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,192
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

299
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,069
Your instinct will be

300
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,990
to remove your hand
from the box.

301
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,846
If you do so,

302
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,464
you die.

303
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,499
You will feel

304
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,181
an itching

305
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,966
there.

306
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:19,516
Now, the itching
becomes burning.

307
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,224
Heat upon heat upon heat.

308
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,392
It burns.

309
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,227
Silence! Silence!

310
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,981
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

311
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,527
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

312
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,279
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass

313
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,365
over me and through me.
l must not fear.

314
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:41,909
You feel the flesh crisping.

315
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,368
Fear is the mind killer.

316
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,789
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

317
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,915
I will face my fear.

318
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,096
Flesh dropping off.

319
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,297
Fear is the little death.

320
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,424
I must not fear.

321
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:02,225
Fear is the little death.
I'm...

322
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,556
The pain!

323
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,798
No! Enough!

324
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,595
Kull wahad!

325
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,724
No woman child
ever withstood that much.

326
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:22,245
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

327
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,319
Do it!

328
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,504
Pain by nerve induction.

329
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,463
A human can resist any pain.

330
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,842
Our test is
crisis and observation.

331
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,636
I see the truth of it.

332
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,930
Could he be the one?

333
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,608
Maybe.

334
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,007
But will he be ours to control?

335
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,357
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

336
00:28:56,652 --> 00:29:00,445
Do you know of
the Water of Life?

337
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:03,490
The bile from the newborn
worms of Arrakis?

338
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,575
I have heard of it.

339
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,661
It is very dangerous.

340
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,676
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

341
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,554
There is a place

342
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,962
terrifying to us,

343
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,579
to women.

344
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,947
It is said

345
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,138
a man will come.

346
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,089
The Kwisatz Haderach.

347
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,539
He will go where we cannot.

348
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,928
Many men have tried.

349
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,608
They tried and failed?

350
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,008
They tried and died.

351
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,062
Jessica.

352
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,351
My son lives!

353
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,142
I sense your teachings in him.

354
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,174
Lgnore the regular order
of training.

355
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,719
His safety requires the Voice.

356
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,804
I've heard enough of my safety.

357
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,931
What about my father?

358
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,548
I heard your talking.

359
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,643
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

360
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,019
Paul.
Well, he's not.

361
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,731
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

362
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,566
What can be done has been done.

363
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,600
Mother, tell me!

364
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,970
Mentat Piter De Vries.

365
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,430
Message for
Mentat Piter De Vries.

366
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,821
The Baron is
impatient for Leto's reply.

367
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,438
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

368
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,066
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

369
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,611
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

370
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:07,156
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

371
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,911
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

372
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,454
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

373
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,791
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

374
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,815
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

375
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,024
My lord.

376
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,485
Piter!

377
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,614
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

378
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:33,033
and l have here
your answer from Duke Leto.

379
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,244
What does Leto say, Piter?

380
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,163
He wishes to inform you
that vendetta,

381
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,041
as he puts it,
using the ancient tongue,

382
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,128
the art of kanly,
is still alive.

383
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,195
He does not wish
to meet or speak with you.

384
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,959
I've made my peace gesture.

385
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,713
The forms of kanly
have been obeyed.

386
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,353
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

387
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,797
As you instructed me,

388
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,090
l have enlightened your nephews

389
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,466
concerning my plan...

390
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,032
My plan.

391
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,895
The plan to crush the Atreides.

392
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,010
Feyd,

393
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,189
Rabban,

394
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,681
go quietly.

395
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,945
No other great house
of the Landsraad

396
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:55,616
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

397
00:33:55,617 --> 00:34:00,417
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

398
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,832
and the Emperor.

399
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,543
Put the pick in there, Pete,

400
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,871
and turn it round real neat.

401
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,458
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

402
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,690
Your skin, love to me.

403
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,746
Your diseases
lovingly cared for,

404
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,353
for all eternity.

405
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,298
l will have
Arrakis back for myself!

406
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,844
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

407
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,263
And what Piter did not tell you

408
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,600
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

409
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,937
very close to Duke Leto.

410
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,606
This person, this traitor

411
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,484
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

412
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,831
And who is this traitor?

413
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,907
l won't tell you
who the traitor is,

414
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,149
or when we'll attack.

415
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,965
However,

416
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,623
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...

417
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,167
He'll know that it is l,

418
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,968
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

419
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,493
This is what I'll do
to the Duke and his family.

420
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,181
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

421
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,736
Caladan.

422
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,055
Soon they will
begin to fold space.

423
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:02,006
Far off in the control
rooms of spice gas.

424
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,708
Traveling without moving.

425
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,827
And now,

426
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,777
the prophecy.

427
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,781
One will come.

428
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:36,275
The voice from the outer world.

429
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,092
Bringing the Holy War,

430
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,146
the Jihad,

431
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,168
which will
cleanse the Universe,

432
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:48,809
and bring us out of darkness.

433
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,077
House Atreides
took control of Arrakis

434
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:22,832
63 standard days
into the year 10191.

435
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,792
It was known that
the Harkonnens,

436
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,627
the former rulers of Arrakis

437
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,964
would leave many
suicide troops behind.

438
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,408
Atreides' patrols were doubled.

439
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,689
Duncan!

440
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,653
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

441
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,167
Tell me.

442
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,323
Why haven't we heard from you?

443
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,783
My lord,

444
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,974
l suspect so much.

445
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,748
I think they are
the allies we seek.

446
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,625
They are strong, fierce.

447
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,711
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

448
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:11,380
As you know,
the lmperium has never

449
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,633
been able to take
a census of the Fremen.

450
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,801
Everyone thinks
that there are but few

451
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,137
wandering here and there
in the desert.

452
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,911
My lord,

453
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:24,143
l suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

454
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:28,210
That the Fremen exist
in vast numbers.

455
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,057
Vast.

456
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,158
And it is they
who control Arrakis.

457
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,078
Each trooper will be charged

458
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,581
with responsibility
for preserving water.

459
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,708
Our existence
as an operating army

460
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,836
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

461
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,965
Remember, water is life.

462
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,846
Why is the shield not yet up?

463
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:04,684
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

464
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,353
I think it'll go up now, sir.

465
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,705
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

466
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,177
House shields activated.

467
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,549
Duke Leto is now here.

468
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,678
Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.

469
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,281
So you are Doctor Kynes.

470
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,240
The Judge of the Change.

471
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,534
And the imperial
Ecologist, Sire.

472
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,369
Our intelligence informs us

473
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,330
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.

474
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,304
The process of
removal continues.

475
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:13,878
This is my son, Paul.

476
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,005
Are you a Fremen?

477
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:18,215
I've been on Arrakis
in the service of the Emperor

478
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,342
long enough
for my eyes to change.

479
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,637
In the service
of the Emperor.

480
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,429
We are in your hands, Doctor.

481
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,224
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

482
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,477
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

483
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,981
Well, this is a still suit
of Fremen manufacture,

484
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,650
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

485
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:36,954
Basically...

486
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,751
it's all right, Gurney.

487
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,504
Yes, Sire.

488
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,953
Basically,

489
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,955
it's a high-efficiency
filter,

490
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,990
and heat exchange system.

491
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,377
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

492
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,713
and is gathered in the second.

493
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,965
The salt is separated.

494
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:04,053
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

495
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:07,640
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

496
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:08,933
from which you can drink

497
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:13,000
through this tube
around your neck.

498
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:17,024
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

499
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:20,363
Should you be
in the open desert,

500
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,863
remember to breathe in
through your mouth

501
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,700
and out through this nose tube.

502
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:28,243
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

503
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,663
life can be sustained
for weeks,

504
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:34,052
even in the deep desert, Sire.

505
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,847
My thanks.

506
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,464
With your permission.

507
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,467
You've worn a stillsuit before.

508
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,084
No.

509
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,597
Your suit is
fitted desert fashion.

510
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:49,631
Who told you how to do that?

511
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,361
No one.

512
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,188
It seemed the proper way.

513
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:58,357
That it is.

514
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:02,686
He shall know
your ways as if born to them.

515
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,377
We're wasting time, Sire.

516
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:25,291
That language?
Translate it.

517
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,963
Very faint.

518
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,437
Harkonnen!

519
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:44,841
Air speed, zero-five.

520
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:49,241
Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.

521
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,848
Air speed, three-zero.

522
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,419
...35% percent
efficiency.

523
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,091
That's where l told
your sandmaster

524
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,075
to concentrate
the harvesting today.

525
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,691
Southeast,
over the Shield Wall.

526
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:17,802
Ambient
temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

527
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,107
Air speed, one-three-zero.

528
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,945
Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall

529
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,969
and entered open desert.

530
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,355
Will we see a worm?

531
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,878
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

532
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,004
Always?

533
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,413
Always.

534
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,884
Why do they come?

535
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,034
To protect their territory.

536
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,222
Vibrations attract them.

537
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:56,456
He must be a
Fremen or in with them.

538
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,686
He's studying us.

539
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,502
He's hiding something
about the spice.

540
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:04,995
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

541
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:11,286
As l said, they defend
the spice sands.

542
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:15,381
As to their relationship
with the spice,

543
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:17,601
who knows?

544
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:36,527
My message, it's here.

545
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,062
There are more
enemy bodies coming in

546
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:45,141
for your inspection,
Doctor Yueh.

547
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,946
Are you all right?

548
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,876
Yes, I'm fine.

549
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:55,046
Thank you, Thufir.

550
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,414
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

551
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,709
That's it. Spice mining.

552
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:06,089
No other cloud quite like it.

553
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,948
Wormsign?

554
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,176
Is it wormsign?

555
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:15,137
Yes. Worm. Big one.

556
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:18,371
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?

557
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:24,396
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

558
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,981
Who calls Pad Nine?

559
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,191
Don't mention the Duke.

560
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,610
This is an un-coded channel.

561
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,904
Unlisted flight
northeast of you.

562
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,281
Wormsign on intercept course.

563
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:37,117
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

564
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,745
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.

565
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,457
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

566
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,166
Very precise estimate.

567
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,201
Who's on that unlisted flight?

568
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,047
What happens now?

569
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,090
The carryall will come

570
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:54,010
and lift off
the spice harvester.

571
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,679
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

572
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,599
You'll find this
interesting, Sire.

573
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,684
They work until
the very last minute.

574
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:04,895
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

575
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,409
It isn't answering.

576
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,274
The worm is
eight minutes away, Sire.

577
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,069
Spotter control, give
me a report by the numbers.

578
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,112
Report One.

579
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,196
No contact.

580
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,615
Report two.

581
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:16,741
Negative.

582
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:17,783
Report Three.

583
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:18,909
Negative, Sire.

584
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,952
Report four.

585
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:22,454
No contact.
Repeat, no contact.

586
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,373
I think they've
got our carryall.

587
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:27,084
Damn it! Harkonnens.

588
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,294
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

589
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,463
All spotters are
ordered to comply.

590
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,757
Ordered by whom?

591
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,466
Duke Leto Atreides.

592
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,468
Yes. Yes, Sire.

593
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,803
How many men do you have?

594
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,785
Full crew, 26 men.

595
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:42,057
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

596
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,475
Damn the spice!

597
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,094
Get out of there!

598
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,488
Two men in
each of the spotters!

599
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,157
You, over here!

600
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:01,703
Run! Run!

601
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:09,835
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

602
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:13,172
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

603
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:15,519
Come on, boys.
Come on.

604
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,254
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

605
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,319
Spice.

606
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,990
Pure unrefined spice.

607
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,561
Here he is!
We've got to go!

608
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,540
Bless the Maker and his water.

609
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,208
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

610
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:50,960
May His passing
cleanse the world.

611
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:53,170
What's that you're saying?

612
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,735
Nothing.

613
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:33,347
Gods, what a monster.

614
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:45,631
Someone is going to
pay for this, l promise.

615
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:51,562
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

616
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:56,233
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

617
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,268
l like this Duke.

618
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:47,952
My lady, the local people,

619
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:50,830
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

620
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:53,541
Hawat has cleared them.

621
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:58,359
Excuse me, my lady.

622
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:03,597
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

623
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,771
When you said Harkonnens,

624
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:19,838
l didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

625
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:24,614
Well, my wife...

626
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:30,016
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

627
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,904
The Har...

628
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,665
Forgive me.

629
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,855
They must have killed her.

630
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:40,766
Please excuse me
if l can't talk about it.

631
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:49,601
He's holding something back.
Yet.

632
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,725
There's
the Imperial conditioning.

633
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:56,208
Assurance of trust.

634
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:06,739
The Bene
Gesserit mother, the legend.

635
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,825
Where is your son?

636
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,830
I must warn you.
You are in great danger.

637
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:17,615
Safe.

638
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,540
Spice.

639
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:56,404
What is it doing to me?

640
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,886
Second moon.

641
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:14,056
The sleeper must awaken.

642
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,456
Am l the one?

643
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:32,305
A hunter-seeker!

644
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:34,775
It can't get me
if l don't move.

645
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,301
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

646
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:56,953
I've got to try to grab it.

647
00:57:56,975 --> 00:58:00,144
The suspensor field will make
it slippery on the bottom.

648
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,699
I must grip it tightly.

649
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:07,090
Who is operating that thing?

650
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:10,114
It has to be someone
in the palace.

651
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:11,864
I could shout for help,

652
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:14,576
but it would kill whoever
opened the door.

653
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:34,752
Hold still.

654
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:00,924
It would have killed me.

655
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:05,846
I was its target.
it went to the motion.

656
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:07,461
Who are you?

657
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:10,070
I am the Shadout Mapes,

658
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,634
the housekeeper.

659
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:16,762
I must cleanse
the way between us.

660
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:21,100
You saved my life, and
we Fremen pay our debts.

661
00:59:21,101 --> 00:59:22,643
A Fremen.

662
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:24,770
It is known to us

663
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,189
that you've a traitor
in your midst.

664
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,775
Who it is, we cannot say.

665
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:32,800
But we are certain of it.

666
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:44,113
A traitor.

667
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:58,940
Set up a sonar probe
immediately.

668
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:08,731
Harkonnen.

669
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:15,187
They've tried to take
the life of my son.

670
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:22,077
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.

671
01:00:22,078 --> 01:00:24,061
Take it, Thufir.

672
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:29,835
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over,

673
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:33,695
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

674
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:42,936
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

675
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:48,397
Uh, the palace is now secure.

676
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:52,849
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

677
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:56,862
We have troops here
headquartered underground

678
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:59,782
on sub-floors
6 through 10.

679
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:01,826
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

680
01:01:01,827 --> 01:01:04,078
and we have some
on the airfield.

681
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,832
Our new army is still
in training, but everything,

682
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,458
everything is shielded.

683
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:13,370
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

684
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:08,757
Sleep well, my son.

685
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:22,273
Um, Father,

686
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,087
drugged.

687
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:34,293
Jessica, what is wrong?

688
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:37,579
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

689
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:40,039
I should have married you.

690
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:43,135
Why hold a dream
to ascend to the throne

691
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:45,586
through a political marriage?

692
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,590
I should have married you.

693
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,721
What happened?

694
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:39,066
Yueh!

695
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:41,517
He sabotaged
the house generators.

696
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:43,186
We are wide open!

697
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:50,077
House shield deactivating.

698
01:03:50,078 --> 01:03:53,455
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

699
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,708
I've brought
House Atreides down.

700
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,042
Why?

701
01:03:57,043 --> 01:04:01,589
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.

702
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,549
You were already dead.

703
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:06,552
But you'll get close
to the Baron before you die.

704
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:10,222
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

705
01:04:10,223 --> 01:04:12,726
You can still attack!

706
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:15,561
When you see the Baron,

707
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:18,898
you'll have a new
poison gas tooth.

708
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:23,696
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

709
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:29,037
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

710
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:30,785
Refuse.

711
01:04:30,786 --> 01:04:32,245
No! You mustn't!

712
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:34,622
Because, in return,

713
01:04:34,623 --> 01:04:38,793
I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.

714
01:04:43,006 --> 01:04:44,830
For Paul.

715
01:04:49,054 --> 01:04:50,305
Ahhh!

716
01:04:59,773 --> 01:05:03,442
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

717
01:05:03,443 --> 01:05:07,248
The tooth! The tooth!

718
01:05:07,781 --> 01:05:12,107
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

719
01:05:13,453 --> 01:05:15,434
Open the doors!

720
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:17,550
Signals!

721
01:05:19,585 --> 01:05:21,126
Get that shield up!

722
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:24,777
The shield! The shield!

723
01:05:48,154 --> 01:05:51,492
The weirding modules!
Destroyed!

724
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:43,209
Long live Duke Leto!

725
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:08,121
The drug was timed.

726
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:14,156
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

727
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:19,726
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

728
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:22,540
We can't let
ourselves be swayed

729
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:25,304
by your witch's voice,
now, can we?

730
01:07:25,669 --> 01:07:29,005
Leto, where are you?

731
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:33,334
How simple to subdue us.

732
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:48,358
Goodbye, Jessica.

733
01:07:48,942 --> 01:07:51,445
And goodbye to your sweet son.

734
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:55,303
I want to spit
once on your head.

735
01:07:55,406 --> 01:07:58,222
Just some spittle in your face.

736
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,300
What a luxury!

737
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:11,799
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

738
01:08:15,886 --> 01:08:18,805
l wish this was Paul.

739
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,126
I knew Yueh's wife.

740
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:33,842
I was the one who broke
his imperial conditioning.

741
01:08:37,783 --> 01:08:40,911
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.

742
01:08:42,412 --> 01:08:45,039
It is perhaps
better that you die

743
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,386
in the innards of a worm.

744
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,888
What are your orders, Piter?

745
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:04,799
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

746
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:07,531
The worms will
destroy the evidence.

747
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:10,419
Their bodies
must never be found.

748
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:25,871
They're down on this floor
somewhere.

749
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:27,228
Down there.

750
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,498
Duncan!

751
01:09:52,983 --> 01:09:54,234
Get off!

752
01:09:58,572 --> 01:10:01,281
You wish now to join your wife?

753
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:03,316
Ls that it, traitor?

754
01:10:03,869 --> 01:10:05,578
She lives?

755
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,508
You wish to join her?

756
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,900
Join her, then.

757
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:23,627
You think you've defeated me?

758
01:10:25,891 --> 01:10:30,691
You think l don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!

759
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:39,113
Take him away.

760
01:11:01,217 --> 01:11:03,200
Yueh's sign.

761
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:08,683
He's left us stillsuits.

762
01:11:16,983 --> 01:11:19,276
Don't touch my mother!

763
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:21,320
He's trying the Voice.

764
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:23,322
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

765
01:11:23,323 --> 01:11:26,576
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?

766
01:11:26,577 --> 01:11:29,756
No, l didn't hear anything.

767
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:34,563
The little one.

768
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:49,704
Remove her gag.

769
01:11:49,808 --> 01:11:51,424
Excellent!

770
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:11,424
There's no
need to fight over me.

771
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,300
A poisoned blade.

772
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:36,525
First cut my son's bonds.

773
01:12:45,155 --> 01:12:46,928
That's it.

774
01:12:59,628 --> 01:13:01,348
Oh, my God.

775
01:13:11,932 --> 01:13:13,756
It's under control.

776
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:46,883
Duke Leto Atreides.

777
01:13:49,636 --> 01:13:53,339
Where is the ducal signet ring?

778
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,123
I must have his ring.

779
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:00,553
The ring!

780
01:14:03,525 --> 01:14:07,591
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

781
01:14:08,739 --> 01:14:12,023
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

782
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:16,829
The doctor,
Yueh, what did he say?

783
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,333
Paul and Jessica safe.

784
01:14:19,457 --> 01:14:22,065
Yes. The tooth!

785
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,128
He's coming around, Baron.

786
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:25,850
Where's your ring?

787
01:14:26,673 --> 01:14:27,924
Huh?

788
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:30,134
You do not answer?

789
01:14:30,135 --> 01:14:32,928
Wait! Wait!

790
01:14:32,929 --> 01:14:36,005
You must come closer.

791
01:14:36,182 --> 01:14:40,562
The water of my life

792
01:14:42,147 --> 01:14:43,658
for Paul.

793
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:47,934
He's crying.
He's crying!

794
01:14:48,153 --> 01:14:50,551
What does that mean, Piter?

795
01:14:52,866 --> 01:14:56,204
Come closer, Baron.

796
01:15:01,499 --> 01:15:02,804
No!

797
01:15:04,127 --> 01:15:05,901
Jessica!

798
01:15:07,422 --> 01:15:09,195
Leto!

799
01:15:10,175 --> 01:15:12,134
Leto, he's dead!

800
01:15:12,135 --> 01:15:14,534
No, he's dead!

801
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,681
I know.

802
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:26,316
Am l alive?

803
01:15:27,984 --> 01:15:29,068
I'm alive?

804
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:30,372
Yes,

805
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:33,907
you're alive, my Baron.

806
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:36,440
I'm alive, eh?

807
01:15:36,577 --> 01:15:41,377
I'm alive!

808
01:15:50,882 --> 01:15:53,509
l can't maintain any altitude.

809
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:56,586
We'll never reach
the safety of rock!

810
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,446
Maybe that small rock.

811
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,436
Where are we, do you think?

812
01:16:04,437 --> 01:16:06,627
The south polar regions.

813
01:16:06,648 --> 01:16:10,976
The forbidden area.
Hold on.

814
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:20,745
Hurry!

815
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:25,635
Take the stillsuits!

816
01:16:26,918 --> 01:16:28,293
Hurry!

817
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:30,745
This crash might bring a worm.

818
01:16:35,511 --> 01:16:36,802
The signet.

819
01:16:36,803 --> 01:16:40,401
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh!

820
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:05,593
Where are my feelings?

821
01:17:05,624 --> 01:17:07,917
I feel for no one.

822
01:17:11,838 --> 01:17:14,133
The second moon.

823
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:32,900
l mean Paul Atreides.

824
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:35,976
We want him killed.

825
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:37,446
Why?

826
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,949
Why do they want me killed?

827
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:43,548
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

828
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:45,372
But what?

829
01:17:51,419 --> 01:17:56,059
He who controls the
spice, controls the Universe!

830
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:06,248
This moon holds my future.

831
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:22,878
Never one drop of rain
on Arrakis.

832
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:30,176
The sleeper must awaken.

833
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:40,425
They will call me,

834
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:42,356
Muad'Dib.

835
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:53,326
Listen to me. Listen!

836
01:18:53,524 --> 01:18:56,390
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

837
01:18:56,902 --> 01:18:59,925
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

838
01:19:00,781 --> 01:19:04,274
Do you know why?
The spice!

839
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:06,849
It's in everything here.

840
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:08,621
Calm yourself.

841
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:11,125
Like the Truthsayer drug.

842
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:14,033
It's a poison.

843
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:18,255
You knew the spice
would change me.

844
01:19:18,256 --> 01:19:19,882
But thanks to your teachings,

845
01:19:19,883 --> 01:19:22,301
it's changing my consciousness.

846
01:19:22,302 --> 01:19:25,638
I see it!
l can see it!

847
01:19:25,889 --> 01:19:27,662
Is he the one?

848
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:31,561
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

849
01:19:31,562 --> 01:19:33,177
He knows.

850
01:19:44,157 --> 01:19:45,825
Father!

851
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,748
Father, I promise,

852
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:56,243
one day
the sleeper will awaken.

853
01:19:56,503 --> 01:19:59,527
And I will avenge your death.

854
01:19:59,673 --> 01:20:02,466
I will not stop until I destroy

855
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:05,178
the Emperor and the Baron.

856
01:20:10,183 --> 01:20:11,694
Father.

857
01:20:27,242 --> 01:20:29,223
Go now.

858
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:35,879
Take him to his desert to die.

859
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:38,722
Go.

860
01:21:09,785 --> 01:21:13,226
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

861
01:21:24,215 --> 01:21:27,136
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

862
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:29,554
We have entered the time

863
01:21:29,555 --> 01:21:32,839
when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.

864
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:50,617
It's further than l thought.

865
01:21:51,618 --> 01:21:53,703
A worm is sure to come.

866
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:59,125
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

867
01:22:27,153 --> 01:22:30,447
Remember, walk without rhythm,

868
01:22:30,448 --> 01:22:32,273
and we won't attract a worm.

869
01:22:32,408 --> 01:22:34,442
It will go to the thumper.

870
01:22:36,162 --> 01:22:38,301
I'm ready.

871
01:23:19,372 --> 01:23:21,250
Faster!

872
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,784
It's deafening!

873
01:24:38,952 --> 01:24:40,203
Ooh!

874
01:24:42,122 --> 01:24:44,156
The spice!

875
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:47,292
Do you smell it?

876
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:48,544
Yes!

877
01:24:55,719 --> 01:24:56,970
Paul!

878
01:25:25,624 --> 01:25:27,760
A thumper.

879
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:38,553
The worm! Spice!

880
01:25:38,554 --> 01:25:40,325
Is there a relationship?

881
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:57,990
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

882
01:25:58,532 --> 01:26:02,181
Someone started
another thumper.

883
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,196
We're not alone.

884
01:26:35,694 --> 01:26:37,570
Man-carved steps.

885
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:39,239
Yes.

886
01:26:52,961 --> 01:26:55,045
Such stealth.

887
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:56,756
I didn't hear them.

888
01:26:56,757 --> 01:27:00,259
Perhaps these are the
ones the Shadout Mapes told us of.

889
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,345
I will take the boy-man.

890
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:05,650
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

891
01:27:14,691 --> 01:27:18,966
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

892
01:27:20,614 --> 01:27:22,334
Great Gods!

893
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:25,712
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

894
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:29,967
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

895
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:35,660
As the leader of my people,
l give you my bond.

896
01:27:35,962 --> 01:27:38,923
Teach us this weirding way,

897
01:27:38,924 --> 01:27:41,801
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

898
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:46,597
Your water shall
mingle with our water.

899
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:49,101
Then l will teach you
our way of battle.

900
01:27:53,104 --> 01:27:56,982
l give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

901
01:27:56,983 --> 01:27:59,434
It is the legend.

902
01:28:04,533 --> 01:28:08,233
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

903
01:28:08,995 --> 01:28:12,958
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

904
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,501
From my dreams.

905
01:28:16,044 --> 01:28:18,599
So beautiful.

906
01:28:19,047 --> 01:28:20,255
Come with me.

907
01:28:20,256 --> 01:28:22,864
I'll show you
an easier way down.

908
01:28:40,902 --> 01:28:43,561
You have strength.

909
01:28:43,614 --> 01:28:45,948
You shall be known as Usul,

910
01:28:45,949 --> 01:28:49,326
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

911
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:52,300
This is your secret name
in our troop.

912
01:28:52,497 --> 01:28:55,583
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

913
01:28:55,584 --> 01:28:58,452
which we will call you openly.

914
01:29:00,881 --> 01:29:04,530
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

915
01:29:06,928 --> 01:29:10,422
We call that one Muad'Dib.

916
01:29:11,141 --> 01:29:14,114
Could l be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

917
01:29:14,394 --> 01:29:17,105
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

918
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:21,974
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

919
01:29:22,068 --> 01:29:24,102
We welcome you.

920
01:29:24,946 --> 01:29:28,440
The dream unfolds.

921
01:29:48,804 --> 01:29:50,263
Moisture!

922
01:29:50,388 --> 01:29:51,849
Wind traps.

923
01:29:52,432 --> 01:29:54,310
Huge ones.

924
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:09,620
Water.
Millions of decaliters.

925
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:11,742
A treasure.

926
01:30:11,743 --> 01:30:14,663
Greater than treasure, Usul.

927
01:30:14,788 --> 01:30:18,594
We have thousands
of such caches,

928
01:30:19,209 --> 01:30:22,712
and only a few of us
know them all.

929
01:30:22,713 --> 01:30:25,528
And when we have enough,

930
01:30:25,674 --> 01:30:29,793
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

931
01:30:48,822 --> 01:30:51,428
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

932
01:30:54,285 --> 01:30:57,310
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

933
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:33,982
Arrakis!

934
01:31:34,492 --> 01:31:37,517
Rabban! Rabban!

935
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:41,749
We're knee-deep
in Atreides blood!

936
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:45,816
We've gutted them!
We've gutted them!

937
01:31:49,465 --> 01:31:52,855
Rabban! Rabban!

938
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:56,346
I place you
in charge of Arrakis.

939
01:31:56,347 --> 01:31:59,308
It's yours to squeeze,
as l promised.

940
01:31:59,309 --> 01:32:04,109
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

941
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:07,149
Give me spice!
Drive them!

942
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,610
Drive them
into utter submission!

943
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:12,822
Do not show
the slightest pity or mercy!

944
01:32:12,823 --> 01:32:15,658
Never stop! Go! Go!

945
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:16,909
Show no mercy!

946
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:18,370
Yes, Baron!

947
01:32:39,057 --> 01:32:40,308
Feyd.

948
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:55,201
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

949
01:32:55,824 --> 01:33:00,569
I'll send you. Feyd.

950
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,273
Lovely Feyd.

951
01:33:12,633 --> 01:33:15,343
Where's my doctor?

952
01:33:21,432 --> 01:33:23,518
Jessica,

953
01:33:24,936 --> 01:33:27,544
our Reverend Mother is too old.

954
01:33:28,314 --> 01:33:30,691
She has been calling
through space and time,

955
01:33:30,692 --> 01:33:33,403
for you to come
and let her rest.

956
01:33:34,445 --> 01:33:37,886
She asks that you pass within,

957
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:40,639
and become our Reverend Mother.

958
01:33:41,662 --> 01:33:46,462
if you be a Reverend Mother,

959
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:52,694
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

960
01:33:55,466 --> 01:33:58,075
The Water of Life.

961
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:04,310
But what of my unborn child?

962
01:34:05,268 --> 01:34:09,126
One day,
l will have to do this.

963
01:34:25,413 --> 01:34:27,540
Following
the Bene Gesserit tradition,

964
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:30,209
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life

965
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:32,920
as she surrendered
her knowledge.

966
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,680
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

967
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:42,910
Every man
who has tried has died.

968
01:34:43,389 --> 01:34:45,632
Am l the one?

969
01:34:45,934 --> 01:34:49,428
The sleeper must awaken.

970
01:34:52,733 --> 01:34:55,275
The tremendous
power of the Water of Life

971
01:34:55,276 --> 01:34:59,614
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

972
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:01,616
Alia was born
with all the knowledge

973
01:35:01,617 --> 01:35:04,120
and powers of
a Reverend Mother.

974
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:22,762
Feyd, even
though he's aging,

975
01:35:22,763 --> 01:35:26,933
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

976
01:35:27,017 --> 01:35:31,710
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

977
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,525
Try it now.

978
01:35:35,526 --> 01:35:36,609
I will.

979
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:37,861
Come.

980
01:35:51,457 --> 01:35:53,596
Oh, Thufir!

981
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,506
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

982
01:35:58,339 --> 01:36:01,364
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

983
01:36:01,802 --> 01:36:04,200
But this is not why we're here.

984
01:36:05,138 --> 01:36:08,423
We've brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

985
01:36:09,142 --> 01:36:11,853
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

986
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:17,650
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

987
01:36:17,651 --> 01:36:21,320
By milking this, this smooth,
little cat body,

988
01:36:21,321 --> 01:36:23,656
you receive your antidote.

989
01:36:23,657 --> 01:36:26,160
It must be done each day.

990
01:36:28,829 --> 01:36:33,629
All l can see is an Atreides
that l want to kill.

991
01:36:34,543 --> 01:36:38,139
Feyd, no, no.

992
01:36:38,672 --> 01:36:41,591
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

993
01:36:42,008 --> 01:36:44,093
Aren't you, Thufir?

994
01:36:44,094 --> 01:36:48,894
My Duke, how I've failed you.

995
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:08,598
Chani, l love you.

996
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:12,081
I've always loved you.

997
01:37:37,105 --> 01:37:39,973
The Holy Warriors.

998
01:37:40,483 --> 01:37:43,559
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

999
01:37:44,571 --> 01:37:49,371
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1000
01:37:52,829 --> 01:37:55,540
Our shared enemy,
the Harkonnens,

1001
01:37:58,919 --> 01:38:01,420
Stilgar, your leader,

1002
01:38:01,421 --> 01:38:03,506
has asked me and my mother
to teach you

1003
01:38:03,507 --> 01:38:06,478
the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

1004
01:38:07,636 --> 01:38:10,035
We must do more than this.

1005
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:15,070
We must totally destroy all
spice production on Arrakis.

1006
01:38:15,727 --> 01:38:20,211
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1007
01:38:20,774 --> 01:38:24,528
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1008
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:28,605
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1009
01:38:28,615 --> 01:38:31,951
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

1010
01:38:32,327 --> 01:38:34,870
When the spice flow stops,

1011
01:38:34,871 --> 01:38:38,123
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1012
01:38:38,124 --> 01:38:40,167
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1013
01:38:40,168 --> 01:38:42,462
will be forced to deal with us.

1014
01:38:45,215 --> 01:38:50,015
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1015
01:38:52,055 --> 01:38:53,410
Orato!

1016
01:38:57,143 --> 01:39:01,576
This obelisk is of
your hardest stone.

1017
01:39:02,649 --> 01:39:03,900
Kick it.

1018
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:11,825
Hit it.

1019
01:39:17,122 --> 01:39:18,373
Yell at it.

1020
01:39:24,004 --> 01:39:25,775
Break!

1021
01:39:27,674 --> 01:39:30,907
Korba, cut it.

1022
01:39:43,649 --> 01:39:44,900
Move back.

1023
01:40:14,054 --> 01:40:15,930
This is part
of the weirding way

1024
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:17,859
that we will teach you.

1025
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:24,440
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

1026
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,296
that being
the equivalent to a form.

1027
01:40:27,358 --> 01:40:29,902
Through sound and motion,

1028
01:40:29,903 --> 01:40:34,448
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1029
01:40:34,449 --> 01:40:39,249
set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

1030
01:40:39,329 --> 01:40:40,495
We will kill

1031
01:40:40,496 --> 01:40:43,624
until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1032
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:46,649
Muad'Dib!

1033
01:40:48,004 --> 01:40:51,863
Chaaksa.

1034
01:40:56,555 --> 01:40:58,066
Stilgar.

1035
01:41:00,475 --> 01:41:01,767
Muad'Dib.

1036
01:41:01,768 --> 01:41:02,852
Hmm?

1037
01:41:02,853 --> 01:41:06,554
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1038
01:41:10,193 --> 01:41:13,218
My name is a killing word.

1039
01:41:13,697 --> 01:41:15,364
They are ready to fight.

1040
01:41:15,365 --> 01:41:17,074
Yet in order to lead them,

1041
01:41:17,075 --> 01:41:21,559
I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.

1042
01:41:30,296 --> 01:41:33,737
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch,

1043
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,615
and ride as a leader of men.

1044
01:41:52,027 --> 01:41:55,312
Shai-Hulud.

1045
01:42:34,861 --> 01:42:39,240
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

1046
01:42:46,873 --> 01:42:50,334
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

1047
01:42:50,335 --> 01:42:53,378
Usul has called a big one!

1048
01:42:53,379 --> 01:42:56,717
Again, it is the legend.

1049
01:44:34,314 --> 01:44:36,504
Muad'Dib!

1050
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:12,852
Usul, these are 1
5 of our finest warriors

1051
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:16,711
to serve you as your guard.

1052
01:45:20,902 --> 01:45:22,727
The Fedaykin.

1053
01:45:36,334 --> 01:45:37,585
Now.

1054
01:46:03,612 --> 01:46:07,907
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1055
01:46:07,908 --> 01:46:09,742
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1056
01:46:09,743 --> 01:46:11,776
will be forced to deal with us.

1057
01:46:15,373 --> 01:46:17,958
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1058
01:46:17,959 --> 01:46:19,919
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.

1059
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,629
What happened?
Muad'Dib.

1060
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:23,589
What happened to you
and your men?

1061
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,965
Muad'Dib!

1062
01:46:24,966 --> 01:46:26,759
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1063
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,670
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1064
01:46:31,932 --> 01:46:35,518
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

1065
01:46:35,519 --> 01:46:40,319
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1066
01:46:46,154 --> 01:46:49,114
In the two
standard years that followed,

1067
01:46:49,115 --> 01:46:50,575
Muad'Dib and the Fremen

1068
01:46:50,576 --> 01:46:53,994
brought spice production
to a standstill.

1069
01:46:53,995 --> 01:46:56,747
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best

1070
01:46:56,748 --> 01:47:00,814
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the Baron.

1071
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,427
Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.

1072
01:47:10,428 --> 01:47:14,234
Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.

1073
01:47:14,474 --> 01:47:17,759
Paul and Chant's love grew.

1074
01:47:22,608 --> 01:47:24,316
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

1075
01:47:24,317 --> 01:47:27,028
Too bad. l thought
they were Harkonnen.

1076
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:40,458
Gurney!

1077
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:47,110
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleek.

1078
01:47:47,173 --> 01:47:48,424
Paul.

1079
01:47:50,301 --> 01:47:51,385
Paul!

1080
01:47:51,386 --> 01:47:53,178
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1081
01:47:53,179 --> 01:47:55,318
They said you were dead.

1082
01:47:57,518 --> 01:47:58,769
They...

1083
01:47:59,477 --> 01:48:00,728
They said...

1084
01:48:06,192 --> 01:48:08,318
Gurney! Gurney! Gurney!
You young pup!

1085
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:09,361
Gurney!

1086
01:48:09,362 --> 01:48:10,613
You young pup!

1087
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:29,840
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1088
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:31,801
you have one last chance

1089
01:48:31,802 --> 01:48:33,886
to take matters
into your own hands,

1090
01:48:33,887 --> 01:48:37,306
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

1091
01:48:37,307 --> 01:48:38,599
What do you mean,
one last...

1092
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,892
Silence. Do not speak.

1093
01:48:39,893 --> 01:48:44,063
Listen. You do not have more
than this one chance.

1094
01:48:44,064 --> 01:48:47,297
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

1095
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,734
Our navigators warn you

1096
01:48:48,735 --> 01:48:51,361
that spice production
is in great danger.

1097
01:48:51,362 --> 01:48:53,447
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

1098
01:48:53,448 --> 01:48:56,075
has stopped spice mining
on Arrakis.

1099
01:48:56,076 --> 01:48:59,453
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

1100
01:48:59,454 --> 01:49:02,497
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

1101
01:49:02,498 --> 01:49:04,792
We do not know who he is.

1102
01:49:04,793 --> 01:49:07,452
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

1103
01:49:07,879 --> 01:49:11,423
Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,

1104
01:49:11,424 --> 01:49:15,178
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

1105
01:49:22,435 --> 01:49:23,978
The Emperor will stop him.

1106
01:49:23,979 --> 01:49:26,429
He won't take
the Water of Life.

1107
01:49:26,773 --> 01:49:29,024
That's why
they want me killed.

1108
01:49:29,025 --> 01:49:32,049
They're afraid
I'll take the Water of Life.

1109
01:49:32,613 --> 01:49:36,448
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

1110
01:49:36,449 --> 01:49:38,158
50 legions?

1111
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,869
That's our entire
reserves as well.

1112
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,203
This is genocide,

1113
01:49:41,204 --> 01:49:43,330
the deliberate
and systematic destruction

1114
01:49:43,331 --> 01:49:46,251
of all life on Arrakis!

1115
01:49:47,252 --> 01:49:51,632
The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!

1116
01:49:53,299 --> 01:49:58,099
You were calling my name.
it frightened me.

1117
01:49:58,263 --> 01:49:59,722
Oh, Chani.

1118
01:50:00,766 --> 01:50:03,529
All the images
of my future are gone.

1119
01:50:05,562 --> 01:50:08,230
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

1120
01:50:08,231 --> 01:50:11,108
No, Paul, please.

1121
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:12,985
I've seen the men
who have tried.

1122
01:50:12,986 --> 01:50:14,820
I've seen how they died.

1123
01:50:14,821 --> 01:50:19,619
I'm dead to everyone unless
l try to become what l may be.

1124
01:50:21,662 --> 01:50:24,790
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1125
01:50:30,837 --> 01:50:33,288
l must drink the sacred water.

1126
01:50:36,092 --> 01:50:38,075
I must go now.

1127
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:36,726
Hurry. All l see
is darkness.

1128
01:51:36,903 --> 01:51:38,154
Paul.

1129
01:51:40,657 --> 01:51:45,457
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

1130
01:51:55,255 --> 01:51:56,871
You are my life.

1131
01:52:03,138 --> 01:52:05,692
Many men have tried.

1132
01:52:05,766 --> 01:52:07,933
They tried and failed?

1133
01:52:07,934 --> 01:52:10,020
They tried and died.

1134
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:20,279
The worm is the spice.

1135
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,678
The spice is the worm.

1136
01:52:42,385 --> 01:52:44,991
The worms.

1137
01:53:01,112 --> 01:53:04,032
They're not attacking.
Why?

1138
01:53:22,342 --> 01:53:23,802
Alia.

1139
01:53:25,178 --> 01:53:26,586
Mother.

1140
01:53:28,348 --> 01:53:30,642
It's Paul.

1141
01:53:32,603 --> 01:53:36,147
He's taken the Water of Life.

1142
01:53:45,532 --> 01:53:50,332
There is a
place, terrifying to us,

1143
01:53:50,662 --> 01:53:51,966
to women.

1144
01:53:52,038 --> 01:53:55,376
This is the place
they cannot look.

1145
01:54:01,715 --> 01:54:05,521
Traveling without moving.

1146
01:54:06,386 --> 01:54:09,619
Now I truly control the worm

1147
01:54:10,223 --> 01:54:12,466
and the spice.

1148
01:54:13,226 --> 01:54:18,026
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

1149
01:54:47,803 --> 01:54:51,921
Paul.

1150
01:55:01,024 --> 01:55:03,027
Father!

1151
01:55:07,488 --> 01:55:11,191
The sleeper has awakened!

1152
01:55:19,084 --> 01:55:21,587
Muad'Dib.

1153
01:55:28,885 --> 01:55:33,369
Arrakis, Dune,

1154
01:55:34,516 --> 01:55:36,080
Desert Planet.

1155
01:55:37,519 --> 01:55:40,022
Your time has come.

1156
01:55:40,313 --> 01:55:42,607
A storm is coming.

1157
01:55:42,983 --> 01:55:44,859
Our storm.

1158
01:55:45,986 --> 01:55:50,104
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1159
01:55:51,825 --> 01:55:56,360
Emperor, we come for you!

1160
01:55:57,455 --> 01:55:59,541
We come for you!

1161
01:56:13,805 --> 01:56:16,682
Long live the fighters!

1162
01:56:16,683 --> 01:56:20,749
Long live the fighters!

1163
01:56:51,259 --> 01:56:52,885
Suspicion confirmed.

1164
01:56:52,886 --> 01:56:55,389
The Emperor's
had Rabban seized.

1165
01:57:37,931 --> 01:57:41,425
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1166
01:57:41,935 --> 01:57:45,585
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1167
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:49,933
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1168
01:57:52,403 --> 01:57:53,904
Usul, we have wormsign,

1169
01:57:53,905 --> 01:57:57,085
the likes of which
even God has never seen.

1170
01:58:52,839 --> 01:58:57,639
Bring in that
floating fat man, the Baron.

1171
01:59:13,193 --> 01:59:15,194
Why have you brought me here?

1172
01:59:15,195 --> 01:59:19,323
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1173
01:59:19,324 --> 01:59:21,200
I never requested
your presence.

1174
01:59:21,201 --> 01:59:22,452
Ah.

1175
01:59:22,703 --> 01:59:25,120
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1176
01:59:25,121 --> 01:59:27,582
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1177
01:59:27,583 --> 01:59:31,085
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1178
01:59:31,086 --> 01:59:32,377
You've forced me to come here

1179
01:59:32,378 --> 01:59:35,612
and set things straight,
personally.

1180
01:59:45,225 --> 01:59:49,812
l am a messenger
from Muad'Dib.

1181
01:59:49,813 --> 01:59:52,056
Poor Emperor.

1182
01:59:52,107 --> 01:59:55,985
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1183
01:59:55,986 --> 01:59:57,394
Silence!

1184
01:59:57,403 --> 01:59:59,614
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.

1185
01:59:59,615 --> 02:00:01,824
Kill her. Kill her.

1186
02:00:01,825 --> 02:00:04,785
Get out of my mind!

1187
02:00:04,786 --> 02:00:07,496
Not until you tell them both

1188
02:00:07,497 --> 02:00:11,303
who l really am.

1189
02:00:12,127 --> 02:00:13,742
Alia,

1190
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:19,049
daughter of Duke Leto the Just,

1191
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:22,762
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1192
02:00:22,763 --> 02:00:24,274
Sister

1193
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:28,768
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1194
02:00:28,769 --> 02:00:33,513
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1195
02:00:37,528 --> 02:00:39,924
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1196
02:00:44,492 --> 02:00:48,037
With the storm, their
air power will be useless.

1197
02:00:48,038 --> 02:00:51,290
On Arrakis, it's desert power.

1198
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:52,542
Gurney.

1199
02:00:54,085 --> 02:00:55,169
Now!

1200
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:56,578
Atomics!

1201
02:01:31,873 --> 02:01:36,673
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1202
02:01:38,547 --> 02:01:39,922
Lmpossible!

1203
02:01:39,923 --> 02:01:42,007
Not impossible.

1204
02:01:42,008 --> 02:01:46,127
I told you.
He is here now.

1205
02:01:52,227 --> 02:01:56,188
Father, today
I will avenge your death.

1206
02:02:19,087 --> 02:02:22,339
Emperor, an
impassable storm has descended.

1207
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:26,198
The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.

1208
02:02:27,178 --> 02:02:28,848
Release the Sardaukar.

1209
02:02:28,972 --> 02:02:33,772
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1210
02:02:34,477 --> 02:02:37,710
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1211
02:03:24,444 --> 02:03:25,853
Chaa!

1212
02:04:21,001 --> 02:04:22,252
Cha.

1213
02:04:24,462 --> 02:04:26,443
Wait for my brother.

1214
02:04:32,596 --> 02:04:36,140
Cha!

1215
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:42,470
Muad'Dib!

1216
02:05:23,229 --> 02:05:28,029
Eee-sah!

1217
02:05:32,030 --> 02:05:33,281
Cha!

1218
02:05:37,828 --> 02:05:39,369
Alia, now.

1219
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:41,509
Come to me, Baron.

1220
02:06:55,321 --> 02:06:57,407
Muad'Dib!

1221
02:07:42,035 --> 02:07:44,036
Feyd Rautha.

1222
02:07:44,037 --> 02:07:46,789
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1223
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:48,749
there are Guild Heighliners
above us,

1224
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,418
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1225
02:07:51,419 --> 02:07:52,878
Send them back.

1226
02:07:52,879 --> 02:07:54,880
How dare
you speak to me in...

1227
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:57,227
Stop your speaking.

1228
02:07:58,885 --> 02:08:01,440
You have some idea
of what l could do.

1229
02:08:04,099 --> 02:08:07,697
Don't try your powers on me.

1230
02:08:08,103 --> 02:08:10,479
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1231
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,565
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1232
02:08:12,566 --> 02:08:14,149
You mustn't speak...

1233
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:15,610
Silence!

1234
02:08:18,697 --> 02:08:20,991
l remember your gom jabbar.

1235
02:08:21,658 --> 02:08:23,450
Now you'll remember mine.

1236
02:08:23,451 --> 02:08:25,694
I can kill with a word.

1237
02:08:27,748 --> 02:08:31,041
And his word shall carry
death eternal

1238
02:08:31,042 --> 02:08:33,252
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1239
02:08:33,253 --> 02:08:34,754
The righteous?

1240
02:08:34,755 --> 02:08:37,205
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1241
02:08:39,467 --> 02:08:43,470
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1242
02:08:43,471 --> 02:08:44,680
If Feyd wishes,

1243
02:08:44,681 --> 02:08:47,099
he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1244
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,433
I wish it.

1245
02:08:48,434 --> 02:08:50,937
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1246
02:08:51,396 --> 02:08:54,189
Let me. Please, my lord.

1247
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:56,589
The Emperor's blade.

1248
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:30,080
Why prolong the inevitable?

1249
02:09:31,937 --> 02:09:33,657
l will kill you.

1250
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,050
l will kill him!

1251
02:09:57,671 --> 02:09:58,922
Paul!

1252
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:02,384
I will kill him!

1253
02:10:11,518 --> 02:10:16,053
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

1254
02:10:16,356 --> 02:10:19,901
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

1255
02:10:26,449 --> 02:10:27,858
Poisoned.

1256
02:10:30,787 --> 02:10:34,333
You see your death.

1257
02:10:34,374 --> 02:10:36,459
My blade will finish you.

1258
02:10:38,587 --> 02:10:42,706
I will bend like
a reed in the wind.

1259
02:10:57,105 --> 02:10:58,356
Chaaksa!

1260
02:11:06,156 --> 02:11:08,085
Muad'Dib.

1261
02:11:08,534 --> 02:11:11,193
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1262
02:11:12,037 --> 02:11:15,623
Muad'Dib
had become the hand of God,

1263
02:11:15,624 --> 02:11:18,387
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1264
02:11:18,418 --> 02:11:19,585
Where there was war,

1265
02:11:19,586 --> 02:11:22,337
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1266
02:11:22,338 --> 02:11:26,216
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

1267
02:11:26,217 --> 02:11:29,138
to lead the people
to true freedom,

1268
02:11:29,345 --> 02:11:33,204
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

1269
02:11:35,936 --> 02:11:38,334
We Fremen have a saying.

1270
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:42,693
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1271
02:11:43,443 --> 02:11:46,728
One cannot go
against the word of God.

1272
02:12:43,837 --> 02:12:46,287
And how can this be?

1273
02:12:48,341 --> 02:12:52,617
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach.

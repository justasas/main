1
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
Arrakis.

2
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Dune.

3
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,920
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,640
It is here and only here where can be found:

5
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
The spice.

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Greatest treasure in the universe.

7
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,320
And the never-ending cause of conflict,

8
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,320
betrayal,
and murder.

9
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Muad'Dib.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
No.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,000
Another bad dream, Uncle?

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,840
No, it's indigestion, that's all,
miserable food here.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,280
I can't wait to be off this foul planet.

14
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,520
What are you doing here, boy?

15
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
They're dead, Uncle.

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,720
The Bene Gesserit witch and her son,
both dead.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
We discovered a Fremen sietch
not far from where our thopter crashed.

18
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
They'd been rescued
by that Atreides snake, Duncan Idaho.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
The Emperor's man.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,920
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,720
The witch and her son were last seen
driving a thopter into a sandstorm.

23
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
- You've seen the bodies?
- They're most certainly dead.

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
You've seen the bodies?

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,640
Nothing survives
one of those storms, Uncle.

26
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,240
The wind was over 800 kilometres an hour.

27
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,200
Nothing survives.

28
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
How long have I been asleep?

29
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,240
Not long.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,160
The storm passed a little while ago.

31
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
It was Yueh.

32
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
He's the one who betrayed us.

33
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,440
They had his wife.

34
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
You should put it on, Paul.

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,240
You're the duke now.

36
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,760
We have to get out of here.

37
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
I found some supplies
stowed in the compartment by the hatch:

38
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,080
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,040
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.

40
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
Fremen?

41
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
We're going to need them...

42
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
...to take back Arrakis.

43
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
How do we know which way to go?

44
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
South.

45
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,360
That's into the deep desert.

46
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,520
There were rumours
of sietch communities there.

47
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,600
That's where we'll find the Fremen...

48
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,360
...or die trying.

49
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm all right.

50
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
It's just the stress. I'm fine.

51
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,080
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.

52
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,120
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

53
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Or did you think I would just be
too simple-minded to see the truth?

54
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
Leave us alone.

55
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,640
What happened on Arrakis
was beyond my control, Daughter.

56
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
An ancient feud between royal houses.

57
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,440
Don't patronise me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?

58
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
Used you?

59
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Sending me to the duke
as a token of your support...

60
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,120
...making me a courier
of your esteemed respect...

61
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,360
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.

62
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,800
Or was that your idea, Fenring?

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,760
That would be something
your perverse mind would suggest.

64
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,000
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?

65
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
Send me into the desert to die
like that poor boy and his mother?

66
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,880
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.

67
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Despite the Baron's efforts...

68
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
...he assures me he did everything he could
to secure them from harm.

69
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.

70
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.

71
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,400
Enough!

72
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,520
There will come a time, Daughter...

73
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,280
...when you will have to shed
this naiveté of yours...

74
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,920
...and learn what it means
to rule an empire.

75
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,920
And when that time comes, Father...

76
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,800
...you may learn to regret it.

77
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,760
It's only another few kilometres, that's all.

78
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
Hurry, we don't have much time.

79
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
The sun will soon be up full.

80
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
We'll have some shade in here.

81
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,880
If there are Harkonnen patrols this far out,
they'll have a tough time spotting us.

82
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Such a pity.

83
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,440
A pity that you had to get mixed up
in this business, Doctor.

84
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.

85
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm the Emperor's servant,
nothing more and nothing less.

86
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,800
So you did not lead them
to that warren of Fremen scum?

87
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
That was Idaho's idea.

88
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,080
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.

89
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,520
We know all about Idaho
and his efforts on the duke's behalf.

90
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,440
A foolish, desperate gambit.

91
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,680
And where was that Fremen trash
when he needed them?

92
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,080
What will you say when the Emperor
questions you about what happened here?

93
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,960
What's your impression?

94
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,360
The desert is
an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.

95
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,320
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...

96
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,760
...and her spawn have found that out,
haven't they?

97
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,160
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials
when he's face to face...

98
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,680
...with death's sweet smile.

99
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,360
Muad'Dib.

100
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,880
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

101
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,960
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.

102
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,400
But here, on Arrakis,
you need desert power.

103
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,440
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters.

104
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,680
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

105
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,000
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.

106
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
Did you get any rest?

107
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Some.

108
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,120
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

109
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.

110
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,760
How is my sister?

111
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm having dreams again.

112
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
Visions.

113
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,280
Even when I'm awake.

114
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,160
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.

115
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,280
Even your father didn't know.

116
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,720
Why not?

117
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
There wasn't time.

118
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,280
What have you done to me?

119
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.

120
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?

121
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
This place is changing me.

122
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,680
It's the spice.

123
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,080
It's in the air we breathe,
in the food we eat.

124
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,400
I can't escape it.

125
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
Drink it all.

126
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,680
The best place to conserve water
is in your body.

127
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,560
The stillsuit will do the rest.

128
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,360
If we stay on this dune
we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.

129
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,480
Is that a good idea?

130
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,360
It's the most direct path.

131
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
You all right?

132
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,560
Yes.

133
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,640
Hold on.

134
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,960
That shouldn't have happened.

135
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,720
I was careless about these dunes.

136
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,160
We lost our paracompass.

137
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
Can you hear that?

138
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
It's a worm!

139
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,040
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!

140
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,200
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!

141
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,920
A thumper?

142
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,840
Someone called it away.

143
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.

144
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,040
The spice.

145
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,160
Everywhere.

146
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,200
When the worm came.

147
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
There had to have been people
for this many plants to survive.

148
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
Fremen.

149
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
We have to find them.

150
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,880
Most intruders here
regret finding the Fremen.

151
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.

152
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,680
I know you.

153
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,040
You're Stilgar...

154
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
...the Fremen who came to see my father
with Duncan Idaho.

155
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,720
That was a sloppy crossing you made
from the crash.

156
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
You called a worm.

157
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,680
You were watching us?

158
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,160
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.

159
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,200
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.

160
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,880
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?

161
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,200
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.

162
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,560
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.

163
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,280
My people are cautious and pragmatic.

164
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Good qualities in the desert.

165
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,080
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity
than invite disaster.

166
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,760
Your only value at the moment
is the water in your flesh.

167
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,480
You know the law, Stil.

168
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,040
Yes.

169
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,560
The law.

170
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Tell them to stop hunting my son.

171
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
Tell them.

172
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!

173
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,200
Do you hear me?

174
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,520
Is this the way
you welcome friends of Liet?

175
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,680
Is it?

176
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,080
As leader of this tribe...

177
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,680
...I'm offering the Weirding woman
and her son sanctuary.

178
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,040
No Fremen will lay a hand on you
while you have my protection.

179
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,440
For how long?

180
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,160
Don't be a fool, woman.

181
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.

182
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,360
Don't be fugitives from us as well.

183
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,520
Merciful God!

184
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,480
I've heard of the Weirding ways.

185
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,520
Imagine what a man could do with it.

186
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,000
No doubt we have much
to teach each other.

187
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,720
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.

188
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
He won't move unless I say so.

189
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
Discipline. Good.

190
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
He's here!

191
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
He is unharmed.

192
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,480
We are coming down.

193
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,200
Leave me alone.

194
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,040
Made a lot of noise climbing.

195
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
He has much to learn.

196
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?

197
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,920
He surprised me, that's all.

198
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,800
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.

199
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,320
We have now two with us
who are not trained.

200
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
In squad lines with flankers.

201
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,920
We have to make Cave of Ridges
before full sun.

202
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,720
Chani, you will be responsible for him.

203
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,360
My name is Paul.

204
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,840
Only until we give you a new one.

205
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,040
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.

206
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,800
Across there is home...

207
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,800
...Sietch Tabr.

208
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,800
We'll be there tomorrow.

209
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,080
Tomorrow?

210
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
That must be hundreds of kilometres
from here.

211
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,560
It will be a hard ride.

212
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,360
Sun will be up soon.

213
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,800
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.

214
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,880
When you give us your stillsuits,
we will recover your water for you.

215
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
Here is some food.

216
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,200
Spice.

217
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
We don't have delicacies from the cities
like you are used to.

218
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,240
It's fine.

219
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,400
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?

220
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,800
I can tell by the way you stare at her.

221
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I don't know what it means.

222
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,520
Be careful, Paul.

223
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,920
We are new to these people
as they are to us.

224
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
Everything we say and do must be careful.

225
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Predicting the future,
then plotting to make it so.

226
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,680
These are superstitious people.

227
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,040
If we are to survive, it will be best
to accommodate their legends.

228
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.

229
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,160
A desert creature.

230
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,760
Not finished yet!

231
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Still have work to do!

232
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,440
The pre-spice mass.

233
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,680
I am a desert crea...

234
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
Spice blow.

235
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
Somewhere to the east.

236
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,440
A large field from the looks of it.

237
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,160
We have to send gatherers
before Harkonnen pirates come for it.

238
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,920
You harvest the spice?

239
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.

240
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
It's Liet's wish.

241
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,000
We pay them to keep our skies free
of their satellites...

242
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,280
...so that no one can know
what we are doing here.

243
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,320
You will learn.

244
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
Amtal!

245
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,120
I invoke amtal.

246
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,280
Jamis.

247
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,000
What is this?

248
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,560
His way of dealing with what happened
the other night.

249
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,400
That was an accident.

250
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,040
He bested me because there was
witch-force at Tuono basin.

251
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,960
Amtal! It's my right!

252
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,120
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.

253
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,560
You're starting something
you're going to regret.

254
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,240
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.

255
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,440
If you know what's good for you,
you'll find an honourable way...

256
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,080
...to leave this thing alone.

257
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,040
Silence!

258
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,600
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.

259
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,080
If you try that again,
we know it's your witchcraft.

260
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,080
I won't be able to protect you
or the boy anymore.

261
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,040
Come. You can't stop this.

262
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,320
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.

263
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
Use it well.

264
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
May your blade chip and shatter.

265
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,680
I'm going to bathe this knife
with your blood.

266
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,680
First, you'll have to find my blood.

267
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,160
- Do you yield?
- Yield?

268
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,680
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!

269
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,840
- He's never had to kill.
- What?

270
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
Then he'd better learn.

271
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,000
Finish. Don't toy with him.

272
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,960
He's bested Jamis.

273
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,360
This didn't have to happen.

274
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,880
It is our way.

275
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,720
Your way. Killing each other.

276
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,560
No man recognises leadership
without the challenge of combat.

277
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
There is a legend among us...

278
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,880
...that a voice from the out-world
will come.

279
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
The Mahdi.

280
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,720
He will hold the key to our future.

281
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,960
It is said that a Bene Gesserit
will be his mother.

282
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,000
A Sayyadina.

283
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,480
Friend of God.

284
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,960
There are rumours about you and your son.

285
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,520
From the city. Liet.

286
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,240
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?

287
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,080
I hope...

288
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,960
...and I fear.

289
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,840
If it's true,
your boy will have to call me out one day...

290
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,680
...to challenge me
for the leadership of the tribe.

291
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,040
The huanui is prepared. It's time.

292
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,040
It's our way.

293
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,240
From water does all life begin.

294
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
The flesh belongs to the person...

295
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,760
...but his water belongs to the tribe.

296
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,760
I was a friend of Jamis.

297
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,800
When the hawk plane fell upon us...

298
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,960
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...

299
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,880
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.

300
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,800
I was a friend of Jamis.

301
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,640
I was a friend of Jamis.

302
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,240
I was a friend of Jamis.

303
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,000
He taught me...

304
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,480
...that when you kill...

305
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,720
...you pay for it.

306
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,400
Bila-Kayfa!

307
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
He sheds tears.

308
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
He gives water to the dead.

309
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,480
Jamis carried 33 litres of the tribe's water.

310
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,600
Counted and measured.

311
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,480
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.

312
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,080
Because you fight without stillsuit...

313
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,040
...you may regain the water
you lost fighting.

314
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,360
May you guard it for the tribe,
preserve it against loss...

315
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,440
...be generous with it in time of need.

316
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,200
May you pass it on in your time
for the good of the tribe.

317
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,200
Needs a naming now, Stil.

318
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,760
It's time.

319
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,160
What would you have us call you,
young Atreides?

320
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,920
By what name do you wish Fremen
to know you?

321
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,440
What is the name of that little mouse?

322
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,720
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.

323
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
Muad'Dib.

324
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,360
Is that the name you wish?

325
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,600
Yes.

326
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Muad'Dib.

327
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,520
Wise in the ways of the desert.

328
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,720
Hiding from the sun. Travelling at night.

329
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,200
We call him the "teacher of boys".

330
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,160
Muad'Dib.

331
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,240
A fine choice.

332
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,560
So, from now on
you will be addressed as Muad'Dib.

333
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,880
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.

334
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
Your lives will depend on it.

335
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,280
There.

336
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,000
Get ready.

337
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,960
What is that?

338
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,720
The one who will come. Mahdi.

339
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,520
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent
to the spice blow.

340
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,440
Give her some time, Muad'Dib.

341
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,720
Liet is dead.

342
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,320
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?

343
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,080
Harkonnen treachery.

344
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
She loved her father very much.

345
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
It needs a new dew collector.

346
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,400
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

347
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,360
We had rivers of it.

348
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,320
Great flowing veins of water.

349
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,320
From the snows of mountains...

350
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,160
...into lakes so wide
you couldn't see the other side.

351
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,800
Oceans of water.

352
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Our home was on the coast.

353
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,520
Great waves would hurl themselves
against the cliffs.

354
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
They used to put me to sleep.

355
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,040
My father had a dream, Muad'Dib.

356
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,960
A dream that one day...

357
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,240
...we could change this place...

358
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,240
...make it more like your homeland.

359
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,960
Windtrap.

360
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,040
Plenty of moisture this morning.

361
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,840
My father is at peace.

362
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,680
Muad'Dib.

363
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,080
We have thousands of these caches.

364
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,240
Only a few of us know them all.

365
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,040
I know this place.

366
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,000
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.

367
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,080
In my dreams.

368
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,720
This is the water we will use
to change the face of Arrakis.

369
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,240
As my father taught us...

370
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,560
...the voice from the out-world will come.

371
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,840
The Mahdi.

372
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,800
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.

373
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,680
And no man shall ever want
for water again.

374
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:48,160
Muad'Dib.

375
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,400
Come.

376
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,640
You summoned me, Highness?

377
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,680
- I have a special errand for you, Farrah.
- I'm here to serve, Milady.

378
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,600
I'm sending you to the Harkonnen planet,
Giedi Prime.

379
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,160
I want you to insinuate yourself
among the fat Baron's family.

380
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,320
His nephew, Feyd, the narcissistic type...

381
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,520
...should be especially amenable
to your expert charms.

382
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,840
And how will you want me to use him?

383
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,520
I want to know what happened the night
Duke Leto and his family were killed.

384
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,400
I want to know how it was planned...

385
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,200
...who was involved...

386
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,440
...and I want to know
who the Harkonnen allies were.

387
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,800
I'll do my best.

388
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,480
I've no doubt of that.

389
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,440
Just as you said, Stil.

390
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,320
Harkonnen greed for spice
is the most reliable beacon in the universe.

391
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,560
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.

392
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,280
Anyone else hear that?

393
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,240
We didn't even have to damage
the thopter.

394
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,000
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.

395
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,520
That was our last communication.

396
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,280
No mayday or wreckage
when we went to investigate.

397
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,000
That's the third thopter this month!

398
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,840
The patch turned out to be mock spice.

399
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,800
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!

400
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,520
We caught these last night,
a village near the rimwall...

401
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,360
...known to be desert sympathisers.

402
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,080
Mercy, Governor.

403
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,560
We are refugees.

404
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,160
- We need food.
- Liar!

405
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,520
Spies! That's what you are!

406
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,720
Spies for the Fremen scum!

407
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,480
Fremen scum
who raid my spice warehouses!

408
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.

409
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,040
He was trying to dispose of this
when we caught him.

410
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,880
Send words to the filth of the desert!

411
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,880
Tell them what you witness here!

412
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,920
Tell them this is what awaits them!

413
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,600
Mahdi!

414
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,760
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.

415
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,200
The latest love letter from your brother.

416
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,080
Mahdi!

417
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,800
Appears to be enjoying himself.

418
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,160
The moron's appetite for killing
never ceases to amaze me.

419
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,320
By the time he's finished,
there won't be a population left to rule.

420
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,400
Cheer up, lovely boy.

421
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,400
I merely allow him to brutalise them,
to savage them, until you arrive...

422
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,560
...the handsome Feyd,
to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.

423
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,600
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.

424
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,800
Feyd, the saviour.

425
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,200
There will be cheering in the streets.

426
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,040
You can even give them
your brother's head as a gift, if you like.

427
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,120
And then you will squeeze,
like the grips of a vice...

428
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,320
...so our treasuries become fat
with the profit of spice.

429
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,720
No man recognises leadership...

430
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,600
...without the challenge of combat.

431
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,440
It is the way.

432
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,600
Call him out!

433
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,280
What do you see...

434
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,400
...Muad'Dib...

435
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,400
...when you go away like that?

436
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,360
Where is it you go?

437
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,200
Many places, Stil.

438
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,400
Many roads.

439
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,280
Many choices.

440
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,600
These choices...

441
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
...are good or bad?

442
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,240
It's hard to know sometimes.

443
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,000
Either they are good choices
or bad choices.

444
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,880
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?

445
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,480
Of storms?

446
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,680
Of the future.

447
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,720
The future, Muad'Dib, just is.

448
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,560
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!

449
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,080
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!

450
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,480
Need immediate evacuation!

451
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,160
We are ready, Muad'Dib.

452
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,920
Muad'Dib, it's time. We must hurry.

453
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,120
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.

454
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,040
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.

455
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,880
He made it clear on his arrival
that we should summon you and no other.

456
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,640
The other witches must leave.

457
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,080
As you wish.

458
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,840
This visit is as indiscreet
as it is unexpected.

459
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,040
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity
isn't aroused.

460
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,600
The Emperor's suspicions
are easily moderated...

461
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,520
...by his dependence on our services.

462
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,400
As you are so fond of reminding us.

463
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,960
The navigators are concerned.

464
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,040
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.

465
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,400
There is a problem on the horizon.

466
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,840
What kind of problem?

467
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,760
They are troubled by a nexus
they can't fully explore...

468
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,440
...an intersection of events...

469
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,480
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions
beyond which lies a path...

470
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,400
...they cannot see.

471
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,960
And where is this nexus?

472
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,920
Planet Arrakis.

473
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,400
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.

474
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,160
The Atreides are dead.

475
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,520
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.

476
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,640
We sense a higher order interfering.

477
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,400
A misstep could be catastrophic.

478
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,200
Then we understand one another.

479
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,200
Completely.

480
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,040
We'll do what we can.

481
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,040
I thought...

482
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,440
...I felt something.

483
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,680
The spice must flow.

484
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,360
The balance of power must be maintained.

485
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,080
Sayyadina?

486
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,320
I'm awake, Chani.

487
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,840
Has there been any word,
a courier perhaps?

488
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,720
No. The raids are in the Haga basin.

489
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,840
They won't risk communication
until they are deep across the bled.

490
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,040
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?

491
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,120
No.

492
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,120
It's just your skin.

493
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,120
My skin?

494
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,000
We've heard the stories
about off-worlders...

495
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,160
...the ones who come from water planets.

496
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,640
Skin so moist it's like cream.

497
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,080
- Muad'Dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?

498
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,440
Muad'Dib is still a boy.

499
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,960
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.

500
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,200
Yes.

501
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,120
I say my prayers for his safe return.

502
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,400
We both do, Chani.

503
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,320
The smugglers transport our spice tribute
to the cursed Spacing Guild.

504
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,360
The Emperor never knows.

505
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,120
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.

506
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,320
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'Dib.

507
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,400
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.

508
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,480
Something wrong, Muad'Dib?

509
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
I thought I saw someone I knew.

510
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,680
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.

511
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,120
No, Stil.

512
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,800
Let them go.

513
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,840
I must have been mistaken.

514
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,320
Gurney.

515
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,040
My father's patience is wearing thin.

516
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,720
These troubles on Arrakis
are proving difficult to manage...

517
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,400
...and our time is running short.

518
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,240
I want you to make arrangements
for a trip to Giedi Prime.

519
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,400
Milady?

520
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,040
The Baron's nephew
is having a birthday celebration.

521
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,960
The Emperor ought to be represented,
don't you think?

522
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,960
I'm in the mood for a party.

523
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,400
Besides, it's time to shed
some of this naiveté.

524
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,680
She is not going!

525
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:27,720
I'm not going to allow that headstrong,
meddlesome child loose in Babylon.

526
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,960
My God, what a catastrophe that would be.

527
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,800
The eldest daughter of the Imperial House
ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen...

528
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,680
...and his dreadful progeny.

529
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,480
Yes, catastrophe indeed.

530
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,320
But perhaps the seducer could be seduced.

531
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,520
The more we know of the Baron's schemes,
the more we are prepared for the endgame.

532
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,640
Our operatives on Giedi Prime
have limited access.

533
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,320
Your daughter, on the other hand...

534
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,520
...has proved quite adept
at intelligence gathering.

535
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,120
Gently chaperoned,
I should think she'd prove quite useful...

536
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,800
...once again.

537
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,040
You've heard the voices
from your sietches.

538
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,120
They say the Mahdi has come.

539
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,680
But you...

540
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,800
...the naibs of your tribes are still cautious.
You resist.

541
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,600
But I am offering you the future.

542
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
The future as Liet saw it.

543
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,880
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.

544
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,160
Here.

545
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,520
And here.

546
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,760
And once we rid Arrakis
of the vile Harkonnen...

547
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,360
...we can complete his dream.

548
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,640
I promise this.

549
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,800
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.

550
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,960
You'll never rid Arrakis
with guerrilla raids, boy.

551
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,960
It will take all-out war.

552
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,320
That's why I'm asking you
for hundreds of your best young men.

553
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,440
I want to give them the Weirding way...

554
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,320
...so they can come back to you
and train hundreds more.

555
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,440
So those hundreds
can train hundreds more.

556
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,720
And then hundreds will become thousands!

557
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,600
The Fedaykin.

558
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,760
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.

559
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,920
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!

560
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,120
My father once told me...

561
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,840
...that here on Arrakis...

562
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,920
...one needed desert power to rule.

563
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,240
You are desert power...

564
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
...and nothing can stop you...

565
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,040
...if you believe.

566
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,640
So you are the one.

567
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,120
Jessica of the Weirding,
our Reverend Mother Ramallo.

568
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,440
Mapes said you were beautiful.

569
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,560
She also said she pitied you.

570
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,640
I need no one's pity.

571
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,560
That remains to be seen.

572
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,880
There is much talk of you in the sietches.

573
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,000
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.

574
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,360
I hear them shout the name Muad'Dib.

575
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,760
He is a natural leader like his father.

576
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,520
The men admire his courage.

577
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,960
It will take more than courage
to survive what's coming.

578
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,560
The boy...

579
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,200
...he knows what it is
that's happening here?

580
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,480
He is aware.

581
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,040
You've exploited our legends well.

582
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,400
We had to survive.

583
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,360
And you may...

584
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,800
...for a while.

585
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,040
But remember this:
the very legend which protects you...

586
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,120
...can also destroy you.

587
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,240
- How are you feeling?
- Well.

588
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,080
Tired sometimes.

589
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,640
Healthy.

590
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,280
And growing fast.

591
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,920
I saw the one
they call the Reverend Mother.

592
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,240
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.

593
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,440
- Why?
- To see me.

594
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,920
To see you.

595
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,360
She's Bene Gesserit.

596
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,680
One of our missionaries.

597
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,440
Convenient.

598
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,040
Stilgar says you've learned much.

599
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,320
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.

600
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,480
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.

601
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,640
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?

602
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,240
Because I loved him.

603
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,400
As long as your father
remained unmarried...

604
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,120
...some of the great houses could still hope
for an alliance through marriage.

605
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,640
We both knew what that meant.

606
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,800
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?

607
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,640
I would have encouraged it.

608
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,960
Politics.

609
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,080
Yes.

610
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,760
Politics.

611
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,200
While I was on the hajra...

612
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,320
...I had dreams about this garden.

613
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,720
Except it wasn't here,
it was somewhere else.

614
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,120
Was I there?

615
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,440
Yes.

616
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,120
And there were children...

617
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,720
...playing, very happy.

618
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,440
A wonderful dream.

619
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,080
Do you think it's possible
to love someone enough...

620
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,440
...you'd be willing to give that person up?

621
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,560
I think...

622
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,160
...there are times when it's necessary
to share the one you love...

623
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,200
...with things greater than both of you.

624
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,400
Everything is connected,
one thing to another.

625
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,440
The living and the dead,
the animate and the inanimate.

626
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,640
A system.

627
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,080
All parts functioning to serve the whole.

628
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,240
Smell the air, Muad'Dib.

629
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,720
Cinnamon.

630
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,680
The pre-spice mass is below us.

631
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,240
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.

632
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,120
The Maker has left her nest long ago.

633
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,040
Her children have joined together
for survival.

634
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,800
They have grown.
They are losing water now.

635
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,880
It will mix with their waste.

636
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,920
If enough has accumulated...

637
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,760
...a giant bubble of foam
will heave up with tremendous force.

638
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,680
A spice blow.

639
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,480
Trading places with the sands above.

640
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,520
The sun and heat will dry it out and...

641
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,640
...soon...

642
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,680
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.

643
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,040
The worm...

644
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,440
...is the spice.

645
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,520
So now you know.

646
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,560
Many of the little makers
will die in the blow.

647
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:42,480
The rest will swim off
to become Shai-hulud, the Great Worm.

648
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,560
We may capture a few.

649
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,720
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.

650
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,280
That's enough for now.

651
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,280
When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...

652
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,040
...the whirlwind follows.

653
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,320
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.

654
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,240
The one who can be many places at once.

655
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,480
You are the whirlwind.

656
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,760
It's almost night, Muad'Dib.

657
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,440
Time to return to the sietch.

658
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,400
You've been dreaming.

659
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,760
Too impatient, Farok.

660
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,800
You moved too soon.

661
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,720
Try again.

662
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,600
Watch his posture.

663
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,520
Even the slightest change in his breathing
gives you advantage.

664
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.

665
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,440
I am Otheym.

666
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,200
These are my brothers
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

667
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,320
We've come to find the one
who calls himself Muad'Dib.

668
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,520
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.

669
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,880
We've come to join your crusade.

670
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,840
We want to learn the Weirding way.

671
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,440
We want to become Fedaykin.

672
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,880
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.

673
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,760
- We could fight as Muad'Dib.
- I believe you.

674
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,840
Let their waters join with ours.

675
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,240
I must congratulate you
on the perfection of your heir, Baron.

676
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,960
He faces his 100th slave gladiator
in the arena this afternoon.

677
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,880
He appears ready.

678
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,840
Well then,
perhaps we might take this opportunity...

679
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,680
...to conduct our conversations.

680
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,560
There is much to discuss.

681
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,680
Indeed.

682
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,160
If that meets with your approval, Milady.

683
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,720
I am quite entertained here.

684
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,840
Fine.

685
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,720
By your leave, then.

686
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,520
What other house would have been willing
to humiliate itself...

687
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,800
...so the Emperor could rid himself
of a troublesome duke?

688
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,160
He's been asking himself
that very question.

689
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,400
Are you suggesting that the Emperor
contemplates a move against me?

690
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,760
Speculation is not a worthy science, Baron.

691
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,800
Better we spend our energy
on what's most important.

692
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,520
The spice must flow.

693
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:30,400
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...

694
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,200
...curious.

695
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,640
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...

696
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,840
...coming deeper into the southern regions
than ever before.

697
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,120
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild
won't be enough to protect us.

698
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,760
Then it's agreed.

699
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,640
We move with the next moons.

700
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,400
When the Harkonnen find this place...

701
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,360
...there must be nothing left
but the wind howling through the rocks.

702
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,800
There is no turning back now.

703
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,800
Subdue the Maker.

704
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,440
The Maker is dead.

705
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,080
The Water of Life.

706
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,920
May Shai-hulud have mercy on both of us.

707
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,120
When night falls again,
we have to leave this sietch...

708
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,200
...that has sheltered us for so long.

709
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,480
We must go south into the deep desert...

710
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,960
...where the demon Harkonnen
will not pursue us.

711
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:21,440
But our Reverend Mother
will not survive another hajra.

712
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,240
So that we don't have to make the journey
without her strength and guidance...

713
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,120
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented
to undergo the rites at this time.

714
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,120
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.

715
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,840
So that we don't lose all, Chani...

716
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,800
...daughter of Liet,
will be consecrated as Sayyadina...

717
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,960
...Friend of God.

718
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,200
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...

719
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,000
...in the Sayyadina.

720
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,800
Here is the Water of Life,
the water that will free your soul.

721
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,600
If you are our Reverend Mother,
the universe will open to you.

722
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,720
Let Shai-hulud judge now.

723
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,440
You must drink it now.

724
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,000
What's happening to her?

725
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,880
The water is poisoned until she changes it.

726
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,240
This must take its course.

727
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,280
Mother? Mother?

728
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,600
You cannot go there.

729
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,400
That is the place we cannot look.

730
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,960
The place only
the Kwisatz Haderach may go.

731
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,560
You must turn away, Jessica,
or it will drive you mad.

732
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,400
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.

733
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,000
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding.

734
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,920
And the lives that have come before,
they are yours now.

735
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,960
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.

736
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,680
Holy Mothers, what have we done?

737
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,200
This changes you both.

738
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,200
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.

739
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,280
She must see all that we see.

740
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,680
That is the only way you can save her.

741
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:06,880
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.

742
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,000
The plan was perfect in its simplicity
and viciousness.

743
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,040
Of course it was.

744
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,280
You helped your uncle design it,
didn't you?

745
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,400
Duke Leto thought
he was gaining control of Arrakis...

746
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,760
...but he was only being fattened up
for sacrifice.

747
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,320
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.

748
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,200
Swift and merciless.

749
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,160
The Atreides never had a chance.

750
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,040
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed
within hours.

751
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,600
The Sardaukar.

752
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:10,080
I sent the final communiqué
to your father myself.

753
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,160
Mother?

754
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,000
Yes?

755
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,320
Mother Ramallo is gone.

756
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,920
But she remains.

757
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,360
You have changed the waters.

758
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,760
Now we know you cannot be false.

759
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,600
Paul?

760
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,560
The Reverend Mother
has changed the Water of Life.

761
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,640
It's now safe for us to drink!

762
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,840
The son and his mother,
the duke's concubine and her son...

763
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,640
...what did you do with them?

764
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:55,360
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.

765
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,440
You found their bodies
and disposed of them?

766
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,080
Never found them.

767
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,440
You never found the bodies?

768
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,800
You're trembling.

769
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,680
I'm afraid.

770
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,280
Of what?

771
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,920
Of you.

772
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,040
You make me see things.

773
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,560
What do you see?

774
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,280
I see us together.

775
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,600
There is a great storm.

776
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,720
I have a child in my arms.

777
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,280
Our child, Muad'Dib.

778
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,200
It's not a dream.

779
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,400
I know you, Chani.

780
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,000
I've always known you.

781
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,360
We've sat upon a rock above the sands
and I've eased your fears.

782
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,360
We've caressed
in the darkness of the sietch.

783
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,000
We've grown old together.

784
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,080
History will say that the Fremen
were about to find their messiah.

785
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:17,160
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...

786
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,400
...and the world, as we knew it,
would change forever.

787
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,920
The saga of Dune is far
from over.

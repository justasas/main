1
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,952
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,536
Dune.

3
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,372
Wasteland of the Empire...

4
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,334
...and the most valuable planet
in the universe...

5
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,798
...because it is here,
and only here, where spice is found.

6
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,842
The spice.

7
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,546
Without it,
there is no commerce in the Empire.

8
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,043
There is no civilization.

9
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,205
Arrakis.

10
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,034
Dune.

11
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,322
Home of the spice.

12
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,984
Greatest treasure in the universe.

13
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,016
And he who controls it,
controls our destiny.

14
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,444
Father!

15
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,579
This move to Arrakis comes
at a delicate moment for House Atreides.

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,994
A test of your father's loyalty
to the Emperor.

17
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,869
You must remember, Paul...

18
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:46,705
...our society is a tangled web
of competing forces.

19
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,690
Our civilization rests upon
a political tripod...

20
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,333
...a most unstable of structures.

21
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:59,122
A deceptive balance of power exists
between the Emperor...

22
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:04,362
...the Congress of Royal Houses, and
the supposedly impartial Spacing Guild...

23
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:07,855
...with its invulnerable monopoly
on interstellar transport.

24
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,294
Complicated by a feudal trading culture
that turns its...

25
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,030
Dr. Yueh would be disappointed.

26
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,209
Then he'd know how I feel.

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,578
It's never easy leaving one's home, Paul.

28
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,292
Think of this as a new adventure,
the adventure of a lifetime.

29
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,545
You call this an adventure?

30
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:40,093
Leaving our home for some dry speck
of dust in the middle of nowhere?

31
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,581
You're a duke's son.

32
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,601
You have duties, responsibilities.

33
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,684
How could I ever forget?

34
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:52,396
Every day I have to eat responsibility
for breakfast and duty for dinner.

35
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,734
Sarcasm doesn't become you.

36
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,321
I just want to see my father.

37
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,037
So do I.

38
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,722
The Reverend Mother has arrived.

39
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,503
She wants to see you
before we depart for Arrakis.

40
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,366
You have given him your face, Jessica.

41
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,162
But the father has given him his eyes.

42
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,955
And his courage.

43
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,582
We shall see.

44
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,876
Come here, boy.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,041
Let me have a better look at you.

46
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:03,694
If you know what's good for you,
you'll do as I say.

47
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,812
I'll be the judge of
what's good for me.

48
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,523
Your mother has taught you many things,
I see.

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,858
She tells me you dream.

50
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,604
Your Reverence...

51
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,686
- ...if I could...
- You're dismissed, Jessica.

52
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,331
Since when is it permitted to treat
the Lady Jessica as a common servant?

53
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,430
She was a common servant.

54
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,800
My servant.

55
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,288
And a good one, too...

56
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:57,059
...until she was 16,
and your father took her.

57
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,615
Now, I would like to hear
about your dreams.

58
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,183
They're just dreams.

59
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,471
About what?

60
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,704
Why don't you tell me?

61
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,755
Do you know what this is?

62
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,086
It is a test, young Atreides.

63
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,288
A test for what?

64
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,989
Put your hand inside and we'll see.

65
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,794
What's in it?

66
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,204
Pain.

67
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,446
I hold the Gom Jabbar at your throat,
young Atreides.

68
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,195
Keep your hand in the box and live.

69
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,277
Remove it and die.

70
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,935
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

71
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,686
That's right, boy.

72
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,352
Pray.

73
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:21,268
I will face my fear,
I will let it pass through me.

74
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:25,184
And when the fear is gone
there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

75
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:50,146
No woman child,
ever withstood that much pain.

76
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,812
You are a gifted boy, young Atreides...

77
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,772
...but you have much to learn.

78
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,527
He survived.

79
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:05,030
You should've warned me.

80
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,954
She was forbidden.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,169
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,465
Paul! Paul...

83
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,318
You were supposed to have a daughter.

84
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,244
You have hopelessly complicated matters.

85
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:28,150
An Atreides daughter could've been wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

86
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:31,516
The feud between the houses
could have been ended.

87
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,219
My duke wanted a son.

88
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,179
You arrogant girl.

89
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,516
Putting his desires above our interests.

90
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,187
How dare you turn your back on
the centuries of our breeding programmes.

91
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,730
I'll pay for my mistakes.

92
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,204
And your son will pay it with you.

93
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,728
We'll do what we can.

94
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,196
He may be worth saving...

95
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,237
...but for the father, nothing.

96
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,427
Good thing you don't play your baliset
as badly as you fight, Gurney-man.

97
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,679
Too bad Duncan isn't here.

98
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,469
- Then I could get a real workout.
- Now you've done it.

99
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,007
Whoa, Gurney-man.

100
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:26,006
Never submit to anger.

101
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,206
Fast on defense, slow on the attack.

102
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,452
You forgot your first principle, Gurney.

103
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:38,619
Not likely.

104
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,415
Look down, lad.

105
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,930
Perhaps you'd like to sing soprano
next time I play.

106
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,417
Guess I'm just not in the mood today.

107
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,549
Not in the mood?

108
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:00,432
Mood is a thing for cattle and women,
young pup.

109
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,303
Mood is not for fighting.

110
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,957
Even with the Weirding ways
your mother teaches you.

111
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,869
It's that old Bene Gesserit witch.

112
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,479
Something she said...

113
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,200
...or did.

114
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,701
The navigator is arriving.

115
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:13,524
We'll be on our way to Arrakis soon.

116
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:17,144
It is said that they depend on the spice...

117
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:21,223
...and that without it, they can't navigate.

118
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,307
It is said.

119
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,725
They used to be human, didn't they?

120
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,312
Until the spice changed them.

121
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,900
I don't think anyone knows for sure.

122
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,778
I've never seen one.

123
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,031
No one has.

124
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,953
It's forbidden, Paul.

125
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,499
So don't endanger
our shipping privileges trying.

126
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,754
All non-Guild personnel,
please secure quarters.

127
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,796
Will Arrakis be as bad as they say, Thufir?

128
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,916
The storms, perhaps.

129
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:08,581
They can eat the flesh off your bones
as you stand.

130
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:13,077
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm is the giant worm.

131
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,866
It's not worms I worry about.

132
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,606
Your father is a formidable man, Paul.

133
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,930
Even the Emperor fears him.

134
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:30,665
I'd sooner cast my fate with him
than trust anything...

135
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,993
...some Bene Gesserit hag said.

136
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,793
Why do you hate them?

137
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,993
The Bene Gesserits?

138
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,293
I don't hate them.

139
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,193
I don't trust them.

140
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,093
I am a Mentat.

141
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:56,093
I trust logics and statistics, not
mysticism and prophecy.

142
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,611
And so it begins.

143
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,672
The trap is set, the prey approaches.

144
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:26,058
A glorious winter is about to descend
on House Atreides and all its heirs.

145
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:30,658
The centuries of humiliation,
visited upon my family...

146
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,434
...will finally be avenged.

147
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,240
But Arrakis was mine!

148
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,619
Shut up, Rabban.

149
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,961
I did what you said, Uncle.

150
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,622
I made the people cover.

151
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,587
I crushed that vile planet.

152
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,397
He said squeeze, brother, not crush.

153
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,845
Rabban aspires to rule House Harkonnen
one day, Feyd.

154
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,549
And yet he can't even rule himself.

155
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:57,003
Explain our plan, Mentat.

156
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,890
The plan is elegant and vicious, dear Baron.

157
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,189
Of course it is.

158
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,822
I designed it.

159
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:11,089
In order for the Empire to survive,
the spice must flow.

160
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,192
But the production
has become inconsistent.

161
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:22,750
In his wisdom, the Emperor decided
only one man is honest enough...

162
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:28,079
...and loyal enough to be trusted with
restoring the spice production adequately.

163
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,359
Duke Leto Atreides.

164
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:35,127
Temporarily interrupting
80 years of Harkonnen rule...

165
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,841
...and all the profits that go with it.

166
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,000
I said temporarily, you moron.

167
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,170
It doesn't take long for Duke Leto
to believe he has Arrakis...

168
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:49,423
...firmly under control.

169
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,719
And then,
at the moment of his greatest confidence...

170
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,803
The traitor strikes.

171
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,390
A traitor? Who?

172
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,725
That remains my little secret for now.

173
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,813
What about the other great houses?
They're sure to protest.

174
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,941
Perverting common wisdom, Nephew,
is a mark of all great conspiracies.

175
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,029
You see, Nephews,
a popular man arouses jealousy...

176
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,364
...and Duke Leto is a very popular man.

177
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,239
The other great houses
will be glad to get rid of him...

178
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:19,528
...even though they would never admit it.

179
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:20,777
The spice...

180
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,399
...will flow.

181
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:29,729
The Emperor will be pleased
and House Harkonnen...

182
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,394
...will be more powerful than ever.

183
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,474
Alone and vulnerable,
at the edge of the universe...

184
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:41,054
...valiant Duke Leto
will finally come face to face with fear.

185
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,886
When I'm through,
he won't know who to trust...

186
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:49,632
...not even that Bene Gesserit witch
he sleeps with.

187
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:53,838
They'll all be turning on one another
like rats in the flood.

188
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,543
By the time the traitor is fully revealed...

189
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,581
...the fate of Atreides
will already be sealed.

190
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,311
My son always says
you have a feline grace, Duncan.

191
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,648
I didn't want to startle you, Milord.

192
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:42,350
The latest emigration reports.

193
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:49,762
They fear our regime
will be as bad as the Harkonnens'.

194
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,177
We're losing too many.

195
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,923
Spice hunters, drivers, weather scanners,
dune men, we'll need.

196
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,511
Should I, er, persuade some to stay?

197
00:18:58,636 --> 00:18:59,720
No.

198
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,890
I have something more important
for you to do.

199
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,852
I want you to go into the desert.

200
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,145
The Fremen?

201
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:11,648
I'm getting reports of hundreds,
perhaps thousands, in villages...

202
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,567
what they call "Sietches".

203
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,114
In the deep desert.

204
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,992
Beyond the mountains.

205
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,829
The Harkonnen sneered
at the desert people.

206
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,623
Hunted them for sport.

207
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:32,086
- I doubt they'll expect any better from us.
- Then we have to change that.

208
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,882
We're going to need allies here, Duncan.

209
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,086
I want you to seek out their leader...

210
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:45,453
...this Liet I keep hearing about.

211
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:46,910
A phantom.

212
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,323
He may not even exist.

213
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,944
He could even be many different men.

214
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,316
Find out.

215
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:04,263
Negotiate patience so I can demonstrate
our good intentions with deeds.

216
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,590
If I'm lucky, they will judge all of us by you.

217
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,255
You honor me, sir.

218
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,585
I am endangering you and I know it...

219
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:18,915
...but you're the only one
I can trust with this.

220
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,658
Such a dusty little garrison town.

221
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:28,154
A testament of the harsh climate
of the place.

222
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,775
What's he doing?

223
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,736
Water seller, Milady.

224
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,114
You need never bother
with the likes of them.

225
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,949
The cistern at the palace
holds 50,000 gallons...

226
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,160
...and it's always kept full.

227
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,330
What's wrong with their eyes?

228
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,623
Those are Fremen, desert people.

229
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,334
It's the spice.

230
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,794
It's everywhere: the air, the food.

231
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,548
By the time a Fremen child is 12
his eyes have turned completely blue.

232
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,293
Guards everywhere.

233
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,337
We didn't have to live like this on Caladan.

234
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:43,258
Family apartments are in the west wing.
The furniture is being brought up.

235
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,798
What is this for?

236
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:47,043
An old custom, I'm told.

237
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:51,575
Guests ceremoniously splash water
on the floor after washing their hands.

238
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,681
They save the squeezings.

239
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,469
Demeaning custom.

240
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,829
Idaho has prepared for us well, Milord.

241
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,164
Duncan?

242
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:15,499
Where is Duncan? Can I see him?

243
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,460
I have him occupied on official business
for the moment.

244
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:19,711
You have to be patient.

245
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:22,380
I've assembled the general staff,
as you requested.

246
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,924
No, don't take it up there.

247
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,423
I want the coat of arms to hang here.

248
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:31,216
The first thing visitors must see,

249
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:33,467
this is House Atreides now.

250
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:44,928
We are not like the Harkonnen.

251
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,512
You will be treated here with respect.

252
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:54,598
From now on,
we speak the lady's language at all times.

253
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:02,849
The Shadout Mapes, Milady,
head of household staff.

254
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,643
Mapes, show Milady our apartments.
Make sure she has everything she needs.

255
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:11,393
I'll join you after the briefing.

256
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:13,894
This way, Milady.

257
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,563
Come, Paul.

258
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,898
The men are waiting.

259
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:22,064
Me?

260
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:24,271
Right now?

261
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,772
It's time you participate it.

262
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:39,145
I've had the girls sandscrub these walls
to within a millimeter of their frames.

263
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:42,397
The Harkonnen stench is finally gone.

264
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:55,563
Built by off-worlders many years ago.

265
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,439
A chapel for the memories of what
they left behind when they came here.

266
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:28,730
A thousand people
could survive a year on the water...

267
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:31,231
...it takes to keep this place a month.

268
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:34,357
And a Harkonnen
never let us forget it, Milady.

269
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,106
Your name, Shadout,
it means well-dipper, doesn't it?

270
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:42,856
I was raised in the desert sietches,
Noble-born.

271
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,691
Refer to me as Milady, Mapes.
I'm not noble-born.

272
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,446
I am the bound concubine of the duke.

273
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,532
There is no wife?

274
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:56,368
I'm his only companion,
the mother of his son.

275
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,956
You are Bene Gesserit?

276
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,417
Yes, I know the ancient tongues.

277
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:18,475
Tell the people, Mapes,
this place belongs to them now.

278
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,771
As long as we rule here...

279
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,525
...the Atreides family
will keep it in trust for them.

280
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,872
Stay there.

281
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,327
Give them back their money.

282
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,193
Go on.

283
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,934
It is a custom, Milady.

284
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:54,761
This custom stops now.

285
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,145
Do as I said.

286
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:58,160
Do as I said.

287
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,562
Water will never again be sold
at the Atreides' door.

288
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:10,150
At the end of every meal,
any person who calls at this door...

289
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,196
...may receive a full cup,
free.

290
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,375
Is it possible?

291
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,457
Could it be possible
that she brings the Mahdi?

292
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,619
The thing must take its course.

293
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,489
What about the mining accounts?

294
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,152
The Harkonnen spice operation took...

295
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,315
...10 billion solaris out of here
every year.

296
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:51,400
Now, does anyone here still think that the
Harkonnen have just packed up and left?

297
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,031
Gurney, I want you to make contact...

298
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,157
...with the smugglers
operating in the deep desert.

299
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,787
Tell them that we'll ignore
what they're doing from now on...

300
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,498
...as long as they make it worth our while.

301
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,045
The Emperor is extremely jealous
of his spice profits, Milord.

302
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,376
It's one thing
to turn a blind eye to smugglers,

303
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,370
it's quite another
to pocket some of their earnings.

304
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,117
Well, then just tell him what we're doing.

305
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:30,189
Bank the entire amount to his name,
Shaddam IV.

306
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:35,515
But then deduct it from our taxes
as a legitimate expense.

307
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,972
In other words, cost of doing business.

308
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,543
What?

309
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,169
I would just love to see the Baron's face
when he hears of this.

310
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,548
All the Harkonnen parasites
who got rich taking smuggler bribes...

311
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,010
...will be flushed into the open.

312
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,802
No more graft.

313
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,263
The Emperor cannot deny this.

314
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,765
Not in public, anyhow.

315
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,811
Well done, lad,
well done

316
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,012
Now...

317
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,886
An emperor's daughter must do better.

318
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:48,650
Worthy to be your first-born?

319
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:53,933
They tell me her ambitions
tend more to the literary than the political.

320
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:59,350
Never underestimate the political uses
of an awakened mind, Majesty.

321
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:05,174
Subterfuge and cunning are often
better allies than a fierce heart...

322
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,612
...and a strong back.

323
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,712
All she lacks is the primacy of our gender.

324
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,767
Then you must marry her well.

325
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:19,114
Someone with a suitably
pliable personality.

326
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,626
Too bad it won't be that young Atreides.

327
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:26,011
The most admirable lad, I'm told.

328
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,682
Good union of breeding and training.

329
00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:34,848
We must arrange to send Duke Leto
a token of our love.

330
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:40,057
He must continue to think of us fondly.

331
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,142
Why did we come here, Father?

332
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:01,599
And don't just tell me
it's a matter of honor or duty.

333
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,392
There's more to it, isn't there?

334
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,640
I've never lied to you, Son.

335
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:21,882
We've been entrusted with the most
profitable commodity in the universe.

336
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:25,713
That alone makes us many enemies.

337
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,792
Then why don't we call them out?

338
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:30,625
Expose them...

339
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,413
...in front of the Emperor.

340
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,579
What if he's one of them?

341
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:39,910
This is a hard lesson, Son.

342
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:44,949
In the world we live in,
self-interest governs all.

343
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,905
The Emperor needs us...

344
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:55,692
...for the moment, to administer Arrakis,
to make the spice flow.

345
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:58,482
But he fears us, Paul.

346
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,943
He fears my influence
among the great houses.

347
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,659
If he decides it's in his interests...

348
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,413
...that House Atreides should fall,
he will do nothing to stop it.

349
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:18,082
He might even...

350
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,919
...invite opportunity to hasten it.

351
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,796
Well then, if you're right,
this place is a trap.

352
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,965
Perhaps.

353
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:35,168
But knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

354
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:42,248
I should've taken
the House Atreides renegade...

355
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:45,788
...fled to the darkest corners
of the universe.

356
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:49,078
You're too honorable for that, my love.

357
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,910
No. I'm too fed up.

358
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:07,572
This endless feud stops here.

359
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,818
The Harkonnen are a rogue clan, Leto.

360
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:17,774
No matter how much prestige
they try to buy...

361
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:21,981
...they'll never have the respect
you've earned.

362
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,312
Respect can't buy us peace.

363
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,976
I'd trade it all for a place somewhere,...

364
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,554
...anywhere where we could be alone,
where Paul could be safe.

365
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:40,920
And all I had to think about
was your happiness.

366
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:49,204
Maybe then I could finally make...

367
00:32:57,238 --> 00:33:00,525
Please, don't talk about things
that can't be.

368
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,439
You belong to your time,
I was bred to my destiny.

369
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:09,855
Even if I were able to go back and choose...

370
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,272
...I would change nothing.

371
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,860
One of yours, Turok?

372
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:26,027
Harkonnen mercenaries.

373
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:37,533
Save your strength for the desert, Atreides.
Word has already been sent to the palace.

374
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,285
We have people among you.

375
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,162
- Are they trustworthy?
- They are Fremen.

376
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,125
I'll take care of these.

377
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,125
I didn't mean to intrude.

378
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,125
Forgive me, milady.
I was enjoying the morning.

379
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:38,125
For a moment I could imagine
my wife walking there.

380
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:48,625
My Suk-conditioning is supposed to rid me
of such unstable versions as hope.

381
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,625
Still, it's all I have left.

382
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,425
We have spies everywhere, Dr. Yueh.

383
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:58,725
If she's still alive, we'll find her.

384
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,825
Seems almost a sacrilege,

385
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,825
wasting one's water in a land
starved for it.

386
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,625
I'm sorry we drived you here
to this dangerous place.

387
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,525
I came willingly, milady.

388
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,140
Only half the sandcrawlers are operable...

389
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:42,187
...but we'll have most of the ornithopters
working soon.

390
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,393
That is a harvester factory.

391
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,879
We have about 1,000.

392
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,003
As big as she is,

393
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:51,250
there are worms in the deep desert
that could swallow one whole.

394
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,789
Why don't we use shields?

395
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,498
Shields are useless in the desert.

396
00:36:55,569 --> 00:37:00,060
Even a simple body shield
will call every worm within 100 kilometers.

397
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:02,585
Drives them into a killing frenzy.

398
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:05,708
The imperial ecologist, Milord, Dr. Kynes.

399
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:09,044
We prefer the traditional term,
planetologist.

400
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,894
I understand that we have you to thank
for our stillsuits.

401
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,860
I hope they fit well.

402
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,163
This is basically a high-efficiency filter
and heat-exchange system.

403
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,294
The skin layer is porous.

404
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:25,890
Perspiration passes through heat filaments
and salt precipitators.

405
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,988
Water is reclaimed in catchpockets,
which you can draw from this tube.

406
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:37,169
Properly adjusted, water loss
is kept under 15 milliliters a day.

407
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,756
That's hardly measurable.

408
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,539
That's the point.

409
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,973
You're a Fremen.

410
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:51,144
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

411
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,686
But I am in the Emperor's employ.

412
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,817
You've worn a stillsuit before?

413
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,193
This is the first time.

414
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,485
Someone adjusted it for you?

415
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:07,985
No, it just seemed the right way
to put it on, that's all.

416
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:13,736
Well then...

417
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:17,028
...the desert awaits.

418
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,949
Maintain 120 degrees southeast, Milord.

419
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,324
Set.

420
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,527
That's where the sandmaster
is concentrating his equipment.

421
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,397
How many men are there
on a mining crew?

422
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,770
As few as possible.

423
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:00,137
Mining is a perilous adventure at best,
Milord.

424
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:04,089
Has anyone ever been lost out this far
and survived?

425
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,095
Men have walked out of the nearer zones
by crossing the rock areas...

426
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,137
...where worms seldom go.

427
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,139
Fremen?

428
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,726
Fremen.

429
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,144
There it is.

430
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,855
That's the harvester.

431
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,358
And those are the scouts?

432
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,526
Yes.

433
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,111
Watching for worm sign.

434
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,529
Worm sign?

435
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,281
Wherever there is spice, there are worms.

436
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,658
Always?

437
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,704
They defend the spice sands.

438
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,456
Has there been an effort to wipe them out?

439
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,460
Too much area to cover. Too many worms.

440
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,214
A rich field by the look of the color.

441
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,877
Is that worm sign?

442
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:53,782
Where's the carryall
to evacuate the harvester?

443
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:56,027
Worm sign, approximately 40 kilometers.

444
00:39:56,153 --> 00:39:57,150
He's got you.

445
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,354
Estimated intercept, six minutes.

446
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,273
Do they always cut it this close?

447
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:04,193
It's not standard procedure.
The carryall should be here by now.

448
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,986
- How many men on that harvester?
- Usually 23, Milord.

449
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,823
- Are we sure the worm will attack?
- No doubt about it.

450
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,367
Crew on the harvester,
this is Duke Leto Atreides.

451
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:16,078
We're coming to take you out.
Cease operations and prepare for evacuation.

452
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,665
Spotters, land to the west.
Prepare to be boarded.

453
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,543
Those spotters only carry four men,
in addition to the crew Milord.

454
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,295
We can only get another two in here.

455
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:25,754
Paul, you and Gurney can get to
work on the back seats.

456
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:28,132
We'll jettison them when we land.
I will get in three more.

457
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:32,345
This is harvester Delta Ajax Niner.
With all due respect Sir, we have almost a full load.

458
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,639
Damn the spice.
We can always get more. Prepare for evac.

459
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,097
That's an order!

460
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,749
Worm sighting! Worm sighting!
10 degrees southwest.

461
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:49,576
Estimated speed, 40 knots.
We have an approach.

462
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,569
Worm intercept, five minutes.

463
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,557
Sandmaster, this is a direct command
from your duke.

464
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,598
Cease operations
and evacuate the station immediately...

465
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:25,721
...or I'll cut your ship in two
with a lasgun.

466
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:37,092
I can hear it.

467
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,469
The worm.

468
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:42,008
I can hear it coming.

469
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,547
Over here! Over here!

470
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,501
Both of you, over here!

471
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:53,207
The rest to the spotters!

472
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,772
Run, you sand dogs, run!

473
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:02,931
Get down and hang onto anything you can.

474
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:15,790
What are they doing?

475
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,286
Milord, we must go now! Hurry!

476
00:43:15,682 --> 00:43:17,348
Capacity overload.

477
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,460
We need altitude or it'll suck us down.

478
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:25,128
Capacity overload.

479
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,024
Capacity exceeds lift capability.

480
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:50,856
Bless the Maker and his water.

481
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:53,231
Bless his coming and his going.

482
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:55,940
May his passage cleanse the world.

483
00:43:57,232 --> 00:43:59,607
May he keep the world for his people.

484
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:06,440
How about the men we left behind?

485
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:10,022
- Send a ship to search for them.
- But they were right by the worm...

486
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:11,231
Send a ship anyway.

487
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,184
When God ordains a man's time to die...

488
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:19,215
...he directs that man to the proper place.

489
00:44:19,798 --> 00:44:20,962
- What?
- Paul.

490
00:44:21,502 --> 00:44:25,161
I want the pilots from that missing carryall
delivered to me personally.

491
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,324
Someone's going to pay for that waste.

492
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,324
This is a different kind of man.

493
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:40,824
He risked his life and that of his son
to save the men instead of the Spice.

494
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,524
A leader like that could have commended
fanatic loyalty.

495
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,318
This is my legacy to you, Son.

496
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:02,740
The greatest wealth in the universe
and the never-ending struggle to defend it.

497
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:08,120
The ancients used to say
danger and opportunity were...

498
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,290
...often the same thing father.

499
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,455
This is not one of Yueh's
academic exercises, Paul.

500
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,869
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea.

501
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,160
And here we need desert power.

502
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,198
Desert power!

503
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:33,114
Remember that.

504
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,737
Mahdi, Mahdi.

505
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:06,858
Leto is growing more popular
with every passing week.

506
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:12,440
He has ruined our system
of bribes and patronage.

507
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:16,941
He's been able to maintain the spice quota
despite our sabotage.

508
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,098
Even that mongrel ecologist Kynes
is sending the Emperor favorable reports.

509
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,778
And what do you deduce
from all of this, Nephew?

510
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,555
The longer we wait,
the harder it will be to dislodge him.

511
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,954
Piter, try again, will you?

512
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,071
Leto's continued success makes
the other great houses nervous, Rabban.

513
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:42,358
We can hear whispers, petty jealousies
that could easily give birth...

514
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:44,246
...to considerable envy.

515
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:45,757
Bugger envy!

516
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,678
We have a traitor among them.

517
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:53,465
I say strike now!

518
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:14,014
For your approval, Uncle.

519
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:17,509
The slave is quite a specimen this time,
don't you think, Rabban?

520
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:20,422
Perhaps Feyd
shouldn't be quite so casual today.

521
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,338
No.

522
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:26,841
Perhaps my dear brother
might even break a sweat today.

523
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,435
What you fail to understand...

524
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,398
...is that I want Leto to become popular.

525
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,985
I want him to feel secure.

526
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,615
I want him to feel confident.

527
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,080
Confidence breeds distraction.

528
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:03,538
And that is when one is most vulnerable.

529
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,665
Such a beautiful boy.

530
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,800
Little is known about the giant sandworms
that inhabit the desert regions of Arrakis.

531
00:48:56,142 --> 00:49:01,665
It is known that worms are drawn to the
vibration and noise of mining activity.

532
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:06,500
However there is no direct evidence linking
desert worms to Spice production.

533
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,665
Needs a new dew collector.

534
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,100
Dew collector?

535
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,700
Chromaplastic.

536
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,400
At night it cools very fast.

537
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,000
In the morning, daylight heats it.

538
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:23,000
The surface condenses moisture
out of the air...

539
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:28,200
and it trickles down to keep
the plants alive.

540
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,600
- A simple beauty.
- A meaningless beauty.

541
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,000
In such a godforsaken place.

542
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,900
We deal here with the
law of the minimum.

543
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,600
Unless we learn to live with it,
conditions can never change.

544
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,700
Favorable conditions?

545
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,600
Change the ecology of the planet?

546
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,500
That depends.

547
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,600
On what?

548
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,665
On who the stewart of the desert is.

549
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,960
Perhaps one day the person will
come who will understand,

550
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:31,600
who will see the future
and know what can be.

551
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,200
The one who will change Arrakis.

552
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,400
The Mahdi.

553
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,236
You asked me to inquire
about the shouting the other day.

554
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,238
The words they were calling out
at your shuttle.

555
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,156
"Mahdi", something like that.

556
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,075
It means messiah.

557
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,454
They have a legend here, a prophecy...

558
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,209
...that a leader will come to them
from off-world.

559
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,964
A boy. The only son of a Bene Gesserit.

560
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,005
To guide them to true freedom.

561
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:20,420
Messiah?

562
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:22,378
Paul?

563
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:25,707
These are, uh, simple people, Milord.

564
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,705
They survive on hope.

565
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,195
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

566
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:03,970
I'm sorry, Milord.

567
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,551
Mapes didn't tell me you were in here.

568
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:09,089
No wait.

569
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:11,919
It's fine.

570
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,081
I was tired.

571
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,076
I fell asleep.

572
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,864
You can go on about your work.

573
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,622
Tell me...

574
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:55,499
...do the cooks use much spice in our food?

575
00:53:56,876 --> 00:54:00,210
The spice is everywhere
on Arrakis, Milord.

576
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:03,836
Everywhere.

577
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:20,884
Don't move.

578
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,053
Just do exactly as I say.

579
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:41,317
It's a hunter-seeker.

580
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,489
They will kill you...

581
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,450
...instantly, if you move.

582
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,954
Listen to me.

583
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,958
The operator, wherever he is...

584
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,876
...can only target movement.

585
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,419
Stay perfectly still.

586
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:04,040
Don't give in.

587
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,956
Fear is the mind killer.

588
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,046
You're lucky to be alive.

589
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,752
I was its target?

590
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:05,123
It goes toward movement, that's all.

591
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,663
You could have let it go
and saved yourself.

592
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,675
There is a traitor among you.

593
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,009
Someone close.

594
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,929
Someone very close.

595
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,773
I want him alive!

596
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,697
Hey, you!

597
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,236
They tried to take the life of my son!

598
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:22,900
He looks local.

599
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,711
- There's nothing to identify him.
- Harkonnen, surely.

600
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,570
- And not working alone...
- Stop it, both of you!

601
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,175
Burn him.

602
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,933
Everything except the hands.

603
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:47,142
Put some spice in each one...

604
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:51,100
...and send them to the Baron
on Giedi Prime.

605
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,551
He almost took the life of my son.

606
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,230
Get out, all of you! Out!

607
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:06,983
You simple ass.

608
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,528
I told you that I wanted
those bastard Atreides to feel secure.

609
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,530
But no, you couldn't wait.
You had to have your own way.

610
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,492
Now your "initiative"
has made them more defensive.

611
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,744
Now what, Piter?

612
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,665
Advancing our timetable
would seem appropriate at this point.

613
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,460
Another blinding burst of insight!

614
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,756
How is it that I am blessed with such
extraordinary counselors as these?

615
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,843
There is, of course,
the slight troop-transport problem.

616
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:40,181
Our negotiations with the Spacing Guild
are not yet concluded.

617
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,094
Damn the Guild and their navigators.

618
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:47,456
Even the Emperor can't move without the
blessing of the Spacing Guild, dear Baron.

619
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:50,945
And what would you suggest,
my most devious Mentat?

620
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:55,599
Offer an increase in spice royalties...

621
00:58:56,265 --> 00:59:00,586
...payable in advance
from Rabban's own reserves...

622
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:02,496
You are out of your mind, you...

623
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,498
Get on with it, Piter.

624
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,418
We must try and turn this setback
to our advantage.

625
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,423
Perhaps your incompetence
will prove useful after all...

626
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:17,676
...and hasten the day
House Atreides must fall.

627
00:59:38,114 --> 00:59:39,990
You're tired, Father.

628
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:42,409
Yes, I am tired.

629
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:48,166
The degeneration of the great houses
has worn me out.

630
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,419
Our house hasn't degenerated.

631
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,047
Hasn't it?

632
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,550
Your assassin didn't arrive here
without help.

633
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,635
But who could you suspect?

634
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,553
I can only suspect.

635
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:02,806
I can't prove...

636
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,434
...and there's suspicion enough
to go around.

637
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,892
It can't be Gurney.

638
01:00:06,976 --> 01:00:10,055
He knew your assassin
would be more valuable alive.

639
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:13,594
Gurney's impulsive, Father.
He doesn't have that kind of cunning.

640
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,594
Or Yueh's intelligence.

641
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,342
Surely not Yueh?

642
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,797
His Suk conditioning
would drive him mad first.

643
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:25,086
Never let sentiment
cloud your judgment, Son.

644
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:29,250
There is someone.

645
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,748
Sooner or later
you must face whoever it is.

646
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:37,163
So this is how it works.

647
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:42,620
They sow the seeds of distrust...

648
01:00:44,286 --> 01:00:47,118
...and get us to fear each other.

649
01:00:48,868 --> 01:00:51,075
Learn this lesson well, Son.

650
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:56,989
If you want to hold Arrakis,
you must be prepared to fight fear with fear.

651
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,780
Fear and power.

652
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:12,316
That's our cue.

653
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:30,478
The man in silver
is a stillsuit manufacturer in Carthag.

654
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,935
An inferior product to the Fremen's.

655
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:37,266
The hard-faced woman next to him
runs an escort service in Arsunt.

656
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:41,140
Impressive client list, I'm told.

657
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:46,928
By the fireplace, Lingar Bewt,
water shipper from the polar region.

658
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,428
The man to his right...

659
01:01:48,553 --> 01:01:51,259
A Spacing Guild representative.
How could I miss him?

660
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:55,424
The man with Thufir is Esmar Tuek,
smuggler, highly successful.

661
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:59,255
He has fast ships if we need them.

662
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,337
Milady, Milord...

663
01:02:02,796 --> 01:02:05,417
...I was honored by the invitation.

664
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,330
You are always welcome here, Dr. Kynes.

665
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:13,822
We found the missing carryall, Milord,
hijacked by Harkonnen agents...

666
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:17,153
...who tried to sell it at a smuggler's camp.

667
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,824
They are now dead.

668
01:02:24,425 --> 01:02:26,097
We are indebted to you, sir.

669
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,034
Milady will see to it
you have everything you need.

670
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,497
It will be my pleasure.

671
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,498
And my honor, Milady.

672
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:41,871
I understand they lost another harvester
to a worm.

673
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:47,248
If they keep this up, they won't even be
able to have enough money to buy water.

674
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,580
Gentlemen and ladies, Her Royal Majesty,
Princess Irulan Corrino.

675
01:03:04,456 --> 01:03:09,163
Your Highness, your attendance
is a most welcome delight.

676
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:14,163
My father sends you his enduring respect
and affection, my Lord Duke.

677
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:21,621
The Emperor wishes everyone to know
of the confidence he has in House Atreides.

678
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:37,496
She brings the Emperor's Sardaukar killers
as her bodyguards.

679
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,957
Water customs here are so fascinating...

680
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,458
...don't you think, Your Highness?

681
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:04,005
When I arrived, my bathing towels
were hurried away almost before I was dry.

682
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:06,549
To save their squeezings, I assume.

683
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:08,884
That's a safe assumption.

684
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,506
Nothing about this place is fascinating.

685
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:18,866
If it weren't for the spice,
no one would bother about it at all.

686
01:04:19,284 --> 01:04:23,984
Fortunately enough,
for a water seller like you, I would guess.

687
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:29,555
I enjoy watching the flight of birds
here on Arrakis.

688
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:32,676
Many exist without any water at all.

689
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,712
Carrion eaters, you know, blood drinkers.

690
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,706
A curious adaptation, don't you think?

691
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,952
You mean they are cannibals?

692
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:46,163
I said they drink blood,
not necessarily the blood of their own kind.

693
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,163
Why not?

694
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,663
One's fiercest competition comes
from one's own kind.

695
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,663
They eat from the same bowl.

696
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,651
It's said that Fremen
drink the blood of their dead.

697
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:08,361
Isn't that so, Dr. Kynes?

698
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,610
Not the blood, sir.

699
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:15,271
All of a man's water.

700
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:18,804
A necessity
when one lives in the deep desert.

701
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:22,879
The human body is 70 percent water.

702
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,454
Surely a dead man no longer requires it.

703
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,032
At least here is honest merrymaking.

704
01:05:49,994 --> 01:05:51,162
Careful, lad.

705
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:54,462
That spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

706
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,512
Play, Gurney.

707
01:05:58,098 --> 01:06:00,645
Let's you and I at least have some peace.

708
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:03,946
When the son of my beloved duke
orders me to relax...

709
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:06,703
...then, by God, I intend to do so.

710
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,669
Is that how you really feel, Gurney-man...

711
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:17,416
...about my father?

712
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:19,955
Beloved?

713
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:24,532
You young pup.

714
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:29,484
If I didn't know better, I would take
those words for an accusation.

715
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,482
It was a simple question.

716
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:41,846
Your father rescued me
from a Harkonnen slave pit, boy.

717
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:47,381
He took me into his household,
groomed me as his war master.

718
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,299
The man or woman...

719
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:55,342
...that raises a hand against him...

720
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:59,347
...will have it cut off by me,
as a prelude to their death.

721
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,397
I'm ashamed of myself doubting you,
Gurney-man.

722
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:12,027
That's enough, lad. No more of this.

723
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:28,251
Gentlemen and ladies,
I use the terms loosely of course.

724
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,543
I, the Baron Harkonnen...

725
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:37,124
...have decided that the great seal
of our venerable house...

726
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,958
...that confused and ugly Chimera,
the griffin...

727
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:47,081
...no longer adequately represents
the ambition of our appetites.

728
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:51,955
Therefore and henceforth, in conclusion
and furthermore, ergo and et cetera...

729
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:56,205
...our ample and royal self...

730
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:59,747
...from this day forth,
and throughout the universe...

731
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:03,871
...we shall no longer be known
as House Harkonnen.

732
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,289
We shall be...

733
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,460
...House Hog.

734
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,726
Now I know why they say
your skill with a knife...

735
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:30,647
...is exceeded only by your mastery
of the baliset, Gurney Halleck.

736
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,789
Is it Atreides custom
to abandon an honored guest...

737
01:08:44,873 --> 01:08:47,628
...without even the courtesy
of a lame excuse?

738
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,093
Forgive me, Your Highness.

739
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:53,641
Careful.

740
01:08:55,521 --> 01:08:58,861
Spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

741
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,950
So I've noticed.

742
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:13,893
You were expecting someone
more delicate, perhaps?

743
01:09:14,352 --> 01:09:17,441
Refined was the word I had in mind,
actually.

744
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,736
There's an ancient saying
I've learned to trust:

745
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:24,859
Never judge a book by its cover.

746
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:29,441
We are not all that different, Paul Atreides,
you and me.

747
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:32,982
You don't know what you're talking about.

748
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:38,313
I've heard all about the moody Paul...

749
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:41,604
...the grim Paul,
the angry and unhappy Paul...

750
01:09:41,687 --> 01:09:44,726
...who has been exiled to Arrakis,
well, poor boy...

751
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:49,351
...one day he will inherit responsibility
for the greatest treasure in the universe.

752
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,062
And a never-ending struggle to defend it.

753
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,024
We both suffer the solitude
of our birthright.

754
01:09:56,108 --> 01:10:00,987
Except that tomorrow you will return
to the comfort of your palaces on Kaitain.

755
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:04,365
To the confinement of its perfect gardens
and lonely apartments.

756
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:06,158
To your servants and entourage.

757
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:08,953
With their slavish flattery
and cautious conversation.

758
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:10,788
As an heir to an Emperor.

759
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,209
Who damns my mother
for bearing daughters instead of sons.

760
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,463
You're mocking me.

761
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,466
No.

762
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,797
I'm trying to interest you.

763
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:36,543
Are you gonna dance with me
or just stand there looking confused?

764
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,998
I didn't want to come here, you know.

765
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,037
Being an ornament
of my father's diplomacy...

766
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:58,621
...is hardly my idea of a good time.

767
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:04,035
But you turned out to be more complicated
than your reputation.

768
01:11:05,286 --> 01:11:07,284
And I like complicated.

769
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:17,281
We've been looking for you, Your Highness.

770
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,572
So now you've found me.

771
01:11:18,698 --> 01:11:21,072
- Have you been hurt?
- Be still, Captain.

772
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:24,321
The Princess has been
under my protection.

773
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,822
Oh, please.

774
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,575
- Gurney, hold.
- Stand down, Captain.

775
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,287
- Gurney.
- I said stand down, Captain!

776
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,333
It's late, Highness. The shuttle awaits.

777
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,126
I am not ready to go.

778
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,504
Your father left strict orders.

779
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,506
You see?

780
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,958
Perhaps we should be the adults here.

781
01:11:49,534 --> 01:11:52,356
Set an example
for our hot-tempered friends.

782
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:57,212
You are more interesting than you appear,
Paul Atreides.

783
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,989
I hope this won't be our last encounter.

784
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,468
My father will no doubt reward you
for such mindless obedience, Captain.

785
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,843
Father?

786
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,913
Duncan?

787
01:13:39,956 --> 01:13:42,082
Forgive the abrupt arrival, Milord.

788
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:47,213
But we've taken
a force of Harkonnen infiltrators.

789
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,508
The Fremen found them
in the cave of the shield mountains.

790
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,593
One of the Fremen, Turok,
was badly wounded.

791
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:57,097
- I rushed him here for treatment...
- But he has died.

792
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,889
This is Stilgar, Milord...

793
01:14:02,141 --> 01:14:04,178
...leader of Turok's tribe.

794
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:09,044
We've heard many things in the desert
about Leto Atreides.

795
01:14:09,877 --> 01:14:12,331
I hope what you've heard
will be the beginning...

796
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:14,411
...of a friendship between us.

797
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:22,398
My people have suffered long
under the rule of such as you.

798
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:28,969
No, not such as me, nor any of my family.

799
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,919
All that changed
when the House Atreides came to Arrakis.

800
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,068
Stilgar, this is my son, Paul Atreides.

801
01:14:50,568 --> 01:14:51,652
Yes.

802
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:54,988
We have heard about him as well.

803
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:58,325
The Fremen want me
to remain with them, Milord.

804
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,164
He fights well.

805
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,292
And he has done his best for our friend.

806
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,295
It will reassure us.

807
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:23,093
Dual allegiance, Milord,
to you and to their tribe.

808
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:28,628
There is a precedent.

809
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:32,833
Liet serves two masters.

810
01:15:34,707 --> 01:15:38,910
Let it be known among your people,
Stilgar, that Duke Leto Atreides...

811
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:42,655
...honors the sacrifice
that your warrior has made on our behalf.

812
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:46,069
I wish nothing but peace between us.

813
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,305
We thank you for the gift
of your body's water, Stilgar...

814
01:16:04,847 --> 01:16:08,263
...and accept it in the spirit
with which it was given.

815
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:16,141
Duncan Idaho...

816
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:19,809
...your water now belongs to us.

817
01:16:19,894 --> 01:16:23,060
The body of our friend, Turok,
remains with your duke.

818
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,019
His water now belongs to the Atreides.

819
01:16:27,105 --> 01:16:29,313
That is the bond between us.

820
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:47,961
Mapes? Mapes!

821
01:17:57,008 --> 01:17:58,882
Mapes, who did this? Who?

822
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,842
Traitor.

823
01:18:02,092 --> 01:18:03,174
Who?

824
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:05,091
Guard dead.

825
01:18:06,841 --> 01:18:08,090
Shields.

826
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,839
The shields.

827
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:18,670
Gurney!

828
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:53,493
Yueh?

829
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,075
God forgive me.

830
01:18:59,243 --> 01:19:00,908
I have no choice.

831
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:02,490
Why?

832
01:19:02,908 --> 01:19:03,907
Why?

833
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:08,490
Because I need to save my wife.

834
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:17,448
We haven't much time.

835
01:19:19,073 --> 01:19:21,614
The Harkonnen will be in the palace soon.

836
01:19:23,782 --> 01:19:26,699
I'm giving you
the final revenge, Milord...

837
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:31,738
...for this terrible thing I've done
to you and your family.

838
01:19:32,824 --> 01:19:35,657
You will have your revenge, Milord,
I promise.

839
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:38,949
Just remember the tooth.

840
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:42,573
The tooth, Milord.

841
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,991
When you have the Baron face to face...

842
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,198
...remember the tooth.

843
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,277
An Emperor's Sardaukar.

844
01:20:33,565 --> 01:20:36,098
The duke! Where is the duke?

845
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:39,628
Not in quarters, sir.
We can't find the young master either.

846
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,369
Bastards!

847
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:36,951
He looks sufficiently paralyzed.

848
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:40,163
My half of the bargain, Baron.

849
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,248
I promised you the duke, there he is.

850
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,168
Well, it's a delicious sight, Doctor.

851
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,211
Now it's time for your half.

852
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:52,258
And believe it or not,
I'm a man of my word.

853
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,968
Where is she?

854
01:22:56,926 --> 01:22:59,008
You promised we'd be reunited.

855
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:02,132
You said you'd free her
if I did what you asked.

856
01:23:02,216 --> 01:23:03,964
Well, I've done it.

857
01:23:04,341 --> 01:23:05,839
So where is she?

858
01:23:05,965 --> 01:23:08,505
Your wife is free, my good doctor.

859
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:10,130
Completely free.

860
01:23:18,085 --> 01:23:20,375
Free of her mortal coil.

861
01:23:23,293 --> 01:23:24,957
Free of her physical cage.

862
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,625
I've freed her.

863
01:23:36,252 --> 01:23:39,752
I promised you'd be reunited,
and I'm a man of my word.

864
01:23:42,462 --> 01:23:43,960
As now you can see.

865
01:23:46,671 --> 01:23:50,254
You think you've defeated me.

866
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,047
Never trust a traitor.

867
01:23:57,174 --> 01:23:59,214
Not even one you create.

868
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:03,798
My noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
I hope so.

869
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:09,092
I kept you alive so you could witness
every precious moment of your betrayal.

870
01:24:14,844 --> 01:24:15,885
What?

871
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:17,177
Paul.

872
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:18,845
Oh, the boy.

873
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,098
I don't know, I'd leave them to the desert,
he and that gorgeous woman of yours.

874
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:27,186
My men left them to explore
the beauty of the sands of Arrakis.

875
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,688
Perhaps they'll see some worms.

876
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,902
We couldn't have all that noble blood
all over our hands, could we?

877
01:24:35,486 --> 01:24:38,321
The Emperor was quite insistent
about that.

878
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:39,739
Yes...

879
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:42,492
...your beloved Emperor.

880
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:46,282
Just goes to show,
never get more popular than the boss.

881
01:24:46,615 --> 01:24:48,904
Unless you intend to sack him.

882
01:24:49,863 --> 01:24:52,152
Did I say that? How impolitic of me.

883
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,398
I must be spending too much time
with that idiot nephew of mine, Rabban.

884
01:24:56,607 --> 01:24:58,979
You won't say anything will you,
my dear man?

885
01:24:59,105 --> 01:25:01,311
Perhaps we should get on with it, then.

886
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:02,894
Get on with it?

887
01:25:02,977 --> 01:25:06,015
This is Kanly, Piter!

888
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,557
Vendetta!

889
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,136
And I am going to savor
every minute of it.

890
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:16,383
My family has hated the Atreides
for generations.

891
01:25:17,218 --> 01:25:22,421
They have been the sand in our eyes,
the stink at our meals...

892
01:25:22,796 --> 01:25:28,375
...these arrogant Atreides,
always standing in our way.

893
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:33,538
I want Leto to appreciate the beauty...

894
01:25:34,288 --> 01:25:35,827
...of what I've done to him.

895
01:25:35,912 --> 01:25:41,199
I want him to know that I,
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen...

896
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:44,778
...am the instrument
of his family's demise...

897
01:25:45,322 --> 01:25:48,693
...the extinction of House Atreides...

898
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:52,483
...and the ascendance of House Harkonnen.

899
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,608
The tooth.

900
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,067
What did he say?

901
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,655
Tooth.

902
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,284
What did he say, Piter?

903
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:10,915
The tooth.

904
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,127
No!

905
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:43,692
Need you more proof
of what heaven's choice is?

906
01:26:44,442 --> 01:26:48,730
Atreides is dead, and Harkonnen lives!

907
01:26:59,183 --> 01:27:00,431
He's dead.

908
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:09,424
Father's dead.

909
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:23,580
- What are you doing?
- We won't survive longer than a few hours in the open.

910
01:27:23,665 --> 01:27:24,913
We have to find shelter.

911
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,953
But Harkonnen patrols.

912
01:27:28,078 --> 01:27:29,243
Worms.

913
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:32,078
We have to take our chances.

914
01:28:06,225 --> 01:28:07,684
One of ours?

915
01:28:08,352 --> 01:28:10,143
We can't take the chance.

916
01:28:11,187 --> 01:28:13,812
Could be Harkonnen
coming to finish the job.

917
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:34,658
Hurry! Harkonnen patrol ships
are in the area, approaching fast.

918
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,624
Strap in.

919
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:17,977
- What is this place?
- A Fremen sietch. A small one.

920
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,433
There's a storm coming.
We can stay here until it passes.

921
01:29:21,517 --> 01:29:23,722
Liet, we must talk.

922
01:29:26,263 --> 01:29:27,637
Rest here.

923
01:29:33,049 --> 01:29:35,004
How did you know where to find us?

924
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,962
Dr. Yueh sent a courier.

925
01:29:37,087 --> 01:29:40,832
Said you were being taken to the bled,
south of the mountain shield.

926
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:42,583
Milord...

927
01:29:44,998 --> 01:29:47,204
...I'm supposed to give you this.

928
01:30:16,314 --> 01:30:18,770
Harkonnen patrols are in the area.

929
01:30:18,895 --> 01:30:21,768
- They tracked our thopter.
- They called you Liet.

930
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:27,307
You're the one, aren't you?

931
01:30:27,973 --> 01:30:31,553
The one who's never seen,
the one who may not even exist at all.

932
01:30:32,763 --> 01:30:33,928
Their leader.

933
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,263
I prefer the term guide to leader.

934
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,847
Guiding them?

935
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,059
Until Mahdi comes.

936
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:43,186
Harkonnen thopters approaching.

937
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,521
Milord.

938
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,525
- You're coming with us?
- No.

939
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,568
- They'll kill you.
- Me?

940
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:52,861
I'm Dr. Kynes.

941
01:30:53,402 --> 01:30:55,693
I work for the Emperor, you remember?

942
01:30:55,903 --> 01:30:58,361
I'll just say I was your hostage.

943
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,568
Milord, please.

944
01:31:08,861 --> 01:31:12,944
I must remain with the Fremen, Milord,
as I promised your father.

945
01:31:58,152 --> 01:31:59,901
Just hold on.

946
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,566
We can't lose them.

947
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:36,465
Paul, the storm. We can't go into that.

948
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,215
We have no choice.

949
01:32:38,341 --> 01:32:40,630
Nothing survives one of those storms.

950
01:32:40,713 --> 01:32:44,209
Unless they want to die,
they won't follow us in, will they?

951
01:32:56,657 --> 01:32:58,529
I must not fear.

952
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,817
Fear is the mind killer.

953
01:33:00,986 --> 01:33:04,334
I will face my fear,
and I will let it pass through me.

954
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:07,304
When the fear is gone
there will be nothing.

955
01:33:09,212 --> 01:33:11,034
Only I will remain.

956
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:17,055
There is a legend that the night
House Atreides lost Arrakis...

957
01:33:18,922 --> 01:33:22,907
...a star exploded in the skies
above their homeland on Caladan.

958
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:30,667
But, the saga of Dune was far
from over.

959
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,210
Arrakis.

960
01:36:48,588 --> 01:36:50,010
Dune.

961
01:36:50,798 --> 01:36:55,210
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

962
01:36:56,137 --> 01:37:01,110
It is here and only here
where it can be found: the Spice.

963
01:37:01,475 --> 01:37:03,810
Greatest treasure
in the universe.

964
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:08,810
And the neverending cause
for conflict, betrayal, ...

965
01:37:09,275 --> 01:37:10,810
and murder.

966
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:29,010
No.

967
01:37:52,151 --> 01:37:53,510
Another bad dream, uncle?

968
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:57,710
No, it's a digestion, that's all.
Miserable food here.

969
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:01,730
I can't wait to be off
this foul planet.

970
01:38:02,787 --> 01:38:04,510
What are you doing here, boy?

971
01:38:04,747 --> 01:38:06,610
They're dead, uncle.

972
01:38:06,957 --> 01:38:09,810
The Bene Gesserit witch
and her son. Both dead.

973
01:38:10,169 --> 01:38:13,710
We discovered a Fremen siege not far from
where our thopter was supposed to crash.

974
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:17,410
They've been rescue by this
Atreides snake Duncan Idaho.

975
01:38:17,718 --> 01:38:20,710
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.

976
01:38:22,014 --> 01:38:23,910
The emperor's man.

977
01:38:24,767 --> 01:38:27,310
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.

978
01:38:27,603 --> 01:38:31,810
The witch and her son were last seen
driving a thopter into a sand storm.

979
01:38:34,402 --> 01:38:38,910
- You've seen the bodies?
- They are most certainly dead.

980
01:38:41,325 --> 01:38:44,010
You've seen the bodies?

981
01:38:46,205 --> 01:38:48,310
Nothing survives one
of those storms, uncle.

982
01:38:48,624 --> 01:38:52,010
The wind was over 800 kilometres an hour.

983
01:38:52,545 --> 01:38:54,810
Nothing survives.

984
01:39:16,277 --> 01:39:18,274
How long have I been asleep?

985
01:39:19,315 --> 01:39:20,480
Not long.

986
01:39:21,978 --> 01:39:24,600
The storm passed a little while ago.

987
01:39:34,587 --> 01:39:36,168
It was Yueh.

988
01:39:40,371 --> 01:39:42,327
He's the one who betrayed us.

989
01:39:48,111 --> 01:39:49,817
They had his wife.

990
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,502
You should put it on, Paul.

991
01:40:11,749 --> 01:40:13,622
You're the duke now.

992
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:20,371
We have to get out of here.

993
01:40:22,414 --> 01:40:25,913
I found some supplies
stowed in the compartment by the hatch,

994
01:40:26,164 --> 01:40:30,079
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.

995
01:40:33,163 --> 01:40:36,245
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.

996
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:38,536
Fremen?

997
01:40:39,037 --> 01:40:40,869
We're going to need them...

998
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:43,618
...to take back Arrakis.

999
01:41:26,866 --> 01:41:28,909
How do we know which way to go?

1000
01:41:29,869 --> 01:41:31,037
South.

1001
01:41:32,705 --> 01:41:34,915
That's into the deep desert.

1002
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:38,252
There were rumors
of sietch communities there.

1003
01:41:39,128 --> 01:41:41,422
That's where we'll find the Fremen...

1004
01:41:42,381 --> 01:41:44,299
...or die trying.

1005
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:15,410
I'm all right.

1006
01:42:20,571 --> 01:42:23,193
It's just the stress. I'm fine.

1007
01:42:53,577 --> 01:42:56,877
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.

1008
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,965
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1009
01:42:59,049 --> 01:43:02,891
Or did you think I would just be
too simple-minded to see the truth?

1010
01:43:04,354 --> 01:43:05,941
Leave us alone.

1011
01:43:09,617 --> 01:43:12,959
What happened on Arrakis
was beyond my control, Daughter.

1012
01:43:13,168 --> 01:43:15,465
An ancient feud between royal houses.

1013
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:20,269
Don't patronize me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?

1014
01:43:20,938 --> 01:43:22,270
Used you?

1015
01:43:22,519 --> 01:43:25,266
Sending me to the duke
as a token of your support...

1016
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:28,222
...making me a courier
of your esteemed respect...

1017
01:43:28,305 --> 01:43:31,635
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.

1018
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,130
Or was that your idea, Fenring?

1019
01:43:36,257 --> 01:43:39,254
That would be something
your perverse mind would suggest.

1020
01:43:39,337 --> 01:43:42,667
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?

1021
01:43:42,751 --> 01:43:46,922
Send me into the desert to die
like that poor boy and his mother?

1022
01:43:47,631 --> 01:43:50,968
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.

1023
01:43:51,927 --> 01:43:54,012
Despite the Baron's efforts...

1024
01:43:54,596 --> 01:43:58,016
...he assures me he did everything he could
to secure them from harm.

1025
01:43:58,141 --> 01:44:00,811
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.

1026
01:44:01,478 --> 01:44:03,689
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.

1027
01:44:03,814 --> 01:44:05,060
Enough!

1028
01:44:14,408 --> 01:44:16,613
There will come a time, Daughter...

1029
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:20,358
...when you will have to shed
this naivet of yours...

1030
01:44:20,483 --> 01:44:24,228
...and learn what it means
to rule an empire.

1031
01:44:29,055 --> 01:44:31,510
And when that time comes, Father...

1032
01:44:32,468 --> 01:44:34,595
...you may learn to regret it.

1033
01:44:54,615 --> 01:44:57,451
It's only another few kilometers,
that's all.

1034
01:44:58,494 --> 01:45:00,788
Hurry, we don't have much time.

1035
01:45:02,289 --> 01:45:04,330
The sun will soon be up full.

1036
01:45:35,781 --> 01:45:37,905
We'll have some shade in here.

1037
01:45:38,488 --> 01:45:43,361
If there are any Harkonnen patrols this far out,
they'll have a tough time spotting us.

1038
01:46:05,936 --> 01:46:07,392
Such a pity.

1039
01:46:07,682 --> 01:46:11,094
A pity that you had to get mixed up
in this business, Doctor.

1040
01:46:11,427 --> 01:46:13,715
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.

1041
01:46:14,298 --> 01:46:17,876
I'm the Emperor's servant,
nothing more and nothing less.

1042
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:21,869
So you did not lead them
to that warren of Fremen scum?

1043
01:46:22,578 --> 01:46:24,504
That was Idaho's idea.

1044
01:46:24,923 --> 01:46:27,226
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.

1045
01:46:27,309 --> 01:46:30,826
We know all about Idaho
and his efforts on the Duke's behalf.

1046
01:46:30,953 --> 01:46:32,878
A foolish, desperate gambit.

1047
01:46:32,963 --> 01:46:36,376
And where was that Fremen trash
when he needed them, eh?

1048
01:46:42,912 --> 01:46:49,240
So, what will you say when the Emperor
questions you about what happened here?

1049
01:46:50,031 --> 01:46:52,237
What's your impression, hmm?

1050
01:46:52,862 --> 01:46:57,025
The desert is
an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.

1051
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:02,979
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...

1052
01:47:03,437 --> 01:47:06,559
...and her spawn have found that out,
haven't they?

1053
01:47:13,429 --> 01:47:18,466
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials
when he's face to face...

1054
01:47:18,967 --> 01:47:21,107
...with death's sweet smile.

1055
01:47:24,533 --> 01:47:26,052
Muad'dib.

1056
01:47:31,104 --> 01:47:34,912
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

1057
01:47:36,693 --> 01:47:41,125
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.

1058
01:47:42,866 --> 01:47:46,870
But here, on Arrakis,
you need desert power.

1059
01:47:48,247 --> 01:47:50,998
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters...

1060
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:54,503
...tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

1061
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,819
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.

1062
01:48:23,944 --> 01:48:25,359
Did you get any rest?

1063
01:48:25,444 --> 01:48:26,610
Some.

1064
01:48:28,026 --> 01:48:30,399
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

1065
01:48:31,565 --> 01:48:34,438
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.

1066
01:48:35,854 --> 01:48:37,227
How is my sister?

1067
01:48:47,264 --> 01:48:49,136
I'm having dreams again.

1068
01:48:50,093 --> 01:48:51,258
Visions.

1069
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:53,380
Even when I'm awake.

1070
01:48:53,714 --> 01:48:56,418
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.

1071
01:48:58,457 --> 01:49:00,663
Even your father didn't know.

1072
01:49:00,996 --> 01:49:02,244
Why not?

1073
01:49:05,866 --> 01:49:07,614
There wasn't time.

1074
01:49:11,155 --> 01:49:13,154
What have you done to me?

1075
01:49:15,654 --> 01:49:17,862
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.

1076
01:49:18,403 --> 01:49:20,776
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?

1077
01:49:28,275 --> 01:49:30,399
This place is changing me.

1078
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,398
It's the spice.

1079
01:49:34,773 --> 01:49:37,938
It's in the air we breathe,
in the food we eat.

1080
01:49:38,647 --> 01:49:40,396
I can't escape it.

1081
01:50:09,805 --> 01:50:11,305
Drink it all.

1082
01:50:12,013 --> 01:50:14,973
The best place to conserve water
is in your body.

1083
01:50:15,683 --> 01:50:17,975
The stillsuit will do the rest.

1084
01:50:21,394 --> 01:50:25,146
If we stay on this dune
we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.

1085
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:27,313
Is that a good idea?

1086
01:50:28,147 --> 01:50:30,272
It's the most direct path.

1087
01:51:25,009 --> 01:51:26,468
You all right?

1088
01:51:29,845 --> 01:51:30,928
Yes.

1089
01:51:34,973 --> 01:51:36,359
Hold on.

1090
01:52:00,999 --> 01:52:02,869
That shouldn't have happened.

1091
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:05,526
I was careless about these dunes.

1092
01:52:09,717 --> 01:52:11,550
We lost our paracompass.

1093
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,664
Can you hear that?

1094
01:52:23,563 --> 01:52:24,629
It's a worm!

1095
01:52:24,782 --> 01:52:27,372
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!

1096
01:52:37,087 --> 01:52:39,714
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!

1097
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:26,765
A thumper?

1098
01:53:26,918 --> 01:53:28,920
Someone called it away.

1099
01:53:31,214 --> 01:53:34,217
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.

1100
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:35,385
The spice.

1101
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:37,595
Everywhere...

1102
01:53:39,931 --> 01:53:41,850
...when the worm came.

1103
01:54:12,088 --> 01:54:15,592
There had to have been people
for this many plants to survive.

1104
01:54:16,217 --> 01:54:17,467
Fremen.

1105
01:54:18,966 --> 01:54:20,673
We have to find them.

1106
01:54:20,924 --> 01:54:24,049
Most intruders here
regret finding the Fremen.

1107
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:40,543
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.

1108
01:54:49,584 --> 01:54:50,998
I know you.

1109
01:54:52,662 --> 01:54:54,409
You're Stilgar...

1110
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:59,401
...the Fremen who came to see my father
with Duncan Idaho.

1111
01:55:01,772 --> 01:55:04,476
That was a sloppy crossing you made
from the crash.

1112
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,724
You called a worm.

1113
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,596
You were watching us?

1114
01:55:08,429 --> 01:55:10,966
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.

1115
01:55:11,174 --> 01:55:14,420
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.

1116
01:55:14,794 --> 01:55:18,080
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?

1117
01:55:18,164 --> 01:55:21,659
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.

1118
01:55:22,492 --> 01:55:25,160
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.

1119
01:55:25,703 --> 01:55:27,996
My people are cautious and pragmatic.

1120
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:31,291
Good qualities in the desert.

1121
01:55:31,375 --> 01:55:35,044
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity
than invite disaster.

1122
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:39,924
Your only value at the moment
is the water in your flesh.

1123
01:55:40,009 --> 01:55:41,719
You know the law, Stil.

1124
01:55:41,802 --> 01:55:43,345
Yes.

1125
01:55:46,098 --> 01:55:47,099
The law.

1126
01:55:57,276 --> 01:56:00,279
Tell them to stop hunting my son.

1127
01:56:01,322 --> 01:56:02,781
Tell them.

1128
01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:08,455
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!

1129
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:10,707
Do you hear me?

1130
01:56:12,542 --> 01:56:15,086
Is this the way
you welcome friends of Liet?

1131
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:16,338
Is it?

1132
01:56:24,387 --> 01:56:26,181
As leader of this tribe...

1133
01:56:26,932 --> 01:56:31,102
...I'm offering the Weirding woman
and her son sanctuary.

1134
01:56:31,728 --> 01:56:36,601
No Fremen anywhere will lay a hand on you
while you have my protection.

1135
01:56:37,725 --> 01:56:38,891
For how long?

1136
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,849
Don't be a fool, woman.

1137
01:56:41,474 --> 01:56:43,681
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.

1138
01:56:43,932 --> 01:56:46,305
Don't be fugitives from us as well.

1139
01:57:00,759 --> 01:57:02,008
Merciful God!

1140
01:57:02,884 --> 01:57:05,089
I've heard of the Weirding ways.

1141
01:57:07,128 --> 01:57:09,209
Imagine what a man could do with it.

1142
01:57:09,293 --> 01:57:11,956
No doubt we have much
to teach each other.

1143
01:57:14,953 --> 01:57:18,865
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.

1144
01:57:19,281 --> 01:57:20,987
He won't move unless I say so.

1145
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:22,818
Discipline. Good.

1146
01:57:30,311 --> 01:57:31,684
He's here!

1147
01:57:42,006 --> 01:57:43,589
He is unharmed.

1148
01:57:44,963 --> 01:57:46,753
We are coming down.

1149
01:57:59,461 --> 01:58:01,043
Leave me alone.

1150
01:58:03,043 --> 01:58:05,001
Made a lot of noise climbing.

1151
01:58:05,418 --> 01:58:07,292
He has much to learn.

1152
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:15,623
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?

1153
01:58:17,208 --> 01:58:19,335
He surprised me, that's all.

1154
01:58:20,003 --> 01:58:22,547
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.

1155
01:58:24,257 --> 01:58:27,260
We have now two with us
who are not trained.

1156
01:58:28,136 --> 01:58:30,430
In squad lines with flankers.

1157
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:34,017
We have to make Cave of Ridges
before full sun.

1158
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,895
Chani, you will be responsible for him.

1159
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,688
My name is Paul.

1160
01:58:39,147 --> 01:58:41,271
Only until we give you a new one.

1161
01:58:48,393 --> 01:58:50,933
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.

1162
01:59:36,794 --> 01:59:38,501
Across there is home...

1163
01:59:39,336 --> 01:59:40,585
...Sietch Tabr.

1164
01:59:41,169 --> 01:59:42,626
We'll be there tomorrow.

1165
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,043
Tomorrow?

1166
01:59:44,293 --> 01:59:46,751
That must be hundreds of kilometers
from here.

1167
01:59:46,834 --> 01:59:48,709
It will be a hard ride.

1168
01:59:49,876 --> 01:59:51,417
Sun will be up soon.

1169
01:59:51,584 --> 01:59:55,167
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.

1170
02:00:21,499 --> 02:00:25,559
When you give us your stillsuits,
we will recover your water for you.

1171
02:00:33,177 --> 02:00:35,074
Here is some food.

1172
02:00:40,993 --> 02:00:42,257
Spice.

1173
02:00:43,026 --> 02:00:46,821
We don't have delicacies from the cities
like you are used to.

1174
02:00:47,589 --> 02:00:49,035
It's fine.

1175
02:01:41,537 --> 02:01:45,207
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?

1176
02:01:47,001 --> 02:01:49,795
I can tell by the way you stare at her.

1177
02:01:51,755 --> 02:01:53,882
I don't know what it means.

1178
02:01:55,093 --> 02:01:56,807
Be careful, Paul.

1179
02:01:58,355 --> 02:02:01,450
We are new to these people
as they are to us.

1180
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:04,629
Everything we say and do must be careful.

1181
02:02:05,298 --> 02:02:08,727
Predicting the future,
then plotting to make it so.

1182
02:02:10,233 --> 02:02:12,607
These are superstitious people.

1183
02:02:15,272 --> 02:02:20,311
If we are to survive, it will be best
to accommodate their legends.

1184
02:02:40,926 --> 02:02:46,131
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.

1185
02:02:47,796 --> 02:02:49,545
A desert creature.

1186
02:02:59,333 --> 02:03:01,623
Not finished yet!

1187
02:03:05,246 --> 02:03:07,537
Still have work to do!

1188
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:16,912
The pre-spice mass.

1189
02:03:19,828 --> 02:03:23,411
I am a desert crea...

1190
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,409
Spice blow.

1191
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:19,034
Somewhere to the east.

1192
02:04:25,785 --> 02:04:28,073
A large field from the looks of it.

1193
02:04:33,194 --> 02:04:37,023
We have to send gatherers
before Harkonnen pirates come for it.

1194
02:04:38,023 --> 02:04:39,937
You harvest the spice?

1195
02:04:41,145 --> 02:04:43,185
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.

1196
02:04:44,725 --> 02:04:46,473
It's Liet's wish.

1197
02:04:47,098 --> 02:04:50,386
We pay them to keep our skies free
of their satellites...

1198
02:04:50,927 --> 02:04:53,841
...so that no one can know
what we are doing here.

1199
02:04:55,465 --> 02:04:57,046
You will learn.

1200
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:04,289
Amtal!

1201
02:05:05,663 --> 02:05:07,120
I invoke amtal.

1202
02:05:07,203 --> 02:05:08,368
Jamis.

1203
02:05:08,869 --> 02:05:10,039
What is this?

1204
02:05:10,165 --> 02:05:12,840
His way of dealing with what happened
the other night.

1205
02:05:12,923 --> 02:05:14,721
That was an accident.

1206
02:05:14,805 --> 02:05:18,484
He bested me because there was
witch-force at Tuono basin.

1207
02:05:18,568 --> 02:05:20,449
Amtal! It's my right!

1208
02:05:20,658 --> 02:05:23,960
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.

1209
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:28,588
You're starting something here
you're going to regret.

1210
02:05:28,712 --> 02:05:30,373
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.

1211
02:05:30,457 --> 02:05:33,615
If you know what's good for you,
you will find an honorable way...

1212
02:05:33,698 --> 02:05:35,277
...to leave this thing alone.

1213
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,357
Silence!

1214
02:05:37,023 --> 02:05:39,899
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.

1215
02:05:39,981 --> 02:05:43,565
If you try that again,
we know it's your witchcraft.

1216
02:05:44,483 --> 02:05:47,816
I won't be able to protect you
or the boy anymore.

1217
02:05:49,401 --> 02:05:51,860
Come. You can't stop this.

1218
02:06:32,915 --> 02:06:35,915
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.

1219
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,457
Use it well.

1220
02:06:51,242 --> 02:06:53,366
May your blade chip and shatter.

1221
02:07:10,981 --> 02:07:13,812
I'm going to bathe this knife
with your blood.

1222
02:07:20,851 --> 02:07:23,224
First, you'll have to find my blood.

1223
02:07:56,248 --> 02:07:58,039
- Do you yield?
- Yield?

1224
02:07:58,664 --> 02:08:01,749
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!

1225
02:08:07,711 --> 02:08:10,253
- He's never had to kill.
- What?

1226
02:08:13,547 --> 02:08:15,506
Then he'd better learn.

1227
02:08:32,433 --> 02:08:35,392
Finish. Don't toy with him.

1228
02:09:09,079 --> 02:09:10,830
He's bested Jamis.

1229
02:09:31,008 --> 02:09:33,134
This didn't have to happen.

1230
02:09:36,095 --> 02:09:37,634
It is our way.

1231
02:09:37,759 --> 02:09:40,754
Your way?! Killing each other.

1232
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:52,072
No man recognizes leadership
without the challenge of combat.

1233
02:10:03,391 --> 02:10:05,514
There is a legend among us...

1234
02:10:08,343 --> 02:10:11,089
...that a voice from the out-world
will come.

1235
02:10:11,922 --> 02:10:13,090
The Mahdi.

1236
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,220
He will hold the key to our future.

1237
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:23,683
It is said that a Bene Gesserit
will be his mother.

1238
02:10:24,476 --> 02:10:25,811
A Sayyadina.

1239
02:10:26,561 --> 02:10:28,355
Friend of God.

1240
02:10:31,608 --> 02:10:34,069
There are rumors about you and your son.

1241
02:10:34,403 --> 02:10:36,780
From the city. Liet.

1242
02:10:38,949 --> 02:10:41,701
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?

1243
02:10:42,578 --> 02:10:43,577
I hope...

1244
02:10:44,035 --> 02:10:45,617
...and I fear.

1245
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:53,820
If it's true, your boy will have to
call me out one day...

1246
02:10:54,778 --> 02:10:57,775
...to challenge me
for the leadership of the tribe.

1247
02:10:58,733 --> 02:11:01,272
The huanui is prepared. It's time.

1248
02:11:07,061 --> 02:11:08,560
It's our way.

1249
02:11:17,641 --> 02:11:20,264
From water does all life begin.

1250
02:11:24,305 --> 02:11:26,429
The flesh belongs to the person...

1251
02:11:27,429 --> 02:11:30,136
...but his water belongs to the tribe.

1252
02:11:35,386 --> 02:11:37,426
I was a friend of Jamis.

1253
02:11:39,301 --> 02:11:41,595
When the hawk plane fell upon us...

1254
02:11:43,222 --> 02:11:44,932
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...

1255
02:11:45,391 --> 02:11:48,978
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.

1256
02:11:51,397 --> 02:11:53,107
I was a friend of Jamis.

1257
02:11:55,442 --> 02:11:57,152
I was a friend of Jamis.

1258
02:12:32,146 --> 02:12:34,189
I was a friend of Jamis.

1259
02:12:35,107 --> 02:12:37,064
He taught me...

1260
02:12:38,814 --> 02:12:40,730
...that when you kill...

1261
02:12:42,604 --> 02:12:44,062
...you pay for it.

1262
02:12:45,062 --> 02:12:46,060
Bila-Kayfa!

1263
02:12:58,892 --> 02:13:00,475
He sheds tears.

1264
02:13:01,143 --> 02:13:03,267
He gives water to the dead.

1265
02:13:09,308 --> 02:13:11,972
Jamis carried 33 liters of the tribe's water.

1266
02:13:12,305 --> 02:13:14,177
Counted and measured.

1267
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:33,785
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.

1268
02:13:34,118 --> 02:13:36,489
Because you fight without stillsuit...

1269
02:13:36,947 --> 02:13:39,651
...you may regain the water
you lost fighting.

1270
02:13:49,473 --> 02:13:53,518
May you guard it for the tribe,
preserve it against loss...

1271
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:56,687
...be generous with it in time of need.

1272
02:13:57,021 --> 02:14:00,607
May you pass it on in your time
for the good of the tribe.

1273
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:07,865
Needs a naming now, Stil.

1274
02:14:12,287 --> 02:14:13,662
It's time.

1275
02:14:14,998 --> 02:14:18,246
What would you have us call you,
young Atreides?

1276
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:21,203
By what name do you wish Fremen
to know you?

1277
02:14:23,327 --> 02:14:25,868
What is the name of that little mouse?

1278
02:14:28,409 --> 02:14:31,324
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.

1279
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:37,156
Muad'dib.

1280
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:40,320
Is that the name you wish?

1281
02:14:42,778 --> 02:14:43,777
Yes.

1282
02:14:44,903 --> 02:14:45,988
Muad'dib.

1283
02:14:48,699 --> 02:14:50,909
Wise in the ways of the desert.

1284
02:14:52,578 --> 02:14:55,372
Hiding from the sun. Traveling at night.

1285
02:14:56,373 --> 02:14:57,873
We call him the "Teacher of Boys".

1286
02:15:00,669 --> 02:15:02,004
Muad'dib.

1287
02:15:02,546 --> 02:15:05,215
Yeah, a fine choice.

1288
02:15:07,384 --> 02:15:11,883
So, from now on
you will be addressed as Muad'dib.

1289
02:15:19,965 --> 02:15:23,547
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.

1290
02:15:23,631 --> 02:15:25,630
Your lives will depend on it.

1291
02:15:34,379 --> 02:15:35,545
There.

1292
02:15:55,668 --> 02:15:57,042
Get ready.

1293
02:18:05,857 --> 02:18:07,231
What is that?

1294
02:18:07,773 --> 02:18:11,107
The one who will come. Mahdi.

1295
02:18:41,947 --> 02:18:45,281
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent
to the spice blow.

1296
02:18:52,241 --> 02:18:54,617
Give her some time, Muad'dib.

1297
02:18:55,491 --> 02:18:56,991
Liet is dead.

1298
02:18:57,868 --> 02:19:01,702
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?

1299
02:19:01,785 --> 02:19:03,619
Harkonnen treachery.

1300
02:19:04,744 --> 02:19:06,827
She loved her father very much.

1301
02:19:22,287 --> 02:19:24,578
It needs a new dew collector.

1302
02:19:30,787 --> 02:19:34,204
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

1303
02:19:38,788 --> 02:19:40,413
We had rivers of it.

1304
02:19:43,164 --> 02:19:45,538
Great flowing veins of water.

1305
02:19:48,373 --> 02:19:50,745
From the snows of mountains...

1306
02:19:51,327 --> 02:19:54,738
...into lakes so wide
you couldn't see the other side.

1307
02:19:56,861 --> 02:19:58,524
Oceans of water.

1308
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:08,551
Our home was on the coast.

1309
02:20:11,505 --> 02:20:14,916
Great waves would hurl themselves
against the cliffs.

1310
02:20:18,163 --> 02:20:20,284
They used to put me to sleep.

1311
02:20:22,365 --> 02:20:24,742
My father had a dream, Muad'dib.

1312
02:20:26,911 --> 02:20:28,872
A dream that one day...

1313
02:20:30,039 --> 02:20:32,250
...we could change this place...

1314
02:20:34,085 --> 02:20:36,463
...make it more like your homeland.

1315
02:20:54,647 --> 02:20:55,982
Windtrap.

1316
02:20:56,733 --> 02:20:59,194
Plenty of moisture this morning.

1317
02:21:01,196 --> 02:21:03,198
My father is at peace.

1318
02:21:16,544 --> 02:21:17,545
Muad'dib.

1319
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:36,815
We have thousands of these caches.

1320
02:21:38,066 --> 02:21:40,110
Only a few of us know them all.

1321
02:21:41,319 --> 02:21:42,856
I know this place.

1322
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:46,015
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.

1323
02:21:48,010 --> 02:21:49,256
In my dreams.

1324
02:21:51,169 --> 02:21:55,076
This is the water we will use
to change the face of Arrakis.

1325
02:21:57,861 --> 02:21:59,856
As my father taught us...

1326
02:22:01,727 --> 02:22:04,262
...the voice from the out-world will come.

1327
02:22:05,302 --> 02:22:06,678
The Mahdi.

1328
02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:12,934
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.

1329
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:17,981
And no man shall ever want
for water again.

1330
02:24:21,771 --> 02:24:23,770
Just as you said, Stil.

1331
02:24:24,978 --> 02:24:28,894
Harkonnen greed for spice
is the most reliable beacon in the universe.

1332
02:24:29,228 --> 02:24:33,310
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.

1333
02:24:40,725 --> 02:24:42,308
Anyone else hear that?

1334
02:24:57,348 --> 02:24:59,970
We didn't even have to damage
the thopter.

1335
02:25:01,261 --> 02:25:03,884
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.

1336
02:25:45,563 --> 02:25:47,134
That was our last communication.

1337
02:25:47,220 --> 02:25:50,066
There is no mayday, no evidence of wreckage
when we went to investigate.

1338
02:25:50,151 --> 02:25:51,857
That's the third thopter this month!

1339
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:53,687
The patch turned out to be mock spice.

1340
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:56,889
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!

1341
02:26:00,925 --> 02:26:03,795
We caught these last night,
a village near the rimwall...

1342
02:26:03,878 --> 02:26:05,667
...known to be desert sympathizers.

1343
02:26:05,792 --> 02:26:07,621
Mercy, Governor.

1344
02:26:08,743 --> 02:26:10,156
We are refugees.

1345
02:26:10,532 --> 02:26:12,819
- We need food.
- Liar!

1346
02:26:14,357 --> 02:26:16,352
Spies! That's what you are!

1347
02:26:16,727 --> 02:26:18,598
Spies for the Fremen scum!

1348
02:26:19,514 --> 02:26:22,517
Fremen scum
who raid my spice warehouses!

1349
02:26:22,975 --> 02:26:28,189
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.

1350
02:26:32,568 --> 02:26:35,613
He was trying to dispose of this
when we caught him.

1351
02:26:48,501 --> 02:26:51,129
Send words to the filth of the desert!

1352
02:26:52,046 --> 02:26:54,257
Tell them what you witness here!

1353
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:00,513
Tell them this is what awaits them!

1354
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:03,346
Mahdi!

1355
02:27:24,781 --> 02:27:28,443
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.

1356
02:27:34,396 --> 02:27:37,308
The latest love letter from your brother.

1357
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:40,098
Mahdil

1358
02:27:40,264 --> 02:27:41,929
Appears to be enjoying himself.

1359
02:27:42,013 --> 02:27:45,511
The moron's appetite for killing
never ceases to amaze me.

1360
02:27:47,135 --> 02:27:50,966
By the time he's finished,
there won't be a population left to rule.

1361
02:27:51,925 --> 02:27:54,048
Cheer up, lovely boy.

1362
02:27:54,131 --> 02:27:59,337
I merely allow him to brutalize them,
to savage them, until you arrive...

1363
02:28:00,212 --> 02:28:04,751
...the handsome Feyd,
to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.

1364
02:28:05,709 --> 02:28:08,916
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.

1365
02:28:09,832 --> 02:28:11,167
Feyd, the savior.

1366
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:13,628
There will be cheering in the streets.

1367
02:28:13,753 --> 02:28:17,840
You can even give them
your brother's head as a gift, if you like.

1368
02:28:18,132 --> 02:28:23,012
And then you will squeeze,
like the grips of a vice...

1369
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:28,434
...so our treasuries become fat
with the profit of spice.

1370
02:28:54,544 --> 02:28:57,005
No man recognizes leadership...

1371
02:28:57,588 --> 02:29:00,049
...without the challenge of combat.

1372
02:29:00,633 --> 02:29:01,798
It is the way.

1373
02:29:01,881 --> 02:29:03,130
Call him out!

1374
02:29:08,376 --> 02:29:10,082
What do you see...

1375
02:29:10,873 --> 02:29:12,247
...Muad'dib...

1376
02:29:15,453 --> 02:29:17,451
...when you go away like that?

1377
02:29:18,825 --> 02:29:20,614
Where is it you go?

1378
02:29:22,905 --> 02:29:24,573
Many places, Stil.

1379
02:29:27,285 --> 02:29:28,953
Many roads.

1380
02:29:33,541 --> 02:29:35,042
Many choices.

1381
02:29:37,545 --> 02:29:39,547
These choices...

1382
02:29:40,881 --> 02:29:42,925
...are good or bad?

1383
02:29:45,386 --> 02:29:47,424
It's hard to know sometimes.

1384
02:29:47,589 --> 02:29:51,415
Either they are good choices
or bad choices.

1385
02:29:52,164 --> 02:29:54,451
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?

1386
02:29:55,740 --> 02:29:57,113
Of storms?

1387
02:29:57,861 --> 02:29:59,400
Of the future.

1388
02:29:59,692 --> 02:30:02,602
The future, Muad'dib, just is.

1389
02:30:13,915 --> 02:30:16,957
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!

1390
02:30:36,503 --> 02:30:40,503
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!

1391
02:30:42,963 --> 02:30:45,088
Need immediate evacuation!

1392
02:31:03,843 --> 02:31:05,551
We are ready, Muad'dib.

1393
02:31:08,135 --> 02:31:11,543
Muad'dib, it's time. We must hurry.

1394
02:31:19,188 --> 02:31:20,981
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.

1395
02:31:21,065 --> 02:31:23,025
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.

1396
02:31:23,109 --> 02:31:27,113
He made it clear on his arrival
that we should summon you and no other.

1397
02:31:45,172 --> 02:31:47,466
The other witches must leave.

1398
02:31:47,716 --> 02:31:49,176
As you wish.

1399
02:31:58,185 --> 02:32:02,516
This visit is as indiscreet
as it is unexpected.

1400
02:32:03,557 --> 02:32:06,847
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity
isn't aroused.

1401
02:32:07,305 --> 02:32:10,595
The Emperor's suspicions
are easily moderated...

1402
02:32:11,636 --> 02:32:14,634
...by his dependence on our services.

1403
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:17,633
As you are so fond of reminding us.

1404
02:32:26,088 --> 02:32:28,637
The navigators are concerned.

1405
02:32:30,184 --> 02:32:34,029
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.

1406
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:37,499
There is a problem on the horizon.

1407
02:32:39,214 --> 02:32:41,095
What kind of problem?

1408
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:48,262
They are troubled by a nexus
they can't fully explore...

1409
02:32:48,761 --> 02:32:51,045
...an intersection of events...

1410
02:32:51,378 --> 02:32:57,319
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions
beyond which lies a path...

1411
02:32:57,776 --> 02:32:59,313
...they cannot see.

1412
02:33:00,892 --> 02:33:03,010
And where is this nexus?

1413
02:33:05,962 --> 02:33:08,256
Planet Arrakis.

1414
02:33:11,008 --> 02:33:13,970
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.

1415
02:33:14,887 --> 02:33:16,681
The Atreides are dead.

1416
02:33:16,806 --> 02:33:20,309
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.

1417
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:24,647
We sense a higher order interfering.

1418
02:33:28,234 --> 02:33:30,611
A misstep could be catastrophic.

1419
02:33:31,112 --> 02:33:33,482
Then we understand one another.

1420
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,644
Completely.

1421
02:33:38,015 --> 02:33:39,594
We'll do what we can.

1422
02:33:45,584 --> 02:33:46,840
I thought...

1423
02:33:47,802 --> 02:33:49,434
...I felt something.

1424
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:55,881
The spice must flow.

1425
02:33:57,388 --> 02:34:00,820
The balance of power must be maintained.

1426
02:34:38,679 --> 02:34:40,010
Sayyadina?

1427
02:34:43,851 --> 02:34:45,720
I'm awake, Chani.

1428
02:34:53,944 --> 02:34:57,520
Has there been any
word, a courier perhaps?

1429
02:34:57,865 --> 02:35:00,520
No. The raids are
in the Haga basin.

1430
02:35:00,868 --> 02:35:05,020
They won't risk communication until
they are deep across the bled.

1431
02:35:21,889 --> 02:35:25,120
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?

1432
02:35:25,893 --> 02:35:27,820
No.

1433
02:35:28,521 --> 02:35:30,620
It's just your skin.

1434
02:35:30,981 --> 02:35:31,920
My skin?

1435
02:35:32,274 --> 02:35:35,620
We've heard the stories
about off-worlders,

1436
02:35:36,274 --> 02:35:38,310
the ones who come
from water planets.

1437
02:35:38,906 --> 02:35:42,820
Skin so moist it's like cream.

1438
02:35:43,452 --> 02:35:46,238
- Muad'dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?

1439
02:35:46,956 --> 02:35:49,220
Muad'dib is still a boy.

1440
02:35:50,501 --> 02:35:53,416
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.

1441
02:35:54,130 --> 02:35:55,195
Yes.

1442
02:35:56,674 --> 02:35:59,520
I say my prayers for his safe return.

1443
02:35:59,885 --> 02:36:01,920
We both do, Chani.

1444
02:36:31,417 --> 02:36:35,995
The smugglers transport our spice tribute
to the cursed Spacing Guild.

1445
02:36:38,118 --> 02:36:40,156
The Emperor never knows.

1446
02:36:40,865 --> 02:36:45,110
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.

1447
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:50,478
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'dib.

1448
02:36:51,812 --> 02:36:55,941
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.

1449
02:37:13,542 --> 02:37:15,669
Something wrong, Muad'dib?

1450
02:37:18,172 --> 02:37:20,257
I thought I saw someone I knew.

1451
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:23,093
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.

1452
02:37:23,177 --> 02:37:24,761
No, Stil.

1453
02:37:25,846 --> 02:37:27,470
Let them go.

1454
02:37:29,928 --> 02:37:31,719
I must have been mistaken.

1455
02:37:40,384 --> 02:37:41,633
Gurney.

1456
02:37:43,925 --> 02:37:46,466
My father's patience is wearing thin.

1457
02:37:47,632 --> 02:37:51,381
These troubles on Arrakis
are proving difficult to manage...

1458
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:54,131
...and our time is running short.

1459
02:37:54,756 --> 02:37:58,047
I want you to make arrangements
for a trip to Giedi Prime.

1460
02:37:58,131 --> 02:37:59,380
Milady?

1461
02:38:00,047 --> 02:38:03,175
The Baron's nephew
is having a birthday celebration.

1462
02:38:04,009 --> 02:38:07,303
The Emperor ought to be represented,
don't you think?

1463
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:10,389
I'm in the mood for a party.

1464
02:38:18,023 --> 02:38:21,275
Besides, it's time to shed
some of this naivet.

1465
02:38:21,944 --> 02:38:24,075
She is not going!

1466
02:38:24,405 --> 02:38:30,275
I'm not going to allow that headstrong,
meddlesome child loose in Babylon.

1467
02:38:30,661 --> 02:38:34,831
My God, what a catastrophe
that would be.

1468
02:38:35,165 --> 02:38:40,580
The eldest daughter of the Imperial
House ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen

1469
02:38:40,921 --> 02:38:43,595
and his dreadful progeny.

1470
02:38:43,966 --> 02:38:46,245
Yes, catastrophe indeed.

1471
02:38:46,552 --> 02:38:50,975
But perhaps the seducer
could be seduced.

1472
02:38:51,932 --> 02:38:58,092
The more we know of the Baron's schemes,
the more we are prepared for the endgame.

1473
02:38:59,398 --> 02:39:01,775
Our operatives on Giedi
Prime have limited access.

1474
02:39:02,109 --> 02:39:04,975
Your daughter, on the other hand...

1475
02:39:05,279 --> 02:39:08,875
has proved quite adept at
intelligence gathering.

1476
02:39:09,283 --> 02:39:14,767
Gently chaperoned, I should think
she'd prove quite useful...

1477
02:39:15,247 --> 02:39:17,175
once again.

1478
02:39:24,048 --> 02:39:26,346
You've heard the voices
from your sietches.

1479
02:39:26,472 --> 02:39:28,686
They say the Mahdi has come.

1480
02:39:30,985 --> 02:39:32,322
But you...

1481
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:36,628
...the naibs of your tribes
are still cautious. You resist.

1482
02:39:39,262 --> 02:39:41,727
But I am offering you the future.

1483
02:39:43,484 --> 02:39:45,603
The future as Liet saw it.

1484
02:39:45,978 --> 02:39:49,262
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.

1485
02:39:51,465 --> 02:39:52,629
Here.

1486
02:39:54,791 --> 02:39:56,121
And here.

1487
02:39:56,662 --> 02:39:59,488
And once we rid Arrakis
of the vile Harkonnen...

1488
02:40:00,153 --> 02:40:02,272
...we can complete his dream.

1489
02:40:03,064 --> 02:40:04,643
I promise this.

1490
02:40:05,517 --> 02:40:08,801
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.

1491
02:40:08,884 --> 02:40:12,229
You'll never rid Arrakis
with guerrilla raids, boy.

1492
02:40:12,563 --> 02:40:14,194
It will take all-out war.

1493
02:40:14,277 --> 02:40:17,873
That's why I'm asking you
for hundreds of your best young men.

1494
02:40:19,504 --> 02:40:22,054
I want to give them the Weirding way...

1495
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:25,065
...so they can come back to you
and train hundreds more.

1496
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:27,273
So those hundreds
can train hundreds more.

1497
02:40:27,355 --> 02:40:29,727
And then hundreds will become thousands!

1498
02:40:31,435 --> 02:40:32,684
The Fedaykin.

1499
02:40:33,268 --> 02:40:36,014
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.

1500
02:40:36,557 --> 02:40:39,345
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!

1501
02:40:47,673 --> 02:40:49,881
My father once told me...

1502
02:40:52,048 --> 02:40:53,840
...that here on Arrakis...

1503
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:57,008
...one needed desert power to rule.

1504
02:41:02,844 --> 02:41:05,678
You are desert power...

1505
02:41:07,303 --> 02:41:09,387
...and nothing can stop you...

1506
02:41:12,221 --> 02:41:13,804
...if you believe.

1507
02:41:48,066 --> 02:41:49,851
So you are the one.

1508
02:41:51,554 --> 02:41:55,622
Jessica of the Weirding,
our Reverend Mother Ramallo.

1509
02:41:57,491 --> 02:42:00,023
Mapes said you were beautiful.

1510
02:42:01,186 --> 02:42:04,258
She also said she pitied you.

1511
02:42:04,715 --> 02:42:06,376
I need no one's pity.

1512
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:08,501
That remains to be seen.

1513
02:42:22,456 --> 02:42:25,497
There is much talk of you in the sietches.

1514
02:42:26,498 --> 02:42:29,622
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.

1515
02:42:29,789 --> 02:42:33,204
I hear them shout the name Muad'dib.

1516
02:42:34,412 --> 02:42:37,827
He is a natural leader like his father.

1517
02:42:39,495 --> 02:42:41,494
The men admire his courage.

1518
02:42:41,703 --> 02:42:45,374
It will take more than courage
to survive what's coming.

1519
02:42:48,710 --> 02:42:50,170
The boy...

1520
02:42:50,587 --> 02:42:53,924
...he knows what it is
that's happening here?

1521
02:42:54,967 --> 02:42:57,344
He is aware.

1522
02:42:58,136 --> 02:43:01,014
You've exploited our legends well.

1523
02:43:04,935 --> 02:43:06,687
We had to survive.

1524
02:43:07,896 --> 02:43:09,772
And you may...

1525
02:43:11,814 --> 02:43:13,356
...for a while.

1526
02:43:13,773 --> 02:43:17,816
But remember this:
the very legend which protects you...

1527
02:43:18,651 --> 02:43:20,943
...can also destroy you.

1528
02:44:13,802 --> 02:44:16,344
- How are you feeling?
- Well.

1529
02:44:16,804 --> 02:44:18,179
Tired sometimes.

1530
02:44:26,767 --> 02:44:28,014
Healthy.

1531
02:44:28,221 --> 02:44:29,924
And growing fast.

1532
02:44:38,316 --> 02:44:40,767
I saw the one
they call the Reverend Mother.

1533
02:44:40,892 --> 02:44:43,343
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.

1534
02:44:43,634 --> 02:44:45,586
- Why?
- To see me.

1535
02:44:46,958 --> 02:44:48,037
To see you.

1536
02:44:48,163 --> 02:44:49,704
She's Bene Gesserit.

1537
02:44:50,329 --> 02:44:52,079
One of our missionaries.

1538
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:55,036
Convenient.

1539
02:44:57,370 --> 02:44:59,828
Stilgar says you've learned much.

1540
02:45:00,702 --> 02:45:03,160
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.

1541
02:45:11,119 --> 02:45:13,826
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.

1542
02:45:20,075 --> 02:45:22,282
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?

1543
02:45:25,283 --> 02:45:27,122
Because I loved him.

1544
02:45:27,791 --> 02:45:30,257
As long as your father
remained unmarried...

1545
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:34,269
...some of the great houses could still hope
for an alliance through marriage.

1546
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:36,944
We both knew what that meant.

1547
02:45:37,487 --> 02:45:40,162
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?

1548
02:45:40,246 --> 02:45:42,084
I would have encouraged it.

1549
02:45:42,462 --> 02:45:43,548
Politics.

1550
02:45:44,594 --> 02:45:45,676
Yes.

1551
02:45:47,384 --> 02:45:48,467
Politics.

1552
02:46:31,746 --> 02:46:33,578
While I was on the hajra...

1553
02:46:33,704 --> 02:46:35,911
...I had dreams about this garden.

1554
02:46:37,869 --> 02:46:40,534
Except it wasn't here,
it was somewhere else.

1555
02:46:43,659 --> 02:46:45,117
Was I there?

1556
02:46:46,491 --> 02:46:47,490
Yes.

1557
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:50,285
And there were children...

1558
02:46:51,202 --> 02:46:53,038
...playing, very happy.

1559
02:46:55,165 --> 02:46:56,916
A wonderful dream.

1560
02:47:02,839 --> 02:47:05,925
Do you think it's possible
to love someone enough...

1561
02:47:06,843 --> 02:47:09,471
...you'd be willing to give that person up?

1562
02:47:17,729 --> 02:47:18,894
I think...

1563
02:47:19,892 --> 02:47:23,720
...there are times when it's necessary
to share the one you love...

1564
02:47:24,886 --> 02:47:27,922
...with things greater than both of you.

1565
02:47:44,110 --> 02:47:46,897
Everything is connected,
one thing to another.

1566
02:47:47,522 --> 02:47:51,100
The living and the dead,
the animate and the inanimate.

1567
02:47:51,766 --> 02:47:53,097
A system.

1568
02:47:53,390 --> 02:47:56,977
All parts functioning to serve the whole.

1569
02:47:58,186 --> 02:48:00,230
Smell the air, Muad'dib.

1570
02:48:02,482 --> 02:48:03,817
Cinnamon.

1571
02:48:04,776 --> 02:48:06,903
The pre-spice mass is below us.

1572
02:48:07,904 --> 02:48:10,657
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.

1573
02:48:13,076 --> 02:48:15,787
The Maker has left her nest long ago.

1574
02:48:16,705 --> 02:48:19,875
Her children have joined together
for survival.

1575
02:48:20,375 --> 02:48:23,795
They have grown.
They are losing water now.

1576
02:48:24,755 --> 02:48:26,965
It will mix with their waste.

1577
02:48:28,091 --> 02:48:30,047
If enough has accumulated...

1578
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:34,166
...a giant bubble of foam
will heave up with tremendous force.

1579
02:48:34,540 --> 02:48:36,121
A spice blow.

1580
02:48:36,412 --> 02:48:39,033
Trading places with the sands above.

1581
02:48:39,782 --> 02:48:42,237
The sun and heat will dry it out and...

1582
02:48:43,194 --> 02:48:44,359
...soon...

1583
02:48:45,525 --> 02:48:48,653
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.

1584
02:48:50,322 --> 02:48:52,115
The worm...

1585
02:48:52,949 --> 02:48:54,576
...is the spice.

1586
02:48:55,118 --> 02:48:56,786
So now you know.

1587
02:48:59,748 --> 02:49:03,084
Many of the little makers
will die in the blow.

1588
02:49:05,128 --> 02:49:10,342
The rest will swim off
to become Shai-Hulud, the Great Worm.

1589
02:49:11,676 --> 02:49:13,553
We may capture a few.

1590
02:49:14,429 --> 02:49:16,803
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.

1591
02:49:20,636 --> 02:49:22,551
That's enough for now.

1592
02:50:27,293 --> 02:50:31,442
When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...

1593
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:34,179
...the whirlwind follows.

1594
02:50:35,051 --> 02:50:37,596
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.

1595
02:50:37,929 --> 02:50:41,683
The one who can be many places at once.

1596
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:45,103
You are the whirlwind.

1597
02:50:46,521 --> 02:50:48,378
It's almost night, Muad'dib.

1598
02:50:49,105 --> 02:50:51,163
Time to return to the sietch.

1599
02:50:55,321 --> 02:50:57,137
You've been dreaming.

1600
02:51:20,874 --> 02:51:22,408
Too impatient, Farok.

1601
02:51:23,942 --> 02:51:25,476
You moved too soon.

1602
02:51:26,644 --> 02:51:27,943
Try again.

1603
02:51:32,358 --> 02:51:34,138
Watch his posture.

1604
02:51:34,694 --> 02:51:38,295
Even the slightest change in his breathing
gives you advantage.

1605
02:51:56,549 --> 02:51:58,635
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.

1606
02:52:17,529 --> 02:52:18,774
I am Otheym.

1607
02:52:19,605 --> 02:52:22,679
These are my brothers
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

1608
02:52:23,841 --> 02:52:26,956
We've come to find the one
who calls himself Muad'dib.

1609
02:52:33,561 --> 02:52:36,509
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.

1610
02:52:37,882 --> 02:52:40,007
We've come to join your crusade.

1611
02:52:40,882 --> 02:52:43,089
We want to learn the Weirding Way.

1612
02:52:44,007 --> 02:52:45,840
We want to become Fedaykin.

1613
02:52:46,507 --> 02:52:49,424
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.

1614
02:53:14,051 --> 02:53:17,383
- We could fight as Muad'dib.
- I believe you.

1615
02:53:22,385 --> 02:53:24,763
Let their waters join with ours.

1616
02:53:45,742 --> 02:53:49,071
I must congratulate you
on the perfection of your heir, Baron.

1617
02:53:49,154 --> 02:53:54,105
He faces his 100th slave gladiator
in the arena this afternoon.

1618
02:53:54,356 --> 02:53:56,062
He appears ready.

1619
02:53:56,394 --> 02:53:59,057
Well then,
perhaps we might take this opportunity...

1620
02:53:59,141 --> 02:54:00,930
...to conduct our conversations.

1621
02:54:01,055 --> 02:54:03,052
There is much to discuss.

1622
02:54:04,010 --> 02:54:05,266
Indeed.

1623
02:54:05,978 --> 02:54:08,910
If that meets with your approval, Milady.

1624
02:54:09,328 --> 02:54:11,547
I am quite entertained here.

1625
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:13,892
Fine.

1626
02:54:14,187 --> 02:54:15,988
By your leave, then.

1627
02:54:37,710 --> 02:54:41,288
What other house would have
been willing to humiliate itself

1628
02:54:41,589 --> 02:54:44,908
so the Emperor could rid
himself of a troublesome duke?

1629
02:54:45,551 --> 02:54:48,825
He's been asking
himself that very question.

1630
02:54:49,389 --> 02:54:54,988
Are you suggesting that the Emperor
contemplates a move against me?

1631
02:54:55,687 --> 02:54:58,995
Speculation is not a
worthy science, Baron.

1632
02:54:59,607 --> 02:55:02,588
Better we spend our energy
on what's most important.

1633
02:55:02,777 --> 02:55:04,829
The spice must flow.

1634
02:55:06,864 --> 02:55:12,875
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...

1635
02:55:13,495 --> 02:55:15,251
curious.

1636
02:55:16,124 --> 02:55:19,249
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...

1637
02:55:20,291 --> 02:55:23,708
...coming deeper into the southern regions
than ever before.

1638
02:55:25,208 --> 02:55:29,334
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild
won't be enough to protect us.

1639
02:55:45,795 --> 02:55:47,503
Then it's agreed.

1640
02:55:48,295 --> 02:55:50,503
We move with the next moons.

1641
02:55:52,046 --> 02:55:54,421
When the Harkonnen find this place...

1642
02:55:55,713 --> 02:55:59,630
...there must be nothing left
but the wind howling through the rocks.

1643
02:56:06,132 --> 02:56:08,424
There is no turning back now.

1644
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:22,968
Subdue the Maker.

1645
02:58:03,116 --> 02:58:04,574
The Maker is dead.

1646
02:58:04,699 --> 02:58:06,449
The Water of Life.

1647
02:58:06,784 --> 02:58:10,451
May Shai-Hulud have mercy on both of us.

1648
02:58:47,001 --> 02:58:51,256
When night falls again,
we have to leave this sietch...

1649
02:58:53,591 --> 02:58:56,553
...that has sheltered us for so long.

1650
02:58:58,304 --> 02:59:02,142
We must go south into the deep desert...

1651
02:59:04,102 --> 02:59:07,772
...where the demon Harkonnen
will not pursue us.

1652
02:59:08,648 --> 02:59:13,528
But our Reverend Mother
will not survive another hajra.

1653
02:59:16,030 --> 02:59:20,571
So that we don't have to make the journey
without her strength and guidance...

1654
02:59:23,278 --> 02:59:28,776
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented
to undergo the rites at this time.

1655
02:59:29,776 --> 02:59:32,983
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.

1656
02:59:33,859 --> 02:59:37,940
So that we don't lose all, Chani...

1657
02:59:39,150 --> 02:59:43,065
...daughter of Liet,
will be consecrated as Sayyadina...

1658
02:59:43,940 --> 02:59:46,314
...Friend of God.

1659
02:59:49,689 --> 02:59:52,965
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...

1660
02:59:54,172 --> 02:59:55,939
...in the Sayyadina.

1661
03:01:17,900 --> 03:01:22,168
Here is the Water of Life,
the water that will free your soul.

1662
03:01:23,161 --> 03:01:27,429
If you are our Reverend Mother,
the universe will open to you.

1663
03:01:29,067 --> 03:01:31,696
Let Shai-Hulud judge now.

1664
03:01:49,892 --> 03:01:51,810
You must drink it now.

1665
03:02:08,285 --> 03:02:09,995
What's happening to her?

1666
03:02:10,079 --> 03:02:13,082
The water is poisoned until she changes it.

1667
03:02:16,544 --> 03:02:18,661
This must take its course.

1668
03:02:25,386 --> 03:02:27,053
Mother? Mother?

1669
03:03:25,657 --> 03:03:28,115
You cannot go there.

1670
03:03:30,284 --> 03:03:32,953
That is the place we cannot look.

1671
03:03:33,620 --> 03:03:36,580
The place only
the Kwisatz Haderach may go.

1672
03:03:39,251 --> 03:03:43,545
You must turn away, Jessica,
or it will drive you mad.

1673
03:03:51,096 --> 03:03:54,765
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.

1674
03:03:56,685 --> 03:03:59,599
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding,

1675
03:04:00,308 --> 03:04:04,681
...and the lives that have come before.
They are yours now.

1676
03:04:23,674 --> 03:04:27,672
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.

1677
03:04:29,172 --> 03:04:32,546
Holy Mothers!
What have we done?

1678
03:04:33,878 --> 03:04:36,252
This changes you both.

1679
03:04:51,996 --> 03:04:56,119
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.

1680
03:04:56,954 --> 03:04:59,246
She must see all that we see.

1681
03:05:00,287 --> 03:05:03,788
That is the only way you can save her.

1682
03:05:08,998 --> 03:05:13,457
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.

1683
03:05:42,423 --> 03:05:46,924
The plan was perfect in its simplicity
and viciousness.

1684
03:05:47,300 --> 03:05:49,008
Of course it was.

1685
03:05:49,342 --> 03:05:52,342
You helped your uncle design it,
didn't you?

1686
03:05:52,885 --> 03:05:56,708
Duke Leto thought
he was gaining control of Arrakis...

1687
03:05:57,208 --> 03:06:00,034
...but he was only being fattened up
for sacrifice.

1688
03:06:00,117 --> 03:06:03,857
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.

1689
03:06:05,022 --> 03:06:06,849
Swift and merciless.

1690
03:06:07,555 --> 03:06:09,839
The Atreides never had a chance.

1691
03:06:09,924 --> 03:06:12,831
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed
within hours.

1692
03:06:12,955 --> 03:06:14,492
The Sardaukar.

1693
03:06:15,324 --> 03:06:19,249
I sent the final communiqu
to your father myself.

1694
03:06:43,102 --> 03:06:44,350
Mother?

1695
03:06:46,806 --> 03:06:48,303
Yes?

1696
03:07:02,913 --> 03:07:05,284
Mother Ramallo is gone.

1697
03:07:12,236 --> 03:07:14,316
But she remains.

1698
03:07:18,354 --> 03:07:20,975
You have changed the waters.

1699
03:07:22,141 --> 03:07:25,560
Now we know you cannot be false.

1700
03:07:28,355 --> 03:07:29,519
Paul?

1701
03:07:39,336 --> 03:07:42,996
The Reverend Mother
has changed the Water of Life.

1702
03:07:43,912 --> 03:07:46,199
It's now safe for us to drink!

1703
03:07:58,510 --> 03:08:02,296
The son and his mother,
the duke's concubine and her son...

1704
03:08:03,474 --> 03:08:05,100
...what did you do with them?

1705
03:08:05,184 --> 03:08:09,031
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.

1706
03:08:09,605 --> 03:08:12,105
You found their bodies
and disposed of them?

1707
03:08:12,232 --> 03:08:13,942
Never found them.

1708
03:08:15,277 --> 03:08:17,404
You never found the bodies?

1709
03:09:17,548 --> 03:09:19,090
You're trembling.

1710
03:09:20,634 --> 03:09:22,092
I'm afraid.

1711
03:09:23,595 --> 03:09:24,845
Of what?

1712
03:09:27,349 --> 03:09:28,596
Of you.

1713
03:09:31,009 --> 03:09:32,964
You make me see things.

1714
03:09:33,838 --> 03:09:35,501
What do you see?

1715
03:09:37,999 --> 03:09:41,493
I see us together.

1716
03:09:43,949 --> 03:09:45,955
There is a great storm.

1717
03:09:48,128 --> 03:09:50,259
I have a child in my arms.

1718
03:09:52,182 --> 03:09:54,020
Our child, Muad'dib.

1719
03:09:56,362 --> 03:09:58,075
It's not a dream.

1720
03:09:59,956 --> 03:10:01,460
I know you, Chani.

1721
03:10:04,052 --> 03:10:06,263
I've always known you.

1722
03:10:08,974 --> 03:10:13,937
We've sat upon a rock above the sands
and I've eased your fears.

1723
03:10:16,439 --> 03:10:19,150
We've caressed
in the darkness of the sietch.

1724
03:10:21,820 --> 03:10:25,031
We've grown old together.

1725
03:11:29,846 --> 03:11:33,937
History will say that the Fremen
were about to find their messiah.

1726
03:11:36,045 --> 03:11:39,165
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...

1727
03:11:40,136 --> 03:11:43,677
...and the world, as we knew it,
would change forever.

1728
03:11:45,028 --> 03:11:47,557
The saga of Dune is far
from over.

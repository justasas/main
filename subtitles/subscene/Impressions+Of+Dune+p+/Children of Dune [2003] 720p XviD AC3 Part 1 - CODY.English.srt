1
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,830
Twelve years of war.

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,750
Twelve years since Emperor Shaddam
the Fourth was defeated...

3
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,310
and Paul Muad'dib's wild Fremen
spread out across the universe...

4
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,790
exterminating all that remained
of the old imperial armies...

5
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,990
colonizing the planets
of the known universe...

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,150
one by one under his rule...

7
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,430
sweeping away anything...

8
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,870
and anyone who resisted.

9
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,350
Millions have been defeated.

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,350
Millions more have been slaughtered.

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,750
There are no innocents anywhere.

12
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,750
And the name of Muad'dib
is no longer a prayer.

13
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,750
For many, it is now a curse.

14
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:26,351
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

15
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,350
The mercy of Muad'dib...

16
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,390
is on our worst enemies.

17
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,990
The compassion of Muad'dib-

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,190
Commander Farok,
the conversions have begun.

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,910
Anyone refusing the peace of Muad'dib
will be executed.

20
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,590
So it is written.

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,430
You who deny the glory of Muad'dib...

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,870
are condemned to death.

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,070
Sir, your son-

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,350
He's been wounded.

25
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,470
My eyes! My eyes!

26
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,550
I'm blind, Father. I'm blind!

27
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,990
Don't give me to the desert, Father.
Please!

28
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,990
Don't send me to die.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,110
If history teaches us anything...

30
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,790
it is simply this-

31
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,950
Every revolution carries within it
the seeds of its own destruction.

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,710
And empires that rise will one day fall.

33
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,430
Arrakis.

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,270
Dune.

35
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,190
Once the wasteland of the universe...

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,950
now an imperial capital.

37
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,070
For it is here and only here
that giant worms still roam...

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,270
creating spice...

39
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,630
still the greatest treasure
in the universe...

40
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,310
still the cause of conspiracy...

41
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,230
betrayal and murder.

42
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,030
- The holy sister!
- Alia!

43
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,190
In the beginning, we were all empty.

44
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,470
Ignorant of all things.

45
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,830
We did not know the power
that resides in every place.

46
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,950
And in all time.

47
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,310
He is the power that awakens the soul.

48
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,750
And brings us joy.

49
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,310
Muad'dib! I don't suppose you feel
it's necessary to inform me...

50
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,350
when you go on these walkabouts.

51
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,870
You'd only try and stop me... again.

52
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,750
- The streets are full of danger.
- Truth is in the streets, Stil...

53
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,430
not in this parade of sycophants
who flutter around this palace...

54
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,310
with their meaningless statistics
and empty ritual.

55
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,310
Ritual is the way by which
men are enlightened, Muad'dib.

56
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,550
Tell me, Korba...

57
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,230
when was it you reinvented yourself from
Fremen Fedaykin to religious fanatic?

58
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,550
The day you defeated Shaddam
and his armies, Muad'dib.

59
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,670
The day I saw the future.

60
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,550
The city's filled
with adventurers, Muad'dib.

61
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,390
Not to mention agents of
the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit...

62
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,590
and the former imperial family.

63
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,710
Surely they conspire to something
a little more elegant...

64
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,510
than assassination
on the streets of Arakeen.

65
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,870
You are vulnerable, Muad'dib.

66
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,990
No matter how powerful
you have become...

67
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,950
you cannot escape this simple fact.

68
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,470
You're right about one thing, Stil.

69
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,830
There is no escape.

70
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,430
I'm not asleep.

71
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,230
I thought the doctors said
you were supposed to rest.

72
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,230
As long as you insist on wandering
the city like some off-world pilgrim...

73
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,350
I will never be able to rest.

74
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,750
Are you going to lecture me too?

75
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,710
While I was walking,
I stepped in a puddle.

76
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,110
An open pool of water in the street.

77
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,790
Muad'dib has brought many wonders
to Arrakis, the people say.

78
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,750
Muad'dib spends water like a madman.

79
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,190
That's what they say, Chani.

80
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,430
The old Fremen.

81
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,430
I hear them...

82
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,750
in the streets when I walk.

83
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,550
We've become water-fat.

84
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,190
They resent the wonders
I've brought to their desert.

85
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,950
They resent me.

86
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,190
You know what I'd pay
to end these wars?

87
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,630
To separate myself from this...

88
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,630
damnable myth I've become?

89
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,150
What's to stop you?

90
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,430
Command it, Muad'dib.

91
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,110
After all, you are the emperor.

92
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,070
Even if I vanished tomorrow,
the revolution would follow my ghost.

93
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,150
This is not a clean place.

94
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,470
It's time to return to the desert.

95
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,550
We were happy there.

96
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,110
Father.

97
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,030
I'm waiting and I'm ready.

98
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,710
To knowthe future
is to be trapped by it.

99
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,510
But knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

100
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,750
It's the first step
along the Golden Path.

101
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm the answer.
I'm ready, Father.

102
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,270
And I am ready, Father.

103
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,110
The answer's standing
right in front of you...

104
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,510
in the Golden Path.

105
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,190
Is there no other way?

106
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,150
Everywhere we turn,
his power confronts us.

107
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,270
- He's a curse.
- He's a messiah.

108
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,230
You can't launch a frontal attack
on a messiah.

109
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,830
Even if you succeed,
their martyrdom remains.

110
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,670
But he is human,
and because he is human...

111
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,870
he has his weaknesses.

112
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,070
So, what do you suggest, Princess?

113
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,270
Something subtle. Something...

114
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,630
unexpected.

115
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,070
A ghost, perhaps.

116
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,830
May I introduce our friend,
Reverend Mother, Scytale of the Tleilaxu.

117
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,310
Get to the point, Wencisia.

118
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,030
I haven't traveled all the way
to the edge of the universe...

119
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,430
to discuss nonsense
with a face dancer.

120
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,190
You Bene Gesserit are desperate to
regain control of Muad'dib's bloodline...

121
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,950
and because you want to break
his monopoly on spice.

122
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,990
He who controls the spice
controls the universe.

123
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,430
As long as Muad'dib controls Arrakis...

124
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,390
we are all at his mercy.

125
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,830
And that's why I intend
to destroy that domination...

126
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,990
and return the imperial throne
to the planet Kaitain...

127
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,950
and the Corrino family,
where it rightfully belongs.

128
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,550
Face dancers, sex toys...

129
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,950
musicians, technicians-

130
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,790
Whatever the need...

131
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,870
we have the breed.

132
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,710
- Good gods!
- Good chemistry is more like it.

133
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,510
Duncan Idaho.

134
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,950
Yes, the Atreides hero.

135
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,550
Paul Muad'dib's most beloved
friend and teacher.

136
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,630
But Idaho is dead.

137
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,710
Killed by your father's Sardukar.

138
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,870
Even in defeat, my father's men
did not abandon wisdom, Reverend Mother.

139
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,710
A few precious pieces
of Idaho's ruined flesh...

140
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,070
hidden away, saved...

141
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,110
awaiting just the right time,
the right place.

142
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,150
Perfect duplicate. Perfect ghola.

143
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,110
A perfect gift for a lonely emperor.

144
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,910
A time bomb waiting
for the trigger to explode.

145
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,790
- You intend to kill Muad'dib?
- Exactly.

146
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,910
But that will mean chaos.

147
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,910
- Spice production will be disrupted.
- Learn the lesson my father ignored.

148
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,310
It's not who controls the spice...

149
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,350
but who has the ability to disrupt
the spice who controls the universe.

150
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,630
But what makes you think...

151
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,870
Muad'dib will ever accept this... ghost?

152
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,790
I'm leaving it up to the Spacing Guild.

153
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,710
And what of the trigger?

154
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,630
The device to set the time bomb off?

155
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,550
Leave that to me.

156
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,270
Test after test, and still nothing.

157
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,150
I'm healthy, strong.

158
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,230
No matter what they do,
the doctors can't find the reason...

159
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,910
why I'm unable to conceive.

160
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,790
What does Muad'dib say?

161
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,470
Muad'dib is afraid.

162
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,870
He fears for me
if I have another child.

163
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,270
I can feel it.

164
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,870
He may be right to fear.

165
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,470
Someone has been feeding you a poison.

166
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,230
It's the only possibility left.

167
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,590
But the doctors
have never found evidence.

168
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,990
They wouldn't.

169
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,950
Its traces are subtle, confusing.

170
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,470
Of the most sophisticated chemistry.

171
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,110
Beyond their knowledge.

172
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,470
Surely from off-world.

173
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,630
But...

174
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,350
there are remedies.

175
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,750
The ancient Fremen diet...

176
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,310
which might overcome
the contraceptive's effects.

177
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,230
But it's dangerous.

178
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,150
You would be required to eat greater
and greater quantities of spice.

179
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,030
And if you conceive...

180
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,790
it will accelerate your pregnancy.

181
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,870
But the question remains...

182
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,310
who has been able to feed you
the contraceptives for so long?

183
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,510
Be that as it may...

184
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,750
this is a question that cannot be
delayed any longer.

185
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,310
The great houses are still demanding...

186
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,310
that a constitution be on the agenda...

187
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,710
at the next convention of the Lansraad.

188
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,910
It's nothing but a ruse...

189
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,430
contrived by enemies of House Atreides
to conceal far more sinister motives.

190
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,870
Perhaps we could offer the appearance
of a constitution.

191
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,590
Something ceremonial.

192
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,710
It doesn't need to be real.

193
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,790
Deceit, after all,
is a legitimate tool of statecraft.

194
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,750
Bravo, sister-in-law.

195
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,830
I couldn't have said it better.

196
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,270
Yes, perhaps something
at the local level.

197
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,710
Something impotent,
virtually meaningless.

198
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,430
No!

199
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,830
Atreides power
must never be marginalized...

200
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,110
by the chaos of democracy.

201
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,910
- I'm sure my brother agrees.
- Father.

202
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,430
I'm waiting.

203
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,990
You must decide.

204
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,750
The first step. You can't wait.

205
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,350
Along the Golden Path.

206
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,870
The answer's standing
right in front of you.

207
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,110
But you must decide.

208
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,270
Alia knows my mind.
I forbid a constitution.

209
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,310
Order in council this day,
et cetera, et cetera.

210
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,670
Irulan, are you taking this down?

211
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,350
Yes, my lord.

212
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,390
We will deliver the formal declaration
when the Guild ambassador arrives...

213
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,630
to present his credentials.

214
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,670
Then...

215
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,110
if there's nothing more-

216
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,270
A Guild embassy, Muad'dib?

217
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,070
On Arrakis?

218
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,990
The Council of Naibs
won't like this, Muad'dib.

219
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,270
We remember well...

220
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,910
how the Guild brought those
who oppressed us...

221
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,830
how they blackmailed us for spice...

222
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,990
to keep our secrets from our enemies.

223
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,030
Think I'd forgotten, Stil?

224
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,510
This... decision troubles me, Muad'dib.

225
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,230
There's something...

226
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,070
reckless about it.

227
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,350
Not reckless.

228
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,030
Necessary.

229
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,590
You'll know my reasons soon enough.

230
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,350
No. I trust you'll convince the naibs...

231
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,590
of the wisdom in this.

232
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,190
A Guild ambassador,
here onArrakis.

233
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,470
Muad'dib's decision strikes some
as mysterious, even dangerous.

234
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,310
But Muad'dib never does anything
without reason.

235
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,670
I should spill your water on the sand
for what you've done.

236
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,590
I know it was you, Irulan.

237
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,830
You're the only one
who could have hidden the poison.

238
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,910
Don't lie!

239
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,590
You will insult him if you lie.

240
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,430
It is my right to bear the royal heir.

241
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,990
It is your duty to play a role.
Nothing more.

242
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,350
- I am his wife!
- You have his name.

243
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,150
I am the one he calls "wife. "

244
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,070
Do you think you are the only woman
who truly loves him?

245
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,870
But I am the only woman he loves.

246
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,990
I could cuckold him.

247
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,990
Dare him to expose me.

248
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,230
Cuckold him all you like...

249
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,670
as long as you're discreet.

250
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,710
He won't deny you.

251
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,110
But no child, Irulan. Ever.

252
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,950
So, what do you think, Tyekanik?

253
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,950
Does my little prince have what it takes
to lead a Sardukar army one day?

254
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,510
There are many ways
to lead an army, Princess.

255
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,270
Being a warrior is only one of them.

256
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,870
And not necessarily the best.

257
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,670
Prince Farad'n. Your turn.

258
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,030
Muad'dib's decision to accept
a Guild ambassador...

259
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,990
is causing much unrest on Arrakis.

260
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,750
Good.

261
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,950
Once the face dancer is insinuated
into Muad'dib's palace...

262
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,750
we shall light the fuse...

263
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,030
and the Idaho ghola will do its work.

264
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,590
Mom? Mommy?

265
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,590
- What is this?
- I'm sorry, Princess.

266
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,710
The future emperor, crying?

267
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,630
I don't want to be an emperor.
Let someone else do it.

268
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,990
Nonsense.

269
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,190
Wipe your tears. Here.
Getting all over me now.

270
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,230
All right. Now, go back to your men.

271
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,390
Go back. Go.

272
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,030
Do you want the men to see you crying?
Do you want them to think you're weak?

273
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,630
I don't care.

274
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,950
Well, I do.

275
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,270
So now you will go back...

276
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,430
and this time...

277
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,870
you will do it properly.

278
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,630
Won't you?

279
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,030
Commander Farok,
hero of the Naraj campaign.

280
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,270
I bring you greetings from
your new friends on Salusa Secundus.

281
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,750
Hurry. The eyes of Muad'dib
are everywhere.

282
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,430
These are seats once occupied
in sietch by Muad'dib...

283
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,790
during the days when he taught us
the weirding way.

284
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,150
It is some time since you've seen him.

285
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,510
I think he's forgotten
I ever existed.

286
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,190
He's blind. Your son.

287
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,350
At the Battle of Naraj.

288
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,150
I wonder if Muad'dib knows...

289
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,030
how many have been maimed
in his name.

290
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,030
I couldn't leave him to the desert.

291
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,590
Even I violated the old laws.

292
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,350
The laws of men have gone.

293
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,150
The laws of a god have replaced them.

294
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,470
We were a noble people once.

295
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,230
We had a proper sietch.

296
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,110
I owned a chrysknife.

297
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,390
My own share of spice.

298
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,790
I was a rider of worms.

299
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,110
And then Muad'dib came...

300
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,550
with his witch mother.

301
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,070
And he promised to fulfill
Liet's prophesy.

302
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,110
And we followed.

303
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,550
- You joined his jihad?
- Do you know why?

304
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,310
I heard there was a thing called a sea.

305
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,590
Men came back from Muad'dib's wars,
and they said they had seen it.

306
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,350
And did you find your sea?

307
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,430
It healed me of jihad.

308
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,950
Now I'm ready
to help rid the universe...

309
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,310
of the cancer that is Muad'dib!

310
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,350
And that is Othyem's daughter?

311
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,270
Lichna.

312
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
If you bring her to Muad'dib...

313
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,390
he will never refuse to see her.

314
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,030
I was hoping that's what you'd say.

315
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,150
Lichna. I will enjoy
being called Lichna.

316
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,510
What is the meaning of this?

317
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,190
Helen Gaius Mohiam
of the Bene Gesserit...

318
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,630
you have violated
Muad'dib's eternal order...

319
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,470
never to set foot
on Arrakis again.

320
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,630
I am not on Arrakis.
I am in free space.

321
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,550
There is no such thing as free space
where Muad'dib rules.

322
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,270
I abase myself before the emperor.

323
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,150
We welcome you to our court,
Edric of the Spacing Guild...

324
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,870
and to a new understanding
between us.

325
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,150
Please allow me the honor
of presenting His Majesty...

326
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,310
with a small token of our esteem.

327
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,390
According to our investigators,
this one was killed here on Arrakis...

328
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,950
the body recovered
after the unfortunate conflict...

329
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,950
between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.

330
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,710
Terrible wounds required many months
of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.

331
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,830
We acquired him as a gift
befitting an emperor.

332
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,150
What is your name, ghola?

333
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,230
They say it was Duncan Idaho.

334
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,230
Idaho is dead!

335
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,670
This thing...

336
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,550
is a horror!

337
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,710
Send him away!

338
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,550
And do you enjoy the name?

339
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,830
It stirs up curious feelings.

340
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,550
You don't know who you are?

341
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,070
I know nothing of my past, sire.

342
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,270
How is this one trained?

343
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,230
It amused the Tleilaxu
to train him as a mentat.

344
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,830
I beg you, my lord!
Let me take its water.

345
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,630
Find quarters in the keep
for the ghola, Stil.

346
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,510
We accept this gift in the spirit
with which it was given.

347
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,990
Majesty, there is the matter
of Reverend Mother Mohiam.

348
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,750
She was removed from our highliner
by your agents...

349
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,870
in violation of our neutrality.

350
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,110
Be careful, Ambassador.

351
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,470
To be neutral is to be indifferent.

352
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,710
You would do well to disassociate
yourself from those who are not.

353
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,510
As you will learn, Edric,
my sister has the pulse of the court.

354
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,550
Be advised.

355
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,390
Reverend Mother.

356
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,030
I shudder to see you
in such circumstances.

357
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,150
I've been in worse.

358
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,550
Did the cards answer all your questions?

359
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,950
Answers only breed more questions.

360
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,750
What is important is how
one navigates between the two.

361
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,830
So, you haven't forgotten
everything we taught you.

362
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,910
Has the emperor explained
why I'm to be detained?

363
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,350
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.

364
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,350
But I hope it won't be too long.

365
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,870
We understand.

366
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,910
The sisterhood is aware of my delay?

367
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,750
They have changed your schedule
in light of the situation.

368
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,990
I'll be patient then.

369
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,830
You seem to be adapting to life here
quite well.

370
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,510
I have made my peace with it.

371
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,190
I hope your training has been a help.

372
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,270
A comfort.

373
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,990
One day, even Muad'dib
will know the good you've done.

374
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,150
For us all.

375
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,990
Do you know how dangerous that was?

376
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,790
Eleven blades, Paul!

377
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,350
Eleven!

378
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,190
The finest swordsmen in the imperium
have not gone up against more than nine.

379
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,070
Experienced swordsmen would never
have been so reckless.

380
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,070
This is why you invaded my privacy?

381
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,870
To disapprove of my recklessness?

382
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,990
- A body was found in the desert.
- A young woman.

383
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,670
- A Fremen.
- Fremen?

384
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,670
Decapitated and her hands removed.

385
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,910
So someone was afraid she'd be found
before the desert does its work.

386
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,470
I want you to examine the scene
the way our mother taught us.

387
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,150
You will take the ghola mentat with you.

388
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,990
I assume you can handle him.

389
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,870
I should arrange a thopter.

390
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,990
Poisoned!

391
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,950
- How can you tell?
- The molting of the skin.

392
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,150
Clearly the effect of rapid
neurological atrophy.

393
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,270
A Tleilaxu specialty.

394
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,990
Tleilaxu? Face dancers.

395
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,670
This is a dead Fremen girl, my lady.

396
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,190
What if there are no women
reported missing amongst the Fremen?

397
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,430
Othyem's daughter, my lord.

398
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,470
- Lichna.
- It's been years since I've seen you.

399
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,110
And my father.

400
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,950
I must beg Muad'dib's forgiveness
for this intrusion, but...

401
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,790
I am the smoke who banishes sleep
in the night.

402
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,870
Sit.

403
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,910
Deliver your warning then.

404
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,070
You must visit my father...

405
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,110
as soon as possible, milord.

406
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,030
- There is a plot against you.
- There are many plots against me.

407
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,830
This is a Fremen plot.

408
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,630
My father has information for you.

409
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,550
But he's weak.

410
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,510
He's sick.

411
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,750
He needs you to visit
so he can tell you.

412
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,790
Why didn't he tell you
so you could tell me?

413
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,590
He feared I might be captured
before seeing you.

414
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,870
If I know nothing,
I can divulge nothing.

415
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,830
I leave for Othyem's tonight.

416
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,990
Othyem has missed... his old friend.

417
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,470
A face dancer.

418
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,990
- Good one too.
- Let me take its water.

419
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,110
No, Stil.

420
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,110
This must play out the way I've seen it.

421
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,430
Cursed be thy name, Atreides.

422
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,150
Your time has finally come.

423
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,750
The stoneburner is set and ready.

424
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,750
Let the others know
Muad'dib is in the streets.

425
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,670
Go.

426
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,870
So, you've come, then.

427
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,950
We meet again, Muad'dib.

428
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,950
Answering the call of the Fedaykin.

429
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,030
I carry your water burden, Othyem.

430
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,670
Command me.

431
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,110
I caught the spitting disease
in Tarahill.

432
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,910
- The tribe will take my water soon.
- Let me summon my doctors.

433
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,350
We've had doctors as good as any
Muad'dib could provide.

434
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,030
There's treachery, Muad'dib.

435
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,350
I'm ashamed to say it.

436
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,630
The Fremen plot against you.

437
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,110
They want time to stop.

438
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,190
They want things
the way they used to be.

439
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,030
Bijaz has told me their names.
He was a gift to me...

440
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,790
after our victories on Tarahill.

441
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,550
I am a person, not a gift.

442
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,150
Cheap to feed but costly to fill.

443
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,510
Empty me as you will, sire.

444
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,510
He always prattles on like that.
He's a good spy.

445
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,270
You should take him tonight.

446
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,150
Our enemies will think I'm selling him
to you because I need the money.

447
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,230
To be gone is to be bygone.

448
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,190
Let bygones be bygones.

449
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,310
And Bijaz and Muad'dib
must be gone by now.

450
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,350
He's right, Muad'dib.
It's not safe for you to be here.

451
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,710
These are troubled times, old friend.

452
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,670
It was better
when we were alone in the desert...

453
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,750
with only the Harkonnen
as our enemies.

454
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,630
There's a thin line
between enemy and friend.

455
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,790
Where that line stops,
there's no beginning...

456
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,710
and no end.

457
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,750
Bygones be bygones,
let them fall where they may.

458
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,910
This has been a dirty day.

459
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,790
The wind speaks of demons.

460
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,110
That is not the wind.

461
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,150
Stoneburner.

462
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,990
Don't look at it, my lord!
You can't look at it!

463
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,030
My eyes!

464
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,590
It's worse in the Old Quarter.
Stoneburner for sure.

465
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,430
- What about Muad'dib?
- We are just entering the area now.

466
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,190
My eyes!

467
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,310
Milord! Is that you?

468
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,470
Here! I'm over here!

469
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,550
Take this one
and get him to the keep immediately.

470
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,030
Your eyes-

471
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,350
Do it, Fedaykin.
Do it now!

472
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,350
This way.

473
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,390
My lord.

474
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,470
Your eyes.

475
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,110
My eyes are gone, Stil.

476
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,110
My gods! Muad'dib.

477
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,710
Calm, Stil.

478
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,230
They blinded my body...

479
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,030
but not my vision.

480
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,510
There are men who need
your help, Fedaykin! Here and here!

481
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,550
The law, Muad'dib.

482
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,750
We live by Atreides law now, Stil.

483
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,230
None of these men
are to be taken out into the desert.

484
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,150
Anyone who wants is to be fitted
with Tleilaxu eyes.

485
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,830
Not eyes, yet he sees.

486
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,270
He has sight without eyes.

487
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,950
You knew this would happen.

488
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,870
It had to be.

489
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,750
Why?

490
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,390
Why?

491
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,950
For our son.

492
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,670
How long have you known?

493
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,870
I have always known.

494
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,230
It was just a matter of when.

495
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,950
Forgive me, Chani.

496
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,190
There was no way I could spare us this.

497
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,350
I waited as long as I could.

498
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,230
We will return to our desert, my love.

499
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,110
To the sietch where our son
will be born.

500
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,270
I'm afraid, Muad'dib.

501
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,470
I suddenly feel like
we have so little time.

502
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,950
We have eternity.

503
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,590
You have eternity.

504
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,550
I have only now.

505
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,790
So you are Bijaz.

506
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,030
Would I were Bijou and not Bijaz.

507
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,430
A jewel is prettier than a horse's ass.

508
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,190
You're a mockery then.

509
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,750
A trick of nature
meant to confuse and annoy.

510
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,230
Annoy, yes.

511
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,350
Confuse, no. Is wind a trick?

512
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,270
Then you are the wind.

513
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,350
No, I am words in the wind.

514
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,670
Words that are names.

515
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,390
Names that are death.

516
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,110
He knows.

517
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,430
- What does he mean?
- What I mean is what I say.

518
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,390
And what I say is what I mean.

519
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:56,030
Time for accounting,
unless you come just to mocker me.

520
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,590
My brother says you know
the names of the traitors.

521
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,830
Poor Muad'dib. Poor Bijaz.

522
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,110
Betrayed and betrayer
together at last

523
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,350
You will give me the names
of those who would betray us.

524
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,950
Very well, then.
Let's start with your priests.

525
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,870
He has another agenda.

526
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,030
How do you know?

527
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,710
I sense it.

528
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,070
Senses are dangerous.
They can be fooled.

529
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,510
Only a machine
functions without senses.

530
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,230
Are you a machine, ghola?

531
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,550
I'm a mentat.
I trust only logic and statistics.

532
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,870
Not mysticism and prophesy.

533
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,350
My brother had a mentat teacher
who talked like that.

534
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:44,990
Hawat.

535
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,350
You remember.

536
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,030
- You did that on purpose.
- You remember.

537
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,430
I feel.

538
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,710
There is a difference.

539
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,230
Is there?

540
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,550
It frightens you, doesn't it?
The memory.

541
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,110
You're afraid you'll remember
who you were.

542
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,710
No ghola has ever been restored
to his former being, child.

543
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,470
I'm no child.

544
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,030
I awakened to consciousness
in my mother's womb.

545
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,670
I have memories of many women
alive inside of me.

546
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:28,310
I know what they knew.
I feel what they felt.

547
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,750
But I can handle it. Can you?

548
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,150
Palace Fedaykin are everywhere.

549
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,510
By the time Alia is through,
a common pickpocket won't be safe.

550
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,390
The fools even had a stoneburner
and they couldn't succeed.

551
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,830
Our spies have no idea
who was responsible.

552
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,070
It could have been Fremen rebels
from the deep desert.

553
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,230
It could have been an element within
the Quizrate itself. We may never know.

554
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,190
- What about Scytale?
- He maintains his masquerade.

555
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:08,870
- And the dwarf?
- Confined to the keep. Who knows where.

556
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,750
Then our plan is still in place.

557
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,510
He's alive.

558
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,630
Gurney, tell me he's alive.

559
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,830
He is alive.

560
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,390
But he's blind.

561
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,310
It was a stoneburner.
Stilgar suspects Fremen.

562
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,910
Alia? Chani?

563
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,590
All safe.

564
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,950
Blind. Blind.

565
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:06,150
There are rumors that Paul can still see
despite his blindness.

566
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,510
Vision-sight.
They say it's a miracle.

567
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,550
-Another brick for the myth of Muad'dib.
-My lady?

568
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,670
Arrange with the Guild ambassador
immediate transport to Arrakis.

569
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,470
I don't think that would be wise.

570
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,350
It was only a matter of time
before this happened.

571
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,270
It might not be long
before it happens again.

572
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,870
And you would not want to encourage it.

573
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,270
Ah, forgive me, my lady.

574
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,790
But those who would rid themselves of
Muad'dib would only be more provoked...

575
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,870
by the arrival of his mother.

576
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,270
If Paul needed you,
he would surely send for you.

577
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,030
We go forward. We come back.

578
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,190
We go forward. We come back.

579
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,310
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer's right in front of you.

580
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:04,030
- The Golden Path.
- But you must decide.

581
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,510
It's the only way.

582
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,150
What troubles you, my lord?

583
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,790
The future.

584
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,110
You're drunk on too much time.

585
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,390
I'm drunk on too much me.

586
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,790
Do you know how many people have died
since I became emperor?

587
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,430
Even your empire must live its time...
and then die.

588
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,350
That's why you're here, isn't it?

589
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,390
Is that what you've seen?
In your visions?

590
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:45,430
It's obvious to anyone who can see.

591
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,030
It's what the Tleilaxu
have written upon you-

592
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,190
to kill me.

593
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,630
What is it, Stil?

594
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,630
I have just received word
from Salusa Sucundus.

595
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,310
Shaddam is dead.

596
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,230
It was very generous of Muad'dib
to permit his wife...

597
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:24,150
to attend the funeral
of his mortal enemy.

598
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,550
How grateful you must be for the safety
my sacrifice assured our father...

599
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,150
and you.

600
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,950
Not one major house represented!
Not one!

601
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,990
Muad'dib would not allow
any formal delegations, milady.

602
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:46,550
As far as he was concerned, your father
died the day he was defeated on Arrakis.

603
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,430
My father was the 81st
Padishaw emperor. A colossus!

604
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,750
Who is this bastard Atreides
but some Bedouin charlatan?

605
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,710
Do not underestimate the power
of Muad'dib's prescience, milady.

606
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:01,830
Your father did,
to his great misfortune.

607
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,670
My father was betrayed by you...

608
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,190
and your simpering Spacing Guild.

609
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,150
And those witches of the Bene Gesserit.
And for what? For spice.

610
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,110
You abandoned your emperor for spice.

611
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,150
We cannot guide our ships
without it, milady.

612
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,270
And that is why you will help me
kidnap a worm and bring it here.

613
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,230
I mean no disrespect, Princess...

614
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,510
but take a worm from Arrakis?

615
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,230
Even if the Idaho ghola succeeds, there
is still the sister to contend with.

616
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,310
We must be prepared with other means
to diminish the Atreides' power.

617
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,550
You want to bring a worm here?

618
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:46,310
Salusa Sucundus might prove hospitable
to the great worms of Arrakis.

619
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,150
If they thrived,
a new spice cycle could begin.

620
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,070
And?

621
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:56,110
Atreides monopoly would be broken.

622
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,990
Plans within plans.

623
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,750
If Muad'dib ever suspected
such a gambit...

624
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,390
he would smash this planet
and the Corrino name into oblivion.

625
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,910
We're already in oblivion.

626
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,510
Kidnap a worm from Arrakis.

627
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,630
The spice must flow.

628
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,190
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

629
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,630
The doctors say her metabolism
has accelerated.

630
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,590
The pregnancy is proceeding
faster than normal.

631
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,710
It will be a dangerous birth.

632
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,590
Beloved. I'm sorry.

633
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,630
I've distracted you.

634
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,030
If only you could
distract me forever.

635
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,070
My body's confusing me, Muad'dib.

636
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,070
My life burns faster.

637
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,590
I'm so hungry, always hungry.

638
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:33,550
Make arrangements, Stil. We leave
for the sietch as soon as possible.

639
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,870
The baby will be born there.
Inform my sister.

640
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,110
- How long have you been there?
- Long enough.

641
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,310
Are you sick, my lady?

642
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,550
You don't know what it's like
to hunt the future.

643
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:31,310
You've taken spice. Too much.

644
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:36,670
My brother needs me, Duncan,
and my vision is incomplete.

645
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,070
I need to remember.
I need to remember the future.

646
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,190
- I'm going to summon doctors.
- No. No.

647
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,990
Don't leave me.
I just need to-

648
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,750
just to-

649
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,110
I can't move.

650
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,470
What are you doing to me?

651
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,550
I am playing.
You were made to be played.

652
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,670
Like Othyem. Poor fellow.

653
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,030
Had a terrific struggle with you.

654
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:19,630
The flesh did not want
to come back.

655
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,150
- You are Tleilaxu.
- Born and bred... in the same tank.

656
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,790
Just we two... in the same tank.

657
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:31,230
First me, then you- then you.

658
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,190
You're trying
to bring out the violence in me.

659
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,150
Oh, no. Not yet.

660
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:43,190
The script is written,
but the stage is not set.

661
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,950
But one day soon,
the emperor will come to you...

662
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:54,070
a mask of grief
obscuring his face.

663
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,510
And he'll say, "She's gone.
She is gone. "

664
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,470
And then you will finally
know what you're expected to do.

665
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:14,110
- She is gone.
- She is gone, Duncan.

666
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:18,870
Now it's time to forget what
you remember when day becomes night.

667
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,870
Forgetting is not having
till the words are right

668
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,350
What do you see with those eyes?

669
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,350
What everyone sees.

670
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,950
We're leaving for the sietch
this morning.

671
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,910
- And I'll be left behind.
- Appropriate, I'd say...

672
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,390
considering what you've done.

673
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:37,150
I never meant to hurt Chani
or you.

674
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,710
I just-

675
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,350
I've given orders
no harm is to come to you...

676
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,950
no matter what happens.

677
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,190
- Is she-
- She's well...

678
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,230
for the moment.

679
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,390
I've been cruel to you, Irulan.

680
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:12,070
- I don't want your pity.
- I'm offering none.

681
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,350
Simply telling you the truth.

682
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,910
You were destined, conditioned.

683
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,310
I understand only too well.

684
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,790
Destined to be used.

685
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,590
- By you?
- By your father. By the Bene Gesserit.

686
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,310
By the Spacing Guild.
To protect them from me.

687
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:43,950
And they'll get their wish,
though not exactly as they'd like it.

688
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,510
I don't understand.

689
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:54,070
The time of plots and revenge
is coming to an end.

690
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,870
You must have a chance
to find peace.

691
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:02,350
I'm gonna give you that chance.

692
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,750
It's ironic.

693
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:08,390
Your selfish, clumsy attempts
to mother an imperial heir...

694
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,430
actually prolonged Chani's life.

695
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:16,150
And for that, I'm grateful.
Forever.

696
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:47,390
Muad'dib, is it truly necessary
to bring the face dancer and the dwarf-

697
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:51,710
They have their parts to play, Stil,
just like you and me.

698
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:01,150
- Chani and I will take this one.
- Muad'dib-

699
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:04,110
I know the way better
than anyone else, Stil...

700
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,910
except, perhaps, you.

701
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:08,830
You must remain here,
as we agreed.

702
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,270
Time to settle accounts.

703
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,990
- Stay where you are.
- What's the meaning of this?

704
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:09,270
You plotted
against Muad'dib, Korba.

705
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,830
You conspired against your emperor.
You're under arrest for treason.

706
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:21,310
I am a Fremen. I demand
to be judged by Fremen law.

707
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,230
You will be, Korba. You will be.

708
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:49,230
I used to hunt these here
when I was little.

709
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:54,670
It's amazing, the simple pleasures
one has as a child.

710
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:03,510
But the desert is leaving now,
taking simple pleasure with it.

711
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:10,390
I wonder if my father would approve
of the future he inspired.

712
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:14,270
A storm comes, my lady.

713
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,870
I am a desert creature, ghola.

714
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:19,390
I know when to hide.

715
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,790
Paul said he would join you as soon
as the naib council is concluded.

716
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:36,390
You called him Paul,
his Atreides name.

717
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:42,670
I did. A memory intruded
where none should have been.

718
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:47,270
Then there are more.
And it frightens you.

719
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,270
Duncan's memories.
They scare you.

720
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:56,550
Are they Duncan's memories
or the inventions of those who made me?

721
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:03,590
When the moment comes to decide,
you will know.

722
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,430
My lady.

723
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,830
It was the birth, my lord. They said
her body was drained by the speed of it.

724
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:14,630
These are your children, Muad'dib.
Both are alive and strong.

725
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:18,110
- "Children"?
- Twins, my lord.

726
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:20,830
A boy and a girl.

727
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,590
I never saw children.

728
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,470
Beloved.

729
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,070
Forgive me.

730
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:41,430
There are some things
no one can bear...

731
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:49,230
problems in this universe
for which there are no answers...

732
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,310
for which nothing can be done,
nothing.

733
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,750
I am sorry.

734
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,910
Nothing in this universe...

735
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:12,910
is as great...

736
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,350
as my love for you.

737
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,270
I can't see.

738
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,350
My lord? My lord!

739
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,950
She's gone.

740
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:01,070
She is gone, Duncan.
She is gone, Duncan.

741
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:12,030
Then you will finally know
what you are expected to do.

742
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:20,750
You're expected to do.

743
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,270
This was the moment
you came back to me, Duncan.

744
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:43,110
Stay where you are, both of you.

745
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:47,670
I warn you. A face dancer can move
faster than you can possibly imagine.

746
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:55,350
So, it is truly you.

747
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,070
Duncan Idaho of the Atreides.

748
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:01,030
A ghola can regain his past.

749
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:06,030
Tell me.
What do you remember?

750
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:11,870
- Tell him.
- Everything. My childhood.

751
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:15,030
My youth. My death.

752
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:21,470
We did it. We did it. Majesty,
don't you see what this means?

753
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:24,750
You can have her back again,
your beloved Chani.

754
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:26,950
The proof is standing right
in front of you.

755
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:31,070
We can restore the flesh
and the spirit. We can recreate her.

756
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,230
This was your plan all along.

757
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:36,230
Plots within plots, my lord.
You should know this better than anyone.

758
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:39,390
We've been trying for decades
to achieve this.

759
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,750
Make an alliance with us,
Muad'dib, the Tleilaxu.

760
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:47,390
Let us restore your beloved Chani.

761
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:51,550
Live content and safe
for the rest of your life...

762
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,990
with her, with your children.

763
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,670
With her, with your children.

764
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:04,310
My lord, please don't
listen to this blasphemy.

765
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:06,390
Don't move, Duncan Idaho.

766
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:09,190
You kill me, and you're
killing Muad'dib's children.

767
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:14,710
You can feel it, can't you, Muad'dib?

768
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:21,150
Can't you?
You can hear her.

769
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:25,550
- I'm afraid, Muad'dib.
- Calling your name.

770
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:38,510
Father. Don't be afraid, Father.

771
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,830
I'm here, Father,
as you knew I would be.

772
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:43,950
We go forward. We go back.
Don't be afraid.

773
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:48,190
We're pre-born, my sister and I,
thanks to our mother and the spice.

774
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:51,990
Thanks to you.
Father, yes, it is me.

775
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:55,990
We go forward. We go back.

776
01:18:56,070 --> 01:19:00,230
We are pre-born, my sister and I,
thanks to you.

777
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:04,270
My eyes. Let me see for you.

778
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:07,230
I can do it.
I can bring her back to you.

779
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,150
Use my eyes, Father.
Use my eyes.

780
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:12,550
My eyes. Let me see for you.
Let me see for you.

781
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,870
- Use them.
- I can do it.

782
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:19,310
I can bring her back.
Let us give you back your love.

783
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:44,350
- The children! The children!
- They are safe, Muad'dib.

784
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:57,390
I meddled in the future,
in all possible futures...

785
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,790
trying to create them.

786
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:08,350
Instead, they created me,
and I became trapped by it.

787
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,390
Yes, but knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

788
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:15,310
The first step
along the Golden Path.

789
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:20,470
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer is right in front of you.

790
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:35,230
Finally, I am free.

791
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:49,470
History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.

792
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:55,071
Resync by CODYBOSS1969

793
01:20:55,590 --> 01:21:00,550
Those who wished an end
to House Atreides have failed.

794
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:06,070
No longer an emperor,
no longer a god...

795
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:11,070
a simple blind Fremen wanders alone
into the desert to die.

796
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:16,110
They say he has gone on a journey...

797
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,030
into the land where men walk
without footprints.

798
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,470
He will not be found...

799
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,030
yet all men will find him.

800
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,830
I wonder if that's what he wanted.

801
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:43,990
I need you, Duncan,
more than ever.

802
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,310
Stay with me.

803
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:37,470
Muad'dib is gone,
but his children remain...

804
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:40,510
and conspiracies continue to breed.

805
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,150
The saga of Dune is far from over.

1
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:18,982
<i>History is written
on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

2
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:21,676
<i>Muad'Dib is gone...</i>

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,239
<i>but his children remain--</i>

4
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,681
<i>almost grown...</i>

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,739
<i>and about to face the consequences
of their father's legacy...</i>

6
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:37,648
<i>a legacy fiercely guarded
by their aunt, Alia...</i>

7
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:43,446
<i>even as she struggles with the ominous
destiny of her own birthright.</i>

8
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:26,215
Here I am.
Here I remain.

9
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,876
The Golden Path.

10
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:32,845
The path I couldn't take.

11
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,313
It's up to you now, my son.

12
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:41,215
The Golden Path is dangerous, son.

13
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,344
<i>Leto.</i>

14
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:11,017
I was hoping to see a worm.

15
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,812
You know they never come
close enough to see anymore.

16
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:16,044
The water has driven them away.

17
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,810
Everything's changing, Ghani.

18
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:25,543
Changing too fast.

19
00:02:25,618 --> 00:02:28,312
You've had another vision,
haven't you?

20
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:38,216
My skin wasn't my own.

21
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:40,615
I was running across the desert
just so fast...

22
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:44,140
just running and running...

23
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,515
to Jacarutu.

24
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:50,575
I saw him there again,
our father.

25
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:53,311
- You sure it was him?
- Yes.

26
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,184
And he spoke of the Golden Path.

27
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,112
It frightens me.

28
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:02,980
I'm afraid of what it could mean
about us.

29
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:06,678
- We're not like Alia, Ghani.
- Are you sure?

30
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:16,478
Will you tell our grandmother all this
when we see her?

31
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:20,450
I don't know.
What do you think?

32
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,077
It might be wise
to understand her a bit better...

33
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,710
before we allow her
to understand us.

34
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,976
They've come for us.

35
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,042
Haven't they, Irulan?

36
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,417
I expect you both to be
courteous and respectful.

37
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,008
None of your sly comments.
She's a Bene Gesserit...

38
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,881
and she'll know if you're
keeping things from her.

39
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:00,385
Why should we
keep anything from her?

40
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:03,351
Do we have anything worth keeping?

41
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,908
That's what I mean, Leto.

42
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,679
Stilgar and I are almost
at our limits with your wit.

43
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,013
Worm sign.

44
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,408
I didn't see anything.

45
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,943
Perhaps a slightly higher altitude
would be advisable, Leto.

46
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,247
My father used to love being this close
to the ground when he flew.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,877
And you, of course,
know this intuitively, don't you?

48
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:40,511
Just like how you knew to fly
without any training.

49
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,451
Don't forget your Bene Gesserit
training, Stepmother.

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,281
Fear is the mind killer.

51
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,717
I'm afraid she's about
to let it pass through her.

52
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,111
It's beautiful.

53
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:31,382
Simply beautiful.

54
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:46,779
Have we gone too far?
Have we forgotten?

55
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:28,211
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless his coming and his going.

56
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,609
May his passing cleanse the world.
May he keep the world for his people.

57
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:37,017
- Ba-Li-Kaifa.
- That wasn't funny.

58
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,077
Duncan!

59
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,280
Love!

60
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,480
You've taken
too much spice again.

61
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,714
I've opened a bottomless pit.

62
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,118
A swarm of locusts
is flying up to harass me.

63
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,314
Why can't I see, Duncan? Why?

64
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,251
See what?

65
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:50,152
The future.
My vision is incomplete.

66
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:55,746
The future. It's there, Duncan,
just out of reach.

67
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,845
Why am I always being pulled back?

68
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:01,786
Perhaps you should ask yourself
why is it necessary to see it.

69
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,617
- Don't patronize me.
- I don't patronize.

70
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:11,387
I care. That's all.

71
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:19,151
Why is she coming, Duncan?
Why now?

72
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,347
So that's it.

73
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:25,252
After all these years since she saw
her grandchildren on Caladan.

74
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,880
And in six months,
they will be of age.

75
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:30,786
Reason for me, Duncan.

76
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:33,720
Be my mentat for a moment,
not my husband.

77
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,119
No Bene Gesserit acts
without preordained plans...

78
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,886
without well-planned deceit.

79
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:46,217
And my mother, for all her independence,
is still a Bene Gesserit-Adept.

80
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:15,649
Clouds.

81
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:19,645
Moisture in the air.

82
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:22,882
- It seems almost a sacrilege.
- You sound like a Fremen.

83
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,787
I haven't forgotten the years
I spent among them.

84
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,652
I haven't forgotten
the honesty of their ways.

85
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:33,450
At times I wish
I'd never learned them.

86
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,552
I hate this planet, Gurney.
It took both the men I loved.

87
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:44,749
And it's still a place
of great danger, milady.

88
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:49,915
Rumors of assassination plots
are too numerous to ignore.

89
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:53,922
Stilgar has sent word
that even Fremen may be involved.

90
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:56,387
Desert partisans who blame you...

91
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,547
for Paul's interference
in the ecology of this planet.

92
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:01,714
I'm so weary of rumors.

93
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,054
They are the lifeblood of this empire,
I'm afraid.

94
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:11,452
Reason enough this trip
should have been delayed.

95
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,553
This way!

96
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,486
The tigers track the robes flawlessly.

97
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:24,954
Our friend Palimbasha
has done his job well.

98
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,489
It appears your patience
is about to be rewarded, milady.

99
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:30,785
Yes. I've waited many years, Tyek...

100
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,948
for just the right moment
to finish the Atreides.

101
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:37,217
Patience has been my only nourishment.

102
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,413
Our allies on Arrakis
continue to instigate civil unrest.

103
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,286
Alia's hold on power
is beginning to slip.

104
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:51,790
And now we have the means
to deal with Muad'Dib's twins.

105
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,756
- I hope milady is satisfied.
- Oh, I won't be satisfied...

106
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:57,289
until every bastard Atreides
is crushed...

107
00:12:57,357 --> 00:13:01,346
beneath the jackboots
of the Corrino Sardukar.

108
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,484
Like the desperate pacing of giant cats
in the zoos of ancient times.

109
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,523
I wouldn't know.

110
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:26,115
I'm not the scholar you are,
young prince.

111
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,554
Back and forth.

112
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:32,517
Back and forth until they made
themselves sick, just like this worm.

113
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,523
Just like my mother...

114
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:40,183
with her futile schemes
to regain power for the House Corrino.

115
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:44,446
Your mother is an ambitious woman,
my prince.

116
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:48,889
Her ambitions tend to be
undisturbed by reality, I'm afraid.

117
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,448
You don't share her desire to regain
your grandfather's throne for yourself?

118
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:57,389
Only a fool covets power without
appreciating its delicate uses...

119
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,390
or fearing its inherent perils.

120
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:05,322
The world of Shaddam the Fourth
remains only in crumbling history books.

121
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:09,585
We hate the empire that defeated it,
but have no idea what we'd like instead.

122
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:11,919
The kind of society we once had,
I assume.

123
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,321
My mother may believe that's possible,
Tyek, but I'm not so sure.

124
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,721
I'm just not so sure.

125
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:24,955
I heard about your little stunt
in the desert.

126
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,684
Well, I prefer to think of it
as expert flying, but carry on.

127
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,383
With your encouragement.

128
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,923
Our father's memories
are very instructive.

129
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,822
Well, I suppose I should be grateful
I don't have to tell your grandmother...

130
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,858
you were lost to a worm
before she was supposed to see you.

131
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:41,049
That would have been an unpleasant task,
wouldn't it?

132
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:44,090
It's rumored my mother has resumed
her allegiance to the Bene Gesserit...

133
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:47,613
and you both know what the Sisterhood
thinks of those of us who are pre-born.

134
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,055
And you want us to pretend
to be something we're not?

135
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,317
I expect you to protect yourselves.

136
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,517
No more talk of your father's memories
or his spirit or his animus.

137
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:59,285
Surely one can distinguish
between being pre-born--

138
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,018
And being possessed.

139
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:04,524
For some, that's a distinction without
a difference. For us, that's dangerous.

140
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,524
But what if she's coming as mother...

141
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:09,717
as grandmother,
and not as Bene Gesserit inquisitor?

142
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,656
You share her memories, Alia. Surely,
her motives can't be that complex.

143
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:18,090
If my mother wasn't that complex,
neither of you would be here.

144
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,023
She would never have
betrayed her training.

145
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,081
She never would have had a son.

146
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:27,919
I would have been her firstborn,
not your father.

147
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,554
And none of this
would have happened.

148
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,921
I warn you,
enemies often appear as angels.

149
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,386
I hope you two
can tell the difference.

150
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,419
We're going to lose her.

151
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,917
We already have.

152
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,924
You're nervous, aren't you?

153
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,981
Why should I be?

154
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,548
You haven't seen her for many years.

155
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:18,558
Your grandmother and I
had an unsettled relationship.

156
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,316
But you wanted her affection,
didn't you?

157
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:27,415
Affection wasn't possible
under the circumstances...

158
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:31,151
but I am due some respect
after all this time.

159
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,083
Stil, please.

160
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:48,057
When you first came here
many years ago...

161
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:52,183
Muad'Dib told me his father said...

162
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,657
"Beauty has finally arrived...

163
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,386
to hold back the wilderness."

164
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:04,516
In his honor, may I borrow
your duke's words today.

165
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,915
Good friend.

166
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:15,222
The imperial regent, my lady.

167
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,950
It's been so long.

168
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:11,424
Of course, you recognize
your grandchildren...

169
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,618
even after all this time.

170
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,483
I hope we can find time
to shed formality...

171
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,418
and get to know each other again.

172
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:39,119
The mother of Muad'Dib
has returned to us.

173
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,126
You must offer them
your blessing, Grandmother.

174
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:53,717
I see the hypocrisy of ritual
still thrives.

175
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,454
Sometimes it is necessary
to accommodate ritual--

176
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,118
In order to survive it.

177
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,090
Mother!

178
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,585
Reverend Mother.

179
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,784
I bring you a warning.

180
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:48,483
The blessings of Muad'Dib
have been corrupted.

181
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:54,323
The religion of Muad'Dib
is not Muad'Dib.

182
00:20:56,162 --> 00:21:02,061
He renounces it...
as he renounces you.

183
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,753
All of you!

184
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,126
Muad'Dib is dead!

185
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:19,295
And sand will cover this place.

186
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:26,623
Sand will cover you.

187
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:44,790
Take them alive! Alive!

188
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,495
Get out!

189
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,726
Jacarutu!

190
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:17,188
It's impossible to guard against every
madman willing to suicide himself.

191
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,194
We try to limit
Alia's public appearances.

192
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:21,228
Are we sure she was the target?

193
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,988
In these times, anyone in
the royal family could be vulnerable.

194
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:28,994
I seem to recall times not long ago
that were not so different.

195
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:34,051
- And we survived them.
- As we will survive them again.

196
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,956
I heard the voices in the crowd
calling out Muad'Dib.

197
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,688
We don't know where he's from
or what his motives are.

198
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:43,284
They say he calls himself
the Preacher.

199
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,795
The people think he's Paul,
don't they, Stil, this Preacher?

200
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:50,989
- Some do. Some need to.
- What do you think?

201
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:54,756
His kind are blown in from the desert
every day. Messianic vagabonds.

202
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:57,761
And Alia's priests tolerate such heresy?

203
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,590
Her priests would like to flay him alive
for the heresy he spews.

204
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,753
But she won't allow it.
"Oh," she says, "he's harmless."

205
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:07,125
It's because she thinks
it might be true, isn't it?

206
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:18,553
Well, we hope you'll be comfortable.
Let us know if you need anything.

207
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:26,289
Paul's gone, my lady.
He walked into the desert.

208
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,851
Blind. Alone.

209
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:32,656
Shai Hulud came for him.

210
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,661
He is gone.

211
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:42,520
I want to supervise the interrogation
of those we found on the street.

212
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:45,427
I'd like Gurney to go with you,
if that's agreeable.

213
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:48,257
- It would be my honor, Stilgar.
- And my pleasure.

214
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,357
This was their room.

215
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:53,462
Alia kept it exactly as they did.

216
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,621
We used to play here
when we were little.

217
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:59,720
It made us feel close to them.

218
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:04,519
For a moment, you almost imagined
that's who we were.

219
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:06,995
Didn't you?

220
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:12,860
You almost let yourself believe
that we were... father and mother.

221
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,090
It was not an unpleasant moment.

222
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,058
I've missed so much.

223
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,528
You've never been far from us,
Grandmother.

224
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:34,121
Your presence is always strong
within us both.

225
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:42,927
I thought we agreed
to let her rest first.

226
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:47,524
Seeing my grandchildren
is all the rest I need.

227
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:50,689
And there will be time enough
for our reunion, Grandmother.

228
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:53,696
Now is the time
for you and your daughter.

229
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:05,487
- They're complicated.
- Yes. What did you expect?

230
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,587
They're Paul's children.

231
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:11,653
He would be proud.

232
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,923
You've done well.

233
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:20,489
You look...

234
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:22,530
wonderful.

235
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,757
I try my best.

236
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:27,092
My people expect it.

237
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:33,629
The greening of the desert is proceeding
faster than I ever imagined.

238
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:37,255
Paul used to say
the only permanence is change.

239
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:41,286
I wasn't prepared for how much
the desert's retreating.

240
00:26:41,364 --> 00:26:44,524
Only the great mother wilderness
of the south remains untouched.

241
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:46,689
We still meet with some resistance.

242
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:48,593
As I've noticed.

243
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:51,222
Some of the older naibs
have withdrawn from our council...

244
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,695
and taken their tribes
to the far regions.

245
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:55,957
We're better off without them.

246
00:26:56,031 --> 00:27:00,588
- Some remain to attack you directly.
- We know how to deal with our enemies.

247
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:06,559
It must be so hard, the responsibility.

248
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,329
The loneliness.

249
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:16,194
- What can you know of loneliness?
- I've had my share.

250
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:19,425
Is that why you're here then,
'cause you're lonely?

251
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:23,260
I came to see my grandchildren,
to see you.

252
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:26,593
Don't try to conceal anything
from me, Mother.

253
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:31,754
I can read truth in the slightest tick
of human behavior.

254
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:35,286
This was your gift to me, remember?

255
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:39,797
It's in my blood. In my blood before
I was even born, thanks to you.

256
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:41,263
Don't interrupt me.

257
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:44,855
I am the regent of this empire.
I rule in Paul's name for his children.

258
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:49,125
I am the supreme authority here.
You abandoned me...

259
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,026
to fend for myself after Paul died.

260
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:56,226
I was only 15, Mother.

261
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:00,754
You had Stilgar. You had Duncan.
You had the Council of Naibs.

262
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:03,888
No one could challenge you.

263
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:06,056
You knew how I felt about this place.

264
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:10,587
And yet here you are,
after all these years, to judge me.

265
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:14,097
Just like that wicked
Bene Gesserit bitch who taught you.

266
00:28:14,165 --> 00:28:17,154
<i>- We were right to kill her.
- Abomination.</i>

267
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:21,597
Abomination.
That's what she called me.

268
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:29,697
- Alia, I can't undo the past.
- But I can influence the future.

269
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:33,527
Paul taught me that well enough.
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

270
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,429
You're afraid I have Paul's vision,
his power.

271
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:40,930
No, my darling.

272
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:52,625
I am afraid that you will get lost
trying to achieve it.

273
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,489
I hate you.

274
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:02,292
I love you.

275
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,559
I will never forgive you.

276
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:41,492
Blasphemers!

277
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,131
Idolaters!

278
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,590
You fool yourselves...

279
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:57,030
with images of things
you cannot possibly understand.

280
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,657
You cripple yourselves
with these toads...

281
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,324
of ritual and ceremony.

282
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,092
They give you only fear.

283
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,598
And in return...

284
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,424
you give them obedience.

285
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,064
But I give you a warning.

286
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:23,759
Those who accept self-deception...

287
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:28,356
shall perish by that self-deception.

288
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,797
And those who pray for dew
at the desert's edge...

289
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,623
shall bring forth the deluge.

290
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,526
Milady.

291
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,795
Don't torture yourself.
He's mad.

292
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:03,323
He's a mere thunderclap in the night,
startling for a moment, then gone.

293
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,631
And if I asked you to kill him,
would you?

294
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,689
I wouldn't hesitate.

295
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,760
But I would advise against it.

296
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:21,422
I'd say it's not time
to move against the Preacher yet.

297
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,557
<i>- Listen to him, darling.
- Let him gain some currency.</i>

298
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,361
<i>- He's so handsome, isn't he?
- Let our enemies rally to his ideas.</i>

299
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:30,797
The man has flaws.

300
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,425
When the time is right,
they can be used to discredit him.

301
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,557
<i>Just what the doctor ordered.</i>

302
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:39,691
Better he is disgraced than martyred.

303
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:44,824
You're always good medicine
for my distress, Javid.

304
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,991
Whatever the cause
of that distress, milady.

305
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,994
Reverend Mother.

306
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:22,164
- They told me I might find you here.
- I was afraid it might be gone.

307
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:26,963
Paul-- Muad'Dib
would never have permitted that.

308
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:29,000
He said your promise
to the old housekeeper Mapes...

309
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:31,432
would never be broken.

310
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,892
It seems a little silly now though,
doesn't it?

311
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:41,594
Considering the changes
that are everywhere.

312
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:47,498
People don't come to visit like they
used to, but still, it remains a symbol.

313
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:52,626
Symbolism is everywhere these days,
just like these weeds.

314
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,033
I'm truly happy to see you, Irulan.

315
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:03,864
Your devotion to my grandchildren
has been a comfort to me.

316
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,730
They are the source of my happiness.

317
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:10,097
And your occasional
exasperation, I hear.

318
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,691
They are... strong-willed.

319
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:16,666
As I would have expected,
considering.

320
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:20,132
And what else did you expect,
Reverend Mother...

321
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:23,361
considering?

322
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:26,265
I am-- was a Bene Gesserit...

323
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,528
trained just as you were.

324
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:33,160
I know the Sisterhood has never lost
interest in the children's bloodlines.

325
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:36,360
Although they would never confide
as much to a defector like me.

326
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,100
Isn't it ironic, Irulan?

327
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:42,999
We're both Bene Gesserits...

328
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:47,660
who've deserted our sisterhood
for the same reason--

329
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:49,394
love.

330
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:53,696
Love of men who are now dead.

331
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:57,098
I did love your son, Jessica.

332
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:00,363
And I would have made him a good wife.

333
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:04,368
Instead I have satisfied myself
being a good teacher to his children.

334
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,867
And friend.

335
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,865
Nothing--

336
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:14,799
Nothing will harm them as long as
I can prevent it. Do you understand?

337
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:28,661
I don't know.

338
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,929
Perhaps it would be better
if I never became emperor.

339
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:37,791
I'm being selfish, I know.

340
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,563
But I think it's necessary
for me and Ghanima...

341
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:45,462
to have the freedom
to learn to live with what we are.

342
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,001
And what are you, Leto...

343
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:51,797
that you need this time
to find out about yourself?

344
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,792
Why don't you tell me?
That's why you're here, isn't it?

345
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:03,425
You remind me of your father.

346
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,024
And my grandfather?

347
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:12,260
My namesake.
Your beloved duke.

348
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:17,196
Such an admission would be
complicated, wouldn't it?

349
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:21,032
We may have to enter a realm of
intimacies that would make us both...

350
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:23,762
uncomfortable.

351
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:28,463
In a way, I find it reassuring...

352
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:32,029
that he lives on in you.

353
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:35,894
How little you understand
how he lives on in me.

354
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,435
Is that what you're struggling with?

355
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,226
Yes.

356
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:52,701
To know the future is to be
trapped by it, Grandmother.

357
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,031
My father knew it,
but he couldn't escape it.

358
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:03,261
I want more freedom than that.

359
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:06,531
A universe of surprises.
That is what I pray for.

360
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:10,592
Is such a universe possible
for someone like you?

361
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:13,465
Possible? Yes.

362
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,359
But is it desirable?

363
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,633
I have a difficult decision to make,
Grandmother.

364
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:28,102
Do I accept the Atreides mystique?

365
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,227
Dress myself in our myths?

366
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:35,631
Live for my subjects
and die for them...

367
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,192
or do I chose another path?

368
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,532
A Golden Path.

369
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:45,195
One that may change me,
change human destiny forever?

370
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,600
I don't understand.

371
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,625
No, I know you don't because
you do not understand time.

372
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,863
I can help you.

373
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,969
On the contrary, Grandmother.

374
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:02,969
It is I who will help you.

375
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:29,662
We must work together.

376
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:32,203
- We?
- Otherwise we're vulnerable.

377
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,896
- To what?
- Oh, stop being coy.

378
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:39,368
If you want to know how coy he is,
try playing this game with him.

379
00:38:44,704 --> 00:38:49,568
This is not a game! Powerful forces
are conspiring against us.

380
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:53,626
Fremen rebels hate the way I'm cha--
we are changing their planet.

381
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:57,262
The damn Spacing Guild
can't tolerate our monopoly on spice.

382
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:59,803
They have no choice
but to accept it, Alia.

383
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:04,963
And now she is here.
I want to know what she wants.

384
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:08,799
No, Alia. What you want is for us
to engage in the spice trance.

385
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:13,759
Don't turn your backs
on your heritage.

386
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:16,894
Your father was
the greatest man in history.

387
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:21,063
He gave you such wonderful talents
that could be put to such great use.

388
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:25,297
- Why won't you use them?
- You want us to see things you cannot.

389
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:28,337
I need you to help me see.

390
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:31,529
To see the future.

391
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:36,128
Other lives hover in the enigma
of our consciousness, Alia.

392
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,996
Shared lives.

393
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:47,526
It's the curse of all pre-born.

394
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:49,730
They are the real danger.

395
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,499
Not the rebels, not the Guild,
not our grandmother.

396
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,765
You should understand that
better than most.

397
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:04,335
One day...

398
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,427
each of you...

399
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,937
will come face to face
with the horror of your own existence.

400
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:13,903
One day you will cry out for help.

401
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:18,461
One day each of you
will find yourself...

402
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:22,966
alone.

403
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,495
What if she's right?

404
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:38,898
Check.

405
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:50,470
<i>Alia, come back. Alia!</i>

406
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:59,769
<i>Stop it.
Alia, listen to me.</i>

407
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,701
<i>No. Listen to me, Alia!</i>

408
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:22,501
<i>All of you, out! Do as I say!
Leave her alone!</i>

409
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:25,504
<i>Get out of here!
Leave her to me!</i>

410
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,838
So, Granddaughter...

411
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:33,395
you finally meet a spiritual gom jabbar.

412
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,968
<i>We've learned much these past few days.</i>

413
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:42,300
<i>It was meant to look like rebel Fremen.</i>

414
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:47,464
Tribes harboring resentment towards
the Atreides and changes to Arrakis.

415
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,630
- But I don't believe it.
- Why?

416
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:54,234
During interrogation,
the ones we captured...

417
00:41:54,305 --> 00:42:00,101
cried out the name Jacarutu
and then... died.

418
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:04,571
- You tortured them?
- Post-hypnotic suicide compulsion.

419
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,571
The sound of the word alone
simply stopped their hearts.

420
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,696
Leto and I heard rumors of
Jacarutu Sietch when we first came here.

421
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:15,294
We could never find out
whether the place actually existed.

422
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:19,236
The name Jacarutu
is a synonym for evil, Jessica.

423
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:24,068
The Edwali tribe came from there.
They were water stealers.

424
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:28,638
<i>The most heinous criminals
under Fremen law.</i>

425
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:31,831
<i>The first and greatest sin.</i>

426
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:42,296
But the Fremen tribes banded together
to declare war on the Jacarutu.

427
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,971
The Edwali were slaughtered.

428
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,937
Their water spread upon the sands.

429
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:57,404
Jacarutu Sietch was declared taboo.

430
00:42:57,473 --> 00:43:00,564
No Fremen was allowed to look for it.

431
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,731
But legend persists that
not all the Edwali were wiped out...

432
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:10,364
that some escaped to become known
as the Cast Out.

433
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,634
And you believe that these Cast Out...

434
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:16,537
might be responsible
for what happened the other day?

435
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,630
The possibility
makes my blood run cold.

436
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:26,298
If the Cast Out exist, they would
camouflage themselves as something else.

437
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:30,100
We would not permit them
to live if we knew.

438
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:34,969
Gurney, contact your old smuggler
allies, the ones in the deep desert.

439
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,870
See what they know about Jacarutu...

440
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:42,064
and the Cast Out.

441
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:46,435
If such a people still exist,
they could be our greatest threat.

442
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:51,698
I had full consciousness
long before birth.

443
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,032
Knowledge of all the lives
that came before.

444
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:03,870
The genetic rivers
flowing in my veins.

445
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,099
Reverend Mothers.

446
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:12,069
The Atreides.

447
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:17,336
My entire heritage...

448
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:21,930
alive... in me.

449
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,140
Ever present.

450
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,164
I had no defense against
their invasion of my mind.

451
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:38,798
<i>And so you are stalked by fear.</i>

452
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:41,806
Fear.

453
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:45,432
Always fear...

454
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:47,995
of judgement.

455
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:52,802
The pre-born are possessed.

456
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:55,170
The abomination.

457
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:58,435
Bene Gesserit rubbish.

458
00:44:58,507 --> 00:45:02,996
If you succumb to the fear,
it will defeat you.

459
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:07,131
The trial of abomination
ends in death.

460
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:12,299
But we won't let that happen, will we?

461
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,306
We? You're dead!

462
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,632
I killed you.

463
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,663
Yes, you clever little minx,
you killed me and yet...

464
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:24,263
here I am.

465
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:27,102
Go away. Just go away!

466
00:45:27,174 --> 00:45:29,640
Oh, but you need help,
Granddaughter.

467
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:33,640
The others in here,
they want your entire consciousness.

468
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:37,765
They want to drive you out, but I only
want a tiny little corner for myself...

469
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:39,773
an occasional moment with your senses.

470
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,364
Yeah. An occasional taste.
An occasional touch.

471
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,600
Oh, no one need ever know.

472
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:50,265
No! You murdered my father.

473
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:53,205
You tried to destroy my family.
You would have killed Paul.

474
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:57,502
Oh, yes, yes. All that, yes.
Of course I would have killed you.

475
00:45:57,574 --> 00:46:01,768
I mean, you and your brother stood
in my way, but that's old business.

476
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:07,103
You won. I am dead.
Thanks to you, my darling...

477
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:11,130
I have only a fragile existence,
a mere memory self within you.

478
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:15,435
You are alive,
and I am yours to command.

479
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:18,940
And how little I ask in return.

480
00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:31,865
Mine?

481
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,473
To command?

482
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:40,871
Oh, yes. Yours.
Yours, my precious girl.

483
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,566
Think of what we can
accomplish together.

484
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,903
Your power and my experience.

485
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:50,066
There will be nothing
standing in our way.

486
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,629
- The voices in my head?
- Will be silenced.

487
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,141
- My enemies?
- Will be destroyed.

488
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:01,038
No one will stand in the way
of our powers.

489
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:06,870
From this moment on,
the future... is ours.

490
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:37,341
It comes...
just like you summoned it.

491
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:39,931
No. It summoned me, Stil.

492
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:46,539
And may I ask why
we risked a sand-crossing...

493
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:51,906
- at night without bodyguards?
- Come, come, Stil.

494
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:55,430
How often do you ride
the sands anymore...

495
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:57,974
when you want, where you want...

496
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,607
calling a worm instead of riding
with a flock of thopters?

497
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:05,164
How often--

498
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:09,299
How often do you arm the thumper
and just go...

499
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:12,069
like the Fremen you used to be?

500
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:17,070
Used to be?

501
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:23,402
Do you know
in many corners of the universe...

502
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:27,805
this delicate thing...

503
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,309
is considered a wondrous beauty?

504
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,671
But here--

505
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,935
here it's a symbol...

506
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,736
a symbol of the corruption
infecting Arrakis...

507
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:42,605
that wouldn't exist but for the changes
we're enforcing on this place.

508
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:45,869
Changes inspired by your father.

509
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:50,466
Now that's the official Stilgar
speaking, the government Stilgar.

510
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:54,941
The Fremen Stilgar is still repulsed
at this alien life, isn't he?

511
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:02,603
- I have a serious problem, Stil.
- So I've gathered.

512
00:49:04,176 --> 00:49:10,109
The problem with me
is the problem with this place.

513
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:13,869
My father, he--
he left so many things undone.

514
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:16,570
I don't understand.

515
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:23,298
A good ruler doesn't need to be
a prophet, Stil, not even god-like.

516
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:27,775
A good ruler has to be
sensitive to the ones he rules.

517
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:36,406
The ancient meaning of the Fremen word
"naib" is "servant of the sietch."

518
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,606
When the owner dies,
the chrysknife dissolves, yes?

519
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:45,141
It is our legend.

520
00:49:47,343 --> 00:49:50,969
Muad'Dib has dissolved,
but his chrysknife has not.

521
00:49:53,276 --> 00:49:57,504
Stil, a new path must be taken...

522
00:49:57,576 --> 00:50:01,770
one that may require me
to demystify my own father.

523
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,138
To destroy his legacy.

524
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:11,300
These are not sentiments
I'd share with your aunt...

525
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,604
or her priests, young lord.

526
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:17,200
Beware Alia, Stil.

527
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:19,640
She's no longer your friend.

528
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,741
And, Stil...

529
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,935
you must promise
to protect Ghanima.

530
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:29,100
If anything should happen to me--
anything--

531
00:50:29,177 --> 00:50:31,608
my sister will be your only hope.

532
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:51,968
You were in the desert.

533
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,634
Yes. I-- I couldn't sleep.

534
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,142
I could have kept you company.

535
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,643
You were sleeping.
I didn't want to disturb you.

536
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:08,302
You used to. All the time.

537
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:12,503
We'd sneak out of the sietch together.
No one ever knew.

538
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:16,339
Sometimes we wouldn't
be back till dawn.

539
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,774
I had to talk to Stilgar.

540
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:21,207
Oh. I see.

541
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:28,440
Ghanima, we may have to face
some of what's coming apart.

542
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,998
That doesn't mean
you have to face it alone.

543
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:49,100
The Atreides man
named Gurney Halleck...

544
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:53,473
is being sent to the desert
to ask questions.

545
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:57,909
Sooner or later, he will encounter
someone who can be bought.

546
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:00,500
Then we must make sure
he buys the right answers.

547
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:03,600
What shall I do
with the blind fool, Father?

548
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:06,575
He can still be useful.

549
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:12,043
Take him into the desert
until we need his sermons again.

550
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:15,406
Out of chaos comes civil war.

551
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:18,910
Fremen and Atreides
destroying each other.

552
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:23,070
The water of our enemies
will feed our revenge.

553
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:27,008
Our suffering will be repaid
a thousandfold.

554
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:33,643
Jacarutu.

555
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:01,807
I should never have left here.

556
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,743
It was a cowardly thing to do.

557
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:07,902
You lost so much here.

558
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,843
I know it.
Leto knows it.

559
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:14,105
Even Alia must know it, in a way.

560
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:20,743
It helps, doesn't it?

561
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:23,369
The Litany Against Fear.

562
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:28,833
You were thinking it, weren't you?

563
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:32,036
Fear is the mind killer.

564
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,568
Ghani, I've decided
I want you to know my fear.

565
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,100
Fear I've kept hidden too long.

566
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:58,303
I fear for those who are pre-born.

567
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:01,469
Just before we came to Arrakis
the first time...

568
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:05,637
I brought a Reverend Mother
to meet your father.

569
00:54:05,712 --> 00:54:09,008
- He was just a boy.
- I remem--

570
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,238
I've been told.

571
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:19,707
The Reverend Mother brought a nerve
induction box, tested Paul with it.

572
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:22,040
I was forbidden to interfere.

573
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:26,168
He might have died.

574
00:54:29,412 --> 00:54:31,344
But he survived.

575
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,638
Of course, you remember this
in a way that I cannot.

576
00:54:40,979 --> 00:54:43,502
Then that's what your fear is.

577
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:48,236
The memories I've inherited.
The possibility of possession.

578
00:54:48,312 --> 00:54:51,142
The possibility of abomination.

579
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,372
Not you.

580
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:01,344
I'm sure of that now.

581
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:03,900
But you're not sure about Leto.

582
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:06,070
Is he strong enough, Ghani?

583
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:10,703
Leto? Can he survive
what's coming?

584
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:14,575
- What is it that's coming?
- The Sacr-Nabai.

585
00:55:18,946 --> 00:55:21,070
The Golden Path.

586
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:24,976
Leto used those words
when he and I were together.

587
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:28,808
He has visions...

588
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,710
of a pilgrimage
deep into the desert...

589
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:35,939
a journey to a faraway place...

590
00:55:36,013 --> 00:55:38,945
where he sees our father...

591
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:43,545
and speaks to him
of how things must change.

592
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:46,102
Change?

593
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,975
How?

594
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,602
He can't tell me.

595
00:55:55,379 --> 00:55:58,039
I think he's holding things
back from me.

596
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:02,545
But I know this: It's not possession,
and it is not abomination.

597
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:06,874
And when it is my brother's turn
to be tested...

598
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:10,571
he too will survive...

599
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:13,578
just as our father did.

600
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:19,540
The man has arrived to take you
deeper into the desert.

601
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:24,606
He says he will help you find
what you're looking for.

602
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,406
So now it has been decided
We'll go into the desert.

603
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:39,075
So you are the Atreides man,
Gurney Halleck.

604
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:43,475
I don't like it.

605
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:47,274
Why would the Corrino family
send gifts to Muad'Dib's children?

606
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:51,211
An attempt to curry favor with
the future emperor and his sister.

607
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,610
You don't believe that
any more than I do, Duncan.

608
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,135
Nothing is ever as it seems
with my sister.

609
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:03,270
Even an innocent gift of clothing
can be dangerous.

610
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,107
But how?

611
00:57:08,113 --> 00:57:10,773
I want these examined thoroughly.

612
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:15,677
Report back to me before they're given
to the children. Is that understood?

613
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:24,837
I can feel your suspicion, Duncan.

614
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:28,311
You're wondering if there is
something more complex in my motives.

615
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,210
The history of what brought a Corrino
princess into House Atreides...

616
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,871
is not easily forgotten.

617
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:37,038
Plans within plans,
is that it, mentat?

618
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,375
Do you doubt my allegiance
to this family?

619
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:46,243
Allegiances once changed
can change again.

620
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:13,139
Our sources in the palace assure me...

621
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:15,907
the robes were delivered.

622
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:17,674
The catalyst is well-hidden.

623
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:21,209
Little, precious Irulan
will never find them.

624
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,543
Well done.

625
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:26,547
Alia's paranoia is growing
stronger day by day.

626
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:29,342
She sees enemies everywhere.

627
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:31,073
And her only solution--

628
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:32,874
more and more repression.

629
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:35,140
Exactly as we want.

630
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:38,339
The more terror we sow,
the more fear and confusion we harvest.

631
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,403
The more severely Alia responds...

632
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:43,174
the more Fremen
she drives into the south...

633
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:46,373
the sooner they will openly rebel.

634
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:48,107
And then with the twins
out of the way...

635
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:50,704
Alia will be more vulnerable than ever.

636
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:57,170
But we mustn't let Farad'n know
about our plans until they're done.

637
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:00,237
He doesn't have the stomach for it.

638
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:04,742
How dare you?

639
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:09,110
These robes are gifts from
Prince Farad'n. A gesture of goodwill.

640
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:11,976
An opportunity to ease
tension between the houses.

641
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:14,513
Javid arranged for this himself.

642
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:16,843
With the regent's approval, of course.

643
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:18,938
I had to satisfy myself.

644
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:21,071
Satisfy yourself?

645
00:59:21,147 --> 00:59:24,341
That there was
no subterfuge, no danger.

646
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:26,607
You insinuated yourself
into a diplomatic matter...

647
00:59:26,681 --> 00:59:28,909
that's none of your business.

648
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,413
The safety of the twins
is every bit my business.

649
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:33,141
You bloodless bitch.

650
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:37,073
How is it that I'm blessed with such an
extraordinary counselor as you, Irulan?

651
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:41,747
What devious finger of fate
turned you from a Corrino toad...

652
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:43,474
into a simpering Atreides
sycophant?

653
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:45,174
That's enough!

654
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,238
No, it's not nearly enough.

655
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:51,406
From now on, my niece and nephew
are no longer under your care.

656
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:55,175
- You can't do that.
- I am the regent of the empire.

657
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:57,078
I'm their guardian.
I rule in their name.

658
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:02,644
<i>That's right.
And don't let them forget it.</i>

659
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:13,978
Perhaps you should rest.

660
01:00:15,082 --> 01:00:18,105
How can I rest, Mother, when I'm
surrounded by such incompetent fools?

661
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:22,670
Do you see what's become
of my world, Mother?

662
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:24,976
Do you see the chaos I must endure?

663
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,408
Yes, I see it.

664
01:00:29,482 --> 01:00:31,743
I'm afraid I see it all too clearly.

665
01:00:31,815 --> 01:00:34,441
<i>- Get rid of them.
- Get out.</i>

666
01:00:34,515 --> 01:00:35,572
All of you, out.

667
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:40,341
Come.

668
01:00:59,982 --> 01:01:03,244
<i>Still the same arrogant
Bene Gesserit cow.</i>

669
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:21,147
You must forgive my daughter, Irulan.

670
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:24,511
She let temper get in the way
of judgment this afternoon.

671
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:27,605
She let her words run away with her.

672
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:31,248
Do not concern yourself with me.

673
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:33,747
I know what it's like to be in her place.

674
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:37,010
I know how lonely it can be sometimes.

675
01:01:38,682 --> 01:01:40,114
I understand.

676
01:01:40,183 --> 01:01:42,512
At the same time, you're never alone.

677
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:45,844
There are always people who need you.

678
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:48,473
Life in a court can be suffocating.

679
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:50,412
Easy to lose your perspective.

680
01:01:50,482 --> 01:01:54,245
I'm glad we can be honest.

681
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:56,145
I feel that I can trust you.

682
01:01:56,216 --> 01:02:00,205
My only concern is for their safety.

683
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:04,046
Take care of your own well-being.

684
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,844
Thank you for your concern.

685
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:10,382
You're very important to me.

686
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:15,779
I will let Alia know that I bear no ill
feelings because of her harsh words.

687
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:19,077
You're very understanding.

688
01:03:14,516 --> 01:03:17,676
There they are. Those two.

689
01:03:19,516 --> 01:03:21,914
Can you see them?

690
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,944
We have a shuttle waiting.

691
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,577
Leto, come.

692
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,110
Hurry.

693
01:03:50,984 --> 01:03:53,973
Anybody who had a hand in helping
the twins get out of the city...

694
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,515
must be arrested and brought to me.

695
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,311
I will make an example
of all who defy me.

696
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:01,077
Get out!

697
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:13,779
This is my mother's doing.

698
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,713
I want her dead.

699
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,741
<i>- Now.
- No, my dear. Not just yet.</i>

700
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:23,772
<i>Patience, my dear.
Patience and calm.</i>

701
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:28,010
That is the palliative
for fury and despair.

702
01:04:28,084 --> 01:04:30,107
Everyone is turning against me.

703
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:32,945
Oh, don't worry, child.

704
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:38,575
There are many clever ways to rid
oneself of a troublesome witch.

705
01:04:39,984 --> 01:04:43,075
Your efforts to the contrary, I suppose.

706
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,946
Well, unfortunately, my efforts
were, shall we say, interrupted...

707
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:52,416
by a wonderfully devious
and cruel little girl.

708
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:55,315
You took great pleasure
in the act, as I recall.

709
01:04:55,384 --> 01:04:57,350
I had to admire your ruthlessness.

710
01:04:57,417 --> 01:04:59,315
Had you only been a few years older--

711
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:02,544
Why am I even listening to you,
you perverted old fool?

712
01:05:02,618 --> 01:05:07,550
Because I am here to help you.
Because I'm the only one you can trust.

713
01:05:08,584 --> 01:05:12,676
What you must do
is take care of your mother in public.

714
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,949
Why don't you call in that lovely boy?

715
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,810
The priest.

716
01:05:19,885 --> 01:05:21,544
Javid, eh?

717
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:25,210
Mix business with pleasure perhaps?

718
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:43,639
<i>You were right, Muriz.</i>

719
01:05:43,718 --> 01:05:46,912
Her paranoia deepens
with each passing hour.

720
01:05:48,252 --> 01:05:50,979
- She's ordered immediate retaliation.
- Good.

721
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:55,040
The more the repression,
the greater the rebellion.

722
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,709
The greater the rebellion...

723
01:05:57,784 --> 01:06:00,614
the sooner our enemies
slaughter each other.

724
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,113
Get word to that Corrino witch.

725
01:06:04,185 --> 01:06:07,276
Tell her we continue
to work our mischief.

726
01:06:34,818 --> 01:06:37,580
Even though she's not
of council any longer...

727
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:40,311
I have asked Lady Jessica...

728
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:42,442
adored mother of Muad'Dib...

729
01:06:42,518 --> 01:06:46,450
to join us for the ritual
of supplication.

730
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:53,973
We bring before the holy family
a Kedeshian troubadour...

731
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,574
a miserable wanderer...

732
01:06:55,652 --> 01:06:58,117
who has lost everything
but the clothes on his back...

733
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:00,811
and now must beg the court for--

734
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:03,078
Mercy, Holy Mother.

735
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:10,376
I am Gadian Al-Fali...

736
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:12,145
naib of Sietch Gara Kulan.

737
01:07:12,218 --> 01:07:16,241
My ladies, do not listen to this man.
His appeal is not approved.

738
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,443
I am here concerning
a matter of the desert.

739
01:07:19,518 --> 01:07:25,417
A matter of the desert is a concern
of great magnitude, Fedaykin.

740
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,949
But, Reverend Mother--

741
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:43,873
Yes, milady.
I am Fedaykin.

742
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:46,417
Once offering his life
at the side of Muad'Dib.

743
01:07:46,485 --> 01:07:48,713
This is not the proper forum for--

744
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:52,047
We will hear this matter of the desert.

745
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:02,574
We have abandoned our friend
the desert, Holy Mother.

746
01:08:02,652 --> 01:08:05,483
Shai Hulud no longer roams the sands.

747
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:08,916
He cannot be found except in the empty
quarters, far from our people.

748
01:08:08,986 --> 01:08:11,578
The superstitious of the inner desert...

749
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:14,448
have always feared
the transformation of our land.

750
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:17,144
A land where nothing grew.

751
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,980
Now there are plants.

752
01:08:19,052 --> 01:08:22,212
They spread like maggots
upon the wound.

753
01:08:22,286 --> 01:08:24,616
There are clouds in the sky...

754
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:26,345
and rain.

755
01:08:26,419 --> 01:08:30,374
Precious mother of Muad'Dib,
rain from the sky of Dune.

756
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:32,112
It is a death to us all.

757
01:08:32,186 --> 01:08:36,778
We only do what Liet
and Muad'Dib intended us to do.

758
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,649
Would you challenge their holy words?

759
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,277
And what of the worms then?

760
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,078
There will always be some desert,
some worms.

761
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:51,285
As go the worms,
so goes the spice.

762
01:08:51,353 --> 01:08:54,615
And if the spice does not flow,
what coin do we have to buy our way?

763
01:08:54,686 --> 01:08:56,083
Silence!

764
01:08:56,152 --> 01:08:58,641
These are matters of state.

765
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,413
And you will not challenge
the wisdom of this government...

766
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:03,349
to do what it decides is best.

767
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,711
The rabble of the desert must be
made to comply with our judgment.

768
01:09:07,786 --> 01:09:09,911
It is we who rule here...

769
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:11,646
not the mob of the sands.

770
01:09:27,753 --> 01:09:33,118
There are those of you who fear I have
returned to Arrakis as a Bene Gesserit.

771
01:09:36,153 --> 01:09:41,211
That I have abandoned my loyalty to the
Atreides partnership with the desert.

772
01:09:46,053 --> 01:09:48,281
But since the day the Fremen...

773
01:09:49,387 --> 01:09:52,511
gave life to me and to my son...

774
01:09:54,187 --> 01:09:57,176
I have always been Fremen.

775
01:09:59,087 --> 01:10:01,814
And I will always be Fremen.

776
01:10:01,887 --> 01:10:03,648
Be quiet!

777
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,184
We cannot abandon the desert.

778
01:10:09,187 --> 01:10:11,085
My daughter is lying.

779
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:14,915
The worms will not survive
if the desert shrinks.

780
01:10:14,987 --> 01:10:17,044
She knows this.

781
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,382
Spice production will slow...

782
01:10:19,454 --> 01:10:22,352
until it is only a fraction
of what it has been.

783
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:25,083
And when that happens--

784
01:10:25,153 --> 01:10:29,745
We'll have a corner on the scarcest
commodity in the universe.

785
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,810
You will have a corner in hell.

786
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,286
Fedaykin, we who have been scorched
know how to stand back to back.

787
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,445
I have men here, milady.

788
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,949
<i>When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...</i>

789
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:10,953
<i>the whirlwind follows.</i>

790
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:16,215
The Golden Path.
It's up to you now.

791
01:11:17,188 --> 01:11:20,483
<i>The desert storm
that can't be stopped.</i>

792
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:23,713
<i>The whirlwind.</i>

793
01:11:23,787 --> 01:11:27,117
Leto, don't.

794
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:29,911
The Golden Path is dangerous.

795
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:32,880
The path I couldn't take.

796
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,854
You were having
another vision, weren't you?

797
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:02,546
Events are moving faster
than we anticipated, Ghani.

798
01:12:03,621 --> 01:12:05,349
We have to go now.

799
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,478
To Jacarutu?

800
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:10,248
The answer is there. I know it.

801
01:12:12,221 --> 01:12:15,880
We can't turn back.
We have to finish this.

802
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:18,614
Muad'Dib, the god,
must be destroyed.

803
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:20,983
We must find the Golden Path.

804
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:23,384
It's a dangerous path.

805
01:12:23,455 --> 01:12:25,387
It's the only way out of the trap.

806
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:29,480
He saw it at the end.

807
01:12:29,555 --> 01:12:32,112
Father's last vision.
He knew it was possible.

808
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:36,844
Don't you see?
That's why he left.

809
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:38,581
He left it to us.

810
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,950
You're not telling me
everything, are you?

811
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:43,886
There are things you've seen
that you keep from me.

812
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:45,614
I can tell.

813
01:12:49,455 --> 01:12:52,546
Only things that
I don't even understand...

814
01:12:53,922 --> 01:12:55,649
yet.

815
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:59,116
But I have faith, Ghani.

816
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,245
Faith that no matter what happens,
when the time comes...

817
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:03,344
we will both know what to do.

818
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:07,847
Are you sure we can make it?

819
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:13,452
I'm sure that if we don't try,
we'll have failed.

820
01:13:22,122 --> 01:13:23,781
I'm afraid.

821
01:13:26,788 --> 01:13:29,379
Fear is the mind killer.

822
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:33,149
- I will face my fear.
- I will let it pass through me.

823
01:13:52,222 --> 01:13:53,881
We are ready for tonight.

824
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:59,483
- Have you seen that one?
- The one who's gone over to our enemies?

825
01:13:59,556 --> 01:14:01,987
Without doubt. Palimbasha.

826
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,685
I saw him in the bazaar
at Arakeen with the tigers.

827
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:08,814
No doubt he has his part to play.

828
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:13,444
You ready?

829
01:14:31,155 --> 01:14:34,588
I find it ironic that we're using gifts
from our enemies as means of escape.

830
01:14:35,623 --> 01:14:37,589
But you're enjoying
the charade anyway, aren't you?

831
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:39,315
- You know me too well.
- Yeah, too well.

832
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:41,947
Which is why you must promise me
we'll only be as reckless as necessary.

833
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:43,545
Only as necessary.

834
01:15:00,823 --> 01:15:03,016
It won't be long
before the alarm goes out.

835
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:06,453
There. The way to Jacarutu.

836
01:15:06,522 --> 01:15:08,545
They'll never think
we've gone in that direction.

837
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:35,247
We can rest here until arrangements
are made to get you out of the city.

838
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:48,488
Unless something is done...

839
01:15:48,556 --> 01:15:50,523
civil war is inevitable.

840
01:15:55,357 --> 01:15:57,788
We must get a message to Stilgar.

841
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,283
He must call for a council of naibs.

842
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:07,483
We must bring a trial
of possession against Alia.

843
01:16:07,557 --> 01:16:10,455
You know what that will mean,
Reverend Mother.

844
01:16:13,056 --> 01:16:15,181
She is your daughter.

845
01:16:17,624 --> 01:16:19,851
I know what it means.

846
01:16:22,123 --> 01:16:24,180
An official warrant
for the arrest of Fedaykin Al-Fali...

847
01:16:24,257 --> 01:16:26,746
and his confederates
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

848
01:16:28,357 --> 01:16:30,948
Post it in every city.
Send word to every sietch.

849
01:16:31,956 --> 01:16:34,149
The conspiracy to murder
the imperial regent...

850
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:37,417
and kidnap the mother of Muad'Dib
must be crushed without mercy.

851
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:01,247
Are you looking at me
or analyzing me, Duncan?

852
01:17:01,323 --> 01:17:03,289
I'm gathering data.

853
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,017
You must find her, Duncan.

854
01:17:06,657 --> 01:17:09,384
You must find her and return her to me.

855
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:13,921
Surely your data must
point to the danger I'm in.

856
01:17:15,523 --> 01:17:17,580
We are in.

857
01:17:18,857 --> 01:17:22,187
Perhaps your lover would be
a better comfort to you than I.

858
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:29,748
I've made so many mistakes,
Duncan. So many mistakes.

859
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,347
Because I've been afraid.

860
01:17:32,424 --> 01:17:35,288
I'm ashamed of my weakness.

861
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:38,256
Please try to forgive me.

862
01:17:39,891 --> 01:17:41,652
I lost my temper in there, Duncan.

863
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:44,088
I know it was a mistake,
but I can fix it.

864
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:46,920
It was an accident
of fatigue, nothing else.

865
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:49,082
I can make everyone understand.

866
01:17:49,157 --> 01:17:50,816
Everyone except her.

867
01:17:51,524 --> 01:17:53,989
You have to deal with her.

868
01:17:55,424 --> 01:17:57,083
She is your mother.

869
01:17:57,157 --> 01:17:59,782
She is Bene Gesserit
no matter what she said in there.

870
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:03,051
And those damnable hags would like
nothing more than to put me to the test.

871
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:05,090
Please, Duncan.

872
01:18:05,157 --> 01:18:06,816
Please.

873
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,551
You're the only one I can trust.

874
01:18:09,558 --> 01:18:11,786
You're the only one
who loves me enough.

875
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,255
You must eliminate her.

876
01:18:19,091 --> 01:18:21,284
No harm must come
to House Atreides.

877
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:25,947
No matter what the cost.

878
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:49,350
You handled that well.

879
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,084
Shut up.

880
01:18:52,224 --> 01:18:54,554
<i>As you wish, milady.</i>

881
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:11,254
We found their clothing
near the bakery, Stilgar.

882
01:19:11,324 --> 01:19:13,449
We're certain they're
no longer in the sietch.

883
01:19:13,524 --> 01:19:16,218
They must be wearing those robes
they brought from Arakeen.

884
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:19,724
But our search parties can't find
a single trace of them in the desert.

885
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:23,315
They won't. Not unless
the children want them to.

886
01:19:45,992 --> 01:19:48,049
They do not appreciate
my presence here.

887
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,182
These are puritans,
Reverend Mother.

888
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:52,952
What they do not like
is what's become of their revolution.

889
01:19:53,025 --> 01:19:56,150
Then I must convince them
that neither do I.

890
01:19:56,225 --> 01:20:01,055
A messenger has arrived under
immunity of Stilgar. It is urgent.

891
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:11,784
You have a message
from Sietch Tabr.

892
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:16,288
Fali, hold!

893
01:20:18,492 --> 01:20:20,685
Your grandchildren are missing.

894
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:23,088
I'm to bring you to Sietch Tabr
as soon as possible.

895
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:25,317
You can't go with him, Holy Mother.

896
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:27,824
He is a ghola.

897
01:20:27,893 --> 01:20:30,688
He was my duke's most trusted warrior.

898
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:33,955
He died once, saving Muad'Dib's life...

899
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:35,423
and mine.

900
01:20:35,492 --> 01:20:38,947
But he is Alia's husband.

901
01:20:39,026 --> 01:20:42,423
He is still Atreides.

902
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:45,919
It is my daughter who is not.

903
01:20:48,726 --> 01:20:50,487
We don't have much time.

904
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,048
What about these Fedaykin
who have helped me?

905
01:20:53,126 --> 01:20:54,887
Alia has issued a warrant against them.

906
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:57,390
- Crimes against the Imperium.
- Of course she has.

907
01:20:57,459 --> 01:21:00,721
Stilgar has offered sanctuary
if they can make it to Tabr.

908
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:02,451
Then that is what you will do.

909
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,991
When the imperial agents
find this place...

910
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:07,854
there must be nothing left but
the wind howling through the rocks.

911
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:09,653
As the Holy Mother commands.

912
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,387
May Shai Hulud
clear the path before you.

913
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,192
Is it true about
my grandchildren, Duncan?

914
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,283
You would not have come
if you didn't believe it, milady.

915
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:43,687
Stilgar suspects they may have
seen this crisis coming.

916
01:21:43,759 --> 01:21:45,725
He fears they've gone
into the desert.

917
01:21:49,293 --> 01:21:51,815
I made many mistakes
with my daughter, Duncan.

918
01:21:53,859 --> 01:21:56,848
There have been many mistakes, milady.

919
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,586
And I repeated most of them.

920
01:22:01,893 --> 01:22:04,485
She will not survive
the trial of abomination.

921
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:23,015
This is not the course
for the Sietch Tabr, is it?

922
01:22:23,093 --> 01:22:24,753
No, milady, it is not.

923
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,258
Are you going to tell me
where you're taking me?

924
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:35,452
Somewhere even Alia
won't think to look for us.

925
01:22:46,426 --> 01:22:48,086
I don't think they saw us.

926
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,557
I don't think they were looking for us.

927
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:52,286
We don't have much time.

928
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:25,350
We have to make
those rocks before sunset.

929
01:23:25,427 --> 01:23:28,359
Search parties will be certain
to come out this far now.

930
01:23:33,194 --> 01:23:36,024
- That's not a worm.
- But an animal.

931
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,117
More than one.

932
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,656
It's closer now.

933
01:24:04,728 --> 01:24:06,694
Much closer.

934
01:24:37,694 --> 01:24:39,319
Move!

935
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:14,892
- There's a cave up there.
- Run.

936
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:23,993
Get in!

937
01:25:41,028 --> 01:25:44,824
<i>The saga of Dune is far from over.</i>

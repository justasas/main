1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,500
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,100
Dune.

3
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,700
A land so starved for water,
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,980
Wilderness home to the mysterious
desert tribes called the Fremen,

5
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:33,600
who long for a Messiah to free
them from Harkonnen bondage.

6
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:38,150
A Messiah, a boy
once known as Paul,

7
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,400
now known as Muad'dib.

8
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:57,321
Pick up the pace, you lazy desert rats,
we have a quota to meet.

9
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,945
Sound the alarm!

10
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,194
Disperse the men to the safe houses.

11
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,152
Get word to Stilgar.

12
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,778
We'll evacuate the city tomorrow.

13
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,653
Halt!

14
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,611
Turn around.

15
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:04,654
Papers!

16
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,614
I said your papers, you scum...

17
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,493
There's a tunnel out of the city,
at the foot of the steps.

18
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,912
The blessings of Muad'dib
be with you and your family.

19
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,497
Your plan worked, Muad'dib.

20
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,995
Now they know we can strike them at will.

21
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:54,787
We could take the city in an hour.

22
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,411
It's not time.

23
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,117
But they are vulnerable, Muad'dib.

24
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,575
Not yet.

25
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:17,818
The advance unit found something
in the chaos, Muad'dib.

26
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,360
Something you should see.

27
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,655
There was a secret crematorium
in one of the Harkonnen barracks.

28
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,115
And this was all...

29
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:42,240
...of your father that was left.

30
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:05,704
The men think it's an omen,
a sign that our final battle...

31
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,122
...with the Harkonnen is at hand.

32
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,414
Your visions frighten me, Muad'dib.

33
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,209
There are things still hidden from me.

34
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,669
Places I can't go, things I can't see.

35
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,258
Do you ever worry that just trying to see
the future changes it?

36
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,636
We're speeding toward the abyss, Chani.

37
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,889
I have to see a way around it.

38
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,065
Perhaps it's time
for me to leave, Muad'dib.

39
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,816
I've been away from our son too long.

40
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,848
We'll make arrangements
once we reach Cave of Ridges.

41
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,414
We will be there after the next raids.

42
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,019
Will we ever have peace, Muad'dib?

43
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,498
We'll have victory.

44
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,339
I'm sorry, Milord.
He said you must come at once.

45
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:22,245
Do you really take me
for that much of a fool, boy?

46
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,790
I don't understand, Uncle.

47
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,710
What kind of poison did you choose, boy?
Something slow and painful, I assume...

48
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,795
...so you could watch, eh?

49
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,300
Tell me, Feyd, why didn't you simply
assassinate me yourself?

50
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,554
You had plenty of opportunity to.

51
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,557
You taught me that my own hands
must always remain clean.

52
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,727
Quick boy, very quick.

53
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,773
You're good material, Feyd,
and I hate to waste good material.

54
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,115
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right here.

55
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,412
My brother.

56
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,667
Yes.

57
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,085
That's right.

58
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,586
Your dim brother.

59
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,507
If I kill you, then he would be my only heir.

60
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,885
He can't even put down
a dirty mob of religious lunatics.

61
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,597
Yes, you're clever, Feyd.

62
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,183
But not that clever.

63
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,688
And don't get any ideas, Feyd.

64
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,774
My men have you in their sights
even as we speak.

65
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,025
Don't worry.

66
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,572
If I'd wanted you dead
you'd never have made it down the hall.

67
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,114
You're going to let me live?

68
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:57,911
Well, I can't very well leave the wealth
of Arrakis to someone who's dead.

69
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,579
What wealth?

70
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:03,083
Every communiqué brings news
of another Fremen raid.

71
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,377
By the time my idiot of a brother
is through...

72
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,837
...the Emperor himself
we'll have to intervene.

73
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,340
You're not as dim as I thought.

74
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,886
You intend to draw the Emperor himself
into this?

75
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:18,015
You see, this is why you need me, Feyd...

76
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,310
...to help you think, to help you plot.

77
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,670
Why do you think I tolerate
the incompetence of your brother?

78
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,205
Because it amuses me?

79
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,113
Think, Feyd. Think.

80
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:33,297
There is method to this madness, even
though you've been too dull to divine it.

81
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,201
The spice.

82
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,827
Of course the spice.

83
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,956
The one thing that could possibly draw
the Emperor away...

84
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,294
...from his imperial pleasures,
out into the wastelands of the Empire...

85
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:52,382
...where he is vulnerable,
where he can be destroyed.

86
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,138
And Duke Leto was just the beginning,
the prelude to a move...

87
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,557
...on the imperial throne itself.

88
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:05,187
But timing is everything, beautiful boy.
Patience is our ally.

89
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,275
We must not make the Emperor suspicious
with foolishness like this.

90
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,696
So, what will it be?

91
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,825
I give you my pledge.

92
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,749
Good.

93
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,420
Now let the Emperor mock
House Harkonnen, call us swine...

94
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,924
...because in the end,
his throne will be mine.

95
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,221
That's it Hannah.

96
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:45,009
Good.

97
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,548
Good, Hannah.

98
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,575
Another healthy fighter for the cause.

99
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,663
Alia, you were told to wait.

100
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,937
He looks like Mitha's son.

101
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,985
How can you know that, child?

102
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,698
The slaughter on Bela Tegeuse is history.

103
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,287
You weren't even born.

104
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:40,006
But, Mother, I saw it,
and it's true.

105
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,676
Yes, it's true.

106
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,957
I hate them.

107
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,089
Alia.

108
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,549
They stare at me.
They whisper when I pass.

109
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:07,004
It hurts my feelings.

110
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:08,959
They're confused, Alia.

111
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,539
You frighten them.

112
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,454
Because I'm a freak.

113
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,992
You're not a freak. Who has said that?

114
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,238
No one.

115
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,074
Then don't you ever say it again.

116
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,081
My children are not freaks.

117
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,874
But I can't help it.

118
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,670
I just know things,
things I shouldn't know, but I just do.

119
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,884
It was a cruel thing I did to you, Alia.

120
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,302
I took the Water of Life
when you were still in my womb.

121
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:49,675
No one should ever be wakened
to consciousness as you were.

122
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:55,175
But we'll make them understand, Alia.

123
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,842
We'll make them see
that you're not just a little girl...

124
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:02,924
...that you've never really been one.

125
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,714
I want my brother.

126
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,242
What is it?

127
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,524
He came to challenge you in open combat.

128
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:20,560
You killed him?

129
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,012
I took care of it.

130
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,424
But he came to challenge me.

131
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,628
He wasn't worthy, Muad'dib.

132
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,777
Otheym, get Stilgar.

133
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,497
Tell him to summon the Maker.

134
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:48,136
There is only one way
to stop these challenges.

135
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:52,193
You know what this will mean,
between you and Stil.

136
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:54,994
The men will want you to call him out.

137
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,337
Only if I survive the Maker.

138
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,309
Just remember what I've taught you.
Do it simply and directly.

139
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,900
- Nothing fancy.
- I'll remember.

140
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,800
Stand close enough that
you can mount when he passes.

141
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,500
- Not so close that he'll crush you.
- I'll remember.

142
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,200
You will hear him before you see him.

143
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:20,500
When you take your stand,
you must become completely still.

144
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,700
You must become a dune
in your very essence.

145
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,200
Stil.

146
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,900
I'll remember.

147
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,700
See that you do.

148
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,331
Fremen ride the worm
by the time they are 12.

149
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,750
I don't want an old man
like you shaming my teaching.

150
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,400
He won't fail.

151
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,925
I must not fear.

152
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:56,716
Fear is the mind killer.

153
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,796
I will face my fear.

154
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:12,827
I will let it pass through me.
Only I will remain.

155
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:14,867
He is too close.

156
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,577
He's not leaving enough room.

157
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,577
I can second him.
It's allowed, even in the test.

158
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,909
No.

159
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,495
He must do this alone.

160
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,091
He is turning it.

161
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,051
He is turning it!

162
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,760
Take positions!

163
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:39,797
It is our turn now, Muad'dib.

164
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,964
You and me.

165
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't think I've ever seen one that big.

166
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,499
Look, there.

167
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,873
Spice.

168
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,616
We've never come so far south.
The Fremen would never allow this if they knew.

169
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:31,696
No choice.

170
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:34,273
The Spacing Guild's buying up
all the spice there is.

171
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,561
Nothing left for us.

172
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,891
This looks like a rich patch.
I'll call the harvester.

173
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,760
Get some men up on those rocks first.

174
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,054
The Harkonnen patrols
won't be this far out.

175
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:45,057
It's not the Harkonnen I'm worried about.

176
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,483
I'll be damned. A false patch.

177
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,694
Get the men back on board!

178
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,875
Put the knife away, Gurney Halleck.

179
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,712
Who is it that knows the name
of Gurney Halleck?

180
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,425
Paul? Is it truly Paul?

181
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,215
You young pup! Young pup!

182
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,377
Gurney-man.

183
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,661
So you're the reason
the Fremen have gotten so clever.

184
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:34,570
I'd never have expected you
to fall for such a simple trick, Gurney.

185
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,151
Desperate times, Milord.

186
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,727
Harkonnen patrols have forced us south,
deeper and deeper.

187
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,512
Where you might've seen things
you shouldn't.

188
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:44,883
This is Gurney Halleck, Stil.

189
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,919
My father's weapons master.

190
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,790
One of my teachers.

191
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:53,723
There aren't many of us who haven't heard
the name Gurney Halleck.

192
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:58,114
This is Stilgar, Gurney,
the naib of our sietch.

193
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,536
Muad'dib...

194
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,129
...feel the wind.

195
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,299
"Muad'dib"?

196
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,966
- You're the one they call Muad'dib?
- It's my Fremen name.

197
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:11,667
Come, we'll talk of all these things
while we wait out the storm.

198
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,956
Storm? We didn't see any signs.

199
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,535
It comes, soon. Trust me.

200
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,366
What happens to my men?

201
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,905
We'll decide what to do with them
after the storm.

202
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,270
We'll have to hurry
if we're going to save the thopter.

203
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,335
This is one of the things
you should not have seen.

204
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,087
You have many such hiding places?

205
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,881
Many times many.

206
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,426
We call this one Cave of Ridges.

207
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,893
Would you like me to bring coffee?

208
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes.

209
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,439
And more food.

210
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,152
Your woman?

211
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,529
The mother of my first-born.

212
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,406
So much has happened.

213
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,201
The boy I knew has now become a man.

214
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,079
Thanks to our enemies.

215
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
Cowards.

216
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,584
They hide in their cities in garrisons,
hoping you will wear yourself out...

217
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,460
...with useless raids.

218
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,797
In other words, they're immobilized.

219
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,591
While you know where,
and when you choose.

220
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,539
A tactic I learned from you, Gurney-man.

221
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,939
What about your men?

222
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:33,261
Smugglers, all. Good men.

223
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,964
Some newcomers.

224
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:37,122
Off-worlders.

225
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:40,817
It's hard to find recruits these days.

226
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,738
Any of my father's men?

227
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,996
Those that weren't butchered
by the Harkonnen...

228
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:48,880
...bribed whoever they could
to leave Arrakis.

229
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,347
Everyone thought...

230
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:56,358
...we all believed you were dead, Milord.

231
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:58,071
But you stayed.

232
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:01,371
Awaiting an opportunity for vengeance.

233
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,631
I knew we'd be reunited, Gurney.

234
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,674
I saw it.

235
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,668
You're the only one left to me, Milord.

236
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,330
Hawat, Idaho, your father...

237
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:15,573
...all dead, all betrayed.

238
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:21,271
I would've gladly have sacrificed myself
if I could've taken the traitor with me.

239
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:33,707
My father once spoke
about desert power, Gurney.

240
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,163
I remember well.

241
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,290
Well, you've just met it.

242
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,835
The surface of this planet is ours.

243
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,672
No storm, no worm,
not even the Emperor's Sardaukar...

244
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,424
...could stop us now.

245
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,636
Enlist with me, Gurney.

246
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,765
Feed on revenge with us.

247
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,016
Enlist?

248
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:58,060
I never left your service.

249
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,235
That stupid swine seems
almost begging for me to intervene.

250
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:10,156
The Baron is a pig, Father,
but he is not stupid.

251
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:18,039
Rabban has lost almost 50,000 troops
in the past two years.

252
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,669
- Arrakis is a fierce planet.
- Attrition cannot explain such losses.

253
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,460
He's losing five-to-one.

254
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:26,707
Read between the lines.

255
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:31,702
You are saying the Baron is allowing
this rebellion to continue?

256
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:36,114
I'm saying the Baron can count
as well as we.

257
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:42,443
For the sake of argument,
what if there were only 20,000 people...

258
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,357
...in a Fremen sietch?

259
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:49,071
And what if there were only 250
such communities on the whole of Arrakis?

260
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,533
Our spies are suggesting
there may be twice that many.

261
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,994
Yes.

262
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,746
Ten million.

263
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,501
Toughened by conditions
worse than your own prison planet, Father.

264
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,784
Yes, but brutalized by
that mindless thug, Rabban.

265
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,192
They would never ally with him.

266
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:15,350
Perhaps this brutality is simply part
of something more cunning.

267
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,714
A clever prelude
to ripen them up for someone else.

268
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:23,705
Someone to come and rescue them
from Rabban.

269
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:27,820
Someone like the other nephew,
the cute one, Feyd.

270
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,699
If such a plan succeeded...

271
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:36,127
...the Baron would have a force
to rival even your dreaded Sardaukar.

272
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,226
Summon Harkonnen to Kaitain.

273
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:46,402
We shall see what devices
this perverse mind is breeding.

274
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:56,593
Your Highness has a perceptive mind.

275
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,265
Shall I take that as a compliment
or a threat, Fenring?

276
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:04,263
I meant it only as a sign of my respect.

277
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,680
I share your fear of the Baron's schemes.

278
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:10,304
My father can handle the Baron, Fenring.

279
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,179
It is this Muad'dib I'm curious about.

280
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:13,840
Halt!

281
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,090
He caught Korba from behind, Muad'dib.

282
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:19,047
One of my newcomers.

283
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,548
- Sardaukar.
- Not a chance.

284
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:25,047
The only possible explanation
if he overcame Korba.

285
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:29,172
Submit, Captain.

286
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,380
Submit, Captain.

287
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,379
Sardaukar.

288
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,001
- Gurney.
- Let me kill him, Milord.

289
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:55,083
No.

290
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,581
Gurney Halleck is right.
We must take his water.

291
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,994
Otheym, see that he's not harmed.

292
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,367
We'll have use for him soon.

293
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,817
Chani, now you can return
to the southern sietch.

294
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:12,691
I want you to bring my mother here.

295
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,772
Your mother?

296
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:17,556
Milord, we were told
she was taken by the Harkonnen...

297
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,637
...that she is dead.

298
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:23,922
She is very much alive, old friend...

299
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,877
...and you will see her soon.

300
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,951
Come. We have another raid to plan.

301
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,670
Muad'dib never sleeps.

302
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,000
They say Muad'dib never eats.

303
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,260
They believe he can see into the future.

304
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,100
They believe he cannot be killed.

305
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,860
- No one has ever seen him?
- No, Highness.

306
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,100
Though many claim they have.

307
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,200
Sometimes in several places,
at the same time.

308
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,700
But what does he look like?

309
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,230
I want to know what he looks like.

310
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,200
No one will say for sure.

311
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,260
Perhaps he doesn't even exist.

312
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,400
Perhaps he's just a legend.
A ghost.

313
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,990
There were no such things as ghosts.

314
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,650
We were able to jam their signals.

315
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:30,780
No communications escaped,
but I think you should see this.

316
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,650
The Guild agent.

317
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,800
Quite a distance from
the comforts on Kaitain.

318
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,970
May I remind you that I am protected
by the Imperial Treaties for Commerce

319
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:01,500
by the C.H.O.A.M. Declaration,
paragraph 12, subparagraph D...

320
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,200
and by Articles 3, 8 and 14
of the Great Convention, which...

321
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,200
Imperial law is void
where Muad'dib stands.

322
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,900
- The forms must be obeyed.
- Be quiet.

323
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,400
Shall we take their waters now, Muad'dib?

324
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,800
We have surrendered without resistance.
We have put our lives at your mercy.

325
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,900
Mercy is a word I no longer understand.

326
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,000
Milord.

327
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,200
Tell me.

328
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,500
Are there many Guild agents
on Arrakis these days?

329
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,200
We are neutral in the matters
between you and the Harkonnen.

330
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,400
Are there?

331
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,600
Arrakis is crawling with them.

332
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,900
Buying up the spice as if
there was precious little left.

333
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,400
You're afraid, aren't you?

334
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,200
The spice must flow.

335
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,000
Otheym, disarm their thopters.

336
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,000
Fuel them only as much as
needed to reach Arrakeen.

337
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,200
You are letting them go?

338
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,980
Take a message to your masters.

339
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,980
Tell them your fight is hopeless.

340
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,200
Tell them the forces of
Muad'dib cannot be defeated.

341
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,400
Tell them the days are numbered.

342
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,200
The men are going to
question your intentions.

343
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,300
The men, Stil, can't possibly
imagine what my intentions are.

344
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,467
Gurney.

345
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,306
Your son shares a bond with this man.

346
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,932
It runs very deep.

347
00:32:58,016 --> 00:32:59,350
Very deep.

348
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:02,312
The kind only men can have.

349
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,983
And my little man.

350
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,860
You are so thin.

351
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,653
Is he being fed enough?

352
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,614
His appetite is as healthy as any I've seen.

353
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,952
He should be with the other children.

354
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,037
I cherish the time I spend
with my grandson.

355
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,418
He can't learn the ways of the sietch
if he's kept apart.

356
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,087
There are things he must learn
that extend beyond the ways of the sietch.

357
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,506
There will be time enough
to learn those things.

358
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,006
Does Paul share that sentiment?

359
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:37,625
Muad'dib relies on my judgment
where our son is concerned.

360
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:42,953
You have been a good companion
to my son, Chani.

361
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,572
But he is not like other men.

362
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,283
- I'm sure I know that better than most.
- He is noble- born.

363
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,870
The rightful heir to the House Atreides.

364
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,667
An alliance with one of the other
great houses must remain a possibility.

365
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,257
You don't have to worry, Reverend Mother.

366
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,302
I will only do what's best for him.

367
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,802
Just as you did...
...for your duke.

368
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,300
Pleasure to see you again, Baron Harkonnen.

369
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:34,300
So the Emperor seems to be entertaining
some of the other royal houses as well.

370
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,200
There is much to discuss.

371
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,800
Really?

372
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,717
Your Majesty, these people are mad.

373
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,252
The women throw their babies at us.

374
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:10,071
They hurl themselves onto our weapons
to open a wedge for their men to attack.

375
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:11,691
Indeed.

376
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,686
I can wipe the planet clean
of the entire race, Your Majesty.

377
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,891
But then, who would mine the spice?

378
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,012
It's a terrible dilemma.

379
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:24,173
Do you have any idea
where this Muad'dib character came from?

380
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:27,541
What he wants? What his price is?

381
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,133
He's a Fremen fanatic,
a religious adventurer.

382
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:33,477
They crop up regularly
on the fringes of civilization.

383
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,608
Your Majesty knows this.

384
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:39,078
Most seem simply bent on suicide.

385
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:44,972
Have you ever stared into the eyes
of a religious fanatic, Baron?

386
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,598
Suicide and martyrdom
are often the same thing.

387
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:55,261
It's a dangerous game he's playing.

388
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:59,215
This rebellion must be crushed. Now.

389
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:01,255
We agree.

390
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:05,000
Something must be done,
although we may not suggest...

391
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,207
...what that is, of course.

392
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,075
We cannot move on House Harkonnen
unilaterally, Majesty.

393
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:14,901
There are complications in our relationship.

394
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,058
It's time to draw this Muad'dib
into the open.

395
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:24,716
Have the royal houses
prepare their armies.

396
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,165
We're moving the royal palace to Arrakis,
with the Guild's approval, of course.

397
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,097
They expect you to call Stilgar out.

398
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:15,341
No man recognizes leadership
without the challenge of combat.

399
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:20,838
Now that I've ridden the worm,
they think there's nothing else in our way.

400
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,254
Is there?

401
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:29,124
A man in a rush never sees
the edge of the cliff until it's too late.

402
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,332
They don't see any cliffs.

403
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,459
You don't allow them to.

404
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,380
They have a simple religion.

405
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,090
Nothing about religion is simple.

406
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:44,761
- Isn't it late to be worrying about that?
- We did...

407
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:49,891
...I did what I had to do
to ensure our survival.

408
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,224
- You used them.
- Yes.

409
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:56,386
- So have you.
- No.

410
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:59,674
I'm fulfilling the role
destiny has chosen for me.

411
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:02,503
You sound like you believe
the legends about you.

412
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,710
Like the Kwisatz Haderach?

413
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:08,829
What do you know about that?

414
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,912
Mother Ramallo called me that...

415
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:14,995
...at Sietch Tabr, before she died.

416
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,491
I was supposed to have a daughter.

417
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:31,824
One that could be wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

418
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:37,865
A way to end the feud and possibly
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

419
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,281
The one who can be many places at once.

420
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:44,530
The ultimate achievement
of centuries of Bene Gesserit breeding.

421
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,324
The man who could go
where we could not.

422
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,412
The one with perfect memory,
who could provide perfect predictability.

423
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,956
And perfect power
for the Bene Gesserit, of course.

424
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,792
I did what I did
because I loved your father.

425
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,253
I only wanted to give him a son.

426
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,591
I didn't want to create a god.

427
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,926
- Then you don't believe it's true?
- I'm your mother, Paul.

428
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,470
- I know who you are.
- Do you?

429
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,681
Forgive me, Reverend Mother.

430
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:14,929
Can I bring you anything?
Some food, perhaps?

431
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,846
Yes, thank you.

432
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:22,179
And then I'd like to see Gurney.

433
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:28,012
You must find a way not to lose Stilgar.

434
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:40,886
Come, Otheym.

435
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,593
Thought you'd escaped, witch?

436
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,747
- Gurney, what are you doing?
- I'm your confessor.

437
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,029
Take your hands off me.

438
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:58,135
Here to unburden your black conscience
of guilt before I send you into eternity.

439
00:39:58,841 --> 00:39:59,836
Gurney!

440
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:02,866
One more step, Milord,
and I'll finish it right now.

441
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,567
You better explain yourself, Gurney.

442
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,199
I'll explain all right.

443
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:10,048
The day the House Atreides fell,
I swore an oath I would kill the one...

444
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,266
...who betrayed your father.

445
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:15,362
- You couldn't be more wrong, Gurney.
- Do not speak.

446
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,915
- Gurney.
- Stand where you are, Milord.

447
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,334
Am I capable of lying to you?

448
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,544
You never have, Milord.

449
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,839
The traitor was Yueh, Gurney.

450
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,047
No.

451
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,425
We have the confession in his own hand.

452
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:32,804
And as soon as you release my mother,
you can read it for yourself.

453
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,802
Look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't you.

454
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:38,552
I will know if you are lying.

455
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,092
I will know.

456
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:43,631
I would've given my life to save Leto.

457
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:48,253
The day he died, my heart turned to stone.

458
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:50,085
It was Yueh.

459
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,166
They had his wife.

460
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,951
My God, what have I done?

461
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:02,282
My God.

462
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,602
Be still, Gurney, it's over now.

463
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,178
I didn't see it coming.

464
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:21,006
You need to rest, Muad'dib.

465
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:25,833
I didn't know he would threaten her.

466
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:29,329
I never saw it.

467
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,205
He could've killed her.

468
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,381
This can't go on.

469
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:41,060
You are asking too much of yourself.

470
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,915
I want you to take Leto
and return to the southern sietch.

471
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,659
I want you safe.

472
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,690
I'm safest when we are together.

473
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,978
But I'm not.

474
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,601
Muad'dib!

475
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,582
He's alive.

476
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,793
I assure you, he's alive.

477
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,625
But the thread of life is so thin,
most think he's not.

478
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,831
- How long has he been this way?
- Almost to the day you left.

479
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:04,622
Otheym found him.

480
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,870
The experience has shaken him.

481
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:12,950
I spent a week trying to revive him.

482
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,284
But it's been no use.

483
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,239
There have been meetings, arguments.

484
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,943
Some of the elders think it's time...

485
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:28,727
...to take his water.

486
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:32,056
Who else knows?

487
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,089
Stilgar, the naibs,
and the Fedaykin, of course.

488
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:38,502
What do the Fedaykin think?

489
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,880
They think he's in a sacred trance...

490
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:45,343
...gathering his holy powers
for the final battle.

491
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,388
I've encouraged this view.

492
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,893
You have to help, Chani.

493
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,604
You're my last hope.

494
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,146
Please, tell me what to do.

495
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:28,502
The Fedaykin are right, Reverend Mother.

496
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:31,752
Muad'dib is in a trance.

497
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:35,332
A dangerous trance.

498
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:40,079
He has taken the Water of Life.

499
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,162
The raw water of a drowned maker.
I have not changed it yet.

500
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,675
More could kill him.

501
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,094
It's our only hope.

502
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,201
Muad'dib. Beloved.

503
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,163
Chani, what are you doing here?

504
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,581
Paul.

505
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:41,452
I was outside just a moment ago.

506
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:43,740
You drank the Water of Life.

507
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:45,654
Yes.

508
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:49,605
We thought you were dead.

509
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,267
You have no idea.

510
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,779
I have seen things
there are not words to describe.

511
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,112
You've seen the future.

512
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,447
The now, Mother.

513
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,659
The future and the past.

514
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,744
All at once.

515
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,623
All the same.

516
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,141
I am the whirlwind.

517
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:48,423
Paul. I can't go there.

518
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,254
I'm afraid.

519
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:53,041
I'm so afraid.

520
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:57,036
- It is the place we cannot go.
- That is why I have come.

521
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,163
You are the Kwisatz Haderach.

522
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:04,667
No, Mother. I am something more.

523
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,544
I am something unexpected.

524
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,590
I am the fulcrum,
the giver and the taker.

525
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:15,010
I am the one
who can be many places at once.

526
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,263
I am the master of fate.

527
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,804
I am the tool of fate.

528
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,125
Reverend Mother?

529
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:54,170
Reverend Mother, are you sick?

530
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:56,588
I'm fine.

531
00:50:57,838 --> 00:50:59,630
Now you understand.

532
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,649
I've decided we're alike, you and me.

533
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,819
Have you?

534
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:59,364
When this dusty little nuisance is over
I'll convince you.

535
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,784
I'd be confused if you didn't try.

536
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,119
I know.

537
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,788
Yeah, that's why we're alike.

538
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,496
We don't like to be confused.
We like to be certain.

539
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:18,283
Sometime, remind me to tell you
about the ancient legend of the Phoenix.

540
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,612
That's it, beautiful boy.

541
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:32,984
You may find a way for us yet.

542
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,482
She'd make a fine trophy
on Harkonnen linen, wouldn't she?

543
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,434
The Padishah Emperor is here,
in the space above us...

544
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,647
...with his favorite truthsayer
and legions of his Sardaukar.

545
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,193
Every great house has its raiders here.

546
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,530
The Baron Harkonnen is with them.

547
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,283
But Muad'dib, how can you know this?

548
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,953
I've seen them.

549
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,498
Milord, we only heard this morning...

550
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,833
...from our smuggler allies.

551
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:35,003
- You were unconscious.
- Not unconscious!

552
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:38,339
Muad'dib has seen through
the Water of Life.

553
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:42,634
Reverend Mother, is this true?

554
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,299
He has seen.

555
00:53:45,381 --> 00:53:46,791
Mahdi!

556
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:51,565
You are a voice from the outer world.

557
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,840
You are the prophet sent to us
by Shai-Hulud.

558
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:58,746
You must take your place, Muad'dib.

559
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:00,323
We've waited long enough.

560
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,404
You must do it now!

561
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,450
Do you live for the good of the tribe,
Stilgar?

562
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,701
There is no other way.

563
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,539
And for the good of the tribe,
would you stand there...

564
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,042
...and let me drive this blade
into your heart?

565
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,336
- Call him out, Muad'dib.
- Call him out.

566
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,756
- It is the way, Stilgar.
- It is the way.

567
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,008
It is the way.

568
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,551
Ways change!

569
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,725
Hard tasks need hard ways.

570
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:35,398
You must become our naib
so you can lead us against the Harkonnen.

571
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,900
And would you smash your knife
before starting that war?

572
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,238
Will you cut off your right arm
and leave it bloody on the floor?

573
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,115
Do you think the Mahdi is that stupid?

574
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,039
There isn't a man among you who could
stand against me in single combat...

575
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,833
...Stilgar included.

576
00:54:55,625 --> 00:55:00,255
Must I prove it by calling out the naib
of every sietch on the planet?

577
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:05,838
Must I cripple myself by killing
our strongest and wisest leaders...

578
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:08,878
...just for the sake of some mindless ritual?

579
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:14,124
You say I am the Mahdi.

580
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,536
I say I am your Duke!

581
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:28,367
And it's time now to wipe Arrakis clean
of the awful Harkonnen stench.

582
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:33,407
Time to drive their name into the depths
of hell so that we may reclaim the planet...

583
00:55:33,574 --> 00:55:35,947
...and create a paradise together!

584
00:55:43,404 --> 00:55:45,444
As Liet taught us.

585
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:50,652
As Liet taught us.

586
00:55:57,775 --> 00:55:59,566
Long live the Duke.

587
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,110
Long live Duke Paul Muad'dib.

588
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:10,031
Long live the fighters of Muad'dib!

589
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,289
Long live the fighters of Muad'dib!

590
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,700
The men have gathered the supplies.
We're almost ready to depart.

591
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,200
- What are they waiting for?
- For permission.

592
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:41,200
They know the Guild will strand any
force that lands here without its consent.

593
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,900
The Guild is protecting us?

594
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,000
They're afraid, Stil.

595
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,400
Afraid of what's to come.

596
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,500
They're searching for a way out.

597
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,620
They're searching for me.

598
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,600
What are we going to do?

599
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,200
Let them find me.

600
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,030
Come, Otheym.

601
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:31,691
I want you to choose several
of your best men.

602
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:34,607
Ones who you trust above all others.

603
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:38,730
Separate them from the rest
before we withdraw from here.

604
00:58:38,856 --> 00:58:39,855
As you wish.

605
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:43,104
Send them to the reservoir
in the Habbanya Erg.

606
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,644
Have them collect the Water of Life
we've hidden there.

607
00:58:47,435 --> 00:58:51,099
Muad'dib, I-I don't understand.

608
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:53,515
Those are changed waters...

609
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:57,429
...hidden there in case something
should happen to the Reverend Mother.

610
00:58:57,554 --> 00:59:01,677
Have the men find a pre-spice mass,
as large as possible.

611
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:06,424
Have them plant the waters
above the mass...

612
00:59:07,383 --> 00:59:10,173
...and wait for my orders.

613
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,383
Do you realize
what you're asking me to do?

614
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,439
What you've asked shall be done, Muad'dib.

615
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:50,294
The Baron insists
the southern areas are uninhabitable.

616
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,756
The Baron is mistaken.

617
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,384
Fremen?

618
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,136
There have been reports.

619
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,883
Only a few were investigated
according to Harkonnen documents.

620
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:04,796
Cost to profit too high apparently.

621
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,962
Many thopters were lost.

622
01:00:07,545 --> 01:00:10,083
Even smugglers won't venture there.

623
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:16,953
Send a light attack force immediately.

624
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:19,450
I want ground reconnaissance.

625
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,410
Perhaps this Muad'dib thinks
he can continue to attack us...

626
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:26,576
...then retreat into the wilderness
where we dare not follow.

627
01:00:30,704 --> 01:00:33,245
I'm about to strangle his options.

628
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,003
Let all Fremen who pass here...

629
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:03,837
...pause and pay homage to the shrine
of Duke Leto Atreides...

630
01:01:05,547 --> 01:01:08,880
...and all those who have died
in the service of justice.

631
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,593
Gurney.

632
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:54,391
Now all we need is a storm.

633
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,225
A great-grandmother of a storm.

634
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:59,600
Seems you'll have one soon enough.

635
01:02:00,142 --> 01:02:04,767
From here the future will open,
the clouds will part to reveal its glory.

636
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:07,060
And it gives me no peace.

637
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,976
I've seen what you've seen, Paul.

638
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,840
I know what's coming,
what you're about to let loose...

639
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:18,076
...not just here on Arrakis,
but across the entire universe.

640
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,069
But I am powerless to stop it.

641
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,684
Are you?

642
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:27,291
A terrible purpose awaits us, Mother.

643
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,088
This vast organism we call humanity
is about to reinvent itself...

644
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:34,429
...from the ashes of its own complacency.

645
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:36,602
The sleeper has awakened.

646
01:02:37,772 --> 01:02:41,283
Anything that tries to stop it
will be crushed.

647
01:02:43,456 --> 01:02:45,044
Even the innocent.

648
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,510
There are no innocents anymore.

649
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,679
Your father
would never have spoken this way.

650
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:53,510
I am not my father.

651
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:55,260
You are his son.

652
01:02:56,801 --> 01:03:00,048
More than his son. Much more.

653
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:03,713
Thanks to you.

654
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:11,583
Take a good look at me, Mother.

655
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:17,252
See something I learned
after I took the Water of Life.

656
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,753
Look into my eyes.

657
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,969
Look back through them, into my blood.

658
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:30,180
Harkonnen blood.

659
01:03:30,597 --> 01:03:32,265
Flowing in mine.

660
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,345
It flows from you.

661
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:38,254
I won't believe it.

662
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:40,999
Who was your father?

663
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:44,157
- Tell me.
- You know I can't...

664
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:44,946
Who?

665
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,485
I don't know. I don't know.

666
01:03:47,568 --> 01:03:50,312
- I have never known.
- Because they hid it from you.

667
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:52,683
Because they took me
when I was an infant.

668
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:55,097
Raised me in the Bene Gesserit ways...

669
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:57,343
...like all the others before and since.

670
01:03:57,427 --> 01:04:00,920
None know their mothers, or their fathers.

671
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,837
The Baron Harkonnen, Mother,
you're his daughter.

672
01:04:06,044 --> 01:04:08,168
The product of a clever seduction.

673
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:12,960
The handiwork of your precious
Bene Gesserit breeding programmes.

674
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:23,166
I'm his grandson.

675
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:35,375
They wanted to control things.

676
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,041
They couldn't control you.

677
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,634
You changed everything.

678
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:44,857
You had a son and now I'm here.

679
01:04:46,575 --> 01:04:48,709
The one they were seeking.

680
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:56,215
But I've arrived before my time,
and they're just beginning to realize it.

681
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,117
They're coming.

682
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,986
Check that room.

683
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,027
Over here.

684
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,082
Leto!

685
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,393
Muad'dib?

686
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,423
What is it?

687
01:07:37,463 --> 01:07:39,750
Our son is dead.

688
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:49,070
Will you look at that thing?

689
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:51,109
I count nine levels.

690
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,153
The fool's brought
the whole palace with him.

691
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:58,532
My dear Emperor,
I'm about to shatter your sanity.

692
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,451
Then I'm going to destroy you.

693
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,955
Not a thopter in the sky.

694
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,623
Everything's being pulled in and tied down.

695
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:11,748
They know a storm is coming.

696
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,915
Time to let them know I'm here.

697
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:21,623
The Sardaukar Captain,
alive and unharmed as you ordered.

698
01:08:32,581 --> 01:08:34,706
I am about to set you free.

699
01:08:37,624 --> 01:08:39,998
And you must take this with you.

700
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,667
These are terms for surrender.

701
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,503
They killed my son!

702
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,548
I can't do this.

703
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,090
You have no choice.

704
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,969
Don't be afraid.

705
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,226
Good.

706
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,352
Clean him up.

707
01:09:12,392 --> 01:09:15,014
Give him one of the Sardaukar uniforms
we've taken.

708
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:17,512
Full-rank insignia.

709
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,924
Let him face his master with dignity.

710
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:29,456
You're mad! Do you know that?

711
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,865
After you return with the Emperor's
answer then we can discuss who is mad.

712
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,475
The arrogance! The utter lunacy!

713
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,517
Your Majesty, if I may suggest...

714
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:53,773
...the time has come to loose the forces
of the Empire against this scum.

715
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,774
Shut your mouth.

716
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,943
It's you I have to thank for this mess.

717
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,572
You and your hapless family, Baron.

718
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:08,078
I really don't think that this is the time
to revisit old strategies.

719
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,664
I said quiet!

720
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,623
So, he wants an answer, does he?

721
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:58,128
So, here he is, the fat Baron himself.

722
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,674
He isn't much, is he?

723
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:06,345
What is this? Some kind of midget?

724
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,556
My dear Baron.

725
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,851
Meet the sister
of the one they call Muad'dib.

726
01:11:24,723 --> 01:11:26,930
Their shields are going up.

727
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:31,053
They've given us their answer.

728
01:11:31,178 --> 01:11:33,301
The thumpers have been activated.

729
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:38,383
It's time, Gurney.

730
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,170
Your Majesty, I had no idea.

731
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,165
He's lying, of course.

732
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:47,247
Quiet, child.

733
01:11:47,331 --> 01:11:49,452
Make him afraid some more.

734
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:53,279
It's time to bring this sorry episode
to a close.

735
01:11:53,696 --> 01:11:57,606
Time for your brother to surrender,
as the prize for your life.

736
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:02,818
No. I don't take orders from you, old man.

737
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,985
It's not wise to be so impudent, child.

738
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:14,562
You do not want to feel
the full force of my power.

739
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,391
I am beyond your power. Ask her.

740
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:20,389
Kill her.

741
01:12:22,845 --> 01:12:24,717
Kill her now.

742
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,671
She's the Abomination.

743
01:12:28,795 --> 01:12:31,499
The one the ancients warned us about.

744
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:35,161
What is this?

745
01:12:35,827 --> 01:12:37,657
Look at her, Father.

746
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:40,777
Can you not see it?

747
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:45,072
She is the daughter of Duke Leto.

748
01:12:45,156 --> 01:12:46,659
She is Atreides.

749
01:12:48,122 --> 01:12:50,755
Her brother is the duke's son, Paul.

750
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:55,811
He is the Muad'dib.

751
01:12:55,895 --> 01:12:57,149
Impossible.

752
01:12:58,277 --> 01:13:01,870
Have faith.
The endgame has already been written.

753
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,877
Do it, Gurney.

754
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:11,657
Do it now!

755
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,099
Kill her! She's in my mind!

756
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:19,347
Kill her!

757
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:28,034
My brother comes.

758
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,662
The shield wall is breached, Your Majesty.

759
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:54,469
The perimeter shields
won't hold against that.

760
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:27,638
Majesty, we must fall back to space
and reform.

761
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:33,013
Give her body to the storm!

762
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,722
Let the storm have what it can take.

763
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,379
I have her, Your Majesty!

764
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,025
Goodbye, Grandfather.

765
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:49,102
You've finally met
the Atreides' Gom Jabbar.

766
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,614
Majesty, we must retreat!

767
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,700
Prepare my shuttle.

768
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,091
Stilgar!

769
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:23,948
This way.

770
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,722
Some of the dying
asked to see the Reverend Mother.

771
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:20,555
She is with them.

772
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:01,053
This was my parents' room.

773
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:10,346
What little peace they had,
after we came to Arrakis...

774
01:23:11,047 --> 01:23:12,245
...was here.

775
01:23:13,469 --> 01:23:16,885
Tell me again about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'dib.

776
01:23:20,635 --> 01:23:23,635
Where water falls from the sky...

777
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:31,093
...and plants grow so thick
you can't walk in between them.

778
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:37,588
As Arrakis will be one day.

779
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:42,537
Paid for with the blood of our people.

780
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:48,942
Our fathers.

781
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,609
Our son.

782
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:00,159
He can never be replaced, Chani.

783
01:24:04,663 --> 01:24:07,124
But there will be other children.

784
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,452
I promise.

785
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:32,391
Is it over?

786
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,308
Almost.

787
01:24:56,524 --> 01:25:00,652
Perhaps my respected kinsman...

788
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:04,652
...thinks he has things his own way now.

789
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,510
There is a massed armada
of the great houses in the space...

790
01:25:09,594 --> 01:25:11,963
...over Arrakis, young Atreides.

791
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:14,792
I have but to give the word.

792
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,245
Your word means nothing anymore.

793
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:20,199
I am the Emperor!

794
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,406
Not for long.

795
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,611
Dispatch orders to your navigators.

796
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:40,860
You are to depart our space
and return the fleet to its homes at once.

797
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:46,067
The Guild does not take your orders.

798
01:25:46,942 --> 01:25:49,483
Tell them to look into the future.

799
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:57,188
They will see me staring back at them...

800
01:25:58,937 --> 01:26:01,143
...ready to give the order...

801
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:07,513
...the order to destroy
all spice production on this planet.

802
01:26:09,886 --> 01:26:12,260
My men are waiting in the desert.

803
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:17,547
There is a particularly large
and volatile pre-spice mass there.

804
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,974
I need but raise my finger...

805
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:23,696
...and the nest will be flooded
with the changed Water of Life.

806
01:26:23,821 --> 01:26:25,075
Jessica!

807
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,669
What have you done to us?

808
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:29,761
Spreading death among the makers.

809
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:31,935
Killing a cycle of life.

810
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,057
Creating a chain reaction
which will grow and grow...

811
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,345
...until there are no makers left...

812
01:26:39,176 --> 01:26:41,298
...until there is no spice left.

813
01:26:41,381 --> 01:26:43,419
Jessica, silence him!

814
01:26:43,627 --> 01:26:45,499
Silence him yourself.

815
01:26:47,246 --> 01:26:48,578
Can he do this?

816
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,742
They know I can do this.

817
01:26:52,155 --> 01:26:54,774
That's what they've feared the most.

818
01:26:56,274 --> 01:26:59,351
They've been monitoring the signals
my men have been sending.

819
01:27:00,224 --> 01:27:05,340
They know precisely where we are
and what we can do.

820
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:12,827
Without the spice
the navigators will become blind...

821
01:27:13,035 --> 01:27:15,738
...the Bene Gesserit will lose all powers...

822
01:27:15,822 --> 01:27:18,941
...and all commerce
among the great houses will cease!

823
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,955
Civilization will end.

824
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,698
If I am not obeyed...

825
01:27:30,031 --> 01:27:33,696
...the spice will not flow.

826
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:37,193
But it will be suicide.

827
01:27:46,232 --> 01:27:50,438
I think we both know the way out
of this difficulty, don't we?

828
01:27:53,187 --> 01:27:55,729
- Paul.
- Do not interfere, Mother.

829
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,183
This is for the good of us all.

830
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:00,306
Never.

831
01:28:00,973 --> 01:28:04,801
An adventurer like him.
A traitor to the Empire.

832
01:28:04,926 --> 01:28:08,839
Father, here is a man fit
to be your son.

833
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:12,916
Do you really think
I'd agree to such a thing?

834
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,665
What choice do we have?

835
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,541
Kanly.

836
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,879
I invoke Kanly.

837
01:28:27,676 --> 01:28:29,427
Which one is that?

838
01:28:29,636 --> 01:28:32,097
The Baron's other nephew, my Lord.

839
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,015
Feyd.

840
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,058
A cold-blooded killer.

841
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,774
So it comes down to this.

842
01:28:42,858 --> 01:28:44,317
It is my right...

843
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:48,572
...as the Baron now of House Harkonnen,
I demand satisfaction.

844
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:52,452
So you're what's left of the house
that killed my father.

845
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:54,114
It's down to us.

846
01:28:54,197 --> 01:28:56,314
Here we settle this vendetta
once and for all.

847
01:28:56,398 --> 01:28:59,305
He's a Harkonnen animal, Muad'dib.

848
01:28:59,387 --> 01:29:00,717
He's right, Milord.

849
01:29:00,884 --> 01:29:02,253
Let me kill him.

850
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,463
It will be my gift to you.

851
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:10,011
Is the great Muad'dib such a coward
that he sends others to do his dirty work?

852
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:11,595
Otheym.

853
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:18,143
Does this one fight in the Emperor's name?

854
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,524
If Feyd wishes it, he will meet you
with my blade in his hand.

855
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,191
I wish it!

856
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,274
May thy knife chip and shatter.

857
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,278
Paul, don't do it.

858
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:30,383
Would you like the Emperor's truthsayer
to prepare your spirit for its journey?

859
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,500
Or have you gone too native?

860
01:30:35,455 --> 01:30:39,352
Maybe you'd like that little pet up there,
the pretty one...

861
01:30:40,183 --> 01:30:43,584
...to say a few pagan rites?

862
01:30:45,201 --> 01:30:46,984
...before I claim her.

863
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,983
I am not afraid.

864
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,025
Nothing to say, Atreides?

865
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,236
Perhaps you'll answer this.

866
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,463
So you see, Atreides?

867
01:32:38,546 --> 01:32:40,251
Your death, fool.

868
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:44,825
The poison will stop your muscles,
and my knife will finish you.

869
01:32:47,447 --> 01:32:49,027
It's over...

870
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,356
...Cousin.

871
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,050
Irulan.

872
01:33:51,478 --> 01:33:53,620
You cannot stop this thing.

873
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,711
The spice must flow.

874
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:45,417
You see her standing there,
so haughty, so confident.

875
01:34:46,374 --> 01:34:50,199
Let us hope she finds solace
in her writing and her books.

876
01:34:50,324 --> 01:34:52,403
She'll have little else.

877
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:59,724
She may have my son's name,
but it is we...

878
01:34:59,848 --> 01:35:02,841
...the ones who carry

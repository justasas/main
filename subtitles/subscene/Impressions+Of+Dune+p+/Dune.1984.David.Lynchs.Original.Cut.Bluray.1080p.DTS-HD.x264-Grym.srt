1
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,600
A beginning is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Know then, that it is the year 10191.

3
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,000
The Known Universe is ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV, my father.

4
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,600
In this time, the most precious substance
in the Universe is the spice melange.

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,400
The spice extends life.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,700
The spice expands consciousness.

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,600
The spice is vital to space travel.
The Spacing Guild and its navigators, -

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,500
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

9
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,400
use the orange spice gas, which
gives them the ability to fold space.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,000
That is, travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,900
Oh, yes.
I forgot to tell you.

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,200
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,400
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,700
Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts
are a people known as the Fremen,

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,700
who have long held a prophecy,
that a man would come, a messiah.

16
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
who would lead them to true freedom.

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The planet is Arrakis.
Also known as Dune.

18
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,200
A secret report within the Guild.

19
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Four planets have come to our attention
regarding a plot which could jeopardize spice production.


20
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.

21
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,600
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

23
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Planet Kaitain, home of the Emperor
of the Known Universe.

24
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,300
Send a third-stage Guild Navigator to Kaitain
to demand details from the Emperor.

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
The spice must flow.

26
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
-Father?
-Irulan, you must leave.

27
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,700
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

28
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,400
-We felt his presence.
-I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.

29
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,600
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

30
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,800
He's here, my lord.

31
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,300
The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.

32
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,900
-Leave us.
-Yes, my lord.

33
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
We are alone.

34
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,400
-We have just folded space from lx.
-Yes?

35
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,500
-How was your journey?
-Many machines on lx.

36
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,300
-New machines.
-Oh? Yes.

37
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,000
Better than those on Richese.

38
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,700
You are transparent.
I see many things.

39
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I see plans within plans.
I see two great houses,

40
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,500
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.

41
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,600
-I see you behind it.
-Yes

42
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,100
You must share with us.

43
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,600
The Atreides House is building a secret army using a
technique unknown to us. A technique involving sound.

44
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,900
The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad.
He could threaten me.

45
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,400
I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine
the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the Harkonnens.

46
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,000
House Atreides will not refuse because of the
tremendous power they think they will gain.

47
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Then, at an appointed time, Baron Harkonnen will return
to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides.

48
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,000
I have promised the baron five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

49
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,200
-So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides.
-Yes.

50
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,500
-One small point.
<i>-Here it comes.</i>

51
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,200
We, ourselves, foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.
Paul.

52
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,300
Paul Atreides.

53
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,000
-You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides, his father?
-I mean Paul Atreides.

54
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
We want him killed.

55
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I did not say this.
I am not here.

56
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
I understand.

57
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,900
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

58
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,900
We must have a look at Paul Atreides.
On Caladan.

59
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,800
Planet Caladan

60
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,500
The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood for
90 generations, has been manipulating bloodlines

61
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,300
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach.
A super being.

62
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,700
On Caladan, Jessica, a member of the sisterhood
and the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides

63
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,600
had been ordered to bear only daughters.
Because of her love for the Duke,

64
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,300
she disobeyed and gave birth to a son. Paul.

65
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
Paul Atreides.

66
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,300
<i>Here we are now. Caladan.</i>

67
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,800
<i>And 19 light-years beyond.
Beyond Bene Tleilax.</i>

68
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,900
The training planet of the Mentats, the human computers.
Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.

69
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,900
<i>There, Arrakis.</i>
Spice Mining.

70
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,400
Carry-alls lower the harvester to the sand,
and lift it off to safety when a worm attacks.

71
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,100
Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.

72
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Weather. See storms.
No Precipitation.

73
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,300
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

74
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,100
<i>And the Harkonnens are near. There.
Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen. The enemy.</i>

75
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,100
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn to destroy House Atreides,
and steal the ducal signet ring for himself.

76
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,300
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

77
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,500
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,
and Gurney coming down the hall.

78
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,100
Those sounds could be imitated!

79
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,700
-I'd know the difference.
<i>-Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</i>

80
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,700
My father sent you to test me.
Music, then?

81
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,000
-No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
-Shield practice?

82
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,500
-Gurney, we had practice this morning. I'm not in the mood.
-Not in the mood?

83
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,300
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.
Not fighting!

84
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,400
-I'm sorry, Gurney.
-Not sorry enough.

85
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,900
What's wrong with Gurney?
He's not faking this.

86
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,600
Now, guard yourself for true!

87
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,200
-Is this what you seek?
-Good.

88
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,300
The slow blade penetrates the shield. But, ah

89
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
look down.

90
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We'd have joined each other in death.

91
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,400
You did seem finally to get in the mood.

92
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,700
-Would you really have drawn my blood?
-If you'd have fought one whit below your abilities,

93
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,500
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.

94
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,800
-Things have been so serious here lately.
-Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

95
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,500
Arrakis is real.
The Harkonnens are real.

96
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,700
Doctor Yueh, do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

97
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,000
I've obtained a filmbook of a small specimen.
Only 125 meters long.

98
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,400
-Only?
-There have been documented sightings of worms

99
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:17,300
as large as 450 meters in the deep desert.
That's far from where we'll be in Arrakeen.

100
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,900
The desert belt and the south polar region
are marked forbidden.

101
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,300
-How do the Fremen survive there?
-We don't know much about the Fremen.

102
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,900
They live in the deep desert, some of them in the cities.
They have blue-within-blue eyes.

103
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,300
The eyes. Yes... Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

104
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,600
-Could the spice affect us in other ways?
-Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

105
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,700
For one, the Harkonnens would not have
given up their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

106
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,600
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.
But behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.

107
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
You'll make a formidable duke.

108
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,900
Now, remember, the first step in avoiding a trap

109
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,000
is knowing of its existence.

110
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,300
-I know, but if it is a trap then why are we going?
-We have our new army.

111
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,200
Doctor Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

112
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Clear and lock the room!

113
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,500
Activate a fighter.

114
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,900
Make the range two meters.

115
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Precise control.

116
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Duncan!

117
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Paul, I was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

118
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,800
-I have to go on ahead, alone, I won't be seeing you for a while.
-I wish you were coming with us. Why?

119
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,100
It's something for your father.
He wants to talk to you.

120
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,700
I'll see you on Arrakis.

121
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,300
-May the hand of God be with you.
-May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.

122
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,800
-Father.
-Thank you for joining me, Paul.

123
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,700
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

124
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,200
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

125
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,400
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.

126
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,300
-Makes me feel very proud.
-I want you to be proud of me.

127
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,700
I'll miss the sea.

128
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,400
But a person needs new experiences.

129
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,900
They jar something deep inside
allowing him to grow.

130
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Without change,

131
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,900
something sleeps inside us,

132
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,700
and seldom awakens.

133
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,400
The sleeper must awaken.

134
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,900
Arrakis...

135
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Dune. Desert Planet.

136
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,400
I will kill you.

137
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,700
The second moon.

138
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,800
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

139
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:49,400
<i>I know she has come to test him.
No man has ever been tested with the box.</i>

140
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>Tonight, I may lose my son.</i>

141
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,600
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

142
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,800
-Jessica!
-It meant so much to him.

143
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,700
You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?
Desires don't come into this.

144
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,600
An Atreides daughter could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach.

145
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,800
We may lose both bloodlines now.

146
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,800
I vowed never to regret my decision.

147
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,600
-I'll pay for all my own mistakes.
-And your son will pay with you.

148
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,300
Arrakis... Dune...

149
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,700
Desert Planet.

150
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
Moving.

151
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,000
We'll salvage what we can.
But I can tell you, dear God,

152
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,100
for the father, nothing.
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

153
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,400
Did you really think you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?
The Universe's super being?

154
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,000
How dare you!
My greatest student.

155
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,500
And my greatest disappointment.

156
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
He's awake. He's listening to us.
Good!

157
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,100
Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides. I want to see you
in your mother's chambers in one-quarter of an hour.

158
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,100
Paul... this is very important.

159
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,400
<i>Kwisatz Haderach? The super being?
For the father, nothing?</i>

160
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,200
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

161
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,400
She's going to observe you.

162
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,000
-Please. Jessica, you know it must be done.

163
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,200
<i>Your Reverence. What does she fear?</i>

164
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,300
-What about my father?
-Paul...

165
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,500
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

166
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,200
Now, you, come here.

167
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,000
She's using the Voice.

168
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,200
-No.
<i>-Some strength there. Surprising.</i>

169
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,600
Come here.

170
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you see this?

171
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,300
-Put your right hand in the box.
-What's in the box?

172
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,300
Pain. Stop!

173
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,700
Put your hand in the box.

174
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:40,100
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.
This one kills only animals.

175
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,000
-Are you suggesting the Duke's son is an animal?
-Let us say, I suggest you may be human.

176
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,800
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

177
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Your instinct will be to remove your hand
from the box. If you do so,

178
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,300
you die.

179
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,100
You will feel

180
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
an itching

181
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,100
there.

182
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,400
Now, the itching becomes burning.

183
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,100
-Heat upon heat upon heat. Upon heat.
-It burns.

184
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Silence! Silence!

185
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.</i>

186
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,700
<i>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
I must not fear.</i>

187
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,800
-You feel the flesh crisping.
<i>-Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.</i>

188
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,700
-Flesh dropping off.

189
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:59,200
<i>Fear is the little death.  I must not fear.
Fear is the little death.  I'm...</i>

190
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,400
-The pain!
-No! Enough!

191
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,300
Kull wahad! No woman child
ever withstood that much.

192
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,300
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

193
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,000
Do it!

194
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Pain by nerve induction.
A human can resist any pain.

195
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,100
-Our test is crisis and observation.
-I see the truth of it.

196
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,400
<i>Could he be the one? Maybe.</i>

197
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,900
<i>But will he be ours to control?</i>

198
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,900
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

199
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:01,600
Do you know of the Water of Life?
The bile from the newborn worms of Arrakis?

200
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,100
-I have heard of it.
-It is very dangerous.

201
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,200
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

202
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,100
There is a place

203
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,600
terrifying to us, to women.

204
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,500
It is said a man will come.

205
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,600
The Kwisatz Haderach.

206
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,700
He will go
where we cannot.

207
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
-Many men have tried.
-They tried and failed?

208
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,400
They tried and died.

209
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Jessica.

210
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,000
<i>My son lives!</i>

211
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,300
I sense your teachings in him.
Ignore the regular order of training.

212
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,600
-His safety requires the Voice.
-I've heard enough of my safety.

213
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,500
What about my father?
I heard your talking.

214
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
-You speak as if he were dead. Well, he's not!
-Paul.

215
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,800
-Well, he's not. And he won't die. Tell me he won't die.
-What can be done has been done.

216
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,400
Mother, tell me!

217
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,300
Planet Giedi Prime

218
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Mentat Piter De Vries. Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.
The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.

219
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:01,300
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.

220
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

221
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,400
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.  It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.

222
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,700
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

223
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,500
-My lord.
-Piter.

224
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,900
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron,
and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.

225
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,100
-What does Leto say, Piter?
-He wishes to inform you that vendetta,

226
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,200
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,
the art of Kanly, is still alive.

227
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,300
He does not wish to meet or speak with you.

228
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,500
I've made my peace gesture.
The forms of Kanly have been obeyed.

229
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

230
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,200
As you instructed me, I have enlightened
your nephews concerning my plan...

231
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
My plan.

232
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,300
The plan to crush the Atreides.

233
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,600
Feyd... Rabban...

234
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,200
go quietly.

235
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,900
No other great house of the Landsraad must ever
know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.

236
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,700
The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron
and the Emperor.

237
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Put the pick in there, Pete,
and turn it round real neat.

238
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,700
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

239
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,000
Your skin, love to me.
Your diseases

240
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,300
lovingly cared for, for all eternity.

241
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,500
I will have Arrakis back for myself!
He who controls the spice,

242
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,100
controls the Universe! And what Piter did not tell you is we have control of someone who is very close,

243
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,600
very close to Duke Leto.
This person,

244
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,900
this traitor, will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

245
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,200
-And who is this traitor?
-I won't tell you who the traitor is,

246
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,900
or when we'll attack. However,

247
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,700
the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know...
He'll know that it is I,

248
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,000
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

249
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,300
<i>This is what I'll do to the Duke and his family.</i>

250
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh, I'll miss
Caladan so much.

251
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
<i>Caladan...</i>

252
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,200
Soon they will
begin to fold space.

253
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,200
<i>Far off in the control rooms
of spice gas. Traveling...</i>

254
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,400
<i>...without moving.</i>

255
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,900
And now... the prophecy.

256
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,300
One will come.

257
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:38,300
The voice from the outer world.
Bringing the Holy War, the Jihad,

258
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,500
which will cleanse the Universe,
and bring us out of darkness.

259
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:20,400
House Atreides took control of Arrakis
63 standard days into the year 10191.

260
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:28,000
It was known that the Harkonnens, the former rulers
of Arrakis, would leave many suicide troops behind.

261
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,900
Atreides' patrols
were doubled.

262
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,600
Duncan.

263
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,800
What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan?
Tell me.

264
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,000
-Why haven't we heard from you?
-My lord, I suspect so much.

265
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I think they are the allies we seek. They are strong, fierce.
They do not give their loyalty easily or quickly.

266
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,400
As you know, the Imperium has never
been able to take a census of the Fremen.

267
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,400
Everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert. My lord,

268
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,200
I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet.
That the Fremen exist

269
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,000
in vast numbers.  Vast.

270
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,400
And it is they who control Arrakis.

271
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,000
Each trooper will be charged with responsibility
for preserving water.

272
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,500
Our existence as an operating army
depends on these following water-saving procedures.

273
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,100
Remember, water is life.

274
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,200
Why is the shield not yet up?

275
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,700
Sir, we found and removed another sabotage device.
I think it'll go up now, sir.

276
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,500
They're finding these sabotage devices too easily.

277
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,200
House shields activated.

278
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Duke Leto is now here.
Spice mining inspection to start immediately.

279
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So you are Doctor Kynes.
The Judge of the Change.

280
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
-And the Imperial Ecologist, Sire.
-Our intelligence informs us that there's still a strong Harkonnen presence.

281
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,700
-The process of removal continues.
-This is my son, Paul.

282
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,400
-Are you a Fremen?
-I've been on Arrakis in the service of the Emperor, long enough for my eyes to change.

283
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,100
-In the service of the Emperor.
-We are in your hands, Doctor.

284
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,000
Your gift of the stillsuits is much appreciated.
Will you give us an explanation of their workings?

285
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,400
Well, this is a still suit of Fremen manufacture,
the most efficient type on Arrakis. Basically...

286
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,600
-It's all right, Gurney.
-Yes, Sire.

287
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,100
Basically, it's a high-efficiency
filter, and heat exchange system.

288
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,700
Perspiration passes through the first layer
and is gathered in the second.

289
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:01,200
The salt is separated.
Breathing and walking provide the pumping action.

290
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,400
The reclaimed water circulates to catch pockets
from which you can drink

291
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,900
through this tube
around your neck.

292
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,000
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

293
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,700
Should you be in the open desert,
remember to breathe in through your mouth

294
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:26,000
and out through this nose tube.
With a Fremen suit in good working condition,

295
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,700
life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert,
Sire.

296
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,500
My thanks.

297
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,100
With your permission. You've worn a stillsuit before.
-No.

298
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,600
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.
Who told you how to do that?

299
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,200
No one. It seemed the proper way.

300
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,400
That it is.
<i>He shall know your ways as if born to them.</i>

301
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,500
We're wasting time, Sire.

302
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,400
That language?
Translate it.

303
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,600
Very faint.

304
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,500
Harkonnen.

305
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,700
Air speed, zero-five.

306
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,300
Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.

307
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,400
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

308
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,000
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

309
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Ambient temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

310
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,300
Air speed, one-three-zero.

311
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:26,300
Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall and entered open desert.

312
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,400
-Will we see a worm?
-Where there is spice and spice mining,

313
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,400
-there are always worms.
-Always? -Always.

314
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,000
Why do they come?

315
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,700
To protect their territory.
Vibrations attract them.

316
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,200
<i>He must be a Fremen or in with them.
He's studying us.</i>

317
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,300
<i>He's hiding something about the spice.</i>

318
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,000
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

319
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,300
As I said, they defend
the spice sands.

320
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,700
As to their relationship
with the spice, who knows?

321
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,200
<i>My message, it's here.</i>

322
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,800
There are more enemy bodies coming in for your
inspection, Doctor Yueh.

323
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,100
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine. Thank you, Thufir.

324
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,800
-Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
-That's it. Spice mining.

325
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,200
No other cloud quite like it.

326
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,800
Wormsign? Is it wormsign?

327
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Yes. Worm. Big one.
You've got sharp eyes.

328
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
May I?

329
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,000
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

330
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,100
-Who calls Pad Nine?
-Don't mention the Duke. This is an un-coded channel.

331
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,200
Unlisted flight northeast of you.
Wormsign on intercept course.

332
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,600
-Estimated contact, 15 minutes.
-Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for a fix.

333
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:44,100
Contact in 16 minutes minus.  Very precise estimate.
Who's on that unlisted flight?

334
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,000
-What happens now?
-The carry-all will come and lift off the spice harvester.

335
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Try to get in close over the harvester.
You'll find this interesting, Sire.  They work until the very last minute.

336
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,800
Spotter control, there's no sign of the carryall.
It isn't answering.

337
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,700
The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

338
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,900
Spotter control, give me a report by the numbers.

339
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,100
Report One. No contact.
Report Two. Negative.

340
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,400
Report Three. Negative, Sire.

341
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,800
Report Four. No contact.
Repeat, no contact.

342
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,000
-I think they've got our carryall.
-Damn it! Harkonnens.

343
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,700
We're coming down to take you off the harvester.
All spotters are ordered to comply.

344
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,400
-Ordered by whom?
-Duke Leto Atreides.

345
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,900
-Yes. Yes Sire.
-How many men do you have?
-Full crew, 26 men.

346
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,800
-But, Sire, we can't leave all this spice.
-Damn the spice! Get out of there!

347
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:58,400
Two men in each of the spotters!
You, over here! Run! Run!

348
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,300
I can't see him yet, but he is very close now.
Damn sloppy.

349
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,600
Really damn sloppy. Come on, boys.
Come on.

350
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,400
-We're going to be heavy, Sire.
<i>Spice.</i>

351
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,000
<i>Pure unrefined spice.</i>

352
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Here he is!
We've got to go!

353
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:49,100
Bless the Maker and his water. Bless the coming and going of Him.
May His passing cleanse the world.

354
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,300
-What's that you're saying?
-Nothing.

355
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,000
Gods, what a monster.

356
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,000
Someone is going to pay for this, I promise.

357
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:51,500
<i>He's more concerned over
his men than the spice. I must admit...</i>

358
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,400
<i>against all better judgment,
I like this Duke.</i>

359
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,200
My lady, the local people, the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

360
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Hawat has cleared them.

361
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,600
Excuse me, my lady.

362
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,800
The Harkonnens may have tampered with them medically.

363
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,100
When you said Harkonnens,

364
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,800
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

365
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,300
Well, my wife... But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

366
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,400
-The Har...
-Forgive me.

367
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,400
<i>- They must have killed her.</i>
-Please excuse me if I can't talk about it.

368
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,700
<i>He's holding something back.
Yet....</i>

369
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,500
<i>There's the imperial conditioning....</i>

370
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,000
<i>Assurance of trust.</i>

371
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,400
<i>The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.
Where is your son?</i>

372
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,000
<i>I must warn you.
You are in great danger.</i>

373
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,400
Safe.

374
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,100
<i>Spice.</i>

375
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,700
<i>What is it doing to me?</i>

376
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,200
<i>Second moon.</i>

377
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,300
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

378
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,400
<i>Am I the one?</i>

379
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,000
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>

380
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,400
<i>It can't get me
if I don't move.</i>

381
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,500
<i>It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.</i>

382
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,300
<i>I've got to try to grab it. The suspensor field will make
it slippery on the bottom.</i>

383
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,000
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>

384
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,800
<i>Who is operating that thing?
It has to be someone in the palace.</i>

385
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,500
<i>I could shout for help,
but it would kill whoever opened the door.</i>

386
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,600
<i>Hold still.</i>

387
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,400
-It would have killed me.
-I was its target.

388
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,000
It went to the motion.

389
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,900
-Who are you?
-I am the Shadout Mapes, the housekeeper.

390
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,400
I must cleanse the way between us.
You saved my life, and

391
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,700
we Fremen pay our debts.
<i>A Fremen.</i>

392
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:25,500
It is known to us that you've a traitor
in your midst.

393
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:30,800
Who it is, we cannot say.
but we are certain of it.

394
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,300
A traitor.

395
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,800
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

396
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,800
Harkonnen.

397
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>They've tried to take the life of my son.</i>

398
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:21,300
-Sector 6 through 80 progress reports, Sire.
-Take it, Thufir.

399
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:30,300
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the summit, the 8th, quadrant over,
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

400
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,500
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

401
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,000
Uh, the palace is now secure.

402
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,800
The city of Arrakeen is under martial law.
We have troops here

403
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,600
headquartered underground
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

404
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,100
The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen,
and we have some on the airfield.

405
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,900
Our new army is still in training, but everything,
everything is shielded.

406
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,800
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

407
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,700
Sleep well, my son.

408
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,800
Um, Father, drugged.

409
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,200
<i>Jessica, what is wrong?</i>

410
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,900
<i>Forgive me, my beloved concubine.
I should have married you.</i>

411
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:43,900
<i>Why hold a dream to ascend to the throne
through a political marriage?</i>

412
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,700
<i>I should have married you.</i>

413
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,600
What happened?

414
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,900
Yueh! <i>He sabotaged the house generators.
We are wide open!</i>

415
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,600
-House shield deactivating.
-I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules.

416
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,300
I've brought House Atreides down.  -Why?
I wish to kill a man.

417
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,800
Not you, my dear Duke.
You were already dead.

418
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,500
But you'll get close to the Baron before you die.
You'll be tied and drugged, but you can still attack.

419
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,900
You can still attack!

420
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,500
When you see the Baron,
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

421
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,800
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

422
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,800
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

423
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,100
-Refuse....
-No! You mustn't!

424
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:36,200
Because, in return, I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.

425
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,100
For Paul.

426
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,600
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

427
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,900
The tooth! The tooth!

428
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,800
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

429
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,500
Open the doors!

430
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,300
Signals!

431
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,000
Get that shield up!
The shield! The shield!

432
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,700
<i>The weirding modules!
Destroyed!</i>

433
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,900
Long live Duke Leto!

434
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,900
The drug was timed.

435
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:12,600
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

436
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,300
What a pity you must remain gagged.

437
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,800
We can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's voice,
now, can we?

438
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:30,400
<i>Leto, where are you?
How simple to subdue us.</i>

439
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:50,100
Goodbye, Jessica.
And goodbye to your sweet son.

440
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:55,800
I want to spit once on your head.
Just some spittle in your face.

441
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,200
What a luxury.

442
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,100
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

443
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,800
<i>I wish this was Paul.</i>

444
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,000
I knew Yueh's wife.

445
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,500
I was the one who broke
his Imperial conditioning.

446
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,200
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.

447
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,100
It is perhaps better that you die
in the innards of a worm.

448
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:01,600
-What are your orders, Piter?
-Take them to the desert, as the traitor suggested.

449
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:08,000
The worms will destroy the evidence.
Their bodies must never be found.

450
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,900
They're down on this floor
somewhere.  Down there.

451
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,800
Duncan!

452
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,700
You wish now to join your wife?
Is that it, traitor?

453
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,800
-She lives?
-You wish to join her?

454
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,500
Join her, then.

455
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,800
You think you've defeated me?

456
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:29,400
You think I don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!

457
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,500
Take him away.

458
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,900
<i>Yueh's sign.</i>

459
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,300
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>

460
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,400
Don't touch my mother!

461
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,300
<i>He's trying the Voice.
The Reverend Mother said it could save him.</i>

462
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,800
-Did you hear a noise from the little one, huh?
-No, I didn't hear anything.

463
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,900
The little one.

464
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,200
-Remove her gag.
-<i>Excellent!</i>

465
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,200
There's no need to fight over me.

466
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,300
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>

467
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:35,300
First cut my son's bonds.

468
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,100
<i>That's it.</i>

469
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,400
<i>It's under control.</i>

470
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,000
Duke Leto Atreides.

471
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:55,200
Where is the ducal signet ring?
I must have his ring.

472
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,200
The ring!

473
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,600
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

474
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,400
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

475
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:17,200
<i>The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?
Paul and Jessica safe.</i>

476
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,500
<i>-Yes. The tooth!</i>
-He's coming around, Baron.

477
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,900
Where's your ring? Huh?
You do not answer?

478
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:32,800
<i>-Wait! Wait!
-You must come closer.</i>

479
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,800
The water of my life... for Paul.

480
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:45,100
He's crying.
He's crying!

481
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,500
What does that mean,
Piter?

482
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,300
<i>Come closer Baron.</i>

483
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
<i>No! Jessica... Leto...</i>

484
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,100
Leto, he's dead!

485
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,900
-No, he's dead!
-I know.

486
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,600
Am I alive?

487
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:31,000
-Am I alive?
-Yes, you're alive, my Baron.

488
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,500
I'm alive, eh?
I'm alive!

489
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,500
Lever!

490
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:54,200
I can't maintain any altitude.
We'll never reach the safety of rock!

491
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,900
-Maybe that small rock.
-Where are we, do you think?

492
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,700
The south polar regions.
The forbidden area.

493
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,200
Hold on!

494
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,600
Hurry!

495
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,400
Take the stillsuits!

496
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,700
Hurry!
This crash might bring a worm.

497
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:38,600
-The signet.
-A million deaths are not enough for Yueh!

498
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,500
<i>Where are my feelings?
I feel for no one.</i>

499
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,700
<i>The second moon.</i>

500
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:33,400
I mean Paul Atreides.
We want him killed.

501
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,300
<i>Why? Why do they want me killed?</i>

502
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,800
<i>It has to be something
to do with the spice. But what?</i>

503
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,500
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

504
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,200
<i>This moon holds my future.</i>

505
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,500
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

506
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,900
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

507
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,800
<i>They will call me... Muad'Dib.</i>

508
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,900
Listen to me. Listen!

509
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:58,200
You wanted to know about my dreams.
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

510
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,700
Do you know why?
The spice!

511
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,500
-It's in everything here.
-Calm yourself.

512
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,900
Like the Truthsayer drug.

513
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,600
It's a poison. You knew the spice
would change me.

514
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,100
But thanks to your teachings,
it's changing my consciousness.

515
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,700
-I see it! I can see it!
<i>-Is he the one?</i>

516
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:32,100
-You carry my unborn sister in your womb.
<i>-He knows.</i>

517
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,100
Father!

518
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,600
<i>Father, I promise,
one day the sleeper will awaken.</i>

519
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:59,900
<i>And I will avenge your death.
I will not stop...</i>

520
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:04,200
<i>until I destroy the Emperor and the Baron.</i>

521
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,200
Father.

522
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,800
Go now.

523
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,800
Take him to his desert to die.

524
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,700
Go.

525
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,700
<i>Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.</i>

526
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,700
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

527
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:31,100
We have entered the time when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.

528
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,100
It's further than I thought.

529
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,700
A worm is sure to come.

530
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:58,100
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

531
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:32,300
Remember, walk without rhythm, and we won't attract a worm.
It will go to the thumper.

532
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,100
I'm ready.

533
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,700
Faster!

534
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,100
It's deafening!

535
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,100
<i>The spice!</i>

536
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,600
-Do you smell it?
-Yes!

537
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,500
<i>A thumper.</i>

538
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:38,600
<i>The worm. Spice!
Is there a relationship?</i>

539
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:55,900
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

540
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,400
Someone started
another thumper.

541
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,600
We're not alone.

542
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,500
-Man-carved steps.
-Yes.

543
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,400
<i>Such stealth.
I didn't hear them.</i>

544
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,900
Perhaps these are the ones the Shadout Mapes told us of?
I will take the boy-man.

545
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,300
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

546
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,800
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

547
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Great Gods!

548
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:26,600
If you can do this to the strongest of us,
you're worth 10 times your weight of water.

549
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:35,900
As the leader of my people, I give you my bond.
Teach us this weirding way,

550
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:43,100
and you both shall have sanctuary.
Your water shall mingle with our water.

551
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

552
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:56,000
-I give you the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
-It is the legend.

553
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:06,800
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

554
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,600
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

555
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,400
<i>From my dreams.
So beautiful....</i>

556
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,500
Come with me.  I'll show you
an easier way down.

557
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:43,800
You have strength.
You shall be known as Usul,

558
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,700
which is the strength of the base of the pillar.
This is your secret name in our troop.

559
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:55,400
But you must choose the name of manhood,
which we will call you openly.

560
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:03,100
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

561
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:12,000
-We call that one Muad'Dib.
-Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

562
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,600
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

563
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:21,800
And your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.
We welcome you.

564
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,200
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>

565
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,400
-Moisture.
-Wind traps. Huge ones.

566
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,500
<i>Water. Millions of dekaliters.</i>

567
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,000
-A treasure.
-Greater than treasure, Usul.

568
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:16,600
We have thousands of such caches,

569
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,700
and only a few of us know them all.

570
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:26,400
And when we have enough, we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

571
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,800
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

572
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,500
<i>"Tell me of your home world, Usul."</i>

573
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,000
Rabban! Rabban!

574
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:42,100
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!
We've gutted them! We've gutted them!

575
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,300
Rabban! Rabban!

576
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:57,200
I place you in charge of Arrakis.
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

577
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,800
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

578
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:09,800
Give me spice! Drive them! Drive them into utter submission!
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

579
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:14,500
-Never stop! Go! Go! Show no mercy!
-Yes, Baron!

580
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,900
Feyd...

581
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:52,800
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

582
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,200
I'll send you. Feyd.

583
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,400
Lovely Feyd.

584
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,200
Where's my doctor?

585
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,700
Jessica...

586
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:26,200
our Reverend Mother is too old.

587
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:31,500
She has been calling through space and time, for you to come
and let her rest.

588
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:37,500
She asks that you pass within, and become
our Reverend Mother.

589
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:44,800
If you be a Reverend Mother,

590
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,500
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

591
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,700
<i>The Water of Life.</i>

592
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,300
<i>But what of my unborn child?</i>

593
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,400
<i>One day, I will have to do this.</i>

594
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:29,800
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition, the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life as she surrendered her knowledge.

595
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,700
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

596
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:40,900
<i>Every man who has tried has died.</i>

597
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,700
<i>Am I the one?</i>

598
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:47,500
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

599
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:57,100
The tremendous power of the Water of Life
caused the premature birth of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

600
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:02,600
Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

601
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:24,700
Feyd, even though he's aging,
Thufir is one of the finest Mentats in the Universe.

602
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:29,500
And he's mine, Feyd,
all mine.

603
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:35,600
Try it now.  -I will.
Come.

604
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:55,000
Oh, Thufir! I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

605
01:35:56,200 --> 01:36:02,500
Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.
But this is not why we're here.

606
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:06,500
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

607
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:10,600
You must care for it if you wish to live.

608
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:16,500
A poison has been introduced into your body, Thufir Hawat.
By milking this,

609
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:23,500
this smooth, little cat body, you receive your antidote.
It must be done each day.

610
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:32,100
All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill.

611
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:41,100
Feyd, no, no. Thufir's a Harkonnen now.
Aren't you, Thufir?

612
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:46,500
<i>My Duke, how I've failed you.</i>

613
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,100
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>

614
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:10,200
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

615
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:41,100
<i>The Holy Warriors.
No one ever dreamed there were so many.</i>

616
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:46,300
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

617
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:56,800
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,
are once again in control of Arrakis,

618
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:02,400
Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother
to teach you the weirding way

619
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,200
to crush the Harkonnens.

620
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:12,000
We must do more than this.
We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.

621
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:18,300
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

622
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,800
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

623
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:30,200
I will take 100 of your warriors and train them.
This 100 will train the thousands that remain.

624
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,800
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

625
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,100
The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

626
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,400
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

627
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,200
Orato.

628
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:59,900
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

629
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,500
Kick it.

630
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,500
Hit it.

631
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,300
Yell at it.

632
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,300
Break!

633
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:29,100
Korba, cut it.

634
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,800
Move back.

635
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,000
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

636
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,600
Some thoughts have a certain sound,
that being the equivalent to a form.

637
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:29,900
Through sound and motion,
you will be able to paralyze nerves,

638
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:36,400
shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

639
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:41,300
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

640
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,400
Stilgar.

641
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,500
Muad'Dib.

642
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:13,500
<i>My name is a killing word.
They are ready to fight.</i>

643
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:19,400
<i>Yet in order to lead them, I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>

644
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:34,600
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch,
and ride as a leader of men.

645
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:36,700
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

646
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,500
<i>Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.</i>

647
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:54,000
Usul has called a big one!
Again, it is the legend.

648
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:14,400
Usul, these are 15 of our finest warriors
to serve you as your guard.

649
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,300
The Fedaykin.

650
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,800
Now.

651
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:05,900
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>

652
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:09,600
<i>The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.</i>

653
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,800
Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib...

654
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,800
What happened to you and your men?

655
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,100
-Muad'Dib!
-What are you saying?

656
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:37,900
-He's been repeating that name ever since we found him.
-Who is this Muad'Dib?

657
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:52,200
In the two standard years that followed, Muad'Dib and the Fremen
brought spice production to a standstill.

658
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:59,500
Fearing for his life, Rabban did his best
to hide this fact from his uncle, the Baron.

659
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:09,700
Paul's sister Alia matured at a frightening rate.
Her small body harbored

660
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:12,300
tremendous powers.

661
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,200
Paul and Chant's love grew.

662
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:25,100
-We surprised a band of smugglers.
-Too bad. I thought they were Harkonnen.

663
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,300
Gurney!

664
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:45,800
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

665
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,400
-Don't you trust your own eyes?
-They said you were dead.

666
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,600
They said...

667
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:08,200
-Gurney!
-You young pup!

668
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:32,000
Emperor Shaddam lV, you have one last chance
to take matters into your own hands,

669
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,300
- and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

670
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,400
-What do you mean, one last...
-Silence. Do not speak. Listen!

671
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:45,800
You do not have more than this one chance.
I represent the entire Guild in this matter.

672
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:51,700
Our navigators warn you that spice production is in great danger.
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

673
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:57,900
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.
Our navigators suggest he is not of Arrakis.

674
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:02,800
No one on the outside world has been able to see him.
We do not know who he is.

675
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,400
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

676
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:12,400
Remedy this situation, restore spice production,
or you'll live out your life in a pain amplifier.

677
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:25,300
The Emperor will stop him.
He won't take the Water of Life.

678
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:30,100
<i>That's why they want me killed.
They're afraid I'll take the Water of Life.</i>

679
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:36,100
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once!

680
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:43,800
-50 legions?  That's our entire reserves as well.
-This is genocide, the deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis!

681
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:49,200
-The Emperor is coming!
-Chani! Chani!

682
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:56,100
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

683
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:02,600
Oh, Chani.
All the images of my future are gone.

684
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:09,100
-I have to drink the Water of Life.
-No, Paul, please.

685
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:13,500
I've seen the men who have tried.
I've seen how they died.

686
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:18,200
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

687
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,700
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

688
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,700
Paul...

689
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:32,600
I must drink the sacred water.

690
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,100
<i>I must go now.</i>

691
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:36,700
-Hurry. All I see is darkness.
-Paul...

692
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,800
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

693
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,100
You are my life.

694
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:06,100
<i>-Many men have tried.
-They tried and failed?</i>

695
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:08,700
<i>They tried and died.</i>

696
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:21,700
<i>The worm is the spice.
The spice is the worm.</i>

697
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,700
<i>The worms.</i>

698
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,600
They're not attacking.
Why?

699
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,500
Alia...

700
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,100
Mother.

701
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,200
It's Paul.

702
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:35,100
He's taken the Water of Life.

703
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:49,600
<i>There is a place, terrifying to us,
to women.</i>

704
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:54,100
<i>This is the place
they cannot look.</i>

705
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,800
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

706
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:10,000
<i>Now I truly control the worm...
and the spice..</i>

707
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:16,500
<i>And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!</i>

708
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,500
Paul...

709
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:01,200
Father!

710
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:09,100
Father, the sleeper has awakened!

711
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:33,100
Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

712
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:42,000
Your time has come.
A storm is coming. Our storm.

713
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:48,600
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

714
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,800
Emperor, we come for you!

715
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,700
We come for you!

716
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,800
-Long live the fighters!
-Long live the fighters!

717
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:54,100
Suspicion confirmed. The Emperor's
had Rabban seized.

718
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:40,100
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

719
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:44,100
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

720
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,000
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

721
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:54,700
Usul, we have wormsign,
the likes of which even God has never seen.

722
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:55,900
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron.

723
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:16,700
-Why have you brought me here?
-Your Highness, there must be some mistake.

724
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:23,100
-I never requested your presence.
-Ah, but your lack of action demanded it.

725
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:29,100
Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgment
in assigning to Rabban the governorship.

726
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:34,100
You've forced me to come here
and set things straight, personally.

727
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:49,400
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.
Poor Emperor.

728
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,800
-I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you.
-Silence!

729
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:58,700
Kill this child.  She's an abomination.
Kill her.

730
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,700
-Get out of my mind!
-Not until you tell them both

731
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:08,300
who I really am.

732
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,300
Alia...

733
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:20,800
daughter of Duke Leto the Just,
and the royal Lady Jessica.

734
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:26,100
Sister of Paul Muad'Dib.

735
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,400
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

736
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:38,900
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

737
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,400
<i>With the storm, their air power will be useless.
On Arrakish it's desert power.</i>

738
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,300
Gurney...

739
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,700
-Now!
-Atomics!

740
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:34,700
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

741
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,600
Impossible!

742
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:43,100
Not impossible.  I told you.
He is here now.

743
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:52,800
<i>Father, today I will avenge your death.</i>

744
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:23,300
Emperor, an impassable storm has descended.
The Shield Wall has been penetrated by atomics.

745
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:31,400
Release the Sardaukar.
Baron, give this little abomination to the storm.

746
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:35,900
<i>Wait for my brother, Baron.</i>

747
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,500
<i>Wait for my brother.</i>

748
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:39,400
<i>-Alia, now.
-Come to me Baron.</i>

749
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:41,500
<i>Feyd Rautha.</i>

750
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:49,500
Emperor Shaddam IV, there are Guild Heighliners
above us, containing many Great Houses of the Landsraad.

751
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:53,000
-Send them back.
-How dare you speak to me in...

752
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,300
Stop your speaking.

753
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
You have some idea
of what I could do.

754
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,200
Don't try your powers on me.

755
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:10,600
Try looking into that place where you dare not look.
You'll find me there staring back at you.

756
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,600
-You mustn't speak...
-Silence!

757
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:21,700
I remember your gom jabbar.
Now you'll remember mine.

758
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,800
I can kill with a word.

759
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:31,500
And his word shall carry death eternal
to those who stand against the righteous.

760
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:34,900
-The righteous?
-There is a Harkonnen among you.

761
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:41,500
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

762
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:45,300
If Feyd wishes,
he can meet you with my blade in his hand.

763
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:49,100
-I wish it.
-This is a Harkonnen animal.

764
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:53,500
-Let me. Please, my lord.
-The Emperor's blade.

765
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,400
Why prolong the inevitable?

766
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,800
I will kill you.

767
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,200
I will kill him!

768
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,900
Paul!

769
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,700
I will kill him!

770
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:13,800
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

771
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:17,300
Will she deserve my special attentions?

772
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,900
<i>Poisoned.</i>

773
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:34,800
You see your death.
My blade will finish you.

774
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:40,200
<i>I will bend like
a reed in the wind.</i>

775
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:08,400
-Muad'Dib?
-Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

776
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:13,100
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,

777
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:20,100
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.
Where there was war, Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

778
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:27,100
Where there was hatred, Muad'Dib would bring love,
to lead the people to true freedom,

779
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:31,600
and to change the face of Arrakis.

780
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:38,200
We Fremen have a saying.
God created Arrakis

781
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:41,200
to train the faithful.

782
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:45,000
One cannot go against the word of God.

783
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:45,600
And how can this be?

784
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:50,700
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach.

Dune The Alternative Edition Redux
Custom English subtitles created by Spicediver, 2012

2
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:22,225
REDUX is my third and final reworking of
David Lynch's 1984 film adaptation of
Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novel.

3
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:29,884
My original DUNE THE ALTERNATIVE EDITION
fanedit was first released in 2008 (V.1)
and again in 2009 (V.2).

4
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:36,327
Since this fanedit's initial release, I've learnt much
about the art and science of editing with the help of
generous mentors and other DUNE fans.

5
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:40,531
I've also had time to ponder some
criticisms and develop new ideas.

6
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:45,788
REDUX is a major revamp over my
previous versions of Lynch's DUNE and
stands as my final cut of the film.

7
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:51,883
I hope you enjoy the trip, and thankyou to
everyone who helped me realise the dream.
Spicediver, July 2012.

00:00:55,502 --> 00:01:04,662
"Thou shalt not make a machine in the
likeness of a human mind." - Chief
commandment from the Great Revolt

9
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,952
A beginning is a very delicate time.

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,447
Know then that it is the year 10,191.

11
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:49,953
The known universe is ruled by
the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, my father.

12
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,071
In this time the most precious substance
in the Universe is the spice melange.

13
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,861
The spice extends life.

14
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:05,285
The spice expands consciousness.

15
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:10,030
The spice is vital to space travel.

16
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:16,973
The spice exists on only one
planet in the entire Universe...

17
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,950
A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts.

18
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:27,777
Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts
are a people known as the Fremen

19
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:33,527
who have long held a prophecy
that a man would come...

20
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:36,019
a Messiah...

21
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,187
who would lead them to true freedom.

22
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,603
The planet is Arrakis.

23
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,906
Also known as Dune.

24
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:10,792
We are the secret of the Universe.

25
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,300
Bi-la kaifa.

26
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,538
We are the secret.

27
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,860
We know of CHOAM in the Universe

28
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,144
Combine Honnete Ober Advance Mercantiles

29
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:30,386
controlled by the Emperor Shaddam IV

30
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:34,245
and all the Great
Houses of the Landsraad.

31
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:41,375
We know of CHOAM...yet
we are the secret.

32
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:45,930
We know of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood

33
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:50,212
their selective breeding
plan for 90 generations

34
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:56,662
to produce the Kwisatz
Haderach, whom they will control.

35
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:05,890
The ones they call the
witches...yet we are the secret.

36
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:11,757
We know of the Guild and their
Navigators' power to fold space

37
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:16,101
and their control over
all interplanetary travel.

38
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:25,846
We know they have the seeing
eye...yet we are the secret.

39
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:34,487
The Bakka shall weep no more, for
there is now at work a higher power.

40
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:36,713
Bi-la kaifa.

41
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,166
And now

42
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:47,444
the prophecy.

43
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,113
One will come...

44
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:54,597
the voice from the outer world

45
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,259
bringing the holy war,

46
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,489
the Jihad,

47
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,150
which will cleanse the Universe

48
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:06,912
and bring us out of darkness.

49
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,702
"Enemies strengthen you; allies weaken." -
Emperor Elrood IX, Deathbed Insights.

50
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:44,627
Book I: The Great Houses

51
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,502
A secret report within The Guild.

52
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:53,047
Four planets have come to our attention

53
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,531
regarding a plot which could
jeopardise spice production.

54
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,539
Planet Arrakis: source of the spice.

55
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:06,361
Planet Caladan: home of House Atreides.

56
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:10,959
Planet Giedi Prime:
home of House Harkonnen.

57
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:16,021
Planet Kaitain: home of the
Emperor of the known Universe.

58
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:24,075
Send a third-stage Guild Navigator to
Kaitain to demand details from the Emperor.

59
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:28,269
The spice must flow.

60
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,408
Father?

61
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,526
Irulan, you must leave.

62
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:38,495
My Lord...

63
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,405
The Reverend Mother is here.

64
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:43,240
All entrance corridors and
chambers have been cleared.

65
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,910
We are dismissed?

66
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,753
Yes, yes, he'll sense any surveillance.

67
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:49,545
No eavesdropping of any kind!

68
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,800
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

69
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:09,129
We felt his presence.

70
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,295
I shall want telepathy during his visit

71
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,220
and a report when we're finished.

72
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,972
Their minds are so...

73
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:23,340
they move in strange directions.

74
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,034
Yes?

75
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:30,500
Forced spice evolution of
humans changes many things.

76
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,654
I must sit close to him.

77
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:36,852
He will not permit anyone but me to
see him. You must be outside this room.

78
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,288
I am your Truthsayer, my Lord.

79
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,120
He's here, my Lord.

80
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:54,795
The Spacing Guild and its Navigators use
the orange spice gas to fold space.

81
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,593
That is, travel to any part of the
Universe...without moving.

82
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:07,905
Because The Guild controls all interplanetary
travel, they are the highest power in the Universe.

83
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:14,211
The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.

84
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:16,616
Leave us.

85
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,690
Yes, my Lord.

86
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,592
We have just folded space from Ix.

87
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:24,166
Yes? How was your journey?

88
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:30,370
Many machines on Ix. New machines.

89
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,972
Oh? Yes?

90
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:37,853
Better than those on Richese.

91
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:44,661
You are transparent. I see many things.

92
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,215
I see plans within plans...

93
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:54,261
Is there a problem? Usually there's a
problem when one of you makes a visit.

94
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:58,529
The answer is within the problem.

95
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,568
I see two Great Houses

96
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,778
House Atreides, House
Harkonnen, feuding.

97
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,984
I see you behind it.

98
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,180
Yes.

99
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,632
You must share with us.

100
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:22,673
The Atreides House is building a secret
army using a technique unknown to us

101
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,853
a technique involving sound.

102
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,415
The Duke is becoming more
popular in the Landsraad.

103
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,965
He could threaten me.

104
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:34,642
I have ordered House Atreides to
occupy Arrakis to mine the spice

105
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:37,734
thus replacing their
enemies the Harkonnens.

106
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,190
House Atreides will not refuse

107
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:42,273
because of the tremendous
power they think they will gain.

108
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:47,146
Then, at an appointed time, Baron
Harkonnen will return to Arrakis

109
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:49,784
and launch a sneak
attack on House Atreides.

110
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:54,967
I have promised the Baron five
legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

111
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:59,489
So the Harkonnens will rid
you of House Atreides...

112
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:01,196
Yes!

113
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,724
Listen to me. The spice must flow!

114
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,150
The spice has given me accelerated
evolution for 4000 years.

115
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,297
It has enabled you to live 200!

116
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,909
It gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood
the metaphysical ability to see beyond,

117
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,615
to have superior powers.

118
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:20,599
Our power to fold space is in the spice.

119
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:25,517
Without us your empire would be
lost on isolated, scattered planets.

120
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:27,563
YOU would be lost.

121
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,350
One small point...

122
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,567
Here it comes.

123
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:38,479
We ourselves foresee a slight
problem within the House Atreides.

124
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,803
Paul...Paul Atreides.

125
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:47,027
You mean of course Duke
Leto Atreides, his father.

126
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:53,122
I mean Paul Atreides.
We want him killed.

127
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,977
I did not say this. I am not here.

128
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,187
I understand.

129
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:35,940
Well?

130
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:40,941
They fear that putting House Atreides
on Arrakis will hurt spice production.

131
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:46,051
For us, a small amount is enough
to greatly extend our lives

132
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,799
but they consume tremendous quantities.

133
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:54,021
A great deal is needed
to evolve the seeing eye.

134
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,020
They worry.

135
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,380
The Universe worries when
they worry. What else?

136
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:02,841
So much was unclear.

137
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,722
You may go, Helen Mohiam

138
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,111
Bene Gesserit.

139
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,213
Yes, my Lord.

140
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,666
She's Bene Gesserit.

141
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,427
There's nowhere in the
Universe you can escape them.

142
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,773
Her loyalty to the sisterhood is
stronger than her loyalty to me.

143
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,822
Watch her carefully.

144
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:34,672
Why would they want
the Duke's son killed?

145
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,925
We must have a look at
Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

146
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:49,602
Caladan: Home Of House Atreides.

147
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,858
For 90 generations

148
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,909
the sisterhood has been interfering with
the marriages and the children thereof

149
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,193
of the Great Houses of the Universe,

150
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:07,542
cleverly intermixing one bloodline with another
to form the Kwisatz Haderach, a super being.

151
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:15,066
They plan to control this super being and
use his powers for their own selfish purposes.

152
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,160
But now, so close to the prize, a
Bene Gesserit woman Jessica

153
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:27,266
the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides,
who has been ordered to bear only daughters

154
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:33,024
has given birth to a son, Paul Atreides.

155
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,988
Here we are now. Caladan.

156
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:41,713
And 19 light-years beyond

157
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,153
beyond Bene Tleilax

158
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,189
The training planet of the Mentats,

159
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,992
the human computers.

160
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,989
Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.

161
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,633
There, Arrakis.

162
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,832
Spice mining.

163
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,634
Carryalls lower the
harvester to the sand

164
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:00,993
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

165
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:04,104
Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.

166
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:05,705
Weather

167
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,618
See storms

168
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,438
No precipitation

169
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,662
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

170
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,989
And the Harkonnens are near. There.

171
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:20,537
Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen.

172
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,501
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides

173
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:26,017
and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.

174
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:27,508
Saguaro

175
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,874
Burrow bush

176
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,190
Creosote bush

177
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:31,637
Barrel cactus

178
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,423
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

179
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,624
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

180
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,190
and Gurney coming down the hall.

181
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:57,731
Those sounds

182
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,966
could be imitated!

183
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,033
I'd know the difference.

184
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,265
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

185
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,238
My father sent you to test me.

186
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,014
Music, then?

187
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:15,548
No music.

188
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,651
I'm packing this for the crossing.

189
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,446
Shield practice.

190
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,511
Shield practice?

191
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,888
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

192
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,221
I'm not in the mood.

193
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,623
Not in the mood?

194
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,463
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.

195
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,589
Not fighting!

196
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm sorry, Gurney.

197
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:33,824
Not sorry enough.

198
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:52,117
Now, guard yourself for true!

199
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,807
Is this what you seek?

200
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:14,976
Good.

201
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,475
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

202
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,707
But, uh, look down.

203
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:27,017
We'd have joined each other in death.

204
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,958
You did seem finally to get in the mood.

205
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,598
Would you really have drawn my blood?

206
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,597
If you'd have fought one
whit below your abilities,

207
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,607
I'd have given you a
good scar to remind you.

208
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,639
Things have been so serious here lately.

209
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,874
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

210
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,343
Arrakis is real.

211
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,255
The Harkonnens are real.

212
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:03,889
Doctor Yueh,

213
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,224
do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

214
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,327
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

215
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,930
Only 125 meters long.

216
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,260
Only?

217
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,568
There have been documented
sightings of worms

218
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,009
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

219
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,613
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

220
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:30,512
The desert belt and
the south polar region

221
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:31,917
are marked forbidden.

222
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,082
The storms and the worms.

223
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,986
Is it true that the sand
can blow at 700 km per hour?

224
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:44,889
It can render flesh
into dust in minutes.

225
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,502
And these dry winds can also generate

226
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,028
tremendous amounts of static
electricity in the atmosphere.

227
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,271
Our body shields won't have enough power

228
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,642
to operate in the open air on Arrakis.

229
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,245
How do the Fremen survive there?

230
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,247
We don't know much about the Fremen.

231
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:05,950
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

232
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,251
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

233
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:09,950
The eyes.

234
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:11,550
Yes.

235
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:15,195
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

236
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,123
Could the spice affect us in other ways?

237
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,430
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

238
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,491
For one,

239
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,134
the Harkonnens would not have given up

240
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:27,198
their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

241
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,270
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.

242
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:34,972
But behind them, I
suspect, is the Emperor.

243
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:38,785
You'll make a formidable Duke.

244
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:45,357
Now, remember,

245
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:49,420
the first step in avoiding a trap

246
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,924
is knowing of its existence.

247
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,696
I know, but if it is a trap

248
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,504
then why are we going?

249
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,130
We have our new army.

250
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,438
Doctor Yueh,

251
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,936
put the weirding module on him.

252
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:29,231
Clear and lock the room!

253
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,329
Detachment, stand down.

254
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,317
Activate a fighter.

255
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,204
Make the range 2 meters.

256
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:52,379
Precise control.

257
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,525
That's not Duncan's style.

258
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,846
Certainly not mine.

259
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,401
That's his mother's influence.

260
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,122
Duncan!

261
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:43,260
Paul, I was just on my
way to say goodbye to you.

262
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,566
I have to go on ahead, alone,

263
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,109
I won't be seeing you for a while.

264
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,475
I wish you were coming with us. Why?

265
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:52,173
Something for your father.

266
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:53,941
He wants to talk to you.

267
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,810
I'll see you on Arrakis.

268
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:01,046
May the hand of God be with you.

269
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,658
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

270
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,124
Father.

271
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,889
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

272
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:48,362
It will be good to get to our new home

273
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:51,204
and have all this upset behind us.

274
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:58,212
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

275
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:02,642
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

276
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,384
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan say the same.

277
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,719
Makes me feel very proud.

278
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,521
I want you to be proud of me.

279
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:27,968
I'll miss the sea.

280
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,170
But a person needs new experiences.

281
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,876
They draw something deep inside,

282
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,080
allowing him to grow.

283
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:43,213
Without change,

284
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,551
something sleeps inside us

285
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:52,495
and seldom awakens.

286
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:58,968
The sleeper must awaken.

287
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,028
Arrakis, Dune...

288
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:29,568
desert planet.

289
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:35,303
I will kill you.

290
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,071
The second moon.

291
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:49,816
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

292
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:38,436
Jessica, you were told to bear

293
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,058
only daughters to the Atreides.

294
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:42,636
Jessica!

295
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,441
It meant so much to him.

296
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:48,542
You thought only of a
Duke's desire for a son?

297
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:51,185
Desires don't come into this.

298
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:53,821
An Atreides daughter could have been wed

299
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,620
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.

300
00:28:57,393 --> 00:29:00,692
We may lose both bloodlines now.

301
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,099
I vowed never to regret my decision.

302
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:10,069
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

303
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,573
And your son will pay with you.

304
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:23,417
Is Arrakis...

305
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,178
Is it really so terrible on Arrakis?

306
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,118
My Duke...

307
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,853
You entered into this

308
00:29:31,928 --> 00:29:35,420
with full knowledge of the
delicate edge you walked.

309
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:39,790
Jessica.

310
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:42,095
Girl.

311
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:47,234
I wish I could stand in your place

312
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,210
and take your sufferings.

313
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:53,485
But we must each of
us take our own path.

314
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,108
I know.

315
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:02,656
I understand.

316
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,590
About Paul...

317
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:08,619
What you did and why
you did it, we both know.

318
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,533
But kindness forces me to tell you

319
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:16,093
there is little chance he will
be the Bene Gesserit totality.

320
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:20,368
However, I will observe him.

321
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,636
In a few minutes, Jessica,

322
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:26,375
your son will be proved
to be a living human being

323
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,942
or he will be a dead animal.

324
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,082
He's here.

325
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:38,354
Arrakis, Dune

326
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,353
desert planet.

327
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:43,529
Moving...

328
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,056
moving...

329
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,985
We'll salvage what we can.

330
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,553
But I can tell you, dear God,

331
00:31:13,763 --> 00:31:16,425
for the father, nothing.

332
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:22,471
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

333
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:24,972
The Universe's super being?

334
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,635
How dare you!

335
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,604
My greatest student.

336
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:34,842
And my greatest disappointment.

337
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,784
He's awake. He's listening to us.

338
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,343
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

339
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:48,109
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one-quarter of an hour.

340
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,029
Paul.

341
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,361
This is very important.

342
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:04,138
Remember you are a Duke's son.

343
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,766
This is the Reverend
Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.

344
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,871
She's going to observe you.

345
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:31,811
Please.

346
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:32,914
Jessica,

347
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,708
you know it must be done.

348
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,443
Your Reverence.

349
00:32:41,323 --> 00:32:42,449
What about my father?

350
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:43,616
Paul,

351
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:48,451
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

352
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,639
Now, you,

353
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,841
come here.

354
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,675
She's using the Voice.

355
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:08,081
No.

356
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,414
Some strength there.

357
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,918
Surprising.

358
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,350
Come here!

359
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:16,480
Come here...

360
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,790
Come here...

361
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,134
Do you see this?

362
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,476
Put your right hand in the box.

363
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,476
What's in the box?

364
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:43,778
Pain.

365
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,180
Stop.

366
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,920
Put your hand in the box.

367
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:59,330
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.

368
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:02,302
Don't pull away or
you'll feel the poison.

369
00:34:03,272 --> 00:34:05,763
A Duke's son must know
about many poisons.

370
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:09,241
This one kills only animals.

371
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,572
Are you suggesting the
Duke's son is an animal?

372
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:13,774
Let us say

373
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:16,181
I suggest you may be human.

374
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:18,683
Your awareness may be powerful enough

375
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:20,449
to control your instincts.

376
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:22,387
Your instinct will be

377
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:24,855
to remove your hand from the box.

378
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:27,054
If you do so,

379
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,661
you die.

380
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:34,631
You will feel

381
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:38,201
an itching

382
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,102
there.

383
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:48,248
Now the itching becomes burning.

384
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:52,742
Heat upon heat upon heat.

385
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:53,810
It burns.

386
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,584
Silence! Silence!

387
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:58,990
I must not fear. Fear
is the mind killer.

388
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:00,726
And fear is the little death

389
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:02,696
that brings total obliteration.

390
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,631
I will face my fear. I
will permit it to pass

391
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:08,864
over me and through me. I must not fear.

392
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:11,798
You feel the flesh crisping.

393
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,071
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

394
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:17,043
I will face my fear.

395
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,113
Flesh dropping off.

396
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:23,349
Fear is the little death.

397
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,810
I must not fear...

398
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:29,823
Fear is the little death. I'm...

399
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,257
The pain!

400
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:33,725
No! Enough!

401
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:38,599
Kull Wahad!

402
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,564
No woman child ever withstood that much.

403
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:50,173
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

404
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:54,379
Do it!

405
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,720
Pain by nerve induction.

406
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,849
A human can resist any pain.

407
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:07,986
Our test is crisis and observation.

408
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,058
I see the truth of it.

409
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,479
Could he be the one?

410
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:13,802
Maybe.

411
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:17,431
You know when people speak the truth?

412
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,667
I know it.

413
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,550
Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

414
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:33,658
Your mother wants you to
tell me about your dreams.

415
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:36,864
I only want to know one thing:

416
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,459
Do they come true?

417
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:41,692
Not all of them.

418
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,668
I know which ones will.

419
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:51,809
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

420
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,872
What is that?

421
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:56,882
The person who can be
many places at once.

422
00:36:56,951 --> 00:37:00,216
The one who bridges time and space.

423
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:04,518
He will look where we cannot.

424
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:09,662
Do you know of the Water of Life?

425
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,631
The bile from the
newborn worms of Arrakis?

426
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,826
I have heard of it.

427
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,232
It is very dangerous.

428
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:19,334
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

429
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,375
There is a place

430
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,870
terrifying to us,

431
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:27,544
to women.

432
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:29,711
It is said

433
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,985
a man will come.

434
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,679
The Kwisatz Haderach.

435
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,349
He will go where we cannot.

436
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,792
Many men have tried.

437
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,597
They tried and failed?

438
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,869
They tried and died.

439
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,728
Jessica.

440
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,950
I sense your teachings in him.

441
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,051
Ignore the regular order of training.

442
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,353
His safety requires the Voice.

443
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,687
I've heard enough of my safety.

444
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,422
What about my father?

445
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:19,594
I heard your talking.

446
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,861
You speak as if he were dead.

447
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:21,902
Well, he's not!

448
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,334
But he's not.

449
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,998
And he won't die. Tell me he won't die.

450
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,665
What can be done has been done.

451
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,435
Mother, tell me!

452
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,687
The Voice could save you.

453
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:02,385
Giedi Prime: Home of House Harkonnen.

454
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,361
Mentat Piter De Vries.

455
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:14,898
Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.

456
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:18,285
The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.

457
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:23,140
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

458
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,580
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

459
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,940
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

460
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,540
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

461
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,980
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

462
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

463
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,620
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

464
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,940
It is by will alone I
set my mind in motion.

465
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,806
My lord.

466
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:48,892
Piter.

467
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,451
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

468
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,840
and I have here your
answer from Duke Leto.

469
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,333
What does Leto say, Piter?

470
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:05,080
He wishes to inform you that "vendetta,"
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

471
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,080
the art of Kanly, is still alive.

472
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,280
He does not wish to
meet or speak with you.

473
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,640
I've made my peace gesture.

474
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:19,188
The forms of Kanly have been obeyed!

475
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,560
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

476
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:51,691
As you instructed me,

477
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:55,430
I have enlightened your
nephews concerning my plan...

478
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:57,036
My plan!

479
00:42:57,424 --> 00:43:01,940
The plan...to crush the Atreides.

480
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:04,391
Feyd.

481
00:43:05,622 --> 00:43:07,111
Rabban.

482
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,448
Go quietly.

483
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:14,665
No other great house of the Landsraad...

484
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,940
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

485
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:23,560
The entire Landsraad would
turn against the Baron...

486
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,100
and the Emperor.

487
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:28,588
Put the pick in there, Pete,

488
00:43:30,181 --> 00:43:32,830
and turn it 'round real neat.

489
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,814
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

490
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,977
Your skin, love to me.

491
00:44:02,051 --> 00:44:05,169
Your diseases, lovingly cared for...

492
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:07,987
for all eternity.

493
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:16,260
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

494
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:20,425
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

495
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:22,949
And what Piter did not tell you...

496
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,613
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

497
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:29,350
very close to Duke Leto.

498
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:32,076
This person, this traitor,

499
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:36,349
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

500
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,651
And who is this traitor?

501
00:44:39,474 --> 00:44:41,911
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

502
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,228
or when we'll attack.

503
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:48,365
However, the duke will
die before these eyes,

504
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,850
and he'll know, he'll know that it is l,

505
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,200
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

506
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:16,562
This is what I'll do to
the duke and his family.

507
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:32,768
I once told you a
daughter would be conceived

508
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,435
at a time of parting.

509
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,979
I remember.

510
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:45,315
Conceived in love at a time of parting.

511
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:58,700
Arrakis is a hostile world, though.

512
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:03,931
I must be sure you want this.

513
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:10,045
It has to be tonight,

514
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,448
under these influences.

515
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:29,089
I didn't hear you with the wind.

516
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:34,400
I whispered yes.

517
00:47:37,674 --> 00:47:39,437
And I whispered:

518
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,242
"I love you."

519
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:19,933
Soon they will begin to fold space.

520
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:24,227
Far off in the control
rooms of spice gas.

521
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:28,108
Travelling without moving.

522
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,862
And now,

523
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:33,797
the prophecy.

524
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:37,767
One will come...

525
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:41,966
The voice from the outer world

526
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,105
bringing the Holy War,

527
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,412
the Jihad,

528
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,479
Which will cleanse the Universe

529
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,380
and bring us out of darkness.

530
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:14,734
"The desert is a surgeon, cutting away
the skin to expose what is underneath." -
Fremen saying.

531
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:21,756
Book II: Dune

532
00:53:10,602 --> 00:53:11,742
A mother and a son.

533
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:21,992
House Atreides took control of Arrakis

534
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:26,306
63 standard days into the year 10191.

535
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,525
It was known that the Harkonnens,

536
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:30,415
the former rulers of Arrakis

537
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:33,190
would leave many suicide troops behind.

538
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,168
Atreides patrols were doubled.

539
00:53:44,977 --> 00:53:47,002
Each trooper will be charged

540
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,047
with responsibility
for preserving water.

541
00:53:49,114 --> 00:53:51,412
Our existence as an
operating army depends

542
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:54,316
on these following
water-saving procedures.

543
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:57,115
Remember, water is life.

544
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:04,091
Why is the shield not yet up?

545
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,888
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

546
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:09,632
I think it'll go up now, sir.

547
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,607
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

548
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:31,112
House shield activating.

549
00:55:10,396 --> 00:55:13,763
My lady, the local people,

550
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:16,695
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

551
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:19,030
Hawat has cleared them.

552
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:23,866
Excuse me, my lady.

553
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:28,973
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

554
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:40,248
When you said Harkonnens,

555
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:44,625
I didn't know you had so
much reason to hate them.

556
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:49,967
Well, my wife...

557
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:54,904
But, of course, you didn't know my wife.

558
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:58,575
The Har--

559
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:00,178
Forgive me.

560
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:03,508
Please excuse me if
I can't talk about it.

561
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,532
He's holding something back.

562
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:15,642
Yet there's the Imperial conditioning.

563
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:19,017
Assurance of trust.

564
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:32,387
The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.

565
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,561
My message, it's here.

566
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,008
There are more enemy bodies coming in

567
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,476
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

568
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:06,449
Are you all right?

569
00:57:07,214 --> 00:57:08,051
Yes, I'm fine.

570
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:10,649
Thank you, Thufir.

571
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:11,326
Yes?

572
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:16,728
I am the Shadout Mapes.

573
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:20,565
Your housekeeper, noble-born.

574
00:58:21,609 --> 00:58:23,577
What are your orders?

575
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,702
You may refer to me as "my Lady."

576
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,742
I'm not noble-born.

577
00:58:30,384 --> 00:58:33,080
I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto,

578
00:58:33,787 --> 00:58:35,948
mother of the heir designate.

579
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:37,824
"Shadout."

580
00:58:39,426 --> 00:58:41,257
That's an ancient word.

581
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:44,762
You know the ancient tongues?

582
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:47,266
I know many things.

583
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:51,261
I know you came prepared for violence

584
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:54,000
with a weapon in your bodice.

585
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:57,174
My lady,

586
00:58:58,345 --> 00:59:00,575
the weapon was sent as a gift,

587
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:02,944
if you should prove to be the one.

588
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:05,042
And the means of my death

589
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:08,878
should I prove otherwise?

590
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,485
Do you know this, my Lady?

591
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:20,192
It's a crysknife.

592
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:23,438
Say it not lightly.

593
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:26,669
Do you know its meaning?

594
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:33,427
It's a Maker.

595
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:39,523
Did you think I wouldn't know the Maker?

596
00:59:41,351 --> 00:59:42,877
My lady,

597
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:48,620
when one has lived with
prophecy for so long,

598
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:53,979
the moment of revelation is a shock.

599
01:00:01,612 --> 01:00:02,819
Mapes!

600
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,512
You sheath that blade unblooded.

601
01:00:06,574 --> 01:00:08,805
Yes!

602
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:17,516
Take the Water of my Life.

603
01:00:27,313 --> 01:00:29,727
You are ours.

604
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:34,149
You are the one.

605
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:48,939
My Lord.

606
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:01,859
My Lord?

607
01:01:04,321 --> 01:01:05,495
Thufir.

608
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:09,231
Haven't you heard from Duncan Idaho yet?

609
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:11,433
No, Sire.

610
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,674
I have, however, discovered
what the city Fremen

611
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:18,672
called out to Paul when
we entered the city.

612
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:22,593
Mahdi

613
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:29,168
and...Lisan al-Gaib, yes.

614
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:31,355
It is a prophecy

615
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:34,312
that a young leader will come to them

616
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:37,255
with a Bene Gesserit mother.

617
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:41,046
It follows the familiar messiah pattern.

618
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:45,648
But Mahdi?

619
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:48,302
Yes.

620
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:52,138
It seems it is written

621
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:58,241
that he will lead them to true...

622
01:01:59,558 --> 01:02:01,705
freedom.

623
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:15,402
The History Of The Universe.

624
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,634
In the years before the reign of the Padishah Emperors

625
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:24,829
the Universe was ruled by thinking machines,
computers and conscious robots.

626
01:02:26,453 --> 01:02:30,342
The people deteriorated into a state of apathy.

627
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:35,259
Then they became victims and slaves
of other men with machines.

628
01:03:01,014 --> 01:03:02,370
Safe.

629
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,931
Spice.

630
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,106
The second moon.

631
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:57,587
The sleeper must awaken.

632
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:43,621
It would have killed me.

633
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:48,091
I was its target. It went to the motion.

634
01:05:48,962 --> 01:05:50,486
Who are you?

635
01:05:50,563 --> 01:05:52,622
I am the Shadout Mapes,

636
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:55,264
the housekeeper.

637
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:59,203
I must cleanse the way between us.

638
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,602
You saved my life,

639
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:04,040
and we Fremen pay our debts.

640
01:06:05,155 --> 01:06:09,734
It is known to us that you've
a traitor in your midst.

641
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:12,236
Who it is, we cannot say.

642
01:06:12,648 --> 01:06:14,681
But we are certain of it.

643
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,729
A traitor.

644
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:40,904
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

645
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:46,484
Thufir!

646
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:49,451
did you find anything?

647
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:51,547
Nothing yet.

648
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,421
Keep looking.

649
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:57,903
And the traitor? God help us.

650
01:07:10,117 --> 01:07:11,709
Harkonnen.

651
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:16,513
My lord...

652
01:07:16,984 --> 01:07:20,943
Again, my lord, I wish
to tender my resignation--

653
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:22,989
Silence, Thufir. Stop acting the fool.

654
01:07:23,056 --> 01:07:24,819
I told you yesterday.

655
01:07:25,092 --> 01:07:26,525
If you made a mistake,

656
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:28,788
it was in overestimating the Harkonnens.

657
01:07:29,162 --> 01:07:32,154
Their simple minds came
up with a simple trick.

658
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:37,531
Paul survived this largely
because of your training.

659
01:07:37,604 --> 01:07:39,333
You didn't fail there.

660
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,773
Sit down, Thufir.

661
01:07:42,432 --> 01:07:43,485
My lord.

662
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:51,840
Thufir,

663
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:55,182
there's this traitor.

664
01:07:56,957 --> 01:07:58,625
I know you've cleared everyone,

665
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,853
especially those close to us.

666
01:08:01,728 --> 01:08:04,056
But recheck and find him.

667
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:15,441
Sector 6 through 80
progress report, Sire.

668
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:17,144
Take it, Thufir.

669
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:23,450
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over

670
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:26,716
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

671
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,557
8. Thufir Hawat, Mentat,
Master of Assassins.

672
01:08:39,535 --> 01:08:41,696
The palace is now secure.

673
01:08:42,938 --> 01:08:46,066
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

674
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:50,305
We have troops here
headquartered underground

675
01:08:50,412 --> 01:08:52,710
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

676
01:08:53,315 --> 01:08:55,510
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen

677
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:57,711
and we have some on the airfield.

678
01:08:57,786 --> 01:09:00,186
Our new army is still in training,

679
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:02,951
but everything, everything is shielded.

680
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:06,153
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

681
01:09:08,864 --> 01:09:09,853
Kynes...

682
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:11,625
Kynes...

683
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,695
Dr. Kynes is waiting.

684
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:17,534
He is the Emperor's Judge of the Change

685
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:20,370
monitoring the evacuation
of the Harkonnens

686
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:22,637
and our taking control.

687
01:09:24,313 --> 01:09:27,077
He plans on taking you

688
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:30,380
on an inspection of the
spice mining operation.

689
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:34,880
Now, he may or may not

690
01:09:35,424 --> 01:09:39,087
be sympathetic to our cause. But, Sire,

691
01:09:40,362 --> 01:09:42,853
with the attempt on the young master,

692
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:46,799
I am against your leaving the palace.

693
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:48,831
The attempt failed.

694
01:09:48,904 --> 01:09:51,805
Harkonnen captives
have already been taken.

695
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:55,308
We must crush the Harkonnen
machine on Arrakis.

696
01:09:56,044 --> 01:09:58,672
You all know what to do!

697
01:10:06,488 --> 01:10:10,891
Gurney, we desperately
need more spice miners.

698
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:13,619
Many are threatening to
leave on the next shuttle.

699
01:10:13,695 --> 01:10:16,391
We need spice drivers,
weather scanners, dunemen.

700
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:18,558
Any with open sand experience.

701
01:10:18,634 --> 01:10:21,228
You must persuade
them to enlist with us.

702
01:10:26,475 --> 01:10:30,605
"They shall come all for violence.

703
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:35,177
"Their faces shall sup
up as the east wind.

704
01:10:37,552 --> 01:10:41,318
And they will gather the
captivity of the sand."

705
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:44,322
Very moving, Gurney.

706
01:10:46,128 --> 01:10:47,459
On your way.

707
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:55,997
And take care of Doctor
Kynes until Paul and I arrive.

708
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,631
We will not be prisoners
here in this place.

709
01:11:00,709 --> 01:11:05,544
Behold, as a wild ass in the
desert go I forth to my work.

710
01:11:37,068 --> 01:11:39,468
So you are Doctor Kynes.

711
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:41,438
The Judge of the Change.

712
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,770
And the lmperial Ecologist, Sire.

713
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:45,742
Our intelligence informs us

714
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:48,439
that there's still a
strong Harkonnen presence.

715
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,743
The process of removal continues.

716
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:53,308
This is my son, Paul.

717
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:56,045
Are you a Fremen?

718
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:57,383
I've been on Arrakis

719
01:11:57,456 --> 01:12:00,584
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

720
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:02,718
In the service of the Emperor...

721
01:12:02,894 --> 01:12:04,691
We are in your hands, Doctor.

722
01:12:04,763 --> 01:12:07,288
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

723
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:10,266
Would you give us an
explanation of their workings?

724
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:13,797
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

725
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,098
the most efficient type on Arrakis.

726
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:17,471
Basically--

727
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:22,570
It's all right, Gurney.

728
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:25,276
Yes, Sire.

729
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:29,650
Basically, it's a
high-efficiency filter

730
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,021
and heat exchange system.

731
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:35,424
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

732
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:37,788
and is gathered in the second.

733
01:12:37,863 --> 01:12:39,728
The salt is separated.

734
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:43,601
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

735
01:12:44,302 --> 01:12:47,863
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

736
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:50,940
from which you can
drink through this tube

737
01:12:51,309 --> 01:12:52,674
around your neck.

738
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:56,505
Urine and faeces are
processed in the thigh pads.

739
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:00,013
Should you be in the open desert,

740
01:13:00,685 --> 01:13:03,051
remember to breathe
in through your mouth

741
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:05,588
and out through this nose tube.

742
01:13:05,857 --> 01:13:08,348
With a Fremen suit in
good working condition,

743
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,553
life can be sustained for weeks,

744
01:13:10,829 --> 01:13:13,821
even in the deep desert, Sire.

745
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,824
My thanks.

746
01:13:17,335 --> 01:13:18,859
With your permission.

747
01:13:21,373 --> 01:13:23,068
You've worn a stillsuit before.

748
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:24,531
No.

749
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,274
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.

750
01:13:27,712 --> 01:13:29,277
Who told you how to do that?

751
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:31,178
No one.

752
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,818
It seemed the proper way.

753
01:13:37,022 --> 01:13:38,387
That it is.

754
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:42,219
He shall know your
ways as if born to them.

755
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:45,894
We're wasting time, Sire.

756
01:14:01,945 --> 01:14:03,323
Battle language?

757
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:05,282
Translate it.

758
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,308
Very faint.

759
01:14:14,776 --> 01:14:16,393
Harkonnen.

760
01:14:22,443 --> 01:14:25,419
Air speed, zero-five.

761
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,527
Ambient temperature, 300 degrees Kelvin.

762
01:14:29,435 --> 01:14:31,596
Air speed, three-zero.

763
01:14:35,842 --> 01:14:38,367
Ether bender, 75 percent efficiency.

764
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:46,017
That's where I told your sandmaster

765
01:14:46,085 --> 01:14:47,985
to concentrate the harvesting today.

766
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,416
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

767
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:57,088
Ambient temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

768
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:00,495
Air speed,
one-three-zero.

769
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:04,659
Caution. You've now cleared

770
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:07,535
protective Shield Wall
and entered open desert.

771
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:19,011
Will we see a worm?

772
01:15:19,685 --> 01:15:23,143
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

773
01:15:23,222 --> 01:15:24,120
Always?

774
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,316
Always.

775
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:27,586
Why do they come?

776
01:15:28,594 --> 01:15:30,619
To protect their territory.

777
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:32,788
Vibrations attract them.

778
01:15:34,174 --> 01:15:37,769
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

779
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:43,240
As I said, they defend the spice sands.

780
01:15:44,718 --> 01:15:47,585
As to their relationship with the spice,

781
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:50,116
who knows?

782
01:15:53,493 --> 01:15:55,085
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

783
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:56,993
That's it. Spice mining.

784
01:15:57,931 --> 01:16:00,058
No other cloud quite like it.

785
01:16:02,636 --> 01:16:04,501
See the spotters over it?

786
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:06,163
They're watching for wormsign,

787
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,002
the telltale sand waves.

788
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:11,643
Seismic probes on the
surface, too, Sire.

789
01:16:13,113 --> 01:16:16,674
Worms can travel too deep
for their waves to show.

790
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:20,112
Looks like a good patch of spice.

791
01:16:21,655 --> 01:16:23,088
Wormsign?

792
01:16:23,623 --> 01:16:25,352
Is it wormsign?

793
01:16:25,425 --> 01:16:27,120
Yes. Worm. Big one.

794
01:16:27,728 --> 01:16:30,094
You've got sharp eyes. May I?

795
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:36,465
Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign.

796
01:16:37,104 --> 01:16:38,594
Who calls Pad Nine?

797
01:16:38,672 --> 01:16:39,866
Don't mention the Duke.

798
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,965
This is an un-coded channel.

799
01:16:42,209 --> 01:16:44,370
Unlisted flight northeast of you.

800
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:46,639
Wormsign on intercept course.

801
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,414
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

802
01:16:49,816 --> 01:16:52,216
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.

803
01:16:52,285 --> 01:16:55,118
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

804
01:16:55,322 --> 01:16:56,721
Very precise estimate.

805
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,417
Who's on that unlisted flight?

806
01:17:00,694 --> 01:17:02,423
What happens now?

807
01:17:02,496 --> 01:17:05,795
The carryall will come and
lift off the spice harvester.

808
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:09,232
Try to get in close over the harvester.

809
01:17:09,302 --> 01:17:11,862
You'll find this interesting, Sire.

810
01:17:12,172 --> 01:17:14,436
They work until the very last minute.

811
01:17:14,508 --> 01:17:17,068
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

812
01:17:17,144 --> 01:17:19,078
It isn't answering.

813
01:17:19,613 --> 01:17:22,047
The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

814
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:24,845
Spotter control, give me
a report by the numbers.

815
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:25,816
Report One.

816
01:17:25,886 --> 01:17:26,910
No contact.

817
01:17:26,987 --> 01:17:27,954
Report two.

818
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,045
Negative.

819
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:30,111
Report three.

820
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,248
Negative, sir.

821
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:32,313
Report four.

822
01:17:32,392 --> 01:17:34,860
No contact. Repeat, no contact.

823
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:37,253
I think they've got our carryall.

824
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:39,298
Damn it! Harkonnens.

825
01:17:39,766 --> 01:17:41,859
We're coming down to take
you off the harvester.

826
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:43,994
All spotters are ordered to comply.

827
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,332
Ordered by whom?

828
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:46,734
Duke Leto Atreides.

829
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:49,064
Yes. Yes, Sire.

830
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:50,507
How many men do you have?

831
01:17:50,644 --> 01:17:52,009
Full crew, 26 men.

832
01:17:52,345 --> 01:17:54,404
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

833
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,880
Damn the spice!

834
01:17:55,949 --> 01:17:57,280
Get out of there!

835
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,689
Two men in each of the spotters!

836
01:18:08,829 --> 01:18:10,592
You, over here!

837
01:18:10,897 --> 01:18:11,886
Run!

838
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:13,521
Run!

839
01:18:19,806 --> 01:18:22,707
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

840
01:18:22,776 --> 01:18:25,973
Damn sloppy. Really damn sloppy.

841
01:18:26,046 --> 01:18:27,911
Come on, boys. Come on.

842
01:18:31,918 --> 01:18:33,818
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

843
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,519
Spice.

844
01:18:36,656 --> 01:18:39,853
Pure unrefined spice.

845
01:18:46,099 --> 01:18:48,465
Here he is! We've got to go!

846
01:18:58,245 --> 01:18:59,974
Bless the Maker and his water.

847
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:01,842
Bless the coming and going of Him.

848
01:19:01,915 --> 01:19:03,780
May His passing cleanse the world.

849
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,817
What's that you're saying?

850
01:19:05,886 --> 01:19:07,080
Nothing.

851
01:19:43,723 --> 01:19:45,486
Gods, what a monster.

852
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:57,430
Someone is going to
pay for this, I promise.

853
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:03,904
He's more concerned over
his men than the spice.

854
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:08,180
I must admit, against
all better judgment,

855
01:20:08,949 --> 01:20:10,610
I like this Duke.

856
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:28,451
Duncan!

857
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,855
The Fremen have sent
a message to you, Sire.

858
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:43,767
Have you read this?

859
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,331
No, I was instructed it was for you.

860
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,509
It says:

861
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,139
"A column of smoke by day,

862
01:20:52,215 --> 01:20:54,274
a pillar of fire by night."

863
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,316
A warning.

864
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:59,718
An obscure one, at best.

865
01:21:02,492 --> 01:21:05,120
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

866
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:06,583
Tell me.

867
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,322
Why haven't we heard from you?

868
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:12,163
My lord, I suspect so much.

869
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,301
I think they are the allies we seek.

870
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,270
They are strong, fierce.

871
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:21,406
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

872
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:23,075
As you know,

873
01:21:23,146 --> 01:21:26,445
the lmperium has never been able
to take a census of the Fremen.

874
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:28,609
Everyone thinks that there are but few

875
01:21:28,685 --> 01:21:30,744
wandering here and there in the desert.

876
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:32,518
My lord,

877
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:36,554
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

878
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:40,224
That the Fremen exist in vast numbers.

879
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,557
Vast.

880
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:47,358
And it is they who control Arrakis.

881
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:31,734
Dr. Kynes,

882
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:35,575
being in the employ of
the Emperor, as you are,

883
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:39,675
perhaps it isn't wise
for you to associate

884
01:22:39,749 --> 01:22:41,307
too closely with us Atreides.

885
01:22:42,385 --> 01:22:44,114
On the contrary,

886
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:47,515
I feel very comfortable here.

887
01:22:50,893 --> 01:22:53,259
Remember how precious water is here.

888
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:55,422
It was a token of respect.

889
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:00,564
Are you enlisting with us?

890
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,605
You see through to the
truth of the thing, Sire.

891
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,698
That means a dual alliance.

892
01:23:05,841 --> 01:23:07,399
He's in with the Emperor.

893
01:23:07,677 --> 01:23:11,340
A dual alliance, yes.

894
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:14,139
But not with the Emperor.

895
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,081
The Fremen.

896
01:23:21,657 --> 01:23:24,091
Then let water be a bond between us.

897
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:04,645
The Great Revolt.

898
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:09,187
The religious crusade against thinking
machines and conscious robots.

899
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:14,046
After the Great Revolt, human beings
were forced to develop their minds.

900
01:24:15,022 --> 01:24:17,680
See: Mental Training Schools.

901
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:20,811
Two of the ancient mental
training schools are:

902
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:25,759
The Bene Gesserit school, established
primarily for female students.

903
01:24:26,299 --> 01:24:31,534
And the Spacing Guild, which
emphasises pure mathematics.

904
01:24:43,616 --> 01:24:45,796
Sorry you have to sleep
so far underground,

905
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:49,414
but we can't take any chances.

906
01:24:52,197 --> 01:24:53,423
I see you're studying.

907
01:24:54,704 --> 01:24:55,803
Knowledge is strength.

908
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,922
Yes, so says Thufir Hawat.

909
01:25:00,469 --> 01:25:04,421
One must have more than that to hold
Arrakis against our many enemies.

910
01:25:07,022 --> 01:25:08,580
Much more.

911
01:25:11,026 --> 01:25:12,015
Much...

912
01:25:13,462 --> 01:25:14,451
more.

913
01:25:24,606 --> 01:25:25,595
Paul,

914
01:25:32,114 --> 01:25:34,309
if anything should happen to me...

915
01:25:34,383 --> 01:25:37,511
Father, nothing's going to happen.

916
01:25:37,853 --> 01:25:38,945
Yes.

917
01:25:40,188 --> 01:25:43,055
But if it
should, l--

918
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:44,652
Yes?

919
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:46,694
Unknown objects on screen.

920
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:48,796
We are attempting to identify.

921
01:25:55,337 --> 01:25:56,827
I'll be back, son.

922
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:51,807
Sleep well, my son.

923
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:04,681
Father...

924
01:27:06,535 --> 01:27:07,839
drugged...

925
01:27:15,851 --> 01:27:16,579
Jessica.

926
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,613
Forgive me, my beloved concubine.

927
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:22,715
I should have married you.

928
01:27:23,621 --> 01:27:26,215
Why hold a dream to ascend to the throne

929
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,485
through a political marriage?

930
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,129
I should have married you.

931
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,148
What happened?

932
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:18,223
Yueh!

933
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:20,427
He sabotaged the house generators.

934
01:28:21,246 --> 01:28:22,505
We are wide open!

935
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,884
House shield deactivating.

936
01:28:29,553 --> 01:28:32,613
I've destroyed the new
army's weirding modules.

937
01:28:32,923 --> 01:28:35,084
I've brought House Atreides down.

938
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:36,421
Why?

939
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:38,291
I wish to kill a man.

940
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:40,828
Not you, my dear Duke.

941
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:42,965
You were already dead.

942
01:28:43,033 --> 01:28:45,866
But you'll get close to
the Baron before you die.

943
01:28:45,936 --> 01:28:49,167
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

944
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:51,698
You can still attack!

945
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:54,608
When you see the Baron,

946
01:28:55,012 --> 01:28:57,674
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

947
01:28:59,216 --> 01:29:02,344
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

948
01:29:03,687 --> 01:29:07,885
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

949
01:29:09,293 --> 01:29:10,385
Refuse.

950
01:29:10,461 --> 01:29:11,621
No! You mustn't!

951
01:29:12,363 --> 01:29:16,891
Because, in return, I'll save the
lives of your Paul and Jessica.

952
01:29:22,673 --> 01:29:24,140
For Paul.

953
01:29:39,256 --> 01:29:42,248
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

954
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:44,394
The tooth!

955
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:46,424
The tooth!

956
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:50,443
The shield is down! The shield is down!

957
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:54,273
Open the doors!

958
01:29:55,505 --> 01:29:56,263
Signals!

959
01:29:59,108 --> 01:30:00,439
Get that shield up!

960
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,537
The shield!

961
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:25,479
The weirding modules...destroyed!

962
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:28,770
Man the planes.

963
01:30:29,482 --> 01:30:30,500
Man the planes.

964
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:38,115
Release the bombs, release the bombs.

965
01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:12,014
Long live Duke Leto!

966
01:31:43,339 --> 01:31:45,705
The drug was timed.

967
01:31:47,744 --> 01:31:51,407
Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.

968
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,144
What a pity you must remain gagged.

969
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:00,583
We can't let ourselves be swayed

970
01:32:00,723 --> 01:32:02,918
by your witch's voice, now, can we?

971
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,522
Leto, where are you?

972
01:32:08,264 --> 01:32:09,697
Bring him here!

973
01:32:14,971 --> 01:32:16,939
You've done a very good job.

974
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,371
He hardly feels a thing.

975
01:32:56,379 --> 01:32:57,937
Open your mouth.

976
01:32:59,415 --> 01:33:01,645
Open it! Open it!

977
01:33:06,489 --> 01:33:09,356
You've done a good job, traitor.

978
01:33:19,736 --> 01:33:22,261
They are alike, this mother and son.

979
01:33:22,705 --> 01:33:23,694
Paul.

980
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,308
Dangerous.

981
01:33:31,915 --> 01:33:34,349
The training they have had...

982
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:37,578
beyond most people's imaginations.

983
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,313
Leto.

984
01:33:42,892 --> 01:33:45,156
I leave them in your hands, Piter.

985
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:04,763
Goodbye, Jessica.

986
01:34:05,838 --> 01:34:07,863
And goodbye to your sweet son.

987
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:11,741
I want to spit once on your head.

988
01:34:12,121 --> 01:34:14,783
Just some spittle in your face.

989
01:34:18,509 --> 01:34:20,211
What a luxury.

990
01:34:25,045 --> 01:34:27,536
We were ordered to
kill them. So kill them!

991
01:34:43,663 --> 01:34:45,854
What are your orders, Piter?

992
01:34:46,233 --> 01:34:49,361
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

993
01:34:50,303 --> 01:34:52,328
The worms will destroy the evidence.

994
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:55,203
Their bodies must never be found.

995
01:35:21,372 --> 01:35:23,806
I knew Yueh's wife.

996
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:29,837
I was the one who broke
his lmperial conditioning.

997
01:35:34,451 --> 01:35:36,976
I've thought of many pleasures with you.

998
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:41,683
It is perhaps better that you die

999
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:44,057
in the innards of a worm.

1000
01:35:44,395 --> 01:35:47,125
Desire clouds my reason.

1001
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:50,092
That is not good.

1002
01:35:51,035 --> 01:35:52,400
That is bad.

1003
01:36:47,692 --> 01:36:48,542
They're down on this floor somewhere.

1004
01:36:48,934 --> 01:36:49,746
Down there.

1005
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:11,108
Duncan!

1006
01:37:27,765 --> 01:37:30,928
Back! Keep him back from me!

1007
01:37:41,178 --> 01:37:43,476
You wish now to join your wife?

1008
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:45,408
Is that it, traitor?

1009
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,547
She lives?

1010
01:37:47,985 --> 01:37:49,885
You wish to join her?

1011
01:37:53,357 --> 01:37:54,619
Join her.

1012
01:38:03,067 --> 01:38:05,331
You think you've defeated me?

1013
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:12,765
You think I don't know what
I've gained for my wife?

1014
01:38:20,017 --> 01:38:21,575
Take him away.

1015
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:24,545
Guards!

1016
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:47,071
Where are they?

1017
01:38:47,178 --> 01:38:48,736
They're over the great desert.

1018
01:38:48,813 --> 01:38:50,838
Continue reconnaissance.

1019
01:39:14,972 --> 01:39:16,564
Yueh's sign.

1020
01:39:20,211 --> 01:39:22,042
He's left us stillsuits.

1021
01:39:30,487 --> 01:39:32,614
Don't touch my mother!

1022
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:34,453
He's trying the Voice.

1023
01:39:36,994 --> 01:39:39,724
Did you hear a noise
from the little one?

1024
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:42,922
I didn't hear anything.

1025
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:47,828
The little one.

1026
01:40:02,022 --> 01:40:03,250
Remove her gag.

1027
01:40:03,323 --> 01:40:04,483
Excellent!

1028
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:09,994
Remove

1029
01:40:10,063 --> 01:40:12,930
her gag.

1030
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:24,439
There's no need to fight over me.

1031
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:30,048
...to fight over me.

1032
01:40:35,255 --> 01:40:36,745
A poisoned blade.

1033
01:40:45,232 --> 01:40:50,169
First cut my son's bonds.

1034
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:56,037
...my son's bonds.

1035
01:40:58,812 --> 01:41:00,245
That's it.

1036
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:03,009
That's it.

1037
01:41:13,127 --> 01:41:14,492
Oh, my God!

1038
01:41:43,126 --> 01:41:45,924
Duke Leto Atreides.

1039
01:42:12,722 --> 01:42:15,850
Someone's torn the
insignia off your uniform.

1040
01:42:17,627 --> 01:42:18,924
That's careless.

1041
01:42:19,061 --> 01:42:20,392
It was Feyd.

1042
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:24,961
It was Feyd?

1043
01:42:34,444 --> 01:42:37,902
Duke Leto Atreides.

1044
01:42:41,551 --> 01:42:44,486
Where is the ducal signet ring?

1045
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:48,449
I must have his ring.

1046
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,857
The ring!

1047
01:42:55,465 --> 01:42:58,696
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

1048
01:43:00,703 --> 01:43:03,331
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

1049
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:07,941
The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?

1050
01:43:08,778 --> 01:43:10,769
Paul and Jessica safe.

1051
01:43:11,347 --> 01:43:13,440
Yes. The tooth!

1052
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:15,850
He's coming around, Baron.

1053
01:43:15,918 --> 01:43:17,317
Where's your ring?

1054
01:43:18,454 --> 01:43:19,443
Huh?

1055
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,987
You do not answer?

1056
01:43:22,058 --> 01:43:24,026
Wait! Wait!

1057
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:27,124
You must come closer.

1058
01:43:28,164 --> 01:43:31,463
The water of my life

1059
01:43:34,103 --> 01:43:35,297
for Paul.

1060
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:39,070
He's crying. He's crying!

1061
01:43:40,109 --> 01:43:42,043
What does that mean, Piter?

1062
01:43:44,814 --> 01:43:47,112
Come closer, Baron.

1063
01:43:56,092 --> 01:43:57,491
Jessica!

1064
01:43:57,927 --> 01:43:58,985
Paul!

1065
01:43:59,295 --> 01:44:00,694
Leto!

1066
01:44:01,898 --> 01:44:03,763
Leto, he's dead!

1067
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,000
Oh, he's dead!

1068
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,359
I know.

1069
01:44:16,012 --> 01:44:17,707
Am I alive?

1070
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:20,940
I'm alive?

1071
01:44:21,017 --> 01:44:22,006
Yes,

1072
01:44:23,386 --> 01:44:25,377
you're alive, my Baron.

1073
01:44:26,155 --> 01:44:27,952
I'm alive, eh?

1074
01:44:28,524 --> 01:44:30,355
I'm alive!

1075
01:44:31,127 --> 01:44:34,096
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1076
01:44:48,411 --> 01:44:50,641
I can't maintain any altitude.

1077
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:53,515
We'll never reach the safety of rock.

1078
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:59,520
Maybe that small rock.

1079
01:45:00,056 --> 01:45:01,819
Where are we, do you think?

1080
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:03,721
The south polar regions.

1081
01:45:04,193 --> 01:45:07,629
The forbidden area. Hold on.

1082
01:45:16,506 --> 01:45:18,064
Hurry!

1083
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:22,410
Take the stillsuits!

1084
01:45:24,447 --> 01:45:25,744
Hurry!

1085
01:45:25,815 --> 01:45:27,783
This crash might bring a worm.

1086
01:45:33,055 --> 01:45:34,317
The signet.

1087
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:37,120
A million deaths are
not enough for Yueh!

1088
01:45:59,049 --> 01:46:01,017
Where are my feelings?

1089
01:46:01,084 --> 01:46:02,915
I feel for no one.

1090
01:46:07,324 --> 01:46:09,155
The second moon.

1091
01:46:23,275 --> 01:46:26,472
I mean Paul Atreides.

1092
01:46:26,912 --> 01:46:29,380
We want him killed.

1093
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:43,927
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

1094
01:47:07,658 --> 01:47:10,855
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

1095
01:47:14,564 --> 01:47:18,091
The sleeper must awaken.

1096
01:47:18,092 --> 01:47:24,988
Muad'Dib...Muad'Dib...Muad'Dib...

1097
01:47:26,777 --> 01:47:28,642
They will call me

1098
01:47:29,246 --> 01:47:30,941
Muad'Dib.

1099
01:47:38,121 --> 01:47:41,318
Listen to me. Listen!

1100
01:47:42,326 --> 01:47:44,624
You wanted to know about my dreams.

1101
01:47:45,696 --> 01:47:48,130
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

1102
01:47:49,566 --> 01:47:52,364
Do you know why? The spice!

1103
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,170
It's in everything here.

1104
01:47:55,605 --> 01:47:57,205
Calm yourself.

1105
01:47:57,441 --> 01:47:59,409
Like the Truthsayer drug.

1106
01:48:01,211 --> 01:48:02,508
It's a poison.

1107
01:48:03,613 --> 01:48:06,013
You knew the spice would change me.

1108
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,540
But thanks to your teachings,

1109
01:48:08,618 --> 01:48:10,848
it's changing my consciousness.

1110
01:48:11,088 --> 01:48:13,921
I see it! I can see it!

1111
01:48:14,691 --> 01:48:16,215
Is he the one?

1112
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:20,288
You carry my unborn sister in your womb.

1113
01:48:20,364 --> 01:48:21,661
He knows.

1114
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,856
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood.

1115
01:48:30,842 --> 01:48:33,006
I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach!

1116
01:48:33,514 --> 01:48:35,004
I'm something different.

1117
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:37,831
Something unexpected.

1118
01:48:39,789 --> 01:48:41,747
I am so much more.

1119
01:48:44,986 --> 01:48:47,921
You don't begin to know me.

1120
01:48:51,799 --> 01:48:53,323
Father!

1121
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,258
Father, I promise,

1122
01:49:00,355 --> 01:49:03,198
one day the sleeper will awaken.

1123
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:18,746
Father.

1124
01:49:23,093 --> 01:49:29,451
"Dreams are as simple or as complicated as the
dreamer." - Liet Kynes, Imperial Ecologist.

1125
01:49:30,942 --> 01:49:38,287
Book III: Muad'Dib

1126
01:49:57,218 --> 01:49:57,970
Go now.

1127
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:04,536
Take him to his desert to die.

1128
01:50:06,746 --> 01:50:08,068
Go.

1129
01:51:00,778 --> 01:51:02,871
Rabban! Rabban!

1130
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,275
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!

1131
01:51:07,418 --> 01:51:09,477
We've gutted them!

1132
01:51:09,553 --> 01:51:11,248
We've gutted them!

1133
01:51:15,559 --> 01:51:18,255
Rabban! Rabban!

1134
01:51:19,663 --> 01:51:22,564
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

1135
01:51:22,633 --> 01:51:25,534
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

1136
01:51:25,603 --> 01:51:30,438
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

1137
01:51:30,508 --> 01:51:33,375
Give me spice! Drive them!

1138
01:51:33,444 --> 01:51:35,469
Drive them into utter submission!

1139
01:51:35,546 --> 01:51:38,674
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

1140
01:51:38,749 --> 01:51:41,877
Never stop! Go! Go!

1141
01:51:41,952 --> 01:51:43,146
Show no mercy!

1142
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:53,696
Feyd.

1143
01:52:01,616 --> 01:52:06,110
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

1144
01:52:07,289 --> 01:52:09,120
I'll send you.

1145
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:11,083
Feyd.

1146
01:52:15,597 --> 01:52:17,155
Lovely Feyd.

1147
01:52:23,939 --> 01:52:26,066
Where's my doctor?

1148
01:52:32,195 --> 01:52:34,569
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

1149
01:52:46,609 --> 01:52:48,941
We have to get to that mountain of rock.

1150
01:52:50,731 --> 01:52:52,739
We have entered the time
when all will turn against us

1151
01:52:52,822 --> 01:52:54,312
and seek our lives.

1152
01:53:10,467 --> 01:53:12,435
It's further than I thought.

1153
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,664
A worm is sure to come.

1154
01:53:18,084 --> 01:53:21,157
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

1155
01:53:49,688 --> 01:53:50,744
Remember...

1156
01:53:51,645 --> 01:53:54,570
walk without rhythm and
we won't attract the worm.

1157
01:53:54,775 --> 01:53:56,404
It will go to the thumper.

1158
01:53:58,651 --> 01:54:00,079
I'm ready.

1159
01:54:39,443 --> 01:54:40,654
Faster!

1160
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:44,961
It's deafening!

1161
01:55:53,049 --> 01:55:53,903
The spice!

1162
01:55:56,358 --> 01:55:57,340
Do you smell it?

1163
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:58,966
Yes!

1164
01:56:06,351 --> 01:56:07,367
Paul!

1165
01:56:21,247 --> 01:56:22,117
Paul!

1166
01:56:33,991 --> 01:56:35,014
A thumper.

1167
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:02,463
What's happened?

1168
01:57:03,089 --> 01:57:05,393
Why did it leave?

1169
01:57:05,652 --> 01:57:08,136
Someone started another thumper.

1170
01:57:11,681 --> 01:57:12,871
We're not alone.

1171
01:57:42,842 --> 01:57:44,388
Man-carved steps.

1172
01:57:44,629 --> 01:57:45,497
Yes.

1173
01:57:59,893 --> 01:58:03,351
Such stealth. I didn't hear them.

1174
01:58:04,096 --> 01:58:07,463
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

1175
01:58:07,767 --> 01:58:09,462
I will take the boy-man.

1176
01:58:10,202 --> 01:58:12,568
He shall have sanctuary in my tribe.

1177
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:22,069
Stop!

1178
01:58:22,214 --> 01:58:25,615
Get back! She has the weirding way.

1179
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,519
Great gods!

1180
01:58:30,256 --> 01:58:33,123
If you can do this to
the strongest of us,

1181
01:58:33,492 --> 01:58:36,689
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

1182
01:58:39,698 --> 01:58:42,462
As the leader of my
people, I give you my bond.

1183
01:58:43,469 --> 01:58:45,960
Teach us this weirding way,

1184
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:49,272
and you both shall have sanctuary.

1185
01:58:49,341 --> 01:58:52,276
Your water shall mingle with our water.

1186
01:58:53,979 --> 01:58:56,470
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

1187
01:59:00,619 --> 01:59:03,952
I give you the word
bond of a Bene Gesserit.

1188
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:06,185
It is the legend.

1189
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:14,665
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

1190
01:59:16,168 --> 01:59:19,296
I would not have permitted
you to harm my tribe.

1191
01:59:25,336 --> 01:59:28,069
Come with me. I'll show you
an easier way down.

1192
01:59:41,695 --> 01:59:43,356
He surprised me.

1193
01:59:44,631 --> 01:59:46,394
It was an accident.

1194
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,500
Stilgar, I invoke the Amtal Rule.

1195
01:59:51,838 --> 01:59:53,931
Jamis, you force this fight.

1196
01:59:54,107 --> 01:59:56,473
These people have my countenance.

1197
01:59:56,543 --> 01:59:59,876
If you should win, I will cut you down.

1198
01:59:59,946 --> 02:00:01,743
Jamis, I don't want to fight you.

1199
02:00:01,815 --> 02:00:02,873
Maybe if
I explain--

1200
02:00:02,949 --> 02:00:04,041
Explain?

1201
02:00:04,951 --> 02:00:06,782
Explain death.

1202
02:00:06,887 --> 02:00:11,221
I am going to sheath
my knife in your blood.

1203
02:00:12,893 --> 02:00:14,258
No shields.

1204
02:00:15,061 --> 02:00:16,995
I'm used to shield fighting.

1205
02:00:17,831 --> 02:00:19,355
Take my crysknife.

1206
02:00:23,303 --> 02:00:26,238
Jamis turns to the right
with his knife after a parry.

1207
02:00:27,574 --> 02:00:29,701
And watch for a knife switch.

1208
02:00:44,457 --> 02:00:47,449
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1209
02:01:48,388 --> 02:01:51,659
How does it feel to be a killer?

1210
02:02:14,518 --> 02:02:16,817
He gives water to the dead.

1211
02:02:24,813 --> 02:02:28,329
My son has never killed before this day.

1212
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:30,339
You have strength.

1213
02:02:31,313 --> 02:02:33,474
You shall be known as Usul,

1214
02:02:33,648 --> 02:02:36,446
which is the strength of
the base of the pillar.

1215
02:02:37,018 --> 02:02:39,418
This is your secret name in our troop.

1216
02:02:40,188 --> 02:02:42,884
But you must choose the name of manhood,

1217
02:02:43,358 --> 02:02:45,553
which we will call you openly.

1218
02:02:48,597 --> 02:02:51,930
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

1219
02:02:54,636 --> 02:02:57,400
We call that one Muad'Dib.

1220
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,206
Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

1221
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:04,271
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

1222
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:08,874
And your mother shall
be a Sayyidina among us.

1223
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:11,378
We welcome you.

1224
02:03:12,888 --> 02:03:15,755
The dream unfolds.

1225
02:03:47,411 --> 02:03:49,879
The wife and sons of Jamis.

1226
02:05:09,328 --> 02:05:11,956
This water belongs to Usul.

1227
02:05:12,398 --> 02:05:14,798
May he guard it for the tribe.

1228
02:05:15,134 --> 02:05:18,069
May he be generous with
it in time of need.

1229
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:26,936
Jamis carried 33 liters and seven
and three thirty second drachms.

1230
02:05:27,013 --> 02:05:28,605
Do you accept them?

1231
02:05:32,118 --> 02:05:33,107
Yes.

1232
02:05:35,087 --> 02:05:36,520
Water masters.

1233
02:06:01,724 --> 02:06:02,884
Moisture!

1234
02:06:03,026 --> 02:06:04,186
Wind traps.

1235
02:06:05,361 --> 02:06:06,828
Huge ones.

1236
02:06:13,737 --> 02:06:16,638
Water. Millions of decaliters.

1237
02:06:17,675 --> 02:06:18,241
A treasure.

1238
02:06:19,376 --> 02:06:21,469
Greater than treasure, Usul.

1239
02:06:22,379 --> 02:06:25,405
We have thousands of such caches,

1240
02:06:26,951 --> 02:06:29,818
and only a few of us know them all.

1241
02:06:30,387 --> 02:06:32,582
And when we have enough,

1242
02:06:33,457 --> 02:06:36,392
we shall change the face of Arrakis.

1243
02:06:56,647 --> 02:06:58,740
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1244
02:07:01,852 --> 02:07:04,286
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1245
02:07:25,209 --> 02:07:26,574
What is it?

1246
02:07:28,012 --> 02:07:30,640
Liet, Chani's father,

1247
02:07:30,714 --> 02:07:34,275
the leader of our people, is dead.

1248
02:07:34,351 --> 02:07:36,114
Killed by the Harkonnen.

1249
02:07:37,154 --> 02:07:39,622
For the father, nothing.

1250
02:07:40,424 --> 02:07:42,790
Both of us have lost our fathers.

1251
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,372
Feyd, even though he's aging,

1252
02:08:14,583 --> 02:08:17,882
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

1253
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:22,552
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

1254
02:08:26,162 --> 02:08:27,186
Quiet now.

1255
02:08:27,263 --> 02:08:28,230
I will.

1256
02:08:28,297 --> 02:08:29,525
Come.

1257
02:08:43,345 --> 02:08:44,812
Oh, Thufir,

1258
02:08:45,814 --> 02:08:48,647
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

1259
02:08:50,252 --> 02:08:52,652
Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.

1260
02:08:53,856 --> 02:08:55,756
But this is not why we're here.

1261
02:08:57,026 --> 02:08:59,551
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

1262
02:09:01,063 --> 02:09:03,588
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

1263
02:09:04,767 --> 02:09:08,703
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

1264
02:09:09,538 --> 02:09:13,338
By milking this-- this
smooth, little cat's body,

1265
02:09:13,409 --> 02:09:15,400
you receive your antidote.

1266
02:09:15,544 --> 02:09:17,569
It must be done each day.

1267
02:09:20,716 --> 02:09:25,380
All I can see is an
Atreides that I want to kill.

1268
02:09:26,589 --> 02:09:29,456
Feyd, no. No!

1269
02:09:30,593 --> 02:09:32,891
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

1270
02:09:33,681 --> 02:09:35,455
Aren't you, Thufir?

1271
02:09:35,998 --> 02:09:39,866
My Duke, how I've failed you.

1272
02:09:44,914 --> 02:09:46,211
Jessica,

1273
02:09:48,217 --> 02:09:50,617
our Reverend Mother is too old.

1274
02:09:51,554 --> 02:09:54,114
She has been calling
through space and time

1275
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:56,351
for you to come and let her rest.

1276
02:09:57,794 --> 02:10:00,558
She asks that you pass within

1277
02:10:01,431 --> 02:10:03,490
and become our Reverend Mother.

1278
02:10:06,093 --> 02:10:08,376
Do you know the Water Of Life?

1279
02:10:11,433 --> 02:10:15,678
Come watch the mystery of mysteries.

1280
02:10:17,077 --> 02:10:20,061
The end, and the beginning.

1281
02:11:14,338 --> 02:11:16,004
The Water Of Life.

1282
02:11:22,693 --> 02:11:25,175
The Water Of Life.

1283
02:11:27,368 --> 02:11:31,532
If you be a Reverend Mother,

1284
02:11:33,774 --> 02:11:37,505
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

1285
02:11:46,987 --> 02:11:49,512
But what of my unborn child?

1286
02:12:12,978 --> 02:12:15,242
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,

1287
02:12:15,313 --> 02:12:17,543
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life

1288
02:12:17,616 --> 02:12:19,811
as she surrendered her knowledge.

1289
02:12:20,552 --> 02:12:24,716
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

1290
02:12:26,712 --> 02:12:29,212
Every man who has tried has died.

1291
02:12:31,308 --> 02:12:33,932
The sleeper must awaken.

1292
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:37,440
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life

1293
02:12:37,876 --> 02:12:42,075
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

1294
02:12:45,486 --> 02:12:47,097
Alia was born with all the knowledge

1295
02:12:47,551 --> 02:12:50,245
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

1296
02:13:15,245 --> 02:13:16,367
Chani, I love you.

1297
02:13:18,651 --> 02:13:20,455
I've always loved you.

1298
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:34,930
We sense that you may be the
voice from the outer world.

1299
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,219
Both moons told us of you.

1300
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:42,767
You must pass tests before we will know.

1301
02:13:43,712 --> 02:13:46,142
You must conquer the
beast of the desert,

1302
02:13:46,766 --> 02:13:51,135
both his outer and his
deadly inner powers.

1303
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:55,705
Speak to us from the outer world.

1304
02:14:03,818 --> 02:14:06,116
The Holy Warriors.

1305
02:14:07,188 --> 02:14:09,656
No one ever dreamed there were so many.

1306
02:14:11,292 --> 02:14:15,626
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1307
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,898
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

1308
02:14:21,969 --> 02:14:24,267
are once again in control of Arrakis.

1309
02:14:25,639 --> 02:14:27,766
Stilgar, your leader,

1310
02:14:28,142 --> 02:14:29,609
has asked me and my mother

1311
02:14:29,677 --> 02:14:32,578
to teach you the weirding
way to crush the Harkonnens.

1312
02:14:34,348 --> 02:14:36,248
We must do more than this.

1313
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:40,849
We must totally destroy all
spice production on Arrakis.

1314
02:14:42,423 --> 02:14:46,018
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1315
02:14:47,461 --> 02:14:50,487
He who can destroy a
thing, controls a thing.

1316
02:14:51,799 --> 02:14:54,597
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1317
02:14:55,302 --> 02:14:57,998
This 100 will train the
thousands that remain.

1318
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:01,064
When the spice flow stops,

1319
02:15:01,609 --> 02:15:03,941
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1320
02:15:04,845 --> 02:15:06,710
The Baron and the Emperor himself

1321
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:08,611
will be forced to deal with us.

1322
02:15:11,919 --> 02:15:16,618
Arrakis will become the
center of the Universe.

1323
02:15:18,893 --> 02:15:19,882
Orato!

1324
02:15:23,697 --> 02:15:27,224
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

1325
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:30,359
Kick it.

1326
02:15:37,211 --> 02:15:38,200
Hit it.

1327
02:15:43,817 --> 02:15:45,182
Yell at it.

1328
02:15:50,724 --> 02:15:51,986
Break!

1329
02:15:54,361 --> 02:15:56,955
Korba, cut it.

1330
02:16:10,344 --> 02:16:11,709
Move back.

1331
02:16:40,741 --> 02:16:43,972
This is part of the weirding
way that we will teach you.

1332
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:50,272
Some thoughts have a certain sound

1333
02:16:51,185 --> 02:16:53,449
that being the equivalent to a form.

1334
02:16:54,188 --> 02:16:56,315
Through sound and motion,

1335
02:16:56,724 --> 02:17:00,785
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1336
02:17:01,128 --> 02:17:05,394
set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

1337
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,232
We will kill until no
Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

1338
02:17:10,304 --> 02:17:12,704
Muad'Dib!

1339
02:17:23,284 --> 02:17:24,444
Stilgar.

1340
02:17:26,587 --> 02:17:27,576
Muad'Dib.

1341
02:17:27,655 --> 02:17:28,679
Hmm?

1342
02:17:28,756 --> 02:17:31,919
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1343
02:17:36,864 --> 02:17:39,264
My name is a killing word.

1344
02:17:40,122 --> 02:17:41,820
They are ready to fight.

1345
02:17:42,036 --> 02:17:43,799
Yet in order to lead them,

1346
02:17:43,871 --> 02:17:46,999
I must conquer the
worm, conquer Shai-Hulud.

1347
02:18:14,635 --> 02:18:17,627
Usul, it is time you become a sand rider

1348
02:18:17,705 --> 02:18:19,673
and travel as a Fremen.

1349
02:18:20,974 --> 02:18:23,704
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch

1350
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:26,708
and ride as a leader of men.

1351
02:18:34,755 --> 02:18:36,313
Two thumpers are planted.

1352
02:18:36,423 --> 02:18:38,357
The worm may not surface for the first.

1353
02:18:38,492 --> 02:18:40,460
He will rise for the second.

1354
02:18:40,828 --> 02:18:42,455
And remember,

1355
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:46,358
when the worm approaches,
you must be utterly still

1356
02:18:46,433 --> 02:18:48,458
and close enough to plant the hook

1357
02:18:48,569 --> 02:18:50,867
firmly under a ring segment.

1358
02:18:51,238 --> 02:18:53,672
The worm will turn to
lift this exposed area

1359
02:18:53,741 --> 02:18:56,005
as far from the abrasive
sand as possible,

1360
02:18:56,076 --> 02:18:59,045
and it will take you with it to the top.

1361
02:19:00,781 --> 02:19:02,112
Do not get too close.

1362
02:19:02,182 --> 02:19:04,707
As he approaches, the
sand will engulf you.

1363
02:19:08,756 --> 02:19:11,122
Wait till the head of the worm passes,

1364
02:19:11,191 --> 02:19:13,625
then go quickly.

1365
02:19:37,718 --> 02:19:39,515
Shai-Hulud.

1366
02:20:19,968 --> 02:20:24,087
I must not fear. Fear
is the mind killer.

1367
02:20:32,237 --> 02:20:34,746
Only the very strong
ones travel this deep.

1368
02:20:35,995 --> 02:20:37,848
Usul has called a big one!

1369
02:20:39,184 --> 02:20:41,652
Again, it is the legend.

1370
02:22:31,309 --> 02:22:34,253
Now we are ready for battle.

1371
02:22:37,766 --> 02:22:41,524
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors

1372
02:22:42,077 --> 02:22:45,151
to serve you as your guard.

1373
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:52,687
The Fedaykin.

1374
02:23:05,961 --> 02:23:06,979
Now.

1375
02:24:13,153 --> 02:24:16,418
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1376
02:24:16,523 --> 02:24:17,649
Muad'Dib.

1377
02:24:17,725 --> 02:24:18,851
What happened?

1378
02:24:19,493 --> 02:24:21,222
What happened to you and your men?

1379
02:24:21,295 --> 02:24:22,489
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1380
02:24:22,563 --> 02:24:23,621
What are you saying?

1381
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:27,633
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1382
02:24:29,503 --> 02:24:32,472
He's been repeating that
name ever since we found him.

1383
02:24:33,107 --> 02:24:37,373
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1384
02:24:39,551 --> 02:24:42,418
In the two standard years that followed,

1385
02:24:42,487 --> 02:24:46,617
Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.

1386
02:24:47,525 --> 02:24:50,494
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best

1387
02:24:50,562 --> 02:24:53,827
to hide this fact from
his uncle, the Baron.

1388
02:25:00,305 --> 02:25:03,741
Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.

1389
02:25:03,808 --> 02:25:06,868
Her small body harboured
tremendous powers.

1390
02:25:08,446 --> 02:25:11,074
Paul and Chani's love grew.

1391
02:25:16,321 --> 02:25:17,948
We surprised a band of smugglers.

1392
02:25:18,022 --> 02:25:19,819
Too bad. I thought they were Harkonnen.

1393
02:25:32,370 --> 02:25:33,701
Gurney!

1394
02:25:37,375 --> 02:25:40,139
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

1395
02:25:40,745 --> 02:25:41,734
Paul?

1396
02:25:43,681 --> 02:25:44,705
Paul...

1397
02:25:44,782 --> 02:25:46,443
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1398
02:25:46,584 --> 02:25:48,279
They said you were dead.

1399
02:25:51,122 --> 02:25:52,111
They...

1400
02:25:52,857 --> 02:25:53,846
They said...

1401
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:00,797
Gurney man!

1402
02:26:00,865 --> 02:26:01,954
You young puppy!

1403
02:26:07,164 --> 02:26:15,489
"And that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub
of the Universe with the wheel poised to spin." -
from 'Arrakis Awakening' by The Princess Irulan.

1404
02:26:16,662 --> 02:26:22,684
Book IV: The Prophet

1405
02:26:40,542 --> 02:26:42,669
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1406
02:26:42,744 --> 02:26:46,703
you have one last chance to
take matters into your own hands

1407
02:26:46,781 --> 02:26:50,148
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

1408
02:26:50,218 --> 02:26:51,446
What do you
mean, one last--

1409
02:26:51,519 --> 02:26:52,713
Do not speak.

1410
02:26:52,787 --> 02:26:56,689
Listen. You do not have
more than this one chance.

1411
02:26:56,958 --> 02:26:59,552
I represent the entire
Guild in this matter.

1412
02:27:00,328 --> 02:27:04,196
Our Navigators warn you that spice
production is in great danger.

1413
02:27:04,266 --> 02:27:06,530
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

1414
02:27:06,668 --> 02:27:08,932
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.

1415
02:27:09,004 --> 02:27:12,235
Our Navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

1416
02:27:12,307 --> 02:27:15,208
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

1417
02:27:15,277 --> 02:27:17,370
We do not know who he is.

1418
02:27:17,712 --> 02:27:19,805
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

1419
02:27:20,782 --> 02:27:24,274
Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,

1420
02:27:24,352 --> 02:27:27,344
or you'll live out your
life in a pain amplifier.

1421
02:27:35,497 --> 02:27:36,987
The Emperor will stop him.

1422
02:27:37,065 --> 02:27:38,794
He won't take the Water of Life.

1423
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:48,976
I want 50 legion of
Sardaukar on Arrakis at once!

1424
02:27:49,344 --> 02:27:50,936
50 legions?

1425
02:27:51,079 --> 02:27:52,706
That's our entire reserves as well.

1426
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:54,180
This is genocide,

1427
02:27:54,249 --> 02:27:56,444
the deliberate and
systematic destruction

1428
02:27:56,551 --> 02:27:58,678
of all life on Arrakis!

1429
02:27:59,672 --> 02:28:01,363
The Emperor is coming!

1430
02:28:01,837 --> 02:28:03,210
Chani! Chani!

1431
02:28:04,997 --> 02:28:05,699
Oh, Chani.

1432
02:28:07,538 --> 02:28:09,096
All the images of my future are gone.

1433
02:28:12,013 --> 02:28:14,233
I have to drink the Water of Life.

1434
02:28:14,809 --> 02:28:17,243
No, Paul, please.

1435
02:28:17,612 --> 02:28:19,375
I've seen the men who have tried.

1436
02:28:19,514 --> 02:28:21,277
I've seen how they died.

1437
02:28:21,549 --> 02:28:25,183
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

1438
02:28:28,156 --> 02:28:31,182
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1439
02:28:32,093 --> 02:28:33,082
Paul.

1440
02:28:37,365 --> 02:28:39,299
I must drink the sacred water.

1441
02:28:42,837 --> 02:28:44,429
We must go now.

1442
02:29:39,327 --> 02:29:42,592
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

1443
02:29:43,598 --> 02:29:44,587
Paul.

1444
02:29:47,168 --> 02:29:49,136
I will love you forever.

1445
02:29:49,837 --> 02:29:51,566
You are my life.

1446
02:30:01,682 --> 02:30:03,309
You are my life.

1447
02:30:09,724 --> 02:30:11,749
Many men have tried.

1448
02:30:12,393 --> 02:30:13,918
They tried and failed?

1449
02:30:14,429 --> 02:30:16,124
They tried and died.

1450
02:31:23,261 --> 02:31:24,785
Alia...

1451
02:31:25,979 --> 02:31:27,424
Mother.

1452
02:31:29,227 --> 02:31:30,919
It's Paul.

1453
02:31:33,566 --> 02:31:37,126
He's taken the Water Of Life.

1454
02:31:42,984 --> 02:31:44,317
Paul's voice!

1455
02:31:46,622 --> 02:31:47,649
The Guild,

1456
02:31:50,402 --> 02:31:53,776
they're fighting me
in the mental worlds.

1457
02:31:55,067 --> 02:31:57,397
They're behind everything.

1458
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,881
They fear the one who'll come.

1459
02:32:02,686 --> 02:32:04,257
Who'll know more.

1460
02:32:05,576 --> 02:32:06,911
Who'll see more.

1461
02:32:11,347 --> 02:32:14,496
There is a place terrifying to us,

1462
02:32:15,647 --> 02:32:16,464
to women.

1463
02:32:16,921 --> 02:32:19,739
This is the place they cannot look.

1464
02:32:21,309 --> 02:32:24,496
Travelling without moving.

1465
02:32:26,026 --> 02:32:28,440
Now I truly control the worm

1466
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:31,673
and the spice.

1467
02:32:32,868 --> 02:32:37,729
And I have the power to
destroy the spice forever!

1468
02:32:53,201 --> 02:32:54,190
Paul.

1469
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:56,459
Paul.

1470
02:32:57,672 --> 02:32:58,661
Paul.

1471
02:33:06,281 --> 02:33:07,646
Father!

1472
02:33:11,253 --> 02:33:12,242
Father.

1473
02:33:12,754 --> 02:33:15,723
The sleeper has awakened!

1474
02:33:22,030 --> 02:33:24,225
Muad'Dib.

1475
02:33:24,899 --> 02:33:26,958
Muad'Dib.

1476
02:33:27,535 --> 02:33:29,935
Muad'Dib.

1477
02:33:30,438 --> 02:33:31,996
Muad'Dib.

1478
02:33:33,374 --> 02:33:34,636
Muad'Dib.

1479
02:33:34,709 --> 02:33:35,869
Arrakis,

1480
02:33:37,378 --> 02:33:38,640
Dune,

1481
02:33:39,981 --> 02:33:41,471
desert planet.

1482
02:33:43,084 --> 02:33:45,075
Your time has come.

1483
02:33:45,987 --> 02:33:49,980
A storm is coming. Our storm.

1484
02:33:51,459 --> 02:33:54,724
And when it arrives, it
will shake the Universe.

1485
02:33:57,265 --> 02:34:00,894
Emperor, we come for you!

1486
02:34:02,811 --> 02:34:04,773
We come for you!

1487
02:34:19,470 --> 02:34:21,995
Long live the fighters!

1488
02:34:22,173 --> 02:34:25,438
Long live the fighters!

1489
02:34:56,724 --> 02:34:58,224
Suspicion confirmed.

1490
02:34:58,465 --> 02:35:00,792
The Emperor's had Rabban seized.

1491
02:35:53,845 --> 02:35:55,710
Stand by the main control room.

1492
02:36:25,777 --> 02:36:28,940
Gurney, when the storm
hits, set off the atomics.

1493
02:36:30,015 --> 02:36:32,779
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1494
02:36:34,519 --> 02:36:37,283
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1495
02:36:40,291 --> 02:36:44,591
Usul, we have wormsign the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1496
02:37:40,685 --> 02:37:44,917
Bring in that floating
fat man, the Baron.

1497
02:38:03,441 --> 02:38:05,238
Why have you brought me here?

1498
02:38:05,443 --> 02:38:08,935
Your Highness, there
must be some mistake.

1499
02:38:09,547 --> 02:38:11,481
I never requested your presence.

1500
02:38:11,549 --> 02:38:12,538
Ah.

1501
02:38:12,917 --> 02:38:15,283
But your lack of action demanded it.

1502
02:38:15,353 --> 02:38:18,015
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1503
02:38:18,089 --> 02:38:21,024
in assigning to Rabban the governorship.

1504
02:38:21,526 --> 02:38:22,959
You've forced me to come here

1505
02:38:23,027 --> 02:38:25,495
and set things straight, personally.

1506
02:38:25,764 --> 02:38:29,222
And why did you not tell me of the
fighting ability of these people?

1507
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:32,064
We've just flushed out a nest
of them in the open desert

1508
02:38:32,137 --> 02:38:36,335
and the women and children
overpowered some of our Sardaukar.

1509
02:38:36,474 --> 02:38:38,772
We managed only one hostage.

1510
02:38:38,977 --> 02:38:40,467
Bring in the hostage!

1511
02:38:41,613 --> 02:38:43,046
Only one.

1512
02:38:53,825 --> 02:38:57,352
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1513
02:38:58,429 --> 02:39:00,226
Poor Emperor.

1514
02:39:00,732 --> 02:39:04,532
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1515
02:39:04,602 --> 02:39:06,035
Silence!

1516
02:39:06,104 --> 02:39:07,799
Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1517
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:09,263
Kill her.

1518
02:39:10,441 --> 02:39:13,342
Get out of my mind!

1519
02:39:13,411 --> 02:39:16,039
Not until you tell them both

1520
02:39:16,114 --> 02:39:18,878
who I really am.

1521
02:39:19,017 --> 02:39:20,678
...who I really am.

1522
02:39:20,752 --> 02:39:22,014
Alia,

1523
02:39:24,189 --> 02:39:27,454
daughter of Duke Leto the Just

1524
02:39:27,792 --> 02:39:30,488
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1525
02:39:31,362 --> 02:39:32,590
Sister

1526
02:39:33,498 --> 02:39:37,264
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1527
02:39:37,368 --> 02:39:41,270
Paul's sister? Paul is Muad'Dib?

1528
02:39:51,616 --> 02:39:53,948
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1529
02:39:58,523 --> 02:39:59,485
With the storm,

1530
02:39:59,557 --> 02:40:01,855
their air power will be useless.

1531
02:40:02,093 --> 02:40:05,062
On Arrakis, it's desert power.

1532
02:40:05,530 --> 02:40:06,519
Gurney.

1533
02:40:08,266 --> 02:40:09,324
Now!

1534
02:40:09,467 --> 02:40:10,559
Atomics!

1535
02:40:51,676 --> 02:40:53,234
Our army awaits us.

1536
02:40:54,946 --> 02:40:59,883
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1537
02:41:01,352 --> 02:41:02,580
Impossible!

1538
02:41:02,654 --> 02:41:04,519
Not impossible.

1539
02:41:04,656 --> 02:41:08,183
I told you. He is here now.

1540
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:18,109
Father, today I will avenge your death.

1541
02:41:41,427 --> 02:41:43,740
An impassable storm has descended.

1542
02:41:43,863 --> 02:41:46,957
The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.

1543
02:41:48,801 --> 02:41:50,462
Release the Sardaukar.

1544
02:41:50,569 --> 02:41:54,733
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1545
02:41:56,075 --> 02:41:58,669
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1546
02:43:45,927 --> 02:43:47,758
Wait for my brother.

1547
02:44:59,037 --> 02:45:00,116
Alia, now.

1548
02:45:00,701 --> 02:45:02,422
Come to me, Baron.

1549
02:46:19,317 --> 02:46:21,079
Muad'Dib!

1550
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:13,928
My God. They've taken your mind.

1551
02:47:15,528 --> 02:47:18,632
Gurney, I see Thufir
Hawat among the captives.

1552
02:47:19,845 --> 02:47:21,166
Let him stand free.

1553
02:47:28,875 --> 02:47:30,161
The antidote...

1554
02:47:32,815 --> 02:47:33,790
Thufir.

1555
02:47:36,365 --> 02:47:37,724
Come.

1556
02:47:45,696 --> 02:47:48,301
In payment of many years
service to my family

1557
02:47:49,172 --> 02:47:51,153
you may now ask of me anything you wish.

1558
02:47:52,211 --> 02:47:54,100
Anything at all.

1559
02:47:56,730 --> 02:47:58,686
Do you need my life, old friend?

1560
02:48:00,566 --> 02:48:02,145
It is yours.

1561
02:48:07,149 --> 02:48:08,398
I mean this, Thufir.

1562
02:48:09,635 --> 02:48:12,758
If you are to strike, do it now.

1563
02:48:45,037 --> 02:48:49,710
Three generations of...you.

1564
02:49:04,828 --> 02:49:08,104
Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.

1565
02:49:24,339 --> 02:49:25,899
Do him all honour.

1566
02:49:28,930 --> 02:49:31,364
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1567
02:49:31,432 --> 02:49:33,559
there are Guild Heighliners above us

1568
02:49:33,634 --> 02:49:36,068
containing many Great
Houses of the Landsraad.

1569
02:49:36,304 --> 02:49:37,862
Send them back.

1570
02:49:37,939 --> 02:49:39,668
How dare you
speak to me in--

1571
02:49:39,740 --> 02:49:41,037
Stop your speaking.

1572
02:49:43,778 --> 02:49:46,178
You have some idea of what I could do.

1573
02:49:48,983 --> 02:49:51,850
Don't try your powers on me.

1574
02:49:52,987 --> 02:49:55,421
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1575
02:49:55,489 --> 02:49:57,218
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1576
02:49:57,291 --> 02:49:58,451
You mustn't
speak--

1577
02:49:58,526 --> 02:49:59,618
Silence!

1578
02:50:03,564 --> 02:50:05,395
I remember your gom jabbar.

1579
02:50:06,534 --> 02:50:08,331
Now you'll remember mine.

1580
02:50:08,469 --> 02:50:10,266
I can kill with a word.

1581
02:50:12,606 --> 02:50:14,801
And his word shall carry death eternal

1582
02:50:16,043 --> 02:50:17,977
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1583
02:50:18,045 --> 02:50:19,535
The righteous?

1584
02:50:19,613 --> 02:50:21,877
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1585
02:50:24,352 --> 02:50:28,288
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1586
02:50:28,356 --> 02:50:32,053
If Feyd wishes, he can meet
you with my blade in his hand.

1587
02:50:32,126 --> 02:50:33,252
I wish it.

1588
02:50:33,327 --> 02:50:35,318
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1589
02:50:36,130 --> 02:50:38,462
Let me. Please, my Lord.

1590
02:50:39,133 --> 02:50:40,657
The Emperor's blade.

1591
02:51:09,565 --> 02:51:11,760
Why prolong the inevitable?

1592
02:51:14,704 --> 02:51:16,103
I will kill you.

1593
02:51:31,888 --> 02:51:33,412
I will kill him!

1594
02:51:40,330 --> 02:51:41,422
Paul.

1595
02:51:42,865 --> 02:51:44,696
I will kill him!

1596
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:54,839
Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps?

1597
02:51:55,815 --> 02:51:58,648
Will she deserve my special attentions?

1598
02:52:06,263 --> 02:52:09,096
You see your death.

1599
02:52:09,866 --> 02:52:11,891
My blade will finish you.

1600
02:52:13,306 --> 02:52:16,398
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

1601
02:52:29,822 --> 02:52:31,312
Chaaksa!

1602
02:52:39,067 --> 02:52:40,135
Muad'Dib.

1603
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:43,735
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1604
02:52:45,799 --> 02:52:47,276
Emperor Shaddam...

1605
02:52:48,115 --> 02:52:49,964
Irulan shall be my wife,

1606
02:52:50,679 --> 02:52:53,271
opening the way for an
Atreides to take the throne.

1607
02:52:54,516 --> 02:52:55,765
I sit on the throne!

1608
02:52:56,271 --> 02:52:59,490
You will sit on a throne on Salusa
Secundas, your prison planet.

1609
02:53:00,611 --> 02:53:02,420
Either that or you will die.

1610
02:53:17,361 --> 02:53:20,856
The princess shall have
no more of me than my name.

1611
02:53:22,098 --> 02:53:23,343
No child of mine

1612
02:53:24,373 --> 02:53:27,997
nor touch, nor softness of
glance, nor instant of desire.

1613
02:53:31,265 --> 02:53:34,076
This is my promise to you

1614
02:53:36,564 --> 02:53:38,178
my love.

1615
02:53:46,993 --> 02:53:48,603
Think on it, Chani.

1616
02:53:49,955 --> 02:53:52,362
We who carry the name of concubine,

1617
02:53:54,063 --> 02:53:56,743
history will call us wives.

1618
02:54:01,246 --> 02:54:03,800
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God

1619
02:54:04,604 --> 02:54:06,698
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1620
02:54:07,837 --> 02:54:10,074
To lead the people to true freedom

1621
02:54:11,095 --> 02:54:13,861
and to change the face of Arrakis.

1622
02:54:18,931 --> 02:54:20,617
We Fremen have a saying.

1623
02:54:21,642 --> 02:54:24,401
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1624
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:28,800
One cannot go against the word of God.

1
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:17,148
<i>History is written</i>
<i>on the sands of Arrakis.</i>

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,845
<i>Muad'Dib is gone...</i>

3
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,411
<i>but his children remain</i>--

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,855
<i>almost grown...</i>

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:29,918
<i>and about to face the consequences</i>
<i>of their father's legacy...</i>

6
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:35,832
<i>a legacy fiercely guarded</i>
<i>by their aunt, Alia...</i>

7
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:41,636
<i>even as she struggles with the ominous</i>
<i>destiny of her own birthright.</i>

8
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,448
Here I am.
Here I remain.

9
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,111
The Golden Path.

10
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,084
The path I couldn't take.

11
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,557
It's up to you now, my son.

12
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,463
The Golden Path is dangerous, son.

13
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,595
<i>Leto.</i>

14
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,294
I was hoping to see a worm.

15
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,092
You know they never come
close enough to see anymore.

16
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,326
The water has driven them away.

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,096
Everything's changing, Ghani.

18
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,834
Changing too fast.

19
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,606
You've had another vision,
haven't you?

20
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,520
My skin wasn't my own.

21
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,921
I was running across the desert
just so fast...

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,450
just running and running...

23
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,827
to Jacarutu.

24
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,891
I saw him there again,
our father.

25
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,630
- You sure it was him?
- Yes.

26
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,507
And he spoke of the Golden Path.

27
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,439
It frightens me.

28
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,309
I'm afraid of what it could mean
about us.

29
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,010
- We're not like Alia, Ghani.
- Are you sure?

30
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,820
Will you tell our grandmother all this
when we see her?

31
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,796
I don't know.
What do you think?

32
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,426
It might be wise
to understand her a bit better...

33
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,062
before we allow her
to understand us.

34
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,342
They've come for us.

35
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,410
Haven't they, Irulan?

36
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,797
I expect you both to be
courteous and respectful.

37
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,390
None of your sly comments.
She's a Bene Gesserit...

38
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,265
and she'll know if you're
keeping things from her.

39
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,770
Why should we
keep anything from her?

40
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,739
Do we have anything worth keeping?

41
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,299
That's what I mean, Leto.

42
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,073
Stilgar and I are almost
at our limits with your wit.

43
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,408
Worm sign.

44
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,805
I didn't see anything.

45
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,359
Perhaps a slightly higher altitude
would be advisable, Leto.

46
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,666
My father used to love being this close
to the ground when he flew.

47
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,300
And you, of course,
know this intuitively, don't you?

48
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,936
Just like how you knew to fly
without any training.

49
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,879
Don't forget your Bene Gesserit
training, Stepmother.

50
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,711
Fear is the mind killer.

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,150
I'm afraid she's about
to let it pass through her.

52
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,580
It's beautiful.

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,858
Simply beautiful.

54
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,270
Have we gone too far?
Have we forgotten?

55
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,743
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless his coming and his going.

56
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,145
May his passing cleanse the world.
May he keep the world for his people.

57
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,558
- Ba-Li-Kaifa.
- That wasn't funny.

58
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,730
Duncan!

59
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,935
Love!

60
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,137
You've taken
too much spice again.

61
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,373
I've opened a bottomless pit.

62
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,782
A swarm of locusts
is flying up to harass me.

63
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,982
Why can't I see, Duncan? Why?

64
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,921
See what?

65
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,825
The future.
My vision is incomplete.

66
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:54,424
The future. It's there, Duncan,
just out of reach.

67
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,525
Why am I always being pulled back?

68
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,470
Perhaps you should ask yourself
why is it necessary to see it.

69
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,304
- Don't patronize me.
- I don't patronize.

70
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:10,081
I care. That's all.

71
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:17,852
Why is she coming, Duncan?
Why now?

72
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,051
So that's it.

73
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,960
After all these years since she saw
her grandchildren on Caladan.

74
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,590
And in six months,
they will be of age.

75
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,499
Reason for me, Duncan.

76
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,436
Be my mentat for a moment,
not my husband.

77
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,838
No Bene Gesserit acts
without preordained plans...

78
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,609
without well-planned deceit.

79
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,945
And my mother, for all her independence,
is still a Bene Gesserit-Adept.

80
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,407
Clouds.

81
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,406
Moisture in the air.

82
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,647
- It seems almost a sacrilege.
- You sound like a Fremen.

83
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,556
I haven't forgotten the years
I spent among them.

84
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,423
I haven't forgotten
the honesty of their ways.

85
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,225
At times I wish
I'd never learned them.

86
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:39,334
I hate this planet, Gurney.
It took both the men I loved.

87
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:43,535
And it's still a place
of great danger, milady.

88
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,706
Rumors of assassination plots
are too numerous to ignore.

89
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,717
Stilgar has sent word
that even Fremen may be involved.

90
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,185
Desert partisans who blame you...

91
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,348
for Paul's interference
in the ecology of this planet.

92
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,517
I'm so weary of rumors.

93
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,861
They are the lifeblood of this empire,
I'm afraid.

94
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,265
Reason enough this trip
should have been delayed.

95
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,392
This way!

96
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,368
The tigers track the robes flawlessly.

97
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,840
Our friend Palimbasha
has done his job well.

98
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,377
It appears your patience
is about to be rewarded, milady.

99
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,676
Yes. I've waited many years, Tyek...

100
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,843
for just the right moment
to finish the Atreides.

101
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,115
Patience has been my only nourishment.

102
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,316
Our allies on Arrakis
continue to instigate civil unrest.

103
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,193
Alia's hold on power
is beginning to slip.

104
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:50,702
And now we have the means
to deal with Muad'Dib's twins.

105
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,671
- I hope milady is satisfied.
- Oh, I won't be satisfied...

106
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,207
until every bastard Atreides
is crushed...

107
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,268
beneath the jackboots
of the Corrino Sardukar.

108
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:19,425
Like the desperate pacing of giant cats
in the zoos of ancient times.

109
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,466
I wouldn't know.

110
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,061
I'm not the scholar you are,
young prince.

111
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,502
Back and forth.

112
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,470
Back and forth until they made
themselves sick, just like this worm.

113
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,480
Just like my mother...

114
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,143
with her futile schemes
to regain power for the House Corrino.

115
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,411
Your mother is an ambitious woman,
my prince.

116
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,858
Her ambitions tend to be
undisturbed by reality, I'm afraid.

117
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:52,421
You don't share her desire to regain
your grandfather's throne for yourself?

118
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,366
Only a fool covets power without
appreciating its delicate uses...

119
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,369
or fearing its inherent perils.

120
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:04,307
The world of Shaddam the Fourth
remains only in crumbling history books.

121
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,574
We hate the empire that defeated it,
but have no idea what we'd like instead.

122
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,911
The kind of society we once had,
I assume.

123
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,316
My mother may believe that's possible,
Tyek, but I'm not so sure.

124
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,718
I'm just not so sure.

125
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,960
I heard about your little stunt
in the desert.

126
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,691
Well, I prefer to think of it
as expert flying, but carry on.

127
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,392
With your encouragement.

128
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,935
Our father's memories
are very instructive.

129
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,836
Well, I suppose I should be grateful
I don't have to tell your grandmother...

130
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,875
you were lost to a worm
before she was supposed to see you.

131
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,070
That would have been an unpleasant task,
wouldn't it?

132
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,114
It's rumored my mother has resumed
her allegiance to the Bene Gesserit...

133
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,640
and you both know what the Sisterhood
thinks of those of us who are pre-born.

134
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,085
And you want us to pretend
to be something we're not?

135
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,349
I expect you to protect yourselves.

136
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,553
No more talk of your father's memories
or his spirit or his animus.

137
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,324
Surely one can distinguish
between being pre-born--

138
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,058
And being possessed.

139
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,568
For some, that's a distinction without
a difference. For us, that's dangerous.

140
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,570
But what if she's coming as mother...

141
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,766
as grandmother,
and not as Bene Gesserit inquisitor?

142
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,708
You share her memories, Alia. Surely,
her motives can't be that complex.

143
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:17,147
If my mother wasn't that complex,
neither of you would be here.

144
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,083
She would never have
betrayed her training.

145
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,143
She never would have had a son.

146
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,986
I would have been her firstborn,
not your father.

147
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,626
And none of this
would have happened.

148
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,997
I warn you,
enemies often appear as angels.

149
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,466
I hope you two
can tell the difference.

150
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,505
We're going to lose her.

151
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,007
We already have.

152
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,033
You're nervous, aren't you?

153
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,092
Why should I be?

154
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,661
You haven't seen her for many years.

155
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,675
Your grandmother and I
had an unsettled relationship.

156
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,438
But you wanted her affection,
didn't you?

157
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,541
Affection wasn't possible
under the circumstances...

158
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,281
but I am due some respect
after all this time.

159
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,278
Stil, please.

160
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:47,263
When you first came here
many years ago...

161
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:51,393
Muad'Dib told me his father said...

162
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,871
"Beauty has finally arrived...

163
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,602
to hold back the wilderness."

164
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,738
In his honor, may I borrow
your duke's words today.

165
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,141
Good friend.

166
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,455
The imperial regent, my lady.

167
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,217
It's been so long.

168
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,713
Of course, you recognize
your grandchildren...

169
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,909
even after all this time.

170
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,792
I hope we can find time
to shed formality...

171
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,729
and get to know each other again.

172
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,435
The mother of Muad'Dib
has returned to us.

173
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,453
You must offer them
your blessing, Grandmother.

174
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,048
I see the hypocrisy of ritual
still thrives.

175
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,787
Sometimes it is necessary
to accommodate ritual--

176
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,453
In order to survive it.

177
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,455
Mother!

178
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,955
Reverend Mother.

179
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,163
I bring you a warning.

180
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,868
The blessings of Muad'Dib
have been corrupted.

181
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:53,714
The religion of Muad'Dib
is not Muad'Dib.

182
00:20:55,554 --> 00:21:01,459
He renounces it...
as he renounces you.

183
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,154
All of you!

184
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,535
Muad'Dib is dead!

185
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,710
And sand will cover this place.

186
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,046
Sand will cover you.

187
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:44,231
Take them alive! Alive!

188
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,954
Get out!

189
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,190
Jacarutu!

190
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,661
It's impossible to guard against every
madman willing to suicide himself.

191
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,669
We try to limit
Alia's public appearances.

192
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,705
Are we sure she was the target?

193
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,469
In these times, anyone in
the royal family could be vulnerable.

194
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,479
I seem to recall times not long ago
that were not so different.

195
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:33,541
- And we survived them.
- As we will survive them again.

196
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,449
I heard the voices in the crowd
calling out Muad'Dib.

197
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,184
We don't know where he's from
or what his motives are.

198
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,783
They say he calls himself
the Preacher.

199
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,297
The people think he's Paul,
don't they, Stil, this Preacher?

200
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,495
- Some do. Some need to.
- What do you think?

201
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,266
His kind are blown in from the desert
every day. Messianic vagabonds.

202
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,274
And Alia's priests tolerate such heresy?

203
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,106
Her priests would like to flay him alive
for the heresy he spews.

204
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,272
But she won't allow it.
"Oh," she says, "he's harmless."

205
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,647
It's because she thinks
it might be true, isn't it?

206
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:18,087
Well, we hope you'll be comfortable.
Let us know if you need anything.

207
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,830
Paul's gone, my lady.
He walked into the desert.

208
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,396
Blind. Alone.

209
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,204
Shai Hulud came for him.

210
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,211
He is gone.

211
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,077
I want to supervise the interrogation
of those we found on the street.

212
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,987
I'd like Gurney to go with you,
if that's agreeable.

213
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,820
- It would be my honor, Stilgar.
- And my pleasure.

214
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,978
This was their room.

215
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,090
Alia kept it exactly as they did.

216
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,252
We used to play here
when we were little.

217
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,354
It made us feel close to them.

218
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,158
For a moment, you almost imagined
that's who we were.

219
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,636
Didn't you?

220
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:12,507
You almost let yourself believe
that we were... father and mother.

221
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,741
It was not an unpleasant moment.

222
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,720
I've missed so much.

223
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,192
You've never been far from us,
Grandmother.

224
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,789
Your presence is always strong
within us both.

225
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,604
I thought we agreed
to let her rest first.

226
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,205
Seeing my grandchildren
is all the rest I need.

227
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,373
And there will be time enough
for our reunion, Grandmother.

228
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,383
Now is the time
for you and your daughter.

229
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,186
- They're complicated.
- Yes. What did you expect?

230
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,289
They're Paul's children.

231
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,358
He would be proud.

232
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,631
You've done well.

233
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,203
You look...

234
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,246
wonderful.

235
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,475
I try my best.

236
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,813
My people expect it.

237
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:33,356
The greening of the desert is proceeding
faster than I ever imagined.

238
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,986
Paul used to say
the only permanence is change.

239
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:41,021
I wasn't prepared for how much
the desert's retreating.

240
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,262
Only the great mother wilderness
of the south remains untouched.

241
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,429
We still meet with some resistance.

242
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,335
As I've noticed.

243
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,966
Some of the older naibs
have withdrawn from our council...

244
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,442
and taken their tribes
to the far regions.

245
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,706
We're better off without them.

246
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,342
- Some remain to attack you directly.
- We know how to deal with our enemies.

247
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:06,319
It must be so hard, the responsibility.

248
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,093
The loneliness.

249
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,963
- What can you know of loneliness?
- I've had my share.

250
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,197
Is that why you're here then,
'cause you're lonely?

251
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,036
I came to see my grandchildren,
to see you.

252
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,373
Don't try to conceal anything
from me, Mother.

253
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:31,539
I can read truth in the slightest tick
of human behavior.

254
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,074
This was your gift to me, remember?

255
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,590
It's in my blood. In my blood before
I was even born, thanks to you.

256
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,057
Don't interrupt me.

257
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,653
I am the regent of this empire.
I rule in Paul's name for his children.

258
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,927
I am the supreme authority here.
You abandoned me...

259
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,832
to fend for myself after Paul died.

260
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,035
I was only 15, Mother.

261
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:00,567
You had Stilgar. You had Duncan.
You had the Council of Naibs.

262
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,705
No one could challenge you.

263
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,875
You knew how I felt about this place.

264
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,410
And yet here you are,
after all these years, to judge me.

265
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,924
Just like that wicked
Bene Gesserit bitch who taught you.

266
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,984
- We were right to kill her.
- <i>Abomination.</i>

267
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:21,431
Abomination.
That's what she called me.

268
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,539
- Alia, I can't undo the past.
- But I can influence the future.

269
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,373
Paul taught me that well enough.
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

270
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:38,280
You're afraid I have Paul's vision,
his power.

271
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,783
No, my darling.

272
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:52,490
I am afraid that you will get lost
trying to achieve it.

273
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,358
I hate you.

274
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,166
I love you.

275
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,437
I will never forgive you.

276
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,405
Blasphemers!

277
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,052
Idolaters!

278
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,514
You fool yourselves...

279
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,959
with images of things
you cannot possibly understand.

280
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,589
You cripple yourselves
with these toads...

281
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,259
of ritual and ceremony.

282
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,030
They give you only fear.

283
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,537
And in return...

284
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,368
you give them obedience.

285
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,012
But I give you a warning.

286
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,714
Those who accept self-deception...

287
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:28,316
shall perish by that self-deception.

288
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,760
And those who pray for dew
at the desert's edge...

289
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,591
shall bring forth the deluge.

290
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,511
Milady.

291
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,785
Don't torture yourself.
He's mad.

292
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,317
He's a mere thunderclap in the night,
startling for a moment, then gone.

293
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,634
And if I asked you to kill him,
would you?

294
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,694
I wouldn't hesitate.

295
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,769
But I would advise against it.

296
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,434
I'd say it's not time
to move against the Preacher yet.

297
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,572
- <i>Listen to him, darling.</i>
- Let him gain some currency.

298
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,380
- <i>He's so handsome, isn't he?</i>
- Let our enemies rally to his ideas.

299
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,819
The man has flaws.

300
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,449
When the time is right,
they can be used to discredit him.

301
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,583
<i>Just what the doctor ordered.</i>

302
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,721
Better he is disgraced than martyred.

303
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,860
You're always good medicine
for my distress, Javid.

304
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,030
Whatever the cause
of that distress, milady.

305
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,119
Reverend Mother.

306
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:22,296
- They told me I might find you here.
- I was afraid it might be gone.

307
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:27,100
Paul-- Muad'Dib
would never have permitted that.

308
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,139
He said your promise
to the old housekeeper Mapes...

309
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,573
would never be broken.

310
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,040
It seems a little silly now though,
doesn't it?

311
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,745
Considering the changes
that are everywhere.

312
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,655
People don't come to visit like they
used to, but still, it remains a symbol.

313
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:52,788
Symbolism is everywhere these days,
just like these weeds.

314
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,203
I'm truly happy to see you, Irulan.

315
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:04,037
Your devotion to my grandchildren
has been a comfort to me.

316
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,906
They are the source of my happiness.

317
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,277
And your occasional
exasperation, I hear.

318
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,873
They are... strong-willed.

319
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,852
As I would have expected,
considering.

320
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,322
And what else did you expect,
Reverend Mother...

321
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,554
considering?

322
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,461
I am-- was a Bene Gesserit...

323
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,726
trained just as you were.

324
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,362
I know the Sisterhood has never lost
interest in the children's bloodlines.

325
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,566
Although they would never confide
as much to a defector like me.

326
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,309
Isn't it ironic, Irulan?

327
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,211
We're both Bene Gesserits...

328
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,877
who've deserted our sisterhood
for the same reason--

329
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,613
love.

330
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,919
Love of men who are now dead.

331
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:57,324
I did love your son, Jessica.

332
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,592
And I would have made him a good wife.

333
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,601
Instead I have satisfied myself
being a good teacher to his children.

334
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,102
And friend.

335
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,104
Nothing--

336
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:15,043
Nothing will harm them as long as
I can prevent it. Do you understand?

337
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,918
I don't know.

338
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:32,190
Perhaps it would be better
if I never became emperor.

339
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:38,058
I'm being selfish, I know.

340
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,832
But I think it's necessary
for me and Ghanima...

341
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:45,736
to have the freedom
to learn to live with what we are.

342
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,278
And what are you, Leto...

343
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,077
that you need this time
to find out about yourself?

344
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:59,079
Why don't you tell me?
That's why you're here, isn't it?

345
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,717
You remind me of your father.

346
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,320
And my grandfather?

347
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,561
My namesake.
Your beloved duke.

348
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,502
Such an admission would be
complicated, wouldn't it?

349
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:21,341
We may have to enter a realm of
intimacies that would make us both...

350
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,074
uncomfortable.

351
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,780
In a way, I find it reassuring...

352
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,349
that he lives on in you.

353
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,218
How little you understand
how he lives on in me.

354
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,762
Is that what you're struggling with?

355
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,561
Yes.

356
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:53,042
To know the future is to be
trapped by it, Grandmother.

357
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,375
My father knew it,
but he couldn't escape it.

358
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,612
I want more freedom than that.

359
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,885
A universe of surprises.
That is what I pray for.

360
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,951
Is such a universe possible
for someone like you?

361
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,826
Possible? Yes.

362
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,723
But is it desirable?

363
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:23,003
I have a difficult decision to make,
Grandmother.

364
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:28,478
Do I accept the Atreides mystique?

365
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,605
Dress myself in our myths?

366
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,014
Live for my subjects
and die for them...

367
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,578
or do I chose another path?

368
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,921
A Golden Path.

369
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,588
One that may change me,
change human destiny forever?

370
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,995
I don't understand.

371
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:52,024
No, I know you don't because
you do not understand time.

372
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,265
I can help you.

373
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,374
On the contrary, Grandmother.

374
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,379
It is I who will help you.

375
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,099
We must work together.

376
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,642
- We?
- Otherwise we're vulnerable.

377
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,339
- To what?
- Oh, stop being coy.

378
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,815
If you want to know how coy he is,
try playing this game with him.

379
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,025
This is not a game! Powerful forces
are conspiring against us.

380
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,087
Fremen rebels hate the way I'm cha--
we are changing their planet.

381
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,726
The damn Spacing Guild
can't tolerate our monopoly on spice.

382
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,270
They have no choice
but to accept it, Alia.

383
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,435
And now she is here.
I want to know what she wants.

384
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,275
No, Alia. What you want is for us
to engage in the spice trance.

385
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,240
Don't turn your backs
on your heritage.

386
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,378
Your father was
the greatest man in history.

387
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,551
He gave you such wonderful talents
that could be put to such great use.

388
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,789
- Why won't you use them?
- You want us to see things you cannot.

389
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,832
I need you to help me see.

390
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,027
To see the future.

391
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,631
Other lives hover in the enigma
of our consciousness, Alia.

392
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,507
Shared lives.

393
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:48,040
It's the curse of all pre-born.

394
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,246
They are the real danger.

395
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:56,021
Not the rebels, not the Guild,
not our grandmother.

396
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,290
You should understand that
better than most.

397
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,866
One day...

398
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,960
each of you...

399
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,473
will come face to face
with the horror of your own existence.

400
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,443
One day you will cry out for help.

401
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:19,006
One day each of you
will find yourself...

402
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,515
alone.

403
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,055
What if she's right?

404
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,463
Check.

405
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,047
<i>Alia, come back. Alia!</i>

406
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:00,355
<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>Alia, listen to me.</i>

407
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,289
<i>No. Listen to me, Alia!</i>

408
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,109
<i>All of you, out! Do as I say!</i>
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

409
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,115
<i>Get out of here!</i>
<i>Leave her to me!</i>

410
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,453
So, Granddaughter...

411
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,014
you finally meet a spiritual gom jabbar.

412
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,594
<i>We've learned much these past few days.</i>

413
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,928
<i>It was meant to look like rebel Fremen.</i>

414
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,097
Tribes harboring resentment towards
the Atreides and changes to Arrakis.

415
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,265
- But I don't believe it.
- Why?

416
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,874
During interrogation,
the ones we captured...

417
00:41:54,945 --> 00:42:00,747
cried out the name Jacarutu
and then... died.

418
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:05,221
- You tortured them?
- Post-hypnotic suicide compulsion.

419
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,225
The sound of the word alone
simply stopped their hearts.

420
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:13,354
Leto and I heard rumors of
Jacarutu Sietch when we first came here.

421
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,955
We could never find out
whether the place actually existed.

422
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,901
The name Jacarutu
is a synonym for evil, Jessica.

423
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,737
The Edwali tribe came from there.
They were water stealers.

424
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,312
<i>The most heinous criminals</i>
<i>under Fremen law.</i>

425
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,508
<i>The first and greatest sin.</i>

426
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:42,983
But the Fremen tribes banded together
to declare war on the Jacarutu.

427
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:51,667
The Edwali were slaughtered.

428
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,636
Their water spread upon the sands.

429
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,106
Jacarutu Sietch was declared taboo.

430
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,269
No Fremen was allowed to look for it.

431
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,441
But legend persists that
not all the Edwali were wiped out...

432
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:11,079
that some escaped to become known
as the Cast Out.

433
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,352
And you believe that these Cast Out...

434
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,258
might be responsible
for what happened the other day?

435
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:21,355
The possibility
makes my blood run cold.

436
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:27,029
If the Cast Out exist, they would
camouflage themselves as something else.

437
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,835
We would not permit them
to live if we knew.

438
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:35,709
Gurney, contact your old smuggler
allies, the ones in the deep desert.

439
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,613
See what they know about Jacarutu...

440
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,811
and the Cast Out.

441
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:47,186
If such a people still exist,
they could be our greatest threat.

442
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,454
I had full consciousness
long before birth.

443
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,793
Knowledge of all the lives
that came before.

444
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:04,638
The genetic rivers
flowing in my veins.

445
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,871
Reverend Mothers.

446
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,845
The Atreides.

447
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,118
My entire heritage...

448
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:22,716
alive... in me.

449
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,930
Ever present.

450
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,962
I had no defense against
their invasion of my mind.

451
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,601
<i>And so you are stalked by fear.</i>

452
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,612
Fear.

453
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,241
Always fear...

454
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,807
of judgement.

455
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:53,619
The pre-born are possessed.

456
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,989
The abomination.

457
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,257
Bene Gesserit rubbish.

458
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,823
If you succumb to the fear,
it will defeat you.

459
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,962
The trial of abomination
ends in death.

460
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:13,135
But we won't let that happen, will we?

461
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,144
We? You're dead!

462
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,473
I killed you.

463
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,508
Yes, you clever little minx,
you killed me and yet...

464
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:25,111
here I am.

465
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,953
Go away. Just go away!

466
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,493
Oh, but you need help,
Granddaughter.

467
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,497
The others in here,
they want your entire consciousness.

468
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,626
They want to drive you out, but I only
want a tiny little corner for myself...

469
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,636
an occasional moment with your senses.

470
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:45,232
Yeah. An occasional taste.
An occasional touch.

471
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,470
Oh, no one need ever know.

472
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:51,139
No! You murdered my father.

473
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,082
You tried to destroy my family.
You would have killed Paul.

474
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:58,383
Oh, yes, yes. All that, yes.
Of course I would have killed you.

475
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:02,653
I mean, you and your brother stood
in my way, but that's old business.

476
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,993
You won. I am dead.
Thanks to you, my darling...

477
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,024
I have only a fragile existence,
a mere memory self within you.

478
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:16,334
You are alive,
and I am yours to command.

479
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,842
And how little I ask in return.

480
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,780
Mine?

481
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,393
To command?

482
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:41,795
Oh, yes. Yours.
Yours, my precious girl.

483
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,493
Think of what we can
accomplish together.

484
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,833
Your power and my experience.

485
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,999
There will be nothing
standing in our way.

486
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,566
- The voices in my head?
- Will be silenced.

487
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,081
- My enemies?
- Will be destroyed.

488
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,982
No one will stand in the way
of our powers.

489
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:07,820
From this moment on,
the future... is ours.

490
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:38,321
It comes...
just like you summoned it.

491
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,913
No. It summoned me, Stil.

492
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:47,528
And may I ask why
we risked a sand-crossing...

493
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:52,900
- at night without bodyguards?
- Come, come, Stil.

494
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,428
How often do you ride
the sands anymore...

495
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,974
when you want, where you want...

496
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,612
calling a worm instead of riding
with a flock of thopters?

497
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,171
How often--

498
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,311
How often do you arm the thumper
and just go...

499
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,083
like the Fremen you used to be?

500
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,089
Used to be?

501
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,428
Do you know
in many corners of the universe...

502
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:28,835
this delicate thing...

503
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,342
is considered a wondrous beauty?

504
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,707
But here--

505
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,973
here it's a symbol...

506
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,777
a symbol of the corruption
infecting Arrakis...

507
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,650
that wouldn't exist but for the changes
we're enforcing on this place.

508
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,917
Changes inspired by your father.

509
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,518
Now that's the official Stilgar
speaking, the government Stilgar.

510
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,998
The Fremen Stilgar is still repulsed
at this alien life, isn't he?

511
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:03,667
- I have a serious problem, Stil.
- So I've gathered.

512
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:11,181
The problem with me
is the problem with this place.

513
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,945
My father, he--
he left so many things undone.

514
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,648
I don't understand.

515
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:24,383
A good ruler doesn't need to be
a prophet, Stil, not even god-like.

516
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:28,864
A good ruler has to be
sensitive to the ones he rules.

517
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:37,504
The ancient meaning of the Fremen word
"naib" is "servant of the sietch."

518
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:44,711
When the owner dies,
the chrysknife dissolves, yes?

519
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,248
It is our legend.

520
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,081
Muad'Dib has dissolved,
but his chrysknife has not.

521
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:58,623
Stil, a new path must be taken...

522
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:02,893
one that may require me
to demystify my own father.

523
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,264
To destroy his legacy.

524
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:12,432
These are not sentiments
I'd share with your aunt...

525
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,739
or her priests, young lord.

526
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,338
Beware Alia, Stil.

527
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,781
She's no longer your friend.

528
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,886
And, Stil...

529
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,082
you must promise
to protect Ghanima.

530
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,250
If anything should happen to me--
anything--

531
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,761
my sister will be your only hope.

532
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,141
You were in the desert.

533
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,812
Yes. I-- I couldn't sleep.

534
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,323
I could have kept you company.

535
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,828
You were sleeping.
I didn't want to disturb you.

536
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,491
You used to. All the time.

537
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,696
We'd sneak out of the sietch together.
No one ever knew.

538
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,536
Sometimes we wouldn't
be back till dawn.

539
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,973
I had to talk to Stilgar.

540
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,409
Oh. I see.

541
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:29,649
Ghanima, we may have to face
some of what's coming apart.

542
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,211
That doesn't mean
you have to face it alone.

543
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:50,329
The Atreides man
named Gurney Halleck...

544
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,707
is being sent to the desert
to ask questions.

545
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:59,147
Sooner or later, he will encounter
someone who can be bought.

546
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,741
Then we must make sure
he buys the right answers.

547
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,844
What shall I do
with the blind fool, Father?

548
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,822
He can still be useful.

549
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:13,295
Take him into the desert
until we need his sermons again.

550
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,662
Out of chaos comes civil war.

551
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,169
Fremen and Atreides
destroying each other.

552
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:24,333
The water of our enemies
will feed our revenge.

553
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,275
Our suffering will be repaid
a thousandfold.

554
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,917
Jacarutu.

555
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:03,109
I should never have left here.

556
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,047
It was a cowardly thing to do.

557
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,210
You lost so much here.

558
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,153
I know it.
Leto knows it.

559
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,419
Even Alia must know it, in a way.

560
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,063
It helps, doesn't it?

561
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,692
The Litany Against Fear.

562
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,161
You were thinking it, weren't you?

563
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,368
Fear is the mind killer.

564
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,919
Ghani, I've decided
I want you to know my fear.

565
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,454
Fear I've kept hidden too long.

566
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,661
I fear for those who are pre-born.

567
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,830
Just before we came to Arrakis
the first time...

568
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:07,002
I brought a Reverend Mother
to meet your father.

569
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,376
- He was just a boy.
- I remem--

570
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,608
I've been told.

571
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,086
The Reverend Mother brought a nerve
induction box, tested Paul with it.

572
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,421
I was forbidden to interfere.

573
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,553
He might have died.

574
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,734
But he survived.

575
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,035
Of course, you remember this
in a way that I cannot.

576
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,904
Then that's what your fear is.

577
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,643
The memories I've inherited.
The possibility of possession.

578
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,552
The possibility of abomination.

579
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,789
Not you.

580
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,764
I'm sure of that now.

581
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,323
But you're not sure about Leto.

582
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,495
Is he strong enough, Ghani?

583
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,132
Leto? Can he survive
what's coming?

584
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:16,008
- What is it that's coming?
- The Sacr-Nabai.

585
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,510
The Golden Path.

586
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,419
Leto used those words
when he and I were together.

587
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,255
He has visions...

588
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,160
of a pilgrimage
deep into the desert...

589
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,393
a journey to a faraway place...

590
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,402
where he sees our father...

591
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,007
and speaks to him
of how things must change.

592
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,566
Change?

593
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,441
How?

594
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,073
He can't tell me.

595
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,515
I think he's holding things
back from me.

596
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:04,026
But I know this: It's not possession,
and it is not abomination.

597
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,359
And when it is my brother's turn
to be tested...

598
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:12,060
he too will survive...

599
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:15,070
just as our father did.

600
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,038
The man has arrived to take you
deeper into the desert.

601
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,109
He says he will help you find
what you're looking for.

602
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:33,916
So now it has been decided
We'll go into the desert.

603
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:40,592
So you are the Atreides man,
Gurney Halleck.

604
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,996
I don't like it.

605
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,799
Why would the Corrino family
send gifts to Muad'Dib's children?

606
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:52,740
An attempt to curry favor with
the future emperor and his sister.

607
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,142
You don't believe that
any more than I do, Duncan.

608
00:56:56,212 --> 00:57:00,672
Nothing is ever as it seems
with my sister.

609
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,811
Even an innocent gift of clothing
can be dangerous.

610
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,651
But how?

611
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,321
I want these examined thoroughly.

612
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:17,230
Report back to me before they're given
to the children. Is that understood?

613
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,399
I can feel your suspicion, Duncan.

614
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,877
You're wondering if there is
something more complex in my motives.

615
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,780
The history of what brought a Corrino
princess into House Atreides...

616
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,442
is not easily forgotten.

617
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,612
Plans within plans,
is that it, mentat?

618
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,955
Do you doubt my allegiance
to this family?

619
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,827
Allegiances once changed
can change again.

620
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,749
Our sources in the palace assure me...

621
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,520
the robes were delivered.

622
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,289
The catalyst is well-hidden.

623
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,827
Little, precious Irulan
will never find them.

624
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:25,163
Well done.

625
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,170
Alia's paranoia is growing
stronger day by day.

626
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,968
She sees enemies everywhere.

627
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,701
And her only solution--

628
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,504
more and more repression.

629
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,772
Exactly as we want.

630
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,974
The more terror we sow,
the more fear and confusion we harvest.

631
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,040
The more severely Alia responds...

632
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,814
the more Fremen
she drives into the south...

633
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:48,016
the sooner they will openly rebel.

634
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,752
And then with the twins
out of the way...

635
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,351
Alia will be more vulnerable than ever.

636
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:58,824
But we mustn't let Farad'n know
about our plans until they're done.

637
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,894
He doesn't have the stomach for it.

638
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,403
How dare you?

639
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:10,776
These robes are gifts from
Prince Farad'n. A gesture of goodwill.

640
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,645
An opportunity to ease
tension between the houses.

641
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,184
Javid arranged for this himself.

642
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,516
With the regent's approval, of course.

643
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,613
I had to satisfy myself.

644
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,749
Satisfy yourself?

645
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:26,022
That there was
no subterfuge, no danger.

646
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,290
You insinuated yourself
into a diplomatic matter...

647
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,594
that's none of your business.

648
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,101
The safety of the twins
is every bit my business.

649
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,830
You bloodless bitch.

650
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,766
How is it that I'm blessed with such an
extraordinary counselor as you, Irulan?

651
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,445
What devious finger of fate
turned you from a Corrino toad...

652
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,174
into a simpering Atreides
sycophant?

653
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,875
That's enough!

654
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,941
No, it's not nearly enough.

655
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:53,114
From now on, my niece and nephew
are no longer under your care.

656
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,886
- You can't do that.
- I am the regent of the empire.

657
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,791
I'm their guardian.
I rule in their name.

658
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,363
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>And don't let them forget it.</i>

659
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,708
Perhaps you should rest.

660
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,839
How can I rest, Mother, when I'm
surrounded by such incompetent fools?

661
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,409
Do you see what's become
of my world, Mother?

662
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,717
Do you see the chaos I must endure?

663
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,151
Yes, I see it.

664
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,491
I'm afraid I see it all too clearly.

665
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,191
- <i>Get rid of them.</i>
- Get out.

666
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,323
All of you, out.

667
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,097
Come.

668
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:05,023
<i>Still the same arrogant</i>
<i>Bene Gesserit cow.</i>

669
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,944
You must forgive my daughter, Irulan.

670
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:26,311
She let temper get in the way
of judgment this afternoon.

671
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,408
She let her words run away with her.

672
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,055
Do not concern yourself with me.

673
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,556
I know what it's like to be in her place.

674
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:38,822
I know how lonely it can be sometimes.

675
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,929
I understand.

676
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,330
At the same time, you're never alone.

677
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,665
There are always people who need you.

678
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,297
Life in a court can be suffocating.

679
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,238
Easy to lose your perspective.

680
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:56,074
I'm glad we can be honest.

681
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,976
I feel that I can trust you.

682
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:02,040
My only concern is for their safety.

683
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,885
Take care of your own well-being.

684
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,687
Thank you for your concern.

685
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:12,227
You're very important to me.

686
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:17,630
I will let Alia know that I bear no ill
feelings because of her harsh words.

687
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,931
You're very understanding.

688
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,588
There they are. Those two.

689
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,830
Can you see them?

690
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,865
We have a shuttle waiting.

691
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,510
Leto, come.

692
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,051
Hurry.

693
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,921
Anybody who had a hand in helping
the twins get out of the city...

694
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,466
must be arrested and brought to me.

695
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,264
I will make an example
of all who defy me.

696
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,032
Get out!

697
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,747
This is my mother's doing.

698
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,683
I want her dead.

699
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,715
- Now.
- <i>No, my dear. Not just yet.</i>

700
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,750
<i>Patience, my dear.</i>
<i>Patience and calm.</i>

701
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:29,992
That is the palliative
for fury and despair.

702
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,091
Everyone is turning against me.

703
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,932
Oh, don't worry, child.

704
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:40,567
There are many clever ways to rid
oneself of a troublesome witch.

705
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,072
Your efforts to the contrary, I suppose.

706
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,947
Well, unfortunately, my efforts
were, shall we say, interrupted...

707
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:54,422
by a wonderfully devious
and cruel little girl.

708
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,324
You took great pleasure
in the act, as I recall.

709
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,361
I had to admire your ruthlessness.

710
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,328
Had you only been a few years older--

711
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,560
Why am I even listening to you,
you perverted old fool?

712
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:09,571
Because I am here to help you.
Because I'm the only one you can trust.

713
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:14,702
What you must do
is take care of your mother in public.

714
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,979
Why don't you call in that lovely boy?

715
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,843
The priest.

716
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,579
Javid, eh?

717
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,249
Mix business with pleasure perhaps?

718
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:45,696
<i>You were right, Muriz.</i>

719
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,972
Her paranoia deepens
with each passing hour.

720
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,043
- She's ordered immediate retaliation.
- Good.

721
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:57,108
The more the repression,
the greater the rebellion.

722
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,780
The greater the rebellion...

723
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,688
the sooner our enemies
slaughter each other.

724
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,190
Get word to that Corrino witch.

725
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,356
Tell her we continue
to work our mischief.

726
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:39,690
Even though she's not
of council any longer...

727
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,424
I have asked Lady Jessica...

728
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,557
adored mother of Muad'Dib...

729
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:48,569
to join us for the ritual
of supplication.

730
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:56,100
We bring before the holy family
a Kedeshian troubadour...

731
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,702
a miserable wanderer...

732
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,248
who has lost everything
but the clothes on his back...

733
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,944
and now must beg the court for--

734
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,214
Mercy, Holy Mother.

735
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,519
I am Gadian Al-Fali...

736
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,290
naib of Sietch Gara Kulan.

737
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,390
My ladies, do not listen to this man.
His appeal is not approved.

738
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:21,595
I am here concerning
a matter of the desert.

739
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:27,575
A matter of the desert is a concern
of great magnitude, Fedaykin.

740
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,113
But, Reverend Mother--

741
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:46,049
Yes, milady.
I am Fedaykin.

742
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,596
Once offering his life
at the side of Muad'Dib.

743
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,894
This is not the proper forum for--

744
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:54,231
We will hear this matter of the desert.

745
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,769
We have abandoned our friend
the desert, Holy Mother.

746
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,680
Shai Hulud no longer roams the sands.

747
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,117
He cannot be found except in the empty
quarters, far from our people.

748
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,781
The superstitious of the inner desert...

749
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,654
have always feared
the transformation of our land.

750
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,353
A land where nothing grew.

751
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,191
Now there are plants.

752
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,426
They spread like maggots
upon the wound.

753
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,832
There are clouds in the sky...

754
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,563
and rain.

755
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:32,596
Precious mother of Muad'Dib,
rain from the sky of Dune.

756
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,336
It is a death to us all.

757
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:39,006
We only do what Liet
and Muad'Dib intended us to do.

758
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,880
Would you challenge their holy words?

759
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,511
And what of the worms then?

760
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:49,317
There will always be some desert,
some worms.

761
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,528
As go the worms,
so goes the spice.

762
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,861
And if the spice does not flow,
what coin do we have to buy our way?

763
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,331
Silence!

764
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,891
These are matters of state.

765
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,666
And you will not challenge
the wisdom of this government...

766
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,604
to do what it decides is best.

767
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,970
The rabble of the desert must be
made to comply with our judgment.

768
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,172
It is we who rule here...

769
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,909
not the mob of the sands.

770
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:35,402
There are those of you who fear I have
returned to Arrakis as a Bene Gesserit.

771
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,503
That I have abandoned my loyalty to the
Atreides partnership with the desert.

772
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,580
But since the day the Fremen...

773
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,815
gave life to me and to my son...

774
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,484
I have always been Fremen.

775
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,127
And I will always be Fremen.

776
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,963
Be quiet!

777
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,503
We cannot abandon the desert.

778
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,407
My daughter is lying.

779
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:17,241
The worms will not survive
if the desert shrinks.

780
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,372
She knows this.

781
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,712
Spice production will slow...

782
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,685
until it is only a fraction
of what it has been.

783
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,419
And when that happens--

784
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:32,085
We'll have a corner on the scarcest
commodity in the universe.

785
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,152
You will have a corner in hell.

786
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,644
Fedaykin, we who have been scorched
know how to stand back to back.

787
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,805
I have men here, milady.

788
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,328
<i>When religion and politics</i>
<i>ride in the same cart...</i>

789
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,334
<i>the whirlwind follows.</i>

790
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:18,602
The Golden Path.
It's up to you now.

791
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,874
<i>The desert storm</i>
<i>that can't be stopped.</i>

792
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,107
<i>The whirlwind.</i>

793
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:29,514
Leto, don't.

794
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,311
The Golden Path is dangerous.

795
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,283
The path I couldn't take.

796
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,276
You were having
another vision, weren't you?

797
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,978
Events are moving faster
than we anticipated, Ghani.

798
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,784
We have to go now.

799
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,915
To Jacarutu?

800
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,688
The answer is there. I know it.

801
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:18,326
We can't turn back.
We have to finish this.

802
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,062
Muad'Dib, the god,
must be destroyed.

803
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,434
We must find the Golden Path.

804
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,837
It's a dangerous path.

805
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,842
It's the only way out of the trap.

806
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,939
He saw it at the end.

807
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,574
Father's last vision.
He knew it was possible.

808
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:39,310
Don't you see?
That's why he left.

809
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,049
He left it to us.

810
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,421
You're not telling me
everything, are you?

811
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,359
There are things you've seen
that you keep from me.

812
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,089
I can tell.

813
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,028
Only things that
I don't even understand...

814
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,134
yet.

815
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,605
But I have faith, Ghani.

816
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,736
Faith that no matter what happens,
when the time comes...

817
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,837
we will both know what to do.

818
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,344
Are you sure we can make it?

819
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,955
I'm sure that if we don't try,
we'll have failed.

820
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,294
I'm afraid.

821
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,898
Fear is the mind killer.

822
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,671
- I will face my fear.
- I will let it pass through me.

823
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,424
We are ready for tonight.

824
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,031
- Have you seen that one?
- The one who's gone over to our enemies?

825
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,538
Without doubt. Palimbasha.

826
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,240
I saw him in the bazaar
at Arakeen with the tigers.

827
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,372
No doubt he has his part to play.

828
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,006
You ready?

829
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:37,171
I find it ironic that we're using gifts
from our enemies as means of escape.

830
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,175
But you're enjoying
the charade anyway, aren't you?

831
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,903
- You know me too well.
- Yeah, too well.

832
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,537
Which is why you must promise me
we'll only be as reckless as necessary.

833
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,137
Only as necessary.

834
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,627
It won't be long
before the alarm goes out.

835
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:09,068
There. The way to Jacarutu.

836
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,162
They'll never think
we've gone in that direction.

837
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,890
We can rest here until arrangements
are made to get you out of the city.

838
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:51,144
Unless something is done...

839
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,181
civil war is inevitable.

840
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,454
We must get a message to Stilgar.

841
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,954
He must call for a council of naibs.

842
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,158
We must bring a trial
of possession against Alia.

843
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,133
You know what that will mean,
Reverend Mother.

844
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,864
She is your daughter.

845
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,539
I know what it means.

846
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,872
An official warrant
for the arrest of Fedaykin Al-Fali...

847
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,440
and his confederates
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

848
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,647
Post it in every city.
Send word to every sietch.

849
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,851
The conspiracy to murder
the imperial regent...

850
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:40,122
and kidnap the mother of Muad'Dib
must be crushed without mercy.

851
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,976
Are you looking at me
or analyzing me, Duncan?

852
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,020
I'm gathering data.

853
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,749
You must find her, Duncan.

854
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,121
You must find her and return her to me.

855
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,662
Surely your data must
point to the danger I'm in.

856
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,325
We are in.

857
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,936
Perhaps your lover would be
a better comfort to you than I.

858
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,505
I've made so many mistakes,
Duncan. So many mistakes.

859
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,106
Because I've been afraid.

860
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:38,050
I'm ashamed of my weakness.

861
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,021
Please try to forgive me.

862
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,421
I lost my temper in there, Duncan.

863
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,859
I know it was a mistake,
but I can fix it.

864
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,694
It was an accident
of fatigue, nothing else.

865
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,858
I can make everyone understand.

866
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,594
Everyone except her.

867
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,770
You have to deal with her.

868
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,867
She is your mother.

869
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:02,569
She is Bene Gesserit
no matter what she said in there.

870
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,841
And those damnable hags would like
nothing more than to put me to the test.

871
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,882
Please, Duncan.

872
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,610
Please.

873
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,346
You're the only one I can trust.

874
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,584
You're the only one
who loves me enough.

875
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,059
You must eliminate her.

876
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,092
No harm must come
to House Atreides.

877
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,760
No matter what the cost.

878
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,186
You handled that well.

879
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,921
Shut up.

880
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,395
<i>As you wish, milady.</i>

881
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:14,111
We found their clothing
near the bakery, Stilgar.

882
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,309
We're certain they're
no longer in the sietch.

883
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:19,080
They must be wearing those robes
they brought from Arakeen.

884
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:22,590
But our search parties can't find
a single trace of them in the desert.

885
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:26,184
They won't. Not unless
the children want them to.

886
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,943
They do not appreciate
my presence here.

887
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,078
These are puritans,
Reverend Mother.

888
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,851
What they do not like
is what's become of their revolution.

889
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:59,052
Then I must convince them
that neither do I.

890
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:03,962
A messenger has arrived under
immunity of Stilgar. It is urgent.

891
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,701
You have a message
from Sietch Tabr.

892
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,210
Fali, hold!

893
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,611
Your grandchildren are missing.

894
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,017
I'm to bring you to Sietch Tabr
as soon as possible.

895
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,248
You can't go with him, Holy Mother.

896
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,757
He is a ghola.

897
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,624
He was my duke's most trusted warrior.

898
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,894
He died once, saving Muad'Dib's life...

899
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,364
and mine.

900
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,891
But he is Alia's husband.

901
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:45,371
He is still Atreides.

902
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,870
It is my daughter who is not.

903
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,443
We don't have much time.

904
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,006
What about these Fedaykin
who have helped me?

905
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,847
Alia has issued a warrant against them.

906
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,353
- Crimes against the Imperium.
- Of course she has.

907
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,687
Stilgar has offered sanctuary
if they can make it to Tabr.

908
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,419
Then that is what you will do.

909
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,961
When the imperial agents
find this place...

910
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,827
there must be nothing left but
the wind howling through the rocks.

911
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,628
As the Holy Mother commands.

912
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:20,369
May Shai Hulud
clear the path before you.

913
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:33,187
Is it true about
my grandchildren, Duncan?

914
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:36,281
You would not have come
if you didn't believe it, milady.

915
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:46,696
Stilgar suspects they may have
seen this crisis coming.

916
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,736
He fears they've gone
into the desert.

917
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,832
I made many mistakes
with my daughter, Duncan.

918
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:59,870
There have been many mistakes, milady.

919
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,609
And I repeated most of them.

920
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,514
She will not survive
the trial of abomination.

921
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,063
This is not the course
for the Sietch Tabr, is it?

922
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,802
No, milady, it is not.

923
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:34,314
Are you going to tell me
where you're taking me?

924
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:38,512
Somewhere even Alia
won't think to look for us.

925
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,158
I don't think they saw us.

926
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,632
I don't think they were looking for us.

927
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,363
We don't have much time.

928
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,459
We have to make
those rocks before sunset.

929
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,471
Search parties will be certain
to come out this far now.

930
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,144
- That's not a worm.
- But an animal.

931
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:41,239
More than one.

932
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,804
It's closer now.

933
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,844
Much closer.

934
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,502
Move!

935
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:18,110
- There's a cave up there.
- Run.

936
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,220
Get in!

937
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:48,072
<i>The saga of</i> Dune <i>is far from over.</i>

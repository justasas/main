1
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:16,875
Arrakis.

2
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,458
Dune.

3
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:24,292
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,167
It is here and only here where can be found:

5
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,250
The spice.

6
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,042
Greatest treasure in the universe.

7
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,167
And the never-ending cause of conflict,

8
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,292
betrayal,
and murder.

9
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,500
Muad'Dib.

10
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:55,833
No.

11
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,708
Another bad dream, Uncle?

12
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,708
No, it's indigestion, that's all,
miserable food here.

13
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,292
I can't wait to be off this foul planet.

14
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,667
What are you doing here, boy?

15
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,375
They're dead, Uncle.

16
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,083
The Bene Gesserit witch and her son,
both dead.

17
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:43,083
We discovered a Fremen sietch
not far from where our thopter crashed.

18
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,667
They'd been rescued
by that Atreides snake, Duncan Idaho.

19
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,250
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.

20
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,667
The Emperor's man.

21
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,958
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.

22
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,958
The witch and her son were last seen
driving a thopter into a sandstorm.

23
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,167
- You've seen the bodies?
- They're most certainly dead.

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
You've seen the bodies?

25
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,542
Nothing survives
one of those storms, Uncle.

26
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,250
The wind was over 800 kilometers an hour.

27
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,333
Nothing survives.

28
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,208
How long have I been asleep?

29
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,417
Not long.

30
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,500
The storm passed a little while ago.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,083
It was Yueh.

32
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,292
He's the one who betrayed us.

33
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,792
They had his wife.

34
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,458
You should put it on, Paul.

35
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,542
You're the duke now.

36
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,333
We have to get out of here.

37
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,833
I found some supplies
stowed in the compartment by the hatch:

38
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:59,042
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.

39
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,250
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.

40
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,583
Fremen?

41
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,875
We're going to need them...

42
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,667
...to take back Arrakis.

43
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,917
How do we know which way to go?

44
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,000
South.

45
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,917
That's into the deep desert.

46
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,208
There were rumors
of sietch communities there.

47
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,417
That's where we'll find the Fremen...

48
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,292
...or die trying.

49
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,375
I'm all right.

50
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,167
It's just the stress. I'm fine.

51
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,917
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.

52
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:28,042
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

53
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:31,833
Or did you think I would just be
too simple-minded to see the truth?

54
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,917
Leave us alone.

55
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,125
What happened on Arrakis
was beyond my control, Daughter.

56
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,417
An ancient feud between royal houses.

57
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:49,208
Don't patronize me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?

58
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,208
Used you?

59
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,292
Sending me to the duke
as a token of your support...

60
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,208
...making me a courier
of your esteemed respect...

61
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,583
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,208
Or was that your idea, Fenring?

63
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,292
That would be something
your perverse mind would suggest.

64
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,667
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?

65
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:15,667
Send me into the desert to die
like that poor boy and his mother?

66
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,875
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.

67
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,958
Despite the Baron's efforts...

68
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,083
...he assures me he did everything he could
to secure them from harm.

69
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,750
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.

70
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,750
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.

71
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,958
Enough!

72
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,542
There will come a time, Daughter...

73
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,458
...when you will have to shed
this naiveté of yours...

74
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,250
...and learn what it means
to rule an empire.

75
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,542
And when that time comes, Father...

76
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,542
...you may learn to regret it.

77
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,417
It's only another few kilometers, that's all.

78
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,708
Hurry, we don't have much time.

79
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,292
The sun will soon be up full.

80
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,875
We'll have some shade in here.

81
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:12,375
If there are Harkonnen patrols this far out,
they'll have a tough time spotting us.

82
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,333
Such a pity.

83
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,042
A pity that you had to get mixed up
in this business, Doctor.

84
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.

85
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,833
I'm the Emperor's servant,
nothing more and nothing less.

86
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,833
So you did not lead them
to that warren of Fremen scum?

87
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,542
That was Idaho's idea.

88
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,333
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.

89
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,917
We know all about Idaho
and his efforts on the duke's behalf.

90
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,917
A foolish, desperate gambit.

91
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:05,292
And where was that Fremen trash
when he needed them?

92
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:18,208
What will you say when the Emperor
questions you about what happened here?

93
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,208
What's your impression?

94
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:25,792
The desert is
an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.

95
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,000
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...

96
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,583
...and her spawn have found that out,
haven't they?

97
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:47,458
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials
when he's face to face...

98
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,083
...with death's sweet smile.

99
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,958
Muad'Dib.

100
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:03,833
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

101
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:10,167
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.

102
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,833
But here, on Arrakis,
you need desert power.

103
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,042
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters.

104
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,417
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

105
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,917
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.

106
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,417
Did you get any rest?

107
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:55,500
Some.

108
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,292
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

109
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,375
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.

110
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,208
How is my sister?

111
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,083
I'm having dreams again.

112
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,167
Visions.

113
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,375
Even when I'm awake.

114
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,375
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.

115
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,667
Even your father didn't know.

116
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,167
Why not?

117
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,542
There wasn't time.

118
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,167
What have you done to me?

119
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,833
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.

120
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,750
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?

121
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,375
This place is changing me.

122
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
It's the spice.

123
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,958
It's in the air we breathe,
in the food we eat.

124
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,375
I can't escape it.

125
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,333
Drink it all.

126
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:44,042
The best place to conserve water
is in your body.

127
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,042
The stillsuit will do the rest.

128
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:54,125
If we stay on this dune
we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.

129
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,333
Is that a good idea?

130
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
It's the most direct path.

131
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,458
You all right?

132
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,958
Yes.

133
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
Hold on.

134
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,542
That shouldn't have happened.

135
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,417
I was careless about these dunes.

136
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,125
We lost our paracompass.

137
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,500
Can you hear that?

138
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,917
It's a worm!

139
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,708
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!

140
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,292
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!

141
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,958
A thumper?

142
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,958
Someone called it away.

143
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,333
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.

144
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,417
The spice.

145
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,625
Everywhere.

146
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,833
When the worm came.

147
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,583
There had to have been people
for this many plants to survive.

148
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,500
Fremen.

149
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,875
We have to find them.

150
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,208
Most intruders here
regret finding the Fremen.

151
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,708
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.

152
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,083
I know you.

153
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,583
You're Stilgar...

154
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,583
...the Fremen who came to see my father
with Duncan Idaho.

155
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,667
That was a sloppy crossing you made
from the crash.

156
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,958
You called a worm.

157
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,750
You were watching us?

158
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,375
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.

159
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,542
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.

160
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,375
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?

161
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,833
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.

162
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,333
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.

163
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,167
My people are cautious and pragmatic.

164
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,542
Good qualities in the desert.

165
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:04,250
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity
than invite disaster.

166
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,125
Your only value at the moment
is the water in your flesh.

167
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,917
You know the law, Stil.

168
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,542
Yes.

169
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,208
The law.

170
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:29,417
Tell them to stop hunting my son.

171
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,917
Tell them.

172
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,625
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!

173
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,792
Do you hear me?

174
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,292
Is this the way
you welcome friends of Liet?

175
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,500
Is it?

176
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,292
As leader of this tribe...

177
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:00,083
...I'm offering the Weirding woman
and her son sanctuary.

178
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,667
No Fremen will lay a hand on you
while you have my protection.

179
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,167
For how long?

180
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,958
Don't be a fool, woman.

181
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,750
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.

182
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,375
Don't be fugitives from us as well.

183
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,167
Merciful God!

184
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,250
I've heard of the Weirding ways.

185
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,458
Imagine what a man could do with it.

186
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,042
No doubt we have much
to teach each other.

187
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:48,042
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.

188
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,250
He won't move unless I say so.

189
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,917
Discipline. Good.

190
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,833
He's here!

191
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,708
He is unharmed.

192
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,917
We are coming down.

193
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,208
Leave me alone.

194
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,208
Made a lot of noise climbing.

195
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,500
He has much to learn.

196
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,792
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?

197
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,667
He surprised me, that's all.

198
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,667
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.

199
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,375
We have now two with us
who are not trained.

200
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,583
In squad lines with flankers.

201
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,250
We have to make Cave of Ridges
before full sun.

202
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,167
Chani, you will be responsible for him.

203
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,875
My name is Paul.

204
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,458
Only until we give you a new one.

205
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,042
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.

206
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,708
Across there is home...

207
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,792
...Sietch Tabr.

208
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,875
We'll be there tomorrow.

209
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,208
Tomorrow?

210
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,000
That must be hundreds of kilometers
from here.

211
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,875
It will be a hard ride.

212
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,792
Sun will be up soon.

213
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,375
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.

214
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:54,667
When you give us your stillsuits,
we will recover your water for you.

215
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,042
Here is some food.

216
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,625
Spice.

217
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,833
We don't have delicacies from the cities
like you are used to.

218
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,917
It's fine.

219
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,375
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?

220
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,958
I can tell by the way you stare at her.

221
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,042
I don't know what it means.

222
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,958
Be careful, Paul.

223
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,542
We are new to these people
as they are to us.

224
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,750
Everything we say and do must be careful.

225
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,833
Predicting the future,
then plotting to make it so.

226
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,750
These are superstitious people.

227
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:49,417
If we are to survive, it will be best
to accommodate their legends.

228
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,208
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.

229
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,708
A desert creature.

230
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,792
Not finished yet!

231
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,667
Still have work to do!

232
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,083
The pre-spice mass.

233
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,583
I am a desert crea...

234
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,167
Spice blow.

235
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,917
Somewhere to the east.

236
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,917
A large field from the looks of it.

237
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:06,000
We have to send gatherers
before Harkonnen pirates come for it.

238
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,875
You harvest the spice?

239
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,083
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.

240
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,375
It's Liet's wish.

241
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,375
We pay them to keep our skies free
of their satellites...

242
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,792
...so that no one can know
what we are doing here.

243
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,958
You will learn.

244
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,250
Amtal!

245
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,167
I invoke amtal.

246
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,375
Jamis.

247
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,167
What is this?

248
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,833
His way of dealing with what happened
the other night.

249
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,750
That was an accident.

250
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,542
He bested me because there was
witch-force at Tuono basin.

251
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,542
Amtal! It's my right!

252
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,833
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.

253
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,458
You're starting something
you're going to regret.

254
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,208
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.

255
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,542
If you know what's good for you,
you'll find an honorable way...

256
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,250
...to leave this thing alone.

257
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,250
Silence!

258
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,958
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.

259
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,583
If you try that again,
we know it's your witchcraft.

260
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,750
I won't be able to protect you
or the boy anymore.

261
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,875
Come. You can't stop this.

262
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:04,917
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.

263
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,417
Use it well.

264
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,292
May your blade chip and shatter.

265
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,792
I'm going to bathe this knife
with your blood.

266
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,167
First, you'll have to find my blood.

267
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,042
- Do you yield?
- Yield?

268
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,708
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!

269
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,208
- He's never had to kill.
- What?

270
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Then he'd better learn.

271
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,375
Finish. Don't toy with him.

272
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:39,750
He's bested Jamis.

273
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,042
This didn't have to happen.

274
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,750
It is our way.

275
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,708
Your way. Killing each other.

276
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:21,000
No man recognizes leadership
without the challenge of combat.

277
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,500
There is a legend among us...

278
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,083
...that a voice from the out-world
will come.

279
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,083
The Mahdi.

280
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,208
He will hold the key to our future.

281
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,667
It is said that a Bene Gesserit
will be his mother.

282
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,792
A Sayyadina.

283
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,375
Friend of God.

284
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,083
There are rumors about you and your son.

285
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,750
From the city. Liet.

286
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,667
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?

287
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,583
I hope...

288
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,542
...and I fear.

289
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:22,750
If it's true,
your boy will have to call me out one day...

290
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,750
...to challenge me
for the leadership of the tribe.

291
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,250
The huanui is prepared. It's time.

292
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:37,542
It's our way.

293
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,208
From water does all life begin.

294
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,417
The flesh belongs to the person...

295
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:59,125
...but his water belongs to the tribe.

296
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,417
I was a friend of Jamis.

297
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,625
When the hawk plane fell upon us...

298
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,917
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...

299
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:18,000
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.

300
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,083
I was a friend of Jamis.

301
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,083
I was a friend of Jamis.

302
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:03,167
I was a friend of Jamis.

303
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:06,042
He taught me...

304
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,667
...that when you kill...

305
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,042
...you pay for it.

306
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,833
Bila-Kayfa!

307
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,417
He sheds tears.

308
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,208
He gives water to the dead.

309
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,917
Jamis carried 33 liters of the tribe's water.

310
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,125
Counted and measured.

311
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:02,792
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.

312
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,500
Because you fight without stillsuit...

313
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,583
...you may regain the water
you lost fighting.

314
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:22,458
May you guard it for the tribe,
preserve it against loss...

315
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,667
...be generous with it in time of need.

316
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:29,583
May you pass it on in your time
for the good of the tribe.

317
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,875
Needs a naming now, Stil.

318
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,667
It's time.

319
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:47,250
What would you have us call you,
young Atreides?

320
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,125
By what name do you wish Fremen
to know you?

321
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,833
What is the name of that little mouse?

322
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,333
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.

323
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,125
Muad'Dib.

324
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,333
Is that the name you wish?

325
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,708
Yes.

326
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:14,917
Muad'Dib.

327
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,917
Wise in the ways of the desert.

328
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,292
Hiding from the sun. Traveling at night.

329
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:27,917
We call him the "teacher of boys".

330
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,000
Muad'Dib.

331
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,208
A fine choice.

332
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:40,792
So, from now on
you will be addressed as Muad'Dib.

333
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:52,583
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.

334
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,583
Your lives will depend on it.

335
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,458
There.

336
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,042
Get ready.

337
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,208
What is that?

338
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:40,125
The one who will come. Mahdi.

339
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,292
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent
to the spice blow.

340
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,583
Give her some time, Muad'Dib.

341
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,958
Liet is dead.

342
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:30,750
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?

343
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,583
Harkonnen treachery.

344
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,750
She loved her father very much.

345
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,542
It needs a new dew collector.

346
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,125
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

347
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,333
We had rivers of it.

348
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,500
Great flowing veins of water.

349
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,708
From the snows of mountains...

350
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,708
...into lakes so wide
you couldn't see the other side.

351
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,500
Oceans of water.

352
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:37,500
Our home was on the coast.

353
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,875
Great waves would hurl themselves
against the cliffs.

354
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,292
They used to put me to sleep.

355
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,792
My father had a dream, Muad'Dib.

356
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,875
A dream that one day...

357
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,292
...we could change this place...

358
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,458
...make it more like your homeland.

359
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:24,958
Windtrap.

360
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,167
Plenty of moisture this morning.

361
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,125
My father is at peace.

362
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,542
Muad'Dib.

363
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,708
We have thousands of these caches.

364
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Only a few of us know them all.

365
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,917
I know this place.

366
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:15,000
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.

367
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,208
In my dreams.

368
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:24,083
This is the water we will use
to change the face of Arrakis.

369
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,792
As my father taught us...

370
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:33,292
...the voice from the out-world will come.

371
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,667
The Mahdi.

372
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,875
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.

373
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,958
And no man shall ever want
for water again.

374
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:42,667
Muad'Dib.

375
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,125
Come.

376
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,583
You summoned me, Highness?

377
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:57,792
- I have a special errand for you, Farrah.
- I'm here to serve, Milady.

378
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,875
I'm sending you to the Harkonnen planet,
Giedi Prime.

379
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:10,792
I want you to insinuate yourself
among the fat Baron's family.

380
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,083
His nephew, Feyd, the narcissistic type...

381
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,458
...should be especially amenable
to your expert charms.

382
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,875
And how will you want me to use him?

383
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:25,750
I want to know what happened the night
Duke Leto and his family were killed.

384
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,750
I want to know how it was planned...

385
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,667
...who was involved...

386
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,042
...and I want to know
who the Harkonnen allies were.

387
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:36,458
I'll do my best.

388
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,250
I've no doubt of that.

389
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,750
Just as you said, Stil.

390
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:57,833
Harkonnen greed for spice
is the most reliable beacon in the universe.

391
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,250
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.

392
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,333
Anyone else hear that?

393
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:29,000
We didn't even have to damage
the thopter.

394
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,917
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.

395
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,167
That was our last communication.

396
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:19,042
No mayday or wreckage
when we went to investigate.

397
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:20,833
That's the third thopter this month!

398
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,750
The patch turned out to be mock spice.

399
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,833
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!

400
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,833
We caught these last night,
a village near the rimwall...

401
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,750
...known to be desert sympathizers.

402
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,542
Mercy, Governor.

403
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,125
We are refugees.

404
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,833
- We need food.
- Liar!

405
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,333
Spies! That's what you are!

406
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,625
Spies for the Fremen scum!

407
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:51,542
Fremen scum
who raid my spice warehouses!

408
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:57,125
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.

409
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,625
He was trying to dispose of this
when we caught him.

410
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,083
Send words to the filth of the desert!

411
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,208
Tell them what you witness here!

412
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,500
Tell them this is what awaits them!

413
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:32,292
Mahdi!

414
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,458
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.

415
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,250
The latest love letter from your brother.

416
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,250
Mahdi!

417
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,042
Appears to be enjoying himself.

418
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:14,542
The moron's appetite for killing
never ceases to amaze me.

419
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:19,917
By the time he's finished,
there won't be a population left to rule.

420
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:23,125
Cheer up, lovely boy.

421
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:28,333
I merely allow him to brutalize them,
to savage them, until you arrive...

422
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:33,708
...the handsome Feyd,
to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.

423
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,917
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.

424
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,208
Feyd, the saviour.

425
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:42,708
There will be cheering in the streets.

426
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:46,708
You can even give them
your brother's head as a gift, if you like.

427
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:52,000
And then you will squeeze,
like the grips of a vice...

428
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:57,417
...so our treasuries become fat
with the profit of spice.

429
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,958
No man recognizes leadership...

430
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,958
...without the challenge of combat.

431
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,875
It is the way.

432
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,083
Call him out!

433
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,042
What do you see...

434
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,250
...Muad'Dib...

435
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,458
...when you go away like that?

436
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,542
Where is it you go?

437
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,542
Many places, Stil.

438
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,917
Many roads.

439
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,042
Many choices.

440
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,542
These choices...

441
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,917
...are good or bad?

442
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,500
It's hard to know sometimes.

443
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,417
Either they are good choices
or bad choices.

444
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,417
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?

445
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,125
Of storms?

446
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:28,417
Of the future.

447
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,583
The future, Muad'Dib, just is.

448
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:46,000
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!

449
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:09,458
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!

450
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:14,042
Need immediate evacuation!

451
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,542
We are ready, Muad'Dib.

452
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,542
Muad'Dib, it's time. We must hurry.

453
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:50,125
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.

454
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,125
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.

455
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:56,125
He made it clear on his arrival
that we should summon you and no other.

456
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,708
The other witches must leave.

457
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,208
As you wish.

458
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:31,500
This visit is as indiscreet
as it is unexpected.

459
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:35,875
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity
isn't aroused.

460
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,583
The Emperor's suspicions
are easily moderated...

461
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,667
...by his dependence on our services.

462
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,667
As you are so fond of reminding us.

463
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:57,667
The navigators are concerned.

464
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:02,958
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.

465
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,458
There is a problem on the horizon.

466
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,042
What kind of problem?

467
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:17,250
They are troubled by a nexus
they can't fully explore...

468
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,042
...an intersection of events...

469
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:26,333
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions
beyond which lies a path...

470
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,333
...they cannot see.

471
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,042
And where is this nexus?

472
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:37,208
Planet Arrakis.

473
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,917
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.

474
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,792
The Atreides are dead.

475
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:49,292
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.

476
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,583
We sense a higher order interfering.

477
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,583
A misstep could be catastrophic.

478
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,500
Then we understand one another.

479
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,583
Completely.

480
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,583
We'll do what we can.

481
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,875
I thought...

482
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,375
...I felt something.

483
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,875
The spice must flow.

484
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:29,750
The balance of power must be maintained.

485
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,042
Sayyadina?

486
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,500
I'm awake, Chani.

487
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:26,500
Has there been any word,
a courier perhaps?

488
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,500
No. The raids are in the Haga basin.

489
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:33,792
They won't risk communication
until they are deep across the bled.

490
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,792
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?

491
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:55,958
No.

492
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,083
It's just your skin.

493
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,167
My skin?

494
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:04,167
We've heard the stories
about off-worlders...

495
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,458
...the ones who come from water planets.

496
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:11,083
Skin so moist it's like cream.

497
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,667
- Muad'Dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?

498
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,167
Muad'Dib is still a boy.

499
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,833
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.

500
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:24,167
Yes.

501
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,250
I say my prayers for his safe return.

502
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,625
We both do, Chani.

503
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:04,917
The smugglers transport our spice tribute
to the cursed Spacing Guild.

504
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,125
The Emperor never knows.

505
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:14,083
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.

506
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:19,500
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'Dib.

507
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:24,792
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.

508
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,667
Something wrong, Muad'Dib?

509
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,250
I thought I saw someone I knew.

510
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,167
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.

511
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,667
No, Stil.

512
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,458
Let them go.

513
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,667
I must have been mistaken.

514
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,542
Gurney.

515
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,458
My father's patience is wearing thin.

516
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:20,333
These troubles on Arrakis
are proving difficult to manage...

517
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,125
...and our time is running short.

518
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,125
I want you to make arrangements
for a trip to Giedi Prime.

519
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,333
Milady?

520
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:32,125
The Baron's nephew
is having a birthday celebration.

521
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:36,208
The Emperor ought to be represented,
don't you think?

522
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:39,333
I'm in the mood for a party.

523
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,208
Besides, it's time to shed
some of this naiveté.

524
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,583
She is not going!

525
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:58,875
I'm not going to allow that headstrong,
meddlesome child loose in Babylon.

526
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:03,292
My God, what a catastrophe that would be.

527
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:09,375
The eldest daughter of the Imperial House
ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen...

528
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:12,375
...and his dreadful progeny.

529
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:15,292
Yes, catastrophe indeed.

530
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,292
But perhaps the seducer could be seduced.

531
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:25,750
The more we know of the Baron's schemes,
the more we are prepared for the endgame.

532
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,083
Our operatives on Giedi Prime
have limited access.

533
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,875
Your daughter, on the other hand...

534
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:38,250
...has proved quite adept
at intelligence gathering.

535
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:43,042
Gently chaperoned,
I should think she'd prove quite useful...

536
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,833
...once again.

537
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,458
You've heard the voices
from your sietches.

538
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,625
They say the Mahdi has come.

539
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,333
But you...

540
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:05,625
...the naibs of your tribes are still cautious.
You resist.

541
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,625
But I am offering you the future.

542
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:14,500
The future as Liet saw it.

543
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,208
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.

544
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:21,625
Here.

545
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,125
And here.

546
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:28,500
And once we rid Arrakis
of the vile Harkonnen...

547
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,208
...we can complete his dream.

548
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,583
I promise this.

549
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,917
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.

550
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:41,208
You'll never rid Arrakis
with guerrilla raids, boy.

551
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,292
It will take all-out war.

552
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:46,792
That's why I'm asking you
for hundreds of your best young men.

553
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,083
I want to give them the Weirding way...

554
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:54,083
...so they can come back to you
and train hundreds more.

555
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,292
So those hundreds
can train hundreds more.

556
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,667
And then hundreds will become thousands!

557
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,667
The Fedaykin.

558
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,958
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.

559
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:08,250
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!

560
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,875
My father once told me...

561
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,750
...that here on Arrakis...

562
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,958
...one needed desert power to rule.

563
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,625
You are desert power...

564
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,333
...and nothing can stop you...

565
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,750
...if you believe.

566
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,792
So you are the one.

567
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,500
Jessica of the Weirding,
our Reverend Mother Ramallo.

568
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,000
Mapes said you were beautiful.

569
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:33,292
She also said she pitied you.

570
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,458
I need no one's pity.

571
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,458
That remains to be seen.

572
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,458
There is much talk of you in the sietches.

573
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,750
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.

574
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:02,250
I hear them shout the name Muad'Dib.

575
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,833
He is a natural leader like his father.

576
01:07:08,542 --> 01:07:10,750
The men admire his courage.

577
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,333
It will take more than courage
to survive what's coming.

578
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,125
The boy...

579
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:22,917
...he knows what it is
that's happening here?

580
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:26,333
He is aware.

581
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:30,042
You've exploited our legends well.

582
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,625
We had to survive.

583
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:38,708
And you may...

584
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,292
...for a while.

585
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:46,708
But remember this:
the very legend which protects you...

586
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,917
...can also destroy you.

587
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,250
- How are you feeling?
- Well.

588
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,167
Tired sometimes.

589
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,125
Healthy.

590
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,833
And growing fast.

591
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,917
I saw the one
they call the Reverend Mother.

592
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:12,333
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.

593
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,625
- Why?
- To see me.

594
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:17,208
To see you.

595
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,708
She's Bene Gesserit.

596
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,125
One of our missionaries.

597
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,000
Convenient.

598
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,792
Stilgar says you've learned much.

599
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,208
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.

600
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:42,792
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.

601
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:51,292
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?

602
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:56,083
Because I loved him.

603
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,375
As long as your father
remained unmarried...

604
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:03,250
...some of the great houses could still hope
for an alliance through marriage.

605
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,875
We both knew what that meant.

606
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:09,167
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?

607
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,083
I would have encouraged it.

608
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:12,458
Politics.

609
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,667
Yes.

610
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,458
Politics.

611
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,708
While I was on the hajra...

612
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,917
...I had dreams about this garden.

613
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:09,500
Except it wasn't here,
it was somewhere else.

614
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,083
Was I there?

615
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Yes.

616
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,292
And there were children...

617
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,000
...playing, very happy.

618
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,875
A wonderful dream.

619
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,875
Do you think it's possible
to love someone enough...

620
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,375
...you'd be willing to give that person up?

621
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,875
I think...

622
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:52,667
...there are times when it's necessary
to share the one you love...

623
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,875
...with things greater than both of you.

624
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,833
Everything is connected,
one thing to another.

625
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:20,042
The living and the dead,
the animate and the inanimate.

626
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,333
A system.

627
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:25,917
All parts functioning to serve the whole.

628
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,208
Smell the air, Muad'Dib.

629
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:32,833
Cinnamon.

630
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,917
The pre-spice mass is below us.

631
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:39,625
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.

632
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,708
The Maker has left her nest long ago.

633
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,792
Her children have joined together
for survival.

634
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:52,708
They have grown.
They are losing water now.

635
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:55,917
It will mix with their waste.

636
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,083
If enough has accumulated...

637
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:03,083
...a giant bubble of foam
will heave up with tremendous force.

638
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,083
A spice blow.

639
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:08,000
Trading places with the sands above.

640
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:11,167
The sun and heat will dry it out and...

641
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:13,375
...soon...

642
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:17,583
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.

643
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:21,083
The worm...

644
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,583
...is the spice.

645
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,750
So now you know.

646
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:32,042
Many of the little makers
will die in the blow.

647
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:39,250
The rest will swim off
to become Shai-hulud, the Great Worm.

648
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,458
We may capture a few.

649
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,750
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.

650
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:51,542
That's enough for now.

651
01:14:56,292 --> 01:15:00,292
When religion and politics
ride in the same cart...

652
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,167
...the whirlwind follows.

653
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,583
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.

654
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:10,667
The one who can be many places at once.

655
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:14,042
You are the whirlwind.

656
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,458
It's almost night, Muad'Dib.

657
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,250
Time to return to the sietch.

658
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:26,458
You've been dreaming.

659
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,833
Too impatient, Farok.

660
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:55,000
You moved too soon.

661
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,000
Try again.

662
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,125
Watch his posture.

663
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:07,208
Even the slightest change in his breathing
gives you advantage.

664
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,583
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.

665
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:47,750
I am Otheym.

666
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:51,667
These are my brothers
from Sietch Gara Kulan.

667
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,958
We've come to find the one
who calls himself Muad'Dib.

668
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:05,542
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.

669
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:09,042
We've come to join your crusade.

670
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,125
We want to learn the Weirding way.

671
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,833
We want to become Fedaykin.

672
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:18,417
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.

673
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,417
- We could fight as Muad'Dib.
- I believe you.

674
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,792
Let their waters join with ours.

675
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:18,167
I must congratulate you
on the perfection of your heir, Baron.

676
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:23,083
He faces his 100th slave gladiator
in the arena this afternoon.

677
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,083
He appears ready.

678
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:28,167
Well then,
perhaps we might take this opportunity...

679
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,083
...to conduct our conversations.

680
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,042
There is much to discuss.

681
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,250
Indeed.

682
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:37,875
If that meets with your approval, Milady.

683
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:40,542
I am quite entertained here.

684
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:42,750
Fine.

685
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,708
By your leave, then.

686
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:10,542
What other house would have been willing
to humiliate itself...

687
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,958
...so the Emperor could rid himself
of a troublesome duke?

688
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,458
He's been asking himself
that very question.

689
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:23,958
Are you suggesting that the Emperor
contemplates a move against me?

690
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:27,458
Speculation is not a worthy science, Baron.

691
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,667
Better we spend our energy
on what's most important.

692
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,458
The spice must flow.

693
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:41,667
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...

694
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,542
...curious.

695
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:48,167
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...

696
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:52,542
...coming deeper into the southern regions
than ever before.

697
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:58,042
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild
won't be enough to protect us.

698
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,417
Then it's agreed.

699
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:19,417
We move with the next moons.

700
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,333
When the Harkonnen find this place...

701
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:28,500
...there must be nothing left
but the wind howling through the rocks.

702
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,292
There is no turning back now.

703
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,875
Subdue the Maker.

704
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,583
The Maker is dead.

705
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,292
The Water of Life.

706
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:39,292
May Shai-hulud have mercy on both of us.

707
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:20,125
When night falls again,
we have to leave this sietch...

708
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,417
...that has sheltered us for so long.

709
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:30,917
We must go south into the deep desert...

710
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:36,625
...where the demon Harkonnen
will not pursue us.

711
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:42,333
But our Reverend Mother
will not survive another hajra.

712
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:49,417
So that we don't have to make the journey
without her strength and guidance...

713
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:57,625
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented
to undergo the rites at this time.

714
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:01,792
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.

715
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:06,708
So that we don't lose all, Chani...

716
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,875
...daughter of Liet,
will be consecrated as Sayyadina...

717
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:15,167
...Friend of God.

718
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,667
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...

719
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:24,583
...in the Sayyadina.

720
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:51,875
Here is the Water of Life,
the water that will free your soul.

721
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:56,875
If you are our Reverend Mother,
the universe will open to you.

722
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,167
Let Shai-hulud judge now.

723
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,667
You must drink it now.

724
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,958
What's happening to her?

725
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:41,958
The water is poisoned until she changes it.

726
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:47,542
This must take its course.

727
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,917
Mother? Mother?

728
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:56,667
You cannot go there.

729
01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:01,667
That is the place we cannot look.

730
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:05,375
The place only
the Kwisatz Haderach may go.

731
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:12,250
You must turn away, Jessica,
or it will drive you mad.

732
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:23,542
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.

733
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:28,333
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding.

734
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:33,458
And the lives that have come before,
they are yours now.

735
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:56,417
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.

736
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:01,333
Holy Mothers, what have we done?

737
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:05,000
This changes you both.

738
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:24,792
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.

739
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:28,000
She must see all that we see.

740
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:32,583
That is the only way you can save her.

741
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:42,167
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.

742
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:15,625
The plan was perfect in its simplicity
and viciousness.

743
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:17,750
Of course it was.

744
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:21,125
You helped your uncle design it,
didn't you?

745
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:25,417
Duke Leto thought
he was gaining control of Arrakis...

746
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:28,917
...but he was only being fattened up
for sacrifice.

747
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:32,625
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.

748
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:35,625
Swift and merciless.

749
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:38,708
The Atreides never had a chance.

750
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:41,708
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed
within hours.

751
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,333
The Sardaukar.

752
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:48,000
I sent the final communique
to your father myself.

753
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,083
Mother?

754
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,083
Yes?

755
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:34,083
Mother Ramallo is gone.

756
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:43,042
But she remains.

757
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:49,750
You have changed the waters.

758
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:54,333
Now we know you cannot be false.

759
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:58,333
Paul?

760
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:11,833
The Reverend Mother
has changed the Water of Life.

761
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,042
It's now safe for us to drink!

762
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:30,875
The son and his mother,
the duke's concubine and her son...

763
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,792
...what did you do with them?

764
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:37,667
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.

765
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:40,875
You found their bodies
and disposed of them?

766
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,583
Never found them.

767
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,083
You never found the bodies?

768
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,917
You're trembling.

769
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:50,917
I'm afraid.

770
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:53,625
Of what?

771
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:57,417
Of you.

772
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,708
You make me see things.

773
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,333
What do you see?

774
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:10,292
I see us together.

775
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:14,792
There is a great storm.

776
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,083
I have a child in my arms.

777
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,792
Our child, Muad'Dib.

778
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:26,875
It's not a dream.

779
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:30,208
I know you, Chani.

780
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,000
I've always known you.

781
01:34:37,667 --> 01:34:42,667
We've sat upon a rock above the sands
and I've eased your fears.

782
01:34:45,167 --> 01:34:47,875
We've caressed
in the darkness of the sietch.

783
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:53,750
We've grown old together.

784
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:02,583
History will say that the Fremen
were about to find their messiah.

785
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:07,875
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...

786
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:12,292
...and the world, as we knew it,
would change forever.

787
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
The saga of Dune is far
from over.

1
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
Arrakis.

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,320
Dune.

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,120
A land so starved for water
a single tear is cherished.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Wilderness home to the mysterious
desert tribes called Fremen

5
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,880
who long for a messiah to free them
from Harkonnen bondage.

6
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,080
A messiah,
a boy once known as Paul,

7
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,120
now known as...
Muad'Dib.

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,480
Pick up the pace, you lazy desert rats,
we have a quota to meet.

9
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
Sound the alarm!

10
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,480
Disperse the men to the safe houses.

11
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Get word to Stilgar.

12
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
We'll evacuate the city tomorrow.

13
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
Halt!

14
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
Turn around.

15
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,760
Papers!

16
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,320
I said your papers, you scum...

17
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,280
There's a tunnel out of the city,
at the foot of the steps.

18
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,480
The blessings of Muad'Dib
be with you and your family.

19
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Your plan worked, Muad'Dib.

20
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,120
Now they know we can strike them at will.

21
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
We could take the city in an hour.

22
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
It's not time.

23
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,160
But they are vulnerable, Muad'Dib.

24
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
Not yet.

25
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
The advance unit found something
in the chaos, Muad'Dib.

26
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
Something you should see.

27
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
There was a secret crematorium
in one of the Harkonnen barracks.

28
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,400
And this was all...

29
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
...of your father that was left.

30
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,080
The men think it's an omen,
a sign that our final battle...

31
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,280
...with the Harkonnen is at hand.

32
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,280
Your visions frighten me, Muad'Dib.

33
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,040
There are things still hidden from me.

34
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,360
Places I can't go, things I can't see.

35
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Do you ever worry that just trying to see
the future changes it?

36
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
We're speeding toward the abyss, Chani.

37
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,040
I have to see a way around it.

38
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Perhaps it's time for me to leave.

39
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,400
I've been away from our son too long.

40
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,080
We'll make arrangements
once we reach Cave of Ridges.

41
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,440
We will be there after the next raids.

42
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,720
Will we ever have peace, Muad'Dib?

43
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
We'll have victory.

44
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm sorry, Milord.
He said you must come at once.

45
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Do you really take me
for that much of a fool, boy?

46
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,040
I don't understand, Uncle.

47
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
What kind of poison did you choose, boy?
Something slow and painful, I assume...

48
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
...so you could watch?

49
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,400
Tell me, Feyd, why didn't you simply
assassinate me yourself?

50
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,560
You had plenty of opportunity to.

51
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,480
You taught me that my own hands
must always remain clean.

52
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,400
Quick boy, very quick.

53
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,280
You're good material, Feyd,
and I hate to waste good material.

54
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right here.

55
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,400
My brother.

56
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes.

57
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
That's right.

58
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
Your dim brother.

59
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,080
If I kill you, then he would be my only heir.

60
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,280
He can't even put down
a dirty mob of religious lunatics.

61
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Yes, you're clever, Feyd.

62
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
But not that clever.

63
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
And don't get any ideas, Feyd.

64
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,640
My men have you in their sights
even as we speak.

65
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,920
Don't worry.

66
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,280
If I'd wanted you dead
you'd never have made it down the hall.

67
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
You're going to let me live?

68
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,440
I can't very well leave the wealth of Arrakis
to someone who's dead.

69
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,880
What wealth?

70
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,320
Every communiqué brings news
of another Fremen raid.

71
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,520
By the time my idiot of a brother
is through...

72
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,920
...the Emperor himself
will have to intervene.

73
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,120
You're not as dim as I thought.

74
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,680
You intend to draw the Emperor himself
into this?

75
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,520
You see, this is why you need me, Feyd...

76
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,880
...to help you think, to help you plot.

77
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,040
Why do you think I tolerate
the incompetence of your brother?

78
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Because it amuses me?

79
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
Think, Feyd. Think.

80
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,280
There is method to this madness, even
though you've been too dull to divine it.

81
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,040
The spice.

82
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
Of course the spice.

83
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,560
The one thing that could possibly draw
the Emperor away...

84
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,720
...from his imperial pleasures,
out into the wastelands of the Empire...

85
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,600
...where he is vulnerable,
where he can be destroyed.

86
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,160
And Duke Leto was just the beginning,
the prelude to a move...

87
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
...on the imperial throne itself.

88
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,960
But timing is everything, beautiful boy.
Patience is our ally.

89
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,800
We must not make the Emperor suspicious
with foolishness like this.

90
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
So, what will it be?

91
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
I give you my pledge.

92
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Good.

93
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,080
Now let the Emperor mock
House Harkonnen, call us swine...

94
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,400
...because in the end,
his throne will be mine.

95
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,320
That's it Hannah.

96
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,120
Good.

97
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
Good, Hannah.

98
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
Another healthy fighter for the cause.

99
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,400
Alia, you were told to wait.

100
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
He looks like Mitha's son.

101
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,480
How can you know that, child?

102
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
The slaughter on Bela Tegeuse is history.

103
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
You weren't even born.

104
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,960
But, Mother, I saw it, and it's true.

105
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,520
Yes, it's true.

106
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,120
I hate them.

107
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,200
Alia.

108
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,360
They stare at me.
They whisper when I pass.

109
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
It hurts my feelings.

110
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
They're confused, Alia.

111
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
You frighten them.

112
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,920
Because I'm a freak.

113
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,360
You're not a freak. Who has said that?

114
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,480
No one.

115
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,240
Then don't you ever say it again.

116
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
My children are not freaks.

117
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
But I can't help it.

118
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,320
I just know things,
things I shouldn't know, but I just do.

119
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,280
It was a cruel thing I did to you, Alia.

120
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,520
I took the Water of Life
when you were still in my womb.

121
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,720
No one should ever be wakened
to consciousness as you were.

122
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
But we'll make them understand, Alia.

123
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,560
We'll make them see
that you're not just a little girl...

124
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,480
...that you've never really been one.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,720
I want my brother.

126
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,520
What is it?

127
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,640
He came to challenge you in open combat.

128
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,640
You killed him?

129
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,960
I took care of it.

130
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,320
But he came to challenge me.

131
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,440
He wasn't worthy, Muad'Dib.

132
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Otheym, get Stilgar.

133
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Tell him to summon the Maker.

134
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,120
There is only one way
to stop these challenges.

135
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,040
You know what this will mean,
between you and Stil.

136
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,720
The men will want you to call him out.

137
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,840
Only if I survive the Maker.

138
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,640
Just remember what I've taught you.
Do it simply and directly.

139
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,280
- Nothing fancy.
- I'll remember.

140
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,080
Stand close enough that you can mount
when he passes.

141
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,560
- Not so close that he'll crush you.
- I'll remember.

142
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
You will hear him before you see him.

143
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
When you take your stand,
you must become completely still.

144
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,440
You must become a dune
in your very essence.

145
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
Stil.

146
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,280
I'll remember.

147
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
See that you do.

148
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,600
Fremen ride the worm
by the time they are 12.

149
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,640
I don't want an old man like you
shaming my teaching.

150
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,200
He won't fail.

151
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
I must not fear.

152
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,080
Fear is the mind killer.

153
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,920
I will face my fear.

154
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,320
I will let it pass through me.
Only I will remain.

155
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
He is too close.

156
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,040
He's not leaving enough room.

157
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,920
I can second him.
It's allowed, even in the test.

158
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,080
No.

159
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,520
He must do this alone.

160
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,160
He is turning it.

161
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,080
He is turning it!

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Take positions!

163
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,880
It is our turn now, Muad'Dib.

164
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
You and me.

165
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,560
I don't think I've ever seen one that big.

166
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,960
Look, there.

167
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
Spice.

168
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
We've never come so far south.
The Fremen would never allow this.

169
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,920
No choice.

170
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,320
The Spacing Guild's buying up
all the spice there is.

171
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,560
Nothing left for us.

172
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,880
This is a rich patch. I'll call the harvester.

173
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Get some men up on those rocks first.

174
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,800
The Harkonnen patrols
won't be this far out.

175
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,560
It's not the Harkonnen I'm worried about.

176
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll be damned. A false patch.

177
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Get the men back on board!

178
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,320
Put the knife away, Gurney Halleck.

179
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
Who is it that knows the name
of Gurney Halleck?

180
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
Paul, is it truly Paul?

181
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
You young pup! Young pup!

182
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,280
Gurney-man.

183
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,400
So you're the reason
the Fremen have gotten so clever.

184
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,240
I'd never have expected you
to fall for such a simple trick, Gurney.

185
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,680
Desperate times, Milord.

186
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,120
Harkonnen patrols have forced us south,
deeper and deeper.

187
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Where you might've seen things
you shouldn't.

188
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,120
This is Gurney Halleck, Stil.

189
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,040
My father's weapons master.

190
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,760
One of my teachers.

191
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,560
There aren't many of us who haven't heard
the name Gurney Halleck.

192
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,680
This is Stilgar, Gurney,
the naib of our sietch.

193
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,120
Muad'Dib...

194
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
...feel the wind.

195
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
"Muad'Dib"?

196
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,160
- You're the one they call Muad'Dib?
- It's my Fremen name.

197
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,840
Come, we'll talk of all these things
while we wait out the storm.

198
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,120
Storm? We didn't see any signs.

199
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
It comes soon. Trust me.

200
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,240
What happens to my men?

201
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,760
We'll decide what to do with them
after the storm.

202
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,800
We'll have to hurry
if we're going to save the thopter.

203
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,440
This is one of the things
you should not have seen.

204
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
You have many such hiding places?

205
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,960
Many times many.

206
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,280
We call this one Cave of Ridges.

207
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Would you like me to bring coffee?

208
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
Yes.

209
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
And more food.

210
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
Your woman?

211
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,720
The mother of my first-born.

212
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,560
So much has happened.

213
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,040
The boy I knew has now become a man.

214
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,920
Thanks to our enemies.

215
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,360
Cowards.

216
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,200
They hide in their cities in garrisons,
hoping you will wear yourself out...

217
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
...with useless raids.

218
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,240
In other words, they're immobilised.

219
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,920
While you know where,
and when you choose.

220
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,600
A tactic I learned from you, Gurney-man.

221
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,920
What about your men?

222
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,080
Smugglers, all. Good men.

223
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,720
Some newcomers.

224
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Off-worlders.

225
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,560
It's hard to find recruits these days.

226
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,200
Any of my father's men?

227
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
Those that weren't butchered
by the Harkonnen...

228
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,040
...bribed whoever they could
to leave Arrakis.

229
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,400
Everyone thought...

230
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,320
We all believed you were dead, Milord.

231
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,880
But you stayed.

232
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,040
Awaiting an opportunity for vengeance.

233
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,200
I knew we'd be reunited, Gurney.

234
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,200
I saw it.

235
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
You're the only one left to me, Milord.

236
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Hawat, Idaho, your father:

237
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,640
All dead, all betrayed.

238
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,200
I would've gladly have sacrificed myself
if I could've taken the traitor with me.

239
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,200
My father once spoke
about desert power, Gurney.

240
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
I remember well.

241
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,560
Well, you've just met it.

242
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,000
The surface of this planet is ours.

243
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,760
No storm, no worm,
not even the Emperor's Sardaukar...

244
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
...could stop us now.

245
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
Enlist with me, Gurney.

246
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,480
Feed on revenge with us.

247
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
Enlist?

248
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,520
I never left your service.

249
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,360
That stupid swine
seems almost begging for me to intervene.

250
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,120
The Baron is a pig, Father,
but he is not stupid.

251
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,680
Rabban has lost almost 50,000 troops
in the past two years.

252
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,200
- Arrakis is a fierce planet.
- Attrition cannot explain such losses.

253
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
He's losing five-to-one.

254
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,920
Read between the lines.

255
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,640
You are saying the Baron is allowing
this rebellion to continue?

256
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,040
I'm saying the Baron can count
as well as we.

257
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,160
For the sake of argument,
what if there were only 20,000 people...

258
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000
...in a Fremen sietch?

259
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,400
And what if there were only 250
such communities on the whole of Arrakis?

260
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,680
Our spies are suggesting
there may be twice that many.

261
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,080
Yes.

262
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
Ten million.

263
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,320
Toughened by conditions
worse than your own prison planet, Father.

264
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,440
Yes, but brutalised by that mindless thug,
Rabban.

265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
They would never ally with him.

266
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,640
Perhaps this brutality is simply part
of something more cunning.

267
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,840
A clever prelude
to ripen them up for someone else.

268
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,680
Someone to come and rescue them
from Rabban.

269
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,720
Someone like the other nephew,
the cute one, Feyd.

270
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
If such a plan succeeded...

271
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,680
...the Baron would have a force
to rival even your dreaded Sardaukar.

272
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,520
Summon Harkonnen to Kaitain.

273
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,480
We shall see what devices
this perverse mind is breeding.

274
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,240
Your Highness has a perceptive mind.

275
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,840
Shall I take that as a compliment
or a threat, Fenring?

276
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,640
I meant it only as a sign of my respect.

277
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,000
I share your fear of the Baron's schemes.

278
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
My father can handle the Baron, Fenring.

279
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,120
It is this Muad'Dib I'm curious about.

280
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,360
Halt!

281
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,640
He caught Korba from behind, Muad'Dib.

282
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,360
One of my newcomers.

283
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,840
- Sardaukar.
- Not a chance.

284
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,120
The only possible explanation
if he overcame Korba.

285
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,160
Submit, Captain.

286
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,120
Submit, Captain.

287
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,480
Sardaukar.

288
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,040
- Gurney.
- Let me kill him, Milord.

289
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,080
No.

290
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Gurney Halleck is right.
We must take his water.

291
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,680
Otheym, see that he's not harmed.

292
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
We'll have use for him soon.

293
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,240
Chani, now you can return
to the southern sietch.

294
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,960
I want you to bring my mother here.

295
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Your mother?

296
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,560
Milord, we were told
she was taken by the Harkonnen.

297
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
That she is dead.

298
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,720
She is very much alive, old friend.

299
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
And you will see her soon.

300
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Come. We have another raid to plan.

301
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Muad'Dib never sleeps.

302
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
They say Muad'Dib never eats.

303
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,280
They believe he can see into the future.

304
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,680
They believe he cannot be killed.

305
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,840
- No one has ever seen him?
- No, Highness.

306
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,960
Though many claim they have.

307
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,560
Sometimes in several places,
at the same time.

308
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,760
But what does he look like?

309
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
I want to know what he looks like.

310
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,360
No one will say for sure.

311
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Perhaps he doesn't even exist.

312
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,240
Perhaps he's just a legend. A ghost.

313
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,840
There were no such things as ghosts.

314
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,360
We were able to jam their signals.

315
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,480
No communications escaped,
but I think you should see this.

316
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,360
The Guild agent.

317
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,240
Quite a distance
from the comforts on Kaitain.

318
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,200
May I remind you that I am protected
by the Imperial Treaties for Commerce...

319
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,600
...by the C.H.O.A.M. Declaration,
paragraph 12, subparagraph D...

320
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,160
...and by Articles 3, 8 and 14
of the Great Convention, which...

321
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,640
Imperial law is void
where Muad'Dib stands.

322
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,480
- The forms must be obeyed.
- Be quiet.

323
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,960
Shall we take their waters now, Muad'Dib?

324
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,800
We have surrendered without resistance.
We have put our lives at your mercy.

325
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
Mercy is a word I no longer understand.

326
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,440
Milord.

327
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,800
Tell me.

328
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,600
Are there many Guild agents
on Arrakis these days?

329
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,760
We are neutral in the matters
between you and the Harkonnen.

330
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,200
Are there?

331
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,240
Arrakis is crawling with them.

332
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,280
Buying up the spice
as if there was precious little left.

333
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,400
You're afraid, aren't you?

334
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
The spice must flow.

335
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,320
Otheym, disarm their thopters.

336
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,600
Fuel them only as much as needed
to reach Arrakeen.

337
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,320
You are letting them go?

338
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,320
Take a message to your masters.

339
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,440
Tell them your fight is hopeless.

340
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,720
Tell them the forces of Muad'Dib
cannot be defeated.

341
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Tell them the days are numbered.

342
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
The men are going to question
your intentions.

343
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,040
The men, Stil, can't possibly imagine
what my intentions are.

344
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,560
Gurney.

345
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,320
Your son shares a bond with this man.

346
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,880
It runs very deep.

347
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,120
Very deep.

348
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,000
The kind only men can have.

349
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,440
And my little man.

350
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,280
You are so thin.

351
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Is he being fed enough?

352
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
His appetite is as healthy as any I've seen.

353
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,120
He should be with the other children.

354
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,000
I cherish the time I spend
with my grandson.

355
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,320
He can't learn the ways of the sietch
if he's kept apart.

356
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,880
There are things he must learn
that extend beyond the ways of the sietch.

357
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,160
There will be time enough
to learn those things.

358
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,480
Does Paul share that sentiment?

359
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,840
Muad'Dib relies on my judgement
where our son is concerned.

360
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,920
You have been a good companion
to my son, Chani.

361
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,280
But he is not like other men.

362
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,760
- I'm sure I know that better than most.
- He is noble-born.

363
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
The rightful heir to the House Atreides.

364
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,600
An alliance with one of the other
great houses must remain a possibility.

365
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,160
You don't have to worry, Reverend Mother.

366
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,120
I will only do what's best for him.

367
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,400
Just as you did for your duke.

368
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,080
Pleasure to see you again,
Baron Harkonnen.

369
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,400
So the Emperor seems to be entertaining
some of the other royal houses as well.

370
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
There is much to discuss.

371
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,160
Really?

372
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,760
Your Majesty, these people are mad.

373
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,040
The women throw their babies at us.

374
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,640
They hurl themselves onto our weapons
to open a wedge for their men to attack.

375
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,280
Indeed.

376
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,120
I can wipe the planet clean
of the entire race, Your Majesty.

377
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,240
But then, who would mine the spice?

378
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,160
It's a terrible dilemma.

379
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,160
Do you have any idea
where this Muad'Dib character came from?

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,520
What he wants? What his price is?

381
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,040
He's a Fremen fanatic,
a religious adventurer.

382
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,200
They crop up regularly
on the fringes of civilisation.

383
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Your Majesty knows this.

384
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,440
Most seem simply bent on suicide.

385
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,920
Have you ever stared into the eyes
of a religious fanatic, Baron?

386
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,440
Suicide and martyrdom
are often the same thing.

387
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,000
It's a dangerous game he's playing.

388
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,720
This rebellion must be crushed. Now.

389
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,840
We agree.

390
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,480
Something must be done,
although we may not suggest...

391
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
...what that is, of course.

392
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,240
We cannot move on House Harkonnen
unilaterally, Majesty.

393
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,880
There are complications in our relationship.

394
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
It's time to draw this Muad'Dib
into the open.

395
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,280
Have the royal houses
prepare their armies.

396
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,560
We're moving the royal palace to Arrakis,
with the Guild's approval, of course.

397
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,960
They expect you to call Stilgar out.

398
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,000
No man recognises leadership
without the challenge of combat.

399
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,280
Now that I've ridden the worm,
they think there's nothing else in our way.

400
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
Is there?

401
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,240
A man in a rush never sees
the edge of the cliff until it's too late.

402
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,400
They don't see any cliffs.

403
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,320
You don't allow them to.

404
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,080
They have a simple religion.

405
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,760
Nothing about religion is simple.

406
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,200
- Isn't it late to be worrying about that?
- We did...

407
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,080
I did what I had to do
to ensure our survival.

408
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,360
- You used them.
- Yes.

409
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,520
- So have you.
- No.

410
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm fulfilling the role
destiny has chosen for me.

411
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,280
You sound like you believe
the legends about you.

412
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,400
Like the Kwisatz Haderach?

413
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,320
What do you know about that?

414
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Mother Ramallo called me that...

415
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,280
...at Sietch Tabr, before she died.

416
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,200
I was supposed to have a daughter.

417
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,360
One that could be wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

418
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,240
A way to end the feud and possibly
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

419
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,640
The one who can be many places at once.

420
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,440
The ultimate achievement
of centuries of Bene Gesserit breeding.

421
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,320
The man who could go
where we could not.

422
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
The one with perfect memory,
who could provide perfect predictability.

423
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,760
And perfect power
for the Bene Gesserit, of course.

424
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,440
I did what I did because I loved your father.

425
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
I only wanted to give him a son.

426
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,000
I didn't want to create a god.

427
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,080
- Then you don't believe it's true?
- I'm your mother, Paul.

428
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,560
- I know who you are.
- Do you?

429
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,840
Forgive me, Reverend Mother.

430
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Can I bring you anything?
Some food, perhaps?

431
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,640
Yes, thank you.

432
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,720
And then I'd like to see Gurney.

433
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,360
You must find a way not to lose Stilgar.

434
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,640
Come, Otheym.

435
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Thought you'd escaped, witch?

436
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,120
- Gurney, what are you doing?
- I'm your confessor.

437
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,440
Take your hands off me.

438
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,240
Here to unburden your black conscience
of guilt before I send you into eternity.

439
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,040
Gurney!

440
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,920
One more step, Milord,
and I'll finish it right now.

441
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,560
You better explain yourself, Gurney.

442
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
I'll explain all right.

443
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,840
The day the House Atreides fell,
I swore an oath I would kill the one...

444
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,960
...who betrayed your father.

445
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,920
- You couldn't be more wrong, Gurney.
- Do not speak.

446
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,320
- Gurney.
- Stand where you are, Milord.

447
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,520
Am I capable of lying to you?

448
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,720
You never have, Milord.

449
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,040
The traitor was Yueh, Gurney.

450
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,080
No.

451
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,400
We have the confession in his own hand.

452
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,520
And as soon as you release my mother,
you can read it for yourself.

453
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,440
Look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't you.

454
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,080
I will know if you are lying.

455
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,520
I will know.

456
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,960
I would've given my life to save Leto.

457
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,360
The day he died, my heart turned to stone.

458
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,120
It was Yueh.

459
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,040
They had his wife.

460
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,600
My God, what have I done?

461
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,800
My God.

462
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,840
Be still, Gurney, it's over now.

463
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,200
I didn't see it coming.

464
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
You need to rest, Muad'Dib.

465
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,440
I didn't know he would threaten her.

466
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
I never saw it.

467
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,440
He could've killed her.

468
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,560
This can't go on.

469
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,120
You are asking too much of yourself.

470
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,440
I want you to take Leto
and return to the southern sietch.

471
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,120
I want you safe.

472
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm safest when we are together.

473
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,080
But I'm not.

474
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,160
Muad'Dib!

475
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,600
He's alive.

476
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I assure you, he's alive.

477
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,360
But the thread of life is so thin,
most think he's not.

478
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,480
- How long has he been this way?
- Almost to the day you left.

479
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,120
Otheym found him.

480
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,160
The experience has shaken him.

481
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,080
I spent a week trying to revive him.

482
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,320
But it's been no use.

483
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,040
There have been meetings, arguments.

484
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,560
Some of the elders think it's time...

485
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,200
...to take his water.

486
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,480
Who else knows?

487
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,320
Stilgar, the naibs,
and the Fedaykin, of course.

488
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,720
What do the Fedaykin think?

489
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,920
They think he's in a sacred trance...

490
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,240
...gathering his holy powers
for the final battle.

491
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,080
I've encouraged this view.

492
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,440
You have to help, Chani.

493
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,000
You're my last hope.

494
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,480
Please, tell me what to do.

495
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,680
The Fedaykin are right, Reverend Mother.

496
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,720
Muad'Dib is in a trance.

497
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,200
A dangerous trance.

498
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,800
He has taken the Water of Life.

499
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,360
The raw water of a drowned maker.
I have not changed it yet.

500
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,280
More could kill him.

501
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,560
It's our only hope.

502
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,720
Muad'Dib. Beloved.

503
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,800
Chani, what are you doing here?

504
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,920
Paul.

505
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,680
I was outside just a moment ago.

506
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,880
You drank the Water of Life.

507
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,720
Yes.

508
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,440
We thought you were dead.

509
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,840
You have no idea.

510
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,960
I have seen things
there are not words to describe.

511
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,200
You've seen the future.

512
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,640
The now, Mother.

513
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,560
The future and the past.

514
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,520
All at once.

515
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,280
All the same.

516
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,840
I am the whirlwind.

517
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,920
Paul. I can't go there.

518
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,600
I'm afraid.

519
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,360
I'm so afraid.

520
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,160
- It is the place we cannot go.
- That is why I have come.

521
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,200
You are the Kwisatz Haderach.

522
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,560
No, Mother. I am something more.

523
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,480
I am something unexpected.

524
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,240
I am the fulcrum, the giver and the taker.

525
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,640
I am the one
who can be many places at once.

526
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
I am the master of fate.

527
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,960
I am the tool of fate.

528
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,320
Reverend Mother?

529
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,040
Reverend Mother, are you sick?

530
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,440
I'm fine.

531
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,320
Now you understand.

532
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,240
I've decided we're alike, you and me.

533
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,240
Have you?

534
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,680
When this dusty little nuisance is over
I'll convince you.

535
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,040
I'd be confused if you didn't try.

536
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,200
I know.

537
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,800
Yeah, that's why we're alike.

538
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,320
We don't like to be confused.
We like to be certain.

539
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,800
Sometime, remind me to tell you
about the ancient legend of the Phoenix.

540
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,680
That's it, beautiful boy.

541
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,880
You may find a way for us yet.

542
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,240
She'd make a fine trophy
on Harkonnen linen, wouldn't she?

543
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,960
The Padishah Emperor is here,
in the space above us...

544
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,960
...with his favourite truthsayer
and legions of his Sardaukar.

545
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,360
Every great house has its raiders here.

546
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,520
The Baron Harkonnen is with them.

547
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,200
But Muad'Dib, how can you know this?

548
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,760
I've seen them.

549
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,160
Milord, we only heard this morning...

550
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,360
...from our smuggler allies.

551
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,440
- You were unconscious.
- Not unconscious!

552
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,600
Muad'Dib has seen through
the Water of Life.

553
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,720
Reverend Mother, is this true?

554
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,400
He has seen.

555
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,760
Muad'Dib!

556
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,360
You are a voice from the outer world.

557
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,480
You are the prophet sent to us
by Shai-hulud.

558
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,440
You must take your place, Muad'Dib.

559
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,800
We've waited long enough.

560
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,800
You must do it now!

561
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,760
Do you live for the good of the tribe,
Stilgar?

562
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,080
There is no other way.

563
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,640
And for the good of the tribe,
would you stand there...

564
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,040
...and let me drive this blade
into your heart?

565
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,320
- Call him out, Muad'Dib.
- Call him out.

566
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,520
- It is the way, Stilgar.
- It is the way.

567
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,760
It is the way.

568
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,080
Ways change!

569
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,960
Hard tasks need hard ways.

570
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,560
You must become our naib
so you can lead us against the Harkonnen.

571
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,920
And would you smash your knife
before starting that war?

572
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,080
Will you cut off your right arm
and leave it bloody on the floor?

573
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,760
Do you think the Mahdi is that stupid?

574
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,440
There isn't a man among you who could
stand against me in single combat...

575
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,080
...Stilgar included.

576
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,240
Must I prove it by calling out the naib
of every sietch on the planet?

577
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,720
Must I cripple myself by killing
our strongest and wisest leaders...

578
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,600
...just for the sake of some mindless ritual?

579
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,560
You say I am the Mahdi.

580
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,680
I say I am your duke!

581
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,480
And it's time now to wipe Arrakis clean
of the awful Harkonnen stench.

582
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,280
Time to drive their name into the depths
of hell so that we may reclaim the planet...

583
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,600
...and create a paradise together!

584
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,680
As Liet taught us.

585
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,680
As Liet taught us.

586
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,200
Long live the duke.

587
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,680
Long live Duke Paul Muad'Dib.

588
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,280
Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!

589
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,320
Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!

590
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,880
The men have gathered the supplies.
We're almost ready to depart.

591
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,440
- What are they waiting for?
- For permission.

592
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,240
They know the Guild will strand any force
that lands here without its consent.

593
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,760
The Guild is protecting us?

594
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,600
They're afraid, Stil.

595
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Afraid of what's to come.

596
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,960
They're searching for a way out.

597
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,120
They're searching for me.

598
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,080
What are we going to do?

599
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,080
Let them find me.

600
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,280
Come, Otheym.

601
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,280
I want you to choose several
of your best men.

602
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,040
Ones who you trust above all others.

603
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,200
Separate them from the rest
before we withdraw from here.

604
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,240
As you wish.

605
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,200
Send them to the reservoir
in the Habbanya Erg.

606
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,680
Have them collect the Water of Life
we've hidden there.

607
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,880
Muad'Dib, I don't understand.

608
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,280
Those are changed waters...

609
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,120
...hidden there in case something
should happen to the Reverend Mother...

610
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,960
Have the men find a pre-spice mass,
as large as possible.

611
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,640
Have them plant the waters
above the mass...

612
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,200
...and wait for my orders.

613
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,320
Do you realise
what you're asking me to do?

614
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,720
What you've asked shall be done.

615
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,560
The Baron insists
the southern areas are uninhabitable.

616
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,000
The Baron is mistaken.

617
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,800
Fremen?

618
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,320
There have been reports.

619
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,880
Only a few were investigated
according to Harkonnen documents.

620
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,760
Cost to profit too high apparently.

621
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
Many thopters were lost.

622
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,760
Even smugglers won't venture there.

623
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,560
Send a light attack force immediately.

624
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,760
I want ground reconnaissance.

625
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,600
Perhaps this Muad'Dib thinks
he can continue to attack us...

626
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,560
...then retreat into the wilderness
where we dare not follow.

627
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm about to strangle his options.

628
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,640
Let all Fremen who pass here...

629
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,160
...pause and pay homage to the shrine
of Duke Leto Atreides...

630
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,120
...and all those who have died
in the service of justice.

631
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,360
Gurney.

632
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,880
Now all we need is a storm.

633
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,640
A great-grandmother of a storm.

634
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,840
Seems you'll have one soon enough.

635
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,040
From here the future will open,
the clouds will part to reveal its glory.

636
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,040
And it gives me no peace.

637
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,800
I've seen what you've seen, Paul.

638
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,520
I know what's coming,
what you're about to let loose...

639
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,680
...not just here on Arrakis,
but across the entire universe...

640
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,520
But I am powerless to stop it.

641
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,000
Are you?

642
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,520
A terrible purpose awaits us, Mother.

643
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,200
This vast organism we call humanity
is about to reinvent itself...

644
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,400
...from the ashes of its own complacency.

645
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,440
The sleeper has awakened.

646
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,840
Anything that tries to stop it
will be crushed.

647
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,600
Even the innocent.

648
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,880
There are no innocents anymore.

649
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,800
Your father
would never have spoken this way.

650
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,640
I am not my father.

651
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,280
You are his son.

652
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,880
More than his son. Much more.

653
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,440
Thanks to you.

654
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,000
Take a good look at me, Mother.

655
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,360
See something I learned
after I took the Water of Life.

656
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,760
Look into my eyes.

657
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,720
Look back through them, into my blood.

658
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,840
Harkonnen blood.

659
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,760
Flowing in mine.

660
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,720
It flows from you.

661
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,600
I won't believe it.

662
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Who was your father?

663
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,360
- Tell me.
- You know I can't...

664
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,120
Who?

665
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,520
I don't know. I don't know.

666
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,200
- I have never known.
- Because they hid it from you.

667
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,600
Because they took me
when I was an infant.

668
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,920
Raised me in the Bene Gesserit ways...

669
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,000
...like all the others before and since.

670
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,560
None know their mothers, or their fathers.

671
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,160
The Baron Harkonnen, Mother,
you're his daughter.

672
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,280
The product of a clever seduction.

673
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,880
The handiwork of your precious
Bene Gesserit breeding programmes.

674
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,760
I'm his grandson.

675
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,480
They wanted to control things.

676
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,920
They couldn't control you.

677
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,400
You changed everything.

678
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,480
You had a son and now I'm here.

679
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
The one they were seeking.

680
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,400
But I've arrived before my time,
and they're just beginning to realise it.

681
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,560
They're coming.

682
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,480
Check that room.

683
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,400
Over here.

684
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,800
Leto!

685
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,520
Muad'Dib?

686
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,240
What is it?

687
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,400
Our son is dead.

688
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,320
Will you look at that thing?

689
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,440
I count nine levels.

690
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,320
The fools brought
the whole palace with him.

691
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,440
My dear Emperor,
I'm about to shatter your sanity.

692
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,200
Then I'm going to destroy you.

693
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,560
Not a thopter in the sky.

694
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,120
Everything's being pulled in and tied down.

695
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,080
They know a storm is coming.

696
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,080
Time to let them know I'm here.

697
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,600
The Sardaukar Captain,
alive and unharmed as you ordered.

698
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,160
I am about to set you free.

699
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,240
And you must take this with you.

700
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,480
These are terms for surrender.

701
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,200
They killed my son!

702
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,160
I can't do this.

703
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,600
You have no choice.

704
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,320
Don't be afraid.

705
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,280
Good.

706
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,360
Clean him up.

707
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,000
Give him one of the Sardaukar uniforms
we've taken.

708
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,200
Full-rank insignia.

709
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,560
Let him face his master with dignity.

710
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,800
You're mad! Do you know that?

711
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,920
After you return with the Emperor's
answer then we can discuss who is mad.

712
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,160
The arrogance! The utter lunacy!

713
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,080
Your Majesty, if I may suggest...

714
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,920
...the time has come to loose the forces
of the Empire against this scum.

715
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,040
Shut your mouth.

716
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,080
It's you I have to thank for this mess.

717
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,600
You and your hapless family, Baron.

718
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:19,920
I really don't think that this is the time
to revisit old strategies.

719
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,360
I said quiet!

720
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,080
So, he wants an answer, does he?

721
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,880
So, here he is, the fat Baron himself.

722
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,240
He isn't much, is he?

723
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,720
What is this? Some kind of midget?

724
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,800
My dear Baron.

725
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,760
Meet the sister
of the one they call Muad'Dib.

726
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,480
Their shields are going up.

727
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,520
They've given us their answer.

728
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,640
The thumpers have been activated.

729
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,520
It's time, Gurney.

730
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
Your Majesty, I had no idea.

731
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,000
He's lying, of course.

732
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,040
Quiet, child.

733
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,160
Make him afraid some more.

734
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,800
It's time to bring this sorry episode
to a close.

735
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,920
Time for your brother to surrender,
as the prize for your life.

736
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,920
No. I don't take orders from you, old man.

737
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,840
It's not wise to be so impudent, child.

738
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,440
You do not want to feel
the full force of my power.

739
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,080
I am beyond your power. Ask her.

740
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,800
Kill her.

741
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,040
Kill her now.

742
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,800
She's the Abomination.

743
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,560
The one the ancients warned us about.

744
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,000
What is this?

745
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,480
Look at her, Father.

746
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,480
Can you not see it?

747
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,680
She is the daughter of Duke Leto.

748
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,120
She is Atreides.

749
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,960
Her brother is the duke's son, Paul.

750
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,960
He is the Muad'Dib.

751
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,080
Impossible.

752
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,600
Have faith.
The endgame has already been written.

753
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,400
Do it, Gurney.

754
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,000
Do it now!

755
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,320
Kill her! She's in my mind!

756
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,480
Kill her!

757
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,840
My brother comes.

758
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,240
The shield wall is breached, Your Majesty.

759
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,160
The perimeter shields
won't hold against that.

760
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,000
Majesty, we must fall back to space
and reform.

761
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,160
Give her body to the storm!

762
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,760
Let the storm have what it can take.

763
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,200
I have her, Your Majesty!

764
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,720
Goodbye, Grandfather.

765
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,600
You've finally met
the Atreides' Gom Jabbar.

766
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,400
Majesty, we must retreat!

767
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,320
Prepare my shuttle.

768
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,960
Stilgar!

769
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,000
This way.

770
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,440
Some of the dying
asked to see the Reverend Mother.

771
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,080
She is with them.

772
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,920
This was my parents' room.

773
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,760
What little peace they had,
after we came to Arrakis, was here.

774
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,160
Tell me again about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

775
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,600
Where water falls from the sky...

776
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,800
...and plants grow so thick
you can't walk in between them.

777
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,040
As Arrakis will be one day.

778
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,840
Paid for with the blood of our people.

779
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,960
Our fathers.

780
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,560
Our son.

781
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,720
He can never be replaced, Chani.

782
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,400
But there will be other children.

783
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,360
I promise.

784
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,280
Is it over?

785
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,680
Almost.

786
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:36,760
Perhaps my respected kinsman...

787
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,560
...thinks he has things his own way now.

788
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,280
There is a massed armada
of the great houses in the space...

789
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,560
...over Arrakis, young Atreides.

790
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,320
I have but to give the word.

791
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,680
Your word means nothing anymore.

792
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,520
I am the Emperor!

793
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,640
Not for long.

794
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,480
Dispatch orders to your navigators.

795
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:15,480
You are to depart our space
and return the fleet to its homes at once.

796
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:20,360
The Guild does not take your orders.

797
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,640
Tell them to look into the future.

798
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,040
They will see me staring back at them...

799
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,840
...ready to give the order.

800
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,720
The order to destroy
all spice production on this planet.

801
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,520
My men are waiting in the desert.

802
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:50,480
There is a particularly large
and volatile pre-spice mass there.

803
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,880
I need but raise my finger...

804
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,520
...and the nest will be flooded
with the changed Water of Life.

805
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,800
Jessica!

806
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,360
What have you done to us?

807
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,400
Spreading death among the makers.

808
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Killing a cycle of life.

809
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,360
Creating a chain reaction
which will grow and grow...

810
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,560
...until there are no makers left.

811
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,400
Until there is no spice left.

812
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,320
Jessica, silence him!

813
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,360
Silence him yourself.

814
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,400
Can he do this?

815
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,440
They know I can do this.

816
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,280
That's what they've feared the most.

817
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,680
They've been monitoring the signals
my men have been sending.

818
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,440
They know precisely where we are
and what we can do.

819
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,800
Without the spice
the navigators will become blind...

820
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,480
...the Bene Gesserit will lose all powers...

821
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,680
...and all commerce
among the great houses will cease!

822
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,480
Civilisation will end.

823
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,920
If I am not obeyed...

824
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,680
...the spice will not flow.

825
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,040
But it will be suicide.

826
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,760
I think we both know the way out
of this difficulty, don't we?

827
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,880
- Paul.
- Do not interfere, Mother.

828
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,160
This is for the good of us all.

829
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,160
Never.

830
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,680
An adventurer like him.
A traitor to the Empire.

831
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,440
Father, here is a man fit to be your son.

832
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,560
Do you really think
I'd agree to such a thing?

833
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,000
What choice do we have?

834
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,800
Kanly.

835
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,880
I invoke kanly.

836
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,360
Which one is that?

837
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,760
The Baron's other nephew, my Lord.

838
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,720
Feyd.

839
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,560
A cold-blooded killer.

840
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,040
So it comes down to this.

841
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,560
It is my right...

842
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,400
...as the Baron now of House Harkonnen,
I demand satisfaction.

843
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,320
So you're what's left of the house
that killed my father.

844
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,960
It's down to us.

845
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,080
Here we settle this vendetta
once and for all.

846
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,960
He's a Harkonnen animal, Muad'Dib.

847
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,400
He's right, Milord.

848
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,720
Let me kill him.

849
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,840
It will be my gift to you.

850
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:36,120
Is the great Muad'Dib such a coward
that he sends others to do his dirty work?

851
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,640
Otheym.

852
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,000
Does this one fight in the Emperor's name?

853
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:49,160
If Feyd wishes it, he will meet you
with my blade in his hand.

854
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,680
I wish it!

855
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,520
May thy knife chip and shatter.

856
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,000
Paul, don't do it.

857
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,200
Would you like the Emperor's truthsayer
to prepare your spirit for its journey?

858
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,200
Or have you gone too native?

859
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,800
Maybe you'd like that little pet up there,
the pretty one...

860
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,960
...to say a few pagan rites?

861
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,200
Before I claim her.

862
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,120
I am not afraid.

863
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,600
Nothing to say, Atreides?

864
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,640
Perhaps you'll answer this.

865
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,240
So you see, Atreides?

866
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,880
Your death, fool.

867
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,160
The poison will stop your muscles,
and my knife will finish you.

868
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,280
It's over...

869
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,560
...Cousin.

870
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,880
Irulan.

871
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,360
You cannot stop this thing.

872
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,280
The spice must flow.

873
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,920
You see her standing there,
so haughty, so confident.

874
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,760
Let us hope she finds solace
in her writing and her books.

875
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,680
She'll have little else.

876
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,840
She may have my son's name,
but it is we...

877
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,840
...the ones who carry
the name of concubine...

878
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,720
...that history will call "wives".

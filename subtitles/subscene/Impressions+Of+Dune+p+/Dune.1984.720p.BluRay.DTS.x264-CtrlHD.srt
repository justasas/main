1
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,094
A beginning is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,766
Know then,
that it is the year 10,191.

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,394
The Known Universe is

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,605
ruled by the Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV,

5
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,983
my father.

6
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,571
In this time,
the most precious substance in the Universe

7
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,656
is the spice melange.

8
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,993
The spice extends life.

9
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,873
The spice expands consciousness.

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,461
The spice is vital to space travel.

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,672
The Spacing Guild and its navigators,

12
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,968
who the spice has mutated over 4,000 years,

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,763
use the orange spice gas,

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,349
which gives them the ability to fold space.

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,643
That is,

16
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,190
travel to any part of the Universe without moving.

17
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,319
Oh, yes.
I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,155
The spice exists

19
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,700
on only one planet in the entire Universe.

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,371
A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts.

21
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,292
Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts

22
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
are a people known as the Fremen,

23
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,632
who have long held a prophecy,

24
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,550
that a man would come,

25
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,555
a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom.

26
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,393
The planet is Arrakis.

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,314
Also known as Dune.

28
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,070
<i>A secret report within the Guild.</i>

29
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,074
<i>Four planets have come to our attention</i>

30
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>regarding a plot which could jeopardize spice production.</i>

31
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,874
<i>Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.</i>

32
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,045
<i>Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.</i>

33
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,674
<i>Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.</i>

34
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>Planet Kaitain,</i>

35
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,305
<i>home of the Emperor of the Known Universe.</i>

36
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
<i>Send a third-stage Guild Navigator to Kaitain</i>

37
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,271
<i>to demand details from the Emperor.</i>

38
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,191
<i>The spice must flow.</i>

39
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Father?

40
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,865
Irulan, you must leave.

41
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,099
A third-stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,643
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,229
I shall want telepathy during his visit

44
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,314
and a report when we're finished.

45
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,192
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

46
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,778
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.</i>

48
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,479
Leave us.

49
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,815
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,995
We are alone.

51
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>We have just folded space from Ix.</i>

52
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,711
Yes?

53
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,173
How was your journey?

54
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,592
<i>Many machines on Ix.</i>

55
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720
<i>New machines.</i>

56
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,139
Oh?

57
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,974
Yes.

58
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,018
<i>Better than those on Richese.</i>

59
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,481
<i>You are transparent.</i>

60
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,776
<i>I see many things.</i>

61
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,239
<i>I see plans within plans.</i>

62
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,909
<i>I see two great houses,</i>

63
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,998
<i>House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.</i>

64
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>I see you behind it.</i>

65
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes.

66
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,423
<i>You must share with us.</i>

67
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,594
The Atreides House is building a secret army

68
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
using a technique unknown to us.

69
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,973
A technique involving sound.

70
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,351
The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad.

71
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,395
He could threaten me.

72
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,105
I have ordered House Atreides

73
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

74
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,777
thus replacing their enemies, the Harkonnens.

75
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,362
House Atreides will not refuse

76
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,407
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

77
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
Then, at an appointed time,

78
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis

79
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,040
and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides.

80
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,708
I have promised the baron

81
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

82
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,633
<i>So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides.</i>

83
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,301
Yes.

84
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,929
<i>One small point.</i>

85
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,765
<i>Here it comes.</i>

86
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,268
<i>We, ourselves, foresee a slight problem</i>

87
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>within House Atreides.</i>

88
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,150
<i>Paul. Paul Atreides.</i>

89
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,238
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father?

90
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,991
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

91
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>We want him killed.</i>

92
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,249
<i>I did not say this.</i>

93
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,210
<i>I am not here.</i>

94
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
I understand.

95
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,204
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

96
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,545
We must have a look at Paul Atreides.

97
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
On Caladan.

98
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,315
<i>The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood,</i>

99
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,816
<i>for 90 generations,</i>

100
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>has been manipulating bloodlines</i>

101
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,112
<i>to produce the Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

102
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,780
<i>A super being.</i>

103
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,491
<i>On Caladan, Jessica,</i>

104
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,993
<i>a member of the sisterhood</i>

105
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
<i>and the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides</i>

106
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,374
<i>had been ordered to bear only daughters.</i>

107
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,626
<i>Because of her love for the Duke,</i>

108
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,213
<i>she disobeyed and gave birth to a son.</i>

109
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,259
<i>Paul. Paul Atreides.</i>

110
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,146
<i>Here we are now. Caladan.</i>

111
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,149
<i>And 19 light-years beyond.</i>

112
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,860
<i>Beyond Bene Tleilax.</i>

113
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,029
<i>The training planet of the Mentats,</i>

114
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,655
<i>the human computers.</i>

115
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.</i>

116
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,453
<i>There, Arrakis.</i>

117
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,871
<i>Spice Mining.</i>

118
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,832
<i>Carryalls lower the harvester to the sand,</i>

119
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,627
<i>and lift it off to safety when a worm attacks.</i>

120
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,546
<i>Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.</i>

121
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,010
<i>Weather. See storms'.
No Precipitation.</i>

122
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,931
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

123
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,478
<i>And the Harkonnens are near.
There.</i>

124
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen.</i>

125
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,732
<i>The enemy.</i>

126
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,860
<i>The Baron Harkonnen has sworn to destroy House Atreides,</i>

127
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,613
<i>and steal the ducal signet ring for himself.</i>

128
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,343
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door.

129
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,640
l heard you, Doctor Yueh,

130
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,767
and Gurney coming down the hall.

131
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,352
Those sounds

132
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,729
could be imitated!

133
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,650
I'd know the difference.

134
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</i>

135
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,075
My father sent you to test me.

136
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,618
Music, then?

137
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,120
No music.

138
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,914
I'm packing this for the crossing.

139
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
Shield practice.

140
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,959
Shield practice?

141
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,545
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

142
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,671
I'm not in the mood.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,381
Not in the mood?

144
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,009
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.

145
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,135
Not fighting!

146
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm sorry, Gurney.

147
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,889
Not sorry enough.

148
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,359
<i>What's wrong with Gurney?</i>

149
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,903
<i>He's not faking this.</i>

150
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,573
<i>Now, guard yourself for true!</i>

151
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,594
<i>Is this what you seek?</i>

152
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,638
<i>Good.</i>

153
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,099
<i>The slow blade penetrates the shield.</i>

154
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,353
<i>But, uh, look down.</i>

155
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,399
<i>We'd have joined each other in death.</i>

156
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,362
<i>You did seem finally to get in the mood.</i>

157
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,455
Would you really have drawn my blood?

158
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,208
If you'd have fought one whit below your abilities,

159
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,211
I'd have given you a good scar to remind you.

160
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,133
Things have been so serious here lately.

161
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,469
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

162
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,972
Arrakis is real.

163
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,475
The Harkonnens are real.

164
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,520
Doctor Yueh.

165
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,982
Do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis?

166
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,777
I've obtained a filmbook of a small specimen.

167
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
Only 125 meters long.

168
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,949
Only?

169
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,076
There have been documented sightings of worms

170
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,330
as large as 450 meters in the deep desert.

171
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,334
That's far from where we'll be in Arrakeen.

172
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,629
The desert belt and the south polar region

173
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,506
are marked forbidden.

174
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,758
How do the Fremen survive there?

175
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,969
We don't know much about the Fremen.

176
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,264
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

177
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,600
They have blue-within-blue eyes.

178
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,310
The eyes.

179
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,228
Yes.

180
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,607
Saturation of the blood by the spice melange.

181
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,484
Could the spice affect us in other ways?

182
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,820
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

183
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,904
For one,

184
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,906
the Harkonnens would not have

185
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,577
given up their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

186
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,748
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.

187
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,710
But behind them, l suspect,
is the Emperor.

188
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,297
You'll make a formidable duke.

189
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,928
Now, remember,

190
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,849
the first step in avoiding a trap

191
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,310
is knowing of its existence.

192
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,521
I know, but if it is a trap

193
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,814
then why are we going?

194
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,900
We have our new army.

195
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,902
Doctor Yueh,

196
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,780
put the weirding module on him.

197
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,744
Well.

198
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,597
Clear and lock the room!

199
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,974
<i>Detachment, stand down.</i>

200
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,443
Activate a fighter.

201
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,424
Make the range two meters.

202
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
Precise control.

203
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Duncan!

204
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,550
Paul, I was just on my way to say goodbye to you.

205
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,845
I have to go on ahead, alone,

206
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,388
l won't be seeing you for a while.

207
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,766
l wish you were coming with us. Why?

208
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,559
It's something for your father.

209
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,645
He wants to talk to you.

210
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,731
I'll see you on Arrakis.

211
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
May the hand of God be with you.

212
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,321
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.

213
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,588
Father.

214
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,049
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

215
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,136
Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations.

216
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,141
He swears you are the finest student he has ever taught.

217
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan say the same.

218
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,900
Makes me feel very proud.

219
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,236
I want you to be proud of me.

220
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,125
I'll miss the sea.

221
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,255
But a person needs new experiences.

222
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,800
They jar something deep inside

223
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,845
allowing him to grow.

224
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,557
Without change,

225
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,228
something sleeps inside us,

226
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,482
and seldom awakens.

227
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,281
The sleeper must awaken.

228
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,935
Arrakis, Dune.

229
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>Desert Planet.</i>

230
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,526
<i>I will kill you.</i>

231
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,739
<i>The second moon.</i>

232
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,041
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

233
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,847
<i>I know she has come to test him.</i>

234
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,726
<i>No man has ever been tested with the box.</i>

235
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>Tonight, l may lose my son.</i>

236
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,259
Jessica, you were told
to bear only daughters to the Atreides.

237
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,802
Jessica!

238
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,887
It meant so much to him.

239
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,599
You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?

240
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,477
Desires don't come into this.

241
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,187
An Atreides daughter

242
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,273
could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir

243
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,358
and sealed the breach.

244
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,903
We may lose both bloodlines now.

245
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,450
l vowed never to regret my decision.

246
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,121
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

247
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,957
And your son will pay with you.

248
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,086
Arrakis, Dune,

249
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,131
Desert Planet.

250
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,258
Moving.

251
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,969
Moving.

252
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,826
We'll salvage what we can.

253
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,954
But l can tell you, dear God,

254
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,291
for the father, nothing.

255
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,502
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

256
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,214
Did you really think you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

257
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,716
The Universe's super being?

258
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,511
How dare you!

259
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,472
My greatest student.

260
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,518
And my greatest disappointment.

261
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,565
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

262
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,694
Good!
Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides.

263
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,613
I want to see you in your mother's chambers

264
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
in one-quarter of an hour.

265
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,786
Paul.

266
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,081
This is very important.

267
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,672
<i>Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?</i>

268
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,883
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

269
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,357
Vas.

270
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,168
This is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.

271
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,088
She's going to observe you.

272
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,843
Please.

273
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,219
Jessica,

274
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,055
you know it must be done.

275
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,849
Your Reverence.

276
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
<i>What does she fear?</i>

277
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,687
What about my father?

278
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
Paul,

279
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,776
listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

280
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,787
Now, you,

281
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,999
come here.

282
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,294
<i>She's using the Voice.</i>

283
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,046
No.

284
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,131
<i>Some strength there.</i>

285
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,966
<i>Surprising.</i>

286
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,178
Come here!

287
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,513
<i>Here.</i>

288
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,975
<i>Come here.</i>

289
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,365
Do you see this?

290
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,411
Put your right hand in the box.

291
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,872
What's in the box?

292
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,123
Pain.

293
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,416
Stop.

294
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,045
Put your hand in the box.

295
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,345
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.

296
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,765
This one kills only animals.

297
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,227
Are you suggesting the Duke's son is an animal?

298
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,855
Let us say, I suggest you may be human.

299
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,110
Your awareness may be powerful enough
to control your instincts.

300
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,987
Your instinct will be

301
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,447
to remove your hand from the box.

302
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,533
If you do so,

303
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,202
you die.

304
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,124
You will feel

305
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
an itching

306
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,715
there.

307
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:19,512
Now, the itching becomes burning.

308
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,142
Heat upon heat upon heat.

309
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,310
It burns.

310
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,145
Silence! Silence!

311
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,565
<i>I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.</i>

312
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,277
<i>Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.</i>

313
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,196
<i>I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass</i>

314
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,283
<i>over me and through me.
I must not fear.</i>

315
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,826
You feel the flesh crisping.

316
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,286
<i>Fear is the mind killer.</i>

317
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,706
<i>Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.</i>

318
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

319
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,501
Flesh dropping off.

320
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:55,214
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>

321
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,133
<i>I must not fear.</i>

322
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,346
<i>Fear is the little death.
I'm...</i>

323
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,473
The pain!

324
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,391
No! Enough!

325
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,271
<i>Kull wahad!</i>

326
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,108
No woman child ever withstood that much.

327
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:22,241
Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.

328
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,037
Do it!

329
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,420
Pain by nerve induction.

330
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,381
A human can resist any pain.

331
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,759
Our test is crisis and observation.

332
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,552
I see the truth of it.

333
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,513
<i>Could he be the one?</i>

334
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>Maybe.</i>

335
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,476
<i>But will he be ours to control?</i>

336
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,897
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

337
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,821
Do you know of the Water of Life?

338
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,408
The bile from the newborn worms of Arrakis?

339
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
I have heard of it.

340
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
It is very dangerous.

341
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,914
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood use it to see within.

342
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,209
There is a place

343
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,504
terrifying to us,

344
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,297
to women.

345
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,633
It is said

346
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,719
a man will come.

347
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,681
The Kwisatz Haderach.

348
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,059
He will go where we cannot.

349
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,522
Many men have tried.

350
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,233
They tried and failed?

351
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
They tried and died.

352
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,863
Jessica.

353
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,912
<i>My son lives!</i>

354
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,629
I sense your teachings in him.

355
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,091
Ignore the regular order of training.

356
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,427
His safety requires the Voice.

357
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,721
I've heard enough of my safety.

358
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,639
What about my father?

359
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,266
I heard your talking.

360
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,560
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

361
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,978
Paul.
Well, he's not.

362
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,647
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

363
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,483
What can be done has been done.

364
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,234
Mother, tell me!

365
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,887
<i>Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

366
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,348
<i>Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

367
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,184
<i>The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.</i>

368
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,356
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

369
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,025
It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed,

370
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,528
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

371
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,489
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

372
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,827
<i>It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.</i>

373
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,372
<i>It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed,</i>

374
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,707
<i>that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.</i>

375
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,252
<i>It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.</i>

376
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,941
My lord.

377
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,234
Piter!

378
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,530
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

379
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,575
and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.

380
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,119
What does Leto say, Piter?

381
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,039
He wishes to inform you that vendetta,

382
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,958
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

383
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,836
the art of kanly, is still alive.

384
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,423
He does not wish to meet or speak with you.

385
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,385
I've made my peace gesture.

386
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,097
The forms of kanly have been obeyed.

387
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,893
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

388
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,755
As you instructed me,

389
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,049
I have enlightened your nephews

390
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,384
concerning my plan...

391
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,760
My plan.

392
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,182
The plan to crush the Atreides.

393
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,726
Feyd,

394
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,771
Rabban,

395
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,232
go quietly.

396
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,903
No other great house of the Landsraad

397
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,865
must ever know
of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.

398
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,870
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

399
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,665
and the Emperor.

400
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
Put the pick in there,
Pete,

401
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,130
and turn it round
real neat.

402
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,778
You are so beautiful,
my Baron.

403
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,991
Your skin, love to me.

404
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,704
Your diseases lovingly cared for,

405
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,873
for all eternity.

406
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,215
I will have Arrakis back for myself!

407
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,761
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

408
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,180
And what Piter did not tell you

409
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,558
is we have control of someone who is very close,

410
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,311
very close to Duke Leto.

411
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,522
This person, this traitor

412
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,359
will be worth more to us than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

413
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,403
And who is this traitor?

414
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,823
I won't tell you who the traitor is,

415
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,742
or when we'll attack.

416
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,702
However,

417
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,581
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...

418
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,083
He'll know that it is l,

419
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,129
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

420
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,751
<i>This is what I'll do to the Duke and his family.</i>

421
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,543
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

422
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,527
<i>Caladan.</i>

423
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,418
Soon they will begin to fold space.

424
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,630
<i>Far off in the control rooms of spice gas.</i>

425
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,009
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

426
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,399
And now,

427
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,442
the prophecy.

428
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,238
One will come.

429
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,534
The voice from the outer world.

430
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,579
Bringing the Holy War,

431
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,831
the Jihad,

432
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,917
which will cleanse the Universe,

433
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,921
and bring us out of darkness.

434
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,035
<i>House Atreides took control of Arrakis</i>

435
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,414
<i>63 standard days into the year 10191 .</i>

436
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,750
<i>It was known that the Harkonnens,</i>

437
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,543
<i>the former rulers of Arrakis</i>

438
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,338
<i>would leave many suicide troops behind.</i>

439
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,634
<i>Atreides' patrols were doubled.</i>

440
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,438
Duncan!

441
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,569
What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan?

442
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,904
Tell me.

443
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,281
Why haven't we heard from you?

444
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,658
My lord,

445
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,576
I suspect so much.

446
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,705
I think they are the allies we seek.

447
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,582
They are strong, fierce.

448
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,502
They do not give their loyalty easily or quickly.

449
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,338
As you know, the Imperium has never

450
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,548
been able to take a census of the Fremen.

451
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,759
Everyone thinks that there are but few

452
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,886
wandering here and there in the desert.

453
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,596
My lord,

454
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,642
I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet.

455
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,437
That the Fremen exist in vast numbers.

456
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,773
Vast.

457
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,361
And it is they who control Arrakis.

458
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,036
<i>Each trooper will be charged</i>

459
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,539
<i>with responsibility for preserving water.</i>

460
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,666
<i>Our existence as an operating army</i>

461
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,794
<i>depends on these following water-saving procedures.</i>

462
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,380
<i>Remember, water is life.</i>

463
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,637
Why is the shield not yet up?

464
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,141
Sir, we found and removed another sabotage device.

465
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,059
I think it'll go up now, sir.

466
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,026
They're finding these sabotage devices too easily.

467
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,581
<i>House shields activated.</i>

468
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,506
<i>Duke Leto is now here.</i>

469
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,092
<i>Spice mining inspection to start immediately.</i>

470
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,820
So you are Doctor Kynes.

471
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,114
The Judge of the Change.

472
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,367
And the imperial Ecologist, Sire.

473
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,327
Our intelligence informs us

474
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,205
that there's still a strong Harkonnen presence.

475
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,749
The process of removal continues.

476
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,460
This is my son, Paul.

477
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:15,962
Are you a Fremen?

478
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,173
I've been on Arrakis in the service of the Emperor

479
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,300
long enough for my eyes to change.

480
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,594
<i>In the service of the Emperor.</i>

481
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,388
We are in your hands, Doctor.

482
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,182
Your gift of the stillsuits is much appreciated.

483
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,102
Will you give us an explanation of their workings?

484
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,688
Well, this is a still suit of Fremen manufacture,

485
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,607
the most efficient type on Arrakis.

486
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,733
Basically...

487
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,406
It's all right, Gurney.

488
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,200
Yes, Sire.

489
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,661
Basically,

490
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,788
it's a high-efficiency filter,

491
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,623
and heat exchange system.

492
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,876
Perspiration passes through the first layer

493
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
and is gathered in the second.

494
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,673
The salt is separated.

495
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,343
Breathing and walking provide the pumping action.

496
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,556
The reclaimed water circulates to catch pockets

497
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,890
from which you can drink

498
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,227
through this tube around your neck.

499
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,398
Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads.

500
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,734
Should you be in the open desert,

501
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,821
remember to breathe in through your mouth

502
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,490
and out through this nose tube.

503
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,201
With a Fremen suit in good working condition,

504
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,620
life can be sustained for weeks,

505
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,415
even in the deep desert, Sire.

506
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,543
My thanks.

507
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,045
With your permission.

508
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,425
You've worn a stillsuit before.

509
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,801
No.

510
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,554
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.

511
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,264
Who told you how to do that?

512
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,057
No one.

513
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,727
It seemed the proper way.

514
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,315
That it is.

515
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>He shall know your ways as if born to them.</i>

516
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,906
We're wasting time, Sire.

517
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,591
That language?
Translate it.

518
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,596
Very faint.

519
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,102
Harkonnen!

520
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
<i>Air speed, zero-five.</i>

521
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,615
<i>Ambient temperature, 300 degrees Kelvin.</i>

522
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368
<i>Air speed, three-zero.</i>

523
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,958
<i>...35% percent efficiency.</i>

524
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,049
That's where I told your sandmaster

525
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,717
to concentrate the harvesting today.

526
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,137
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

527
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,935
<i>Ambient temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.</i>

528
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,522
<i>Air speed, one-three-zero.</i>

529
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,777
<i>Caution.
You've now cleared protective Shield Wall</i>

530
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,405
<i>and entered open desert.</i>

531
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,957
Will we see a worm?

532
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,669
Where there is spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

533
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,962
Always?

534
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,171
Always.

535
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,507
Why do they come?

536
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,552
To protect their territory.

537
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,096
Vibrations attract them.

538
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,849
<i>He must be a Fremen or in with them.</i>

539
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,351
<i>He's studying us.</i>

540
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,979
<i>He's hiding something about the spice.</i>

541
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,357
Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?

542
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,530
As I said, they defend the spice sands.

543
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,743
As to their relationship with the spice,

544
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,370
who knows?

545
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,930
<i>My message, it's here.</i>

546
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,020
There are more enemy bodies coming in

547
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,564
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

548
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,737
Are you all right?

549
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,530
Yes, I'm fine.

550
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,658
Thank you, Thufir.

551
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,372
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

552
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,290
That's it. Spice mining.

553
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,585
No other cloud quite like it.

554
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,590
Wormsign?

555
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,133
<i>Is it wormsign?</i>

556
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,594
<i>Yes. Worm. Big one.</i>

557
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,764
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?

558
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,978
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

559
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,939
<i>Who calls Pad Nine?</i>

560
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,148
Don't mention the Duke.

561
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,359
This is an un-coded channel.

562
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,861
Unlisted flight northeast of you.

563
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,905
Wormsign on intercept course.

564
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,908
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

565
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,619
<i>Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.</i>

566
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,955
<i>Contact in 16 minutes minus.</i>

567
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,124
<i>Very precise estimate.</i>

568
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,834
<i>Who's on that unlisted flight?</i>

569
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,921
What happens now?

570
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,047
The carryall will come

571
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,466
and lift off the spice harvester.

572
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,636
Try to get in close over the harvester.

573
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,180
You'll find this interesting, Sire.

574
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,391
They work until the very last minute.

575
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,436
Spotter control,
there's no sign of the carryall.

576
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,146
It isn't answering.

577
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,232
The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

578
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,818
<i>Spotter control,
give me a report by the numbers.</i>

579
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,069
<i>Report One.</i>

580
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,154
<i>No contact.</i>

581
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,405
<i>Report two.</i>

582
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,698
<i>Negative.</i>

583
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,741
<i>Report Three.</i>

584
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,867
<i>Negative, Sire.</i>

585
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:19,909
<i>Report four.</i>

586
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,245
<i>No contact.
Repeat, no contact.</i>

587
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,205
I think they've got our carryall.

588
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,624
Damn it! Harkonnens.

589
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,252
We're coming down to take you off the harvester.

590
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,296
All spotters are ordered to comply.

591
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,672
Ordered by whom?

592
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,215
Duke Leto Atreides.

593
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,426
<i>Yes. Yes, Sire.</i>

594
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,761
How many men do you have?

595
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,429
<i>Full crew, 26 men.</i>

596
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,015
But, Sire, we can't leave all this spice.

597
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,433
Damn the spice!

598
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,809
Get out of there!

599
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,446
Two men in each of the spotters!

600
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,114
You, over here!

601
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,034
Run! Run!

602
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,793
I can't see him yet, but he is very close now.

603
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,129
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

604
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,089
Come on, boys.
Come on.

605
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,887
We're going to
be heavy, Sire.

606
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,972
<i>Spice.</i>

607
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,227
<i>Pure unrefined spice.</i>

608
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,944
Here he is!
We've got to go!

609
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,413
Bless the Maker and his water.

610
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,165
Bless the coming and going of Him.

611
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,917
May His passing cleanse the world.

612
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,086
What's that you're saying?

613
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,462
Nothing.

614
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,917
Gods, what a monster.

615
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,929
Someone is going to pay for this, I promise.

616
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,102
<i>He's more concerned over his men than the spice.</i>

617
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,440
<i>I must admit, against all better judgment,</i>

618
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,901
<i>I like this Duke.</i>

619
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,909
My lady, the local people,

620
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,703
the maids and servants, await your inspection.

621
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,039
Hawat has cleared them.

622
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,961
Excuse me, my lady.

623
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,966
The Harkonnens may have tampered with them medically.

624
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,310
When you said Harkonnens,

625
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:19,065
I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them.

626
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,237
Well, my wife...

627
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,283
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

628
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,578
The Har...

629
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,580
Forgive me.

630
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,457
<i>They must have killed her.</i>

631
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,086
Please excuse me if I can't talk about it.

632
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:48,761
<i>He's holding something back.
Yet.</i>

633
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,223
<i>There's the Imperial conditioning.</i>

634
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,727
<i>Assurance of trust.</i>

635
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,862
<i>The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.</i>

636
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,448
<i>Where is your son?</i>

637
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,994
<i>I must warn you.
You are in great danger.</i>

638
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,290
<i>Safe.</i>

639
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,224
<i>Spice.</i>

640
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,912
<i>What is it doing to me?</i>

641
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,509
<i>Second moon.</i>

642
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,846
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

643
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,015
<i>Am I the one?</i>

644
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,864
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>

645
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,325
<i>It can't get me if I don't move.</i>

646
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,745
<i>It's too dark in here for it to see clearly.</i>

647
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,472
<i>I've got to try to grab it.</i>

648
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,101
<i>The suspensor field
will make it slippery on the bottom.</i>

649
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,228
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>

650
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,566
<i>Who is operating that thing?</i>

651
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,569
<i>It has to be someone in the palace.</i>

652
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,821
<i>I could shout for help,</i>

653
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,073
<i>but it would kill whoever opened the door.</i>

654
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,302
<i>Hold still.</i>

655
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,494
It would have killed me.

656
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,041
I was its target.
It went to the motion.

657
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:07,418
Who are you?

658
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,587
I am the Shadout Mapes,

659
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,215
the housekeeper.

660
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,135
I must cleanse the way between us.

661
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,973
You saved my life,
and we Fremen pay our debts.

662
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,600
<i>A Fremen.</i>

663
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,727
It is known to us

664
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,146
that you've a traitor in your midst.

665
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,523
Who it is,
we cannot say.

666
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,235
But we are certain of it.

667
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,829
A traitor.

668
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,219
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

669
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,354
Harkonnen.

670
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,568
<i>They've tried to take the life of my son.</i>

671
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,909
Sector 6 through 80 progress reports, Sire.

672
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,703
Take it, Thufir.

673
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,792
Sector 680, copy the 6th,
the summit, the 8th, quadrant over,

674
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,962
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave the 80 and call the 4th.
Copy.

675
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:42,179
8. Thufir Hawat, Mentat, Master of assassins.

676
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,935
Uh, the palace is now secure.

677
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,106
The city of Arrakeen is under martial law.

678
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,610
We have troops here headquartered underground

679
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,238
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

680
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,782
The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen,

681
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,035
and we have some on the airfield.

682
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,705
Our new army is still in training, but everything,

683
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,415
everything is shielded.

684
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,626
And with this shielding we are impenetrable.

685
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Sleep well, my son.

686
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,570
Um, Father,

687
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,782
drugged.

688
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,125
<i>Jessica, what is wrong?</i>

689
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,961
<i>Forgive me, my beloved concubine.</i>

690
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,630
<i>I should have married you.</i>

691
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,092
<i>Why hold a dream to ascend to the throne</i>

692
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,136
<i>through a political marriage?</i>

693
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,140
<i>I should have married you.</i>

694
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,374
What happened?

695
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,023
Yueh!

696
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,066
<i>He sabotaged the house generators.</i>

697
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,943
<i>We are wide open!</i>

698
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,658
<i>House shield deactivating.</i>

699
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,204
I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules.

700
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,664
I've brought House Atreides down.

701
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,999
Why?

702
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,920
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.

703
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,380
You were already dead.

704
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,091
But you'll get close to the Baron before you die.

705
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,803
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

706
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,264
You can still attack!

707
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,226
When you see the Baron,

708
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,270
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

709
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,942
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

710
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,447
One bite on this tooth and a strong exhale...

711
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,741
Refuse.

712
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,992
No! You mustn't!

713
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,495
Because, in return,

714
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:37,998
I'll save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

715
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,505
For Paul.

716
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,094
Ahhh!

717
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,815
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

718
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,527
The tooth! The tooth!

719
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,282
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

720
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,077
Open the doors!

721
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,288
Signals!

722
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,000
Get that shield up!

723
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,086
The shield! The shield!

724
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,863
<i>The weirding modules!
Destroyed!</i>

725
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,498
Long live Duke Leto!

726
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,564
The drug was timed.

727
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:13,278
Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.

728
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,992
What a pity you must remain gagged.

729
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,454
We can't let ourselves be swayed

730
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,790
by your witch's voice, now, can we?

731
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,377
<i>Leto, where are you?</i>

732
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,756
<i>How simple to subdue us.</i>

733
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,980
Goodbye, Jessica.

734
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,983
And goodbye to your sweet son.

735
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,737
I want to spit once on your head.

736
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,698
Just some spittle in your face.

737
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,995
What a luxury!

738
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,170
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

739
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,260
<i>I wish this was Paul.</i>

740
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,643
I knew Yueh's wife.

741
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,941
I was the one who broke his Imperial conditioning.

742
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,324
I've thought of many pleasures with you.

743
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,703
It is perhaps better that you die

744
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,955
in the innards of a worm.

745
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,552
What are your orders, Piter?

746
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:04,056
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

747
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,059
The worms will destroy the evidence.

748
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,895
Their bodies must never be found.

749
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,828
They're down on this floor somewhere.

750
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:26,995
Down there.

751
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,183
Duncan!

752
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,022
Get off!

753
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,904
You wish now to join your wife?

754
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,948
Is that it, traitor?

755
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,534
She lives?

756
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,160
You wish to join her?

757
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,541
Join her, then.

758
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,093
You think you've defeated me?

759
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:30,392
You think I don't know what I've gained, for my wife!

760
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,817
Take him away.

761
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,841
<i>Yueh's sign.</i>

762
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,263
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>

763
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,149
Don't touch my mother!

764
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,068
<i>He's trying the Voice.</i>

765
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,278
<i>The Reverend Mother said it could save him.</i>

766
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,114
Did you hear a noise from the little one, huh?

767
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,159
No, I didn't hear anything.

768
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,206
The little one.

769
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,388
Remove her gag.

770
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,139
Excellent!

771
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,784
There's no need to fight over me.

772
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,963
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>

773
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:37,436
First cut my son's bonds.

774
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,611
That's it.

775
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,043
Oh, my God.

776
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,430
<i>It's under control.</i>

777
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:46,046
Duke Leto Atreides.

778
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,636
Where is the ducal signet ring?

779
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,515
I must have his ring.

780
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
The ring!

781
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,817
He was brought to us as is, my lord Baron.

782
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,404
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

783
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,034
<i>The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?</i>

784
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,870
<i>Paul and Jessica safe.</i>

785
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,581
Yes. The tooth!

786
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,875
He's coming around, Baron.

787
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,544
Where's your ring?

788
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,712
Huh?

789
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,090
You do not answer?

790
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,592
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

791
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,428
<i>You must come closer.</i>

792
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,724
The water of my life

793
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,395
for Paul.

794
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,149
He's crying.
He's crying!

795
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,110
What does that mean, Piter?

796
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,574
<i>Come closer, Baron.</i>

797
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,581
No!

798
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,584
<i>Jessica!</i>

799
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,879
Leto!

800
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,090
Leto, he's dead!

801
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,092
No, he's dead!

802
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,469
I know.

803
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,937
Am I alive?

804
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,024
I'm alive?

805
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,150
Yes,

806
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,445
you're alive, my Baron.

807
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,031
I'm alive, eh?

808
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,408
I'm alive!

809
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,285
I'm alive!

810
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,037
I'm alive!

811
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,131
I can't maintain any altitude.

812
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,009
We'll never reach the safety of rock!

813
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,015
Maybe that small rock.

814
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,309
Where are we, do you think?

815
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,228
The south polar regions.

816
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,148
The forbidden area.
Hold on.

817
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,492
Hurry!

818
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,205
Take the stillsuits!

819
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,250
Hurry!

820
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,293
This crash might bring a worm.

821
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,758
The signet.

822
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,719
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh!

823
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,203
<i>Where are my feelings?</i>

824
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,497
<i>I feel for no one.</i>

825
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,712
<i>The second moon.</i>

826
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,689
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

827
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,400
<i>We want him killed.</i>

828
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,402
<i>Why?</i>

829
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,904
<i>Why do they want me killed?</i>

830
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,866
<i>It has to be something to do with the spice.</i>

831
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,076
<i>But what?</i>

832
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:55,170
<i>He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!</i>

833
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:05,638
<i>This moon holds my future.</i>

834
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,113
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

835
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:29,329
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

836
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,048
<i>They will call me,</i>

837
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,008
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

838
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,560
Listen to me. Listen!

839
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,855
You wanted to know about my dreams.

840
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,359
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

841
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,613
Do you know why?
The spice!

842
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,408
It's in everything here.

843
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,576
Calm yourself.

844
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,662
Like the Truthsayer drug.

845
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,748
It's a poison.

846
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,669
You knew the spice would change me.

847
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,838
But thanks to your teachings,

848
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,257
it's changing my consciousness.

849
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,009
I see it!
I can see it!

850
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,345
<i>Is he the one?</i>

851
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,224
You carry my unborn sister in your womb.

852
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,892
<i>He knows.</i>

853
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,530
Father!

854
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,704
<i>Father, I promise,</i>

855
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,582
<i>one day the sleeper will awaken.</i>

856
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,960
<i>And I will avenge your death.</i>

857
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,422
<i>I will not stop until I destroy</i>

858
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,674
<i>the Emperor and the Baron.</i>

859
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,431
Father.

860
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,865
Go now.

861
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,996
Take him to his desert to die.

862
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,416
Go.

863
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,575
<i>Yueh's left the plan for the weirding modules.</i>

864
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,589
We have to get to that mountain of rock.

865
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,509
We have entered the time

866
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,220
when all will turn against us and seek our lives.

867
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,154
It's further than I thought.

868
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,324
A worm is sure to come.

869
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,496
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

870
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,403
Remember,
walk without rhythm,

871
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,946
and we won't attract a worm.

872
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,073
It will go to the thumper.

873
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,910
I'm ready.

874
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,912
Faster!

875
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,415
It's deafening!

876
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:39,991
Ooh!

877
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,786
<i>The spice!</i>

878
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,165
Do you smell it?

879
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,332
Yes!

880
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:56,758
Paul!

881
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,371
<i>A thumper.</i>

882
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,216
<i>The worm! Spice!</i>

883
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,009
<i>Is there a relationship?</i>

884
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,235
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

885
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,489
Someone started another thumper.

886
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,868
We're not alone.

887
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,525
Man-carved steps.

888
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,943
Yes.

889
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,959
<i>Such stealth.</i>

890
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,711
<i>I didn't hear them.</i>

891
01:26:56,795 --> 01:27:00,214
Perhaps these are the ones the Shadout Mapes told us of.

892
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,966
I will take the boy-man.

893
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,094
He shall have sanctuary in my tribe.

894
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,149
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

895
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,028
Great Gods!

896
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,156
If you can do this to the strongest of us,

897
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:29,201
you're worth 10 times your weight of water.

898
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,999
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

899
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,502
Teach us this weirding way,

900
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,756
and you both shall have sanctuary.

901
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,676
Your water shall mingle with our water.

902
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:48,638
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

903
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,479
I give you the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.

904
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,981
It is the legend.

905
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,531
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

906
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,203
I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe.

907
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:15,164
<i>From my dreams.</i>

908
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,125
<i>So beautiful.</i>

909
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,211
Come with me.

910
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,380
I'll show you an easier way down.

911
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,067
You have strength.

912
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,820
You shall be known as Usul,

913
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,781
which is the strength of the base of the pillar.

914
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,742
This is your secret name in our troop.

915
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,538
But you must choose the name of manhood,

916
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,915
which we will call you openly.

917
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,838
What do you call the mouse shadow
in the second moon?

918
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,760
We call that one Muad'Dib.

919
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,556
Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

920
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,600
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

921
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,230
And your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.

922
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,733
We welcome you.

923
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,778
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>

924
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:50,009
Moisture!

925
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,594
Wind traps.

926
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:53,971
Huge ones.

927
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:09,528
<i>Water.
Millions of decaliters.</i>

928
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,655
A treasure.

929
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,116
Greater than treasure, Usul.

930
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,870
We have thousands of such caches,

931
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,124
and only a few of us know them all.

932
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,002
And when we have enough,

933
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:29,006
we shall change the face of Arrakis.

934
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,945
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

935
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,742
<i>Tell me of your home world, Usul.</i>

936
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:33,320
Arrakis!

937
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:36,949
Rabban! Rabban!

938
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,412
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!

939
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,040
We've gutted them!
We've gutted them!

940
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,214
Rabban! Rabban!

941
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,302
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

942
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:59,263
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

943
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:04,185
I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze!

944
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:07,104
Give me spice!
Drive them!

945
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,565
Drive them into utter submission!

946
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,443
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

947
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:15,613
Never stop! Go! Go!

948
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:16,864
Show no mercy!

949
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,115
Yes, Baron!

950
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,095
Feyd.

951
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,944
And when we've crushed these people enough,

952
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:59,657
I'll send you. Feyd.

953
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,913
Lovely Feyd.

954
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,838
Where's my doctor?

955
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,138
<i>Jessica,</i>

956
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:27,059
<i>our Reverend Mother is too old.</i>

957
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,646
<i>She has been calling through space and time,</i>

958
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,898
<i>for you to come and let her rest.</i>

959
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:37,236
<i>She asks that you pass within,</i>

960
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,155
<i>and become our Reverend Mother.</i>

961
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,869
If you be a Reverend Mother,

962
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,792
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

963
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,589
<i>The Water of Life.</i>

964
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,721
<i>But what of my unborn child?</i>

965
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:08,392
<i>One day, I will have to do this.</i>

966
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,494
<i>Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,</i>

967
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,080
<i>the old Reverend Mother surrendered her life</i>

968
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,416
<i>as she surrendered her knowledge.</i>

969
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,088
<i>Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.</i>

970
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,176
<i>Every man who has tried has died.</i>

971
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,220
<i>Am I the one?</i>

972
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,766
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

973
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:55,230
<i>The tremendous power of the Water of Life</i>

974
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:59,360
<i>caused the premature birth of Jessica's daughter, Alia.</i>

975
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,570
<i>Alia was born with all the knowledge</i>

976
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,655
<i>and powers of a Reverend Mother.</i>

977
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,633
Feyd, even though he's aging,

978
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,136
Thufir is one of the finest Mentats in the Universe.

979
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:30,808
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

980
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,479
Try it now.

981
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,563
I will.

982
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:37,648
Come.

983
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,205
Oh, Thufir!

984
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,834
I see they've installed your heart plug already.

985
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:00,796
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

986
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,757
But this is not why we're here.

987
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,803
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

988
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,348
You must care for it if you wish to live.

989
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,854
A poison has been introduced into your body, Thufir Hawat.

990
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:21,275
By milking this, this smooth, little cat body,

991
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,360
you receive your antidote.

992
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,696
It must be done each day.

993
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:33,787
All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill.

994
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:37,458
Feyd, no, no.

995
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,044
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

996
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,047
Aren't you, Thufir?

997
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:48,010
<i>My Duke, how I've failed you.</i>

998
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,155
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>

999
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,742
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

1000
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,436
<i>The Holy Warriors.</i>

1001
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:42,981
<i>No one ever dreamed there were so many.</i>

1002
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:48,946
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1003
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,035
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

1004
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,829
are once again in control of Arrakis,

1005
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,124
Stilgar, your leader,

1006
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,460
has asked me and my mother to teach you

1007
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,921
the weirding way to crush the Harkonnens.

1008
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:09,591
We must do more than this.

1009
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:14,179
We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.

1010
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:19,351
The Guild and the entire Universe depends on spice.

1011
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,814
He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing.

1012
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,943
I will take 100 of your warriors and train them.

1013
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,321
This 100 will train the thousands that remain.

1014
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:34,825
When the spice flow stops,

1015
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,536
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1016
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,122
The Baron and the Emperor himself

1017
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,040
will be forced to deal with us.

1018
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:49,715
Arrakis will become the center of the Universe.

1019
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:53,176
Orato!

1020
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,726
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

1021
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:03,687
Kick it.

1022
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,612
Hit it.

1023
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,160
Yell at it.

1024
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,459
Break!

1025
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,297
Korba, cut it.

1026
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,686
Move back.

1027
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,884
This is part of the weirding way

1028
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,511
that we will teach you.

1029
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:23,600
Some thoughts have a certain sound,

1030
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,770
that being the equivalent to a form.

1031
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,523
Through sound and motion,

1032
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:34,069
you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones,

1033
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:38,782
set fires, suffocate an enemy, or burst his organs.

1034
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,450
We will kill

1035
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:43,537
until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

1036
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,081
Muad'Dib!

1037
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,128
Chaaksa.

1038
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,801
Stilgar.

1039
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,722
Muad'Dib.

1040
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:02,806
Hmm?

1041
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,851
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1042
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,649
<i>My name is a killing word.</i>

1043
01:41:13,735 --> 01:41:15,318
<i>They are ready to fight.</i>

1044
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,987
<i>Yet in order to lead them,</i>

1045
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,699
<i>I must conquer the worm, conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>

1046
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,086
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch,

1047
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,089
and ride as a leader of men.

1048
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,691
Shai-Hulud.

1049
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,401
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

1050
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,704
<i>Only the very strong ones travel this deep.</i>

1051
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:52,916
Usul has called a big one!

1052
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,086
Again, it is the legend.

1053
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,102
Muad'Dib!

1054
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:12,472
Usul, these are 15 of our finest warriors

1055
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,976
to serve you as your guard.

1056
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,399
The Fedaykin.

1057
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:37,372
Now.

1058
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:07,152
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>

1059
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,696
<i>The Baron and the Emperor himself</i>

1060
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,406
<i>will be forced to deal with us.</i>

1061
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:17,912
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1062
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:19,873
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.

1063
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,499
What happened?
Muad'Dib.

1064
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,543
What happened to you and your men?

1065
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:24,919
Muad'Dib!

1066
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:26,713
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1067
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,214
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1068
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,924
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1069
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:35,472
<i>He's been repeating that name ever since we found him.</i>

1070
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:39,559
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1071
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:49,069
<i>In the two standard years that followed,</i>

1072
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,528
<i>Muad'Dib and the Fremen</i>

1073
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:53,615
<i>brought spice production to a standstill.</i>

1074
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,701
<i>Fearing for his life, Rabban did his best</i>

1075
01:46:56,786 --> 01:47:00,038
<i>to hide this fact from his uncle, the Baron.</i>

1076
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:10,090
<i>Paul's sister Alia matured at a frightening rate.</i>

1077
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:13,510
<i>Her small body harbored tremendous powers.</i>

1078
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:17,138
<i>Paul and Chani's love grew.</i>

1079
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,270
We surprised a band of smugglers.

1080
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,523
Too bad.
I thought they were Harkonnen.

1081
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:40,203
Gurney!

1082
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,459
You've no need of your weapons with me, Gurney Halleck.

1083
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,211
Paul.

1084
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,339
Paul!

1085
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,091
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1086
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,926
They said you were dead.

1087
01:47:57,555 --> 01:47:58,555
They...

1088
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,515
They said...

1089
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:08,273
Gurney! Gurney! Gurney!
You young pup!

1090
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:09,315
Gurney!

1091
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,400
You young pup!

1092
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,794
<i>Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>

1093
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:31,754
<i>you have one last chance</i>

1094
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:33,840
<i>to take matters into your own hands,</i>

1095
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:37,260
<i>and bring the situation under control on Arrakis.</i>

1096
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,553
What do you mean, one last...

1097
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:39,846
<i>Silence.
Do not speak.</i>

1098
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:43,808
<i>Listen.
You do not have more than this one chance.</i>

1099
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,686
<i>I represent the entire Guild in this matter.</i>

1100
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:48,688
<i>Our navigators warn you</i>

1101
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:51,316
<i>that spice production is in great danger.</i>

1102
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,401
<i>A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,</i>

1103
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:55,820
<i>has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.</i>

1104
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:59,407
<i>Our navigators suggest he is not of Arrakis.</i>

1105
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:02,243
<i>No one on the outside world has been able to see him.</i>

1106
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,621
<i>We do not know who he is.</i>

1107
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,956
<i>The Harkonnens cannot stop him.</i>

1108
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:11,377
<i>Remedy this situation, restore spice production,</i>

1109
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:14,464
<i>or you'll live out your life in a pain amplifier.</i>

1110
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:23,932
<i>The Emperor will stop him.</i>

1111
01:49:24,016 --> 01:49:25,975
<i>He won't take the Water of Life.</i>

1112
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,978
<i>That's why they want me killed.</i>

1113
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,481
<i>They're afraid I'll take the Water of Life.</i>

1114
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:36,110
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once!

1115
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,071
50 legions?

1116
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,822
That's our entire reserves as well.

1117
01:49:39,907 --> 01:49:41,157
This is genocide,

1118
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,284
the deliberate and systematic destruction

1119
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,703
of all life on Arrakis!

1120
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:50,792
<i>The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!</i>

1121
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:57,340
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

1122
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,467
Oh, Chani.

1123
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:03,012
All the images of my future are gone.

1124
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,017
I have to drink the Water of Life.

1125
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,687
No, Paul, please.

1126
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:12,897
I've seen the men who have tried.

1127
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,774
I've seen how they died.

1128
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:18,695
I'm dead to everyone unless I try to become what I may be.

1129
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:24,200
Only the Water of Life will free what can save us.

1130
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,834
I must drink the sacred water.

1131
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,714
<i>I must go now.</i>

1132
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:35,938
Hurry.
All I see is darkness.

1133
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:37,940
Paul.

1134
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:45,114
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

1135
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:56,584
You are my life.

1136
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:05,218
<i>Many men have tried.</i>

1137
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:07,845
<i>They tried and failed?</i>

1138
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:09,639
<i>They tried and died.</i>

1139
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:20,233
<i>The worm is the spice.</i>

1140
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,235
<i>The spice is the worm.</i>

1141
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:44,507
<i>The worms.</i>

1142
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,484
<i>They're not attacking.
Why?</i>

1143
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:23,546
Alia.

1144
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:26,340
Mother.

1145
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,219
It's Paul.

1146
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,475
He's taken the Water of Life.

1147
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,906
<i>There is a place, terrifying to us,</i>

1148
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:51,741
<i>to women.</i>

1149
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:54,744
<i>This is the place they cannot look.</i>

1150
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,795
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

1151
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:09,008
<i>Now I truly control the worm</i>

1152
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,053
<i>and the spice.</i>

1153
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:17,433
<i>And I have the power to destroy the spice forever!</i>

1154
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:48,839
Paul.

1155
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:51,133
Paul.

1156
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:02,436
Father!

1157
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,024
Father!

1158
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:10,486
The sleeper has awakened!

1159
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:21,122
Muad'Dib.

1160
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,508
Arrakis, Dune,

1161
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:35,803
Desert Planet.

1162
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,557
Your time has come.

1163
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,184
A storm is coming.

1164
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,520
Our storm.

1165
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:49,317
And when it arrives, it will shake the Universe.

1166
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:55,489
Emperor, we come for you!

1167
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:59,160
We come for you!

1168
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:16,636
Long live the fighters!

1169
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,972
Long live the fighters!

1170
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,838
<i>Suspicion confirmed.</i>

1171
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,924
<i>The Emperor's had Rabban seized.</i>

1172
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:40,761
Gurney, when the storm hits, set off the atomics.

1173
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,890
I want an opening through the entire shield wall.

1174
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:49,270
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1175
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:53,858
Usul, we have wormsign,

1176
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,485
the likes of which even God has never seen.

1177
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:56,962
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron.

1178
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:15,064
Why have you brought me here?

1179
01:59:15,232 --> 01:59:18,734
Your Highness, there must be some mistake.

1180
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:20,986
I never requested your presence.

1181
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:22,238
Ah.

1182
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:25,074
But your lack of action demanded it.

1183
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,535
Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgment

1184
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:30,704
in assigning to Rabban the governorship.

1185
01:59:31,122 --> 01:59:32,331
You've forced me to come here

1186
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,000
and set things straight, personally.

1187
01:59:45,262 --> 01:59:49,223
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1188
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,642
Poor Emperor.

1189
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:55,938
I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you.

1190
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,147
Silence!

1191
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,441
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.

1192
01:59:59,651 --> 02:00:01,652
Kill her. Kill her.

1193
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:04,738
Get out of my mind!

1194
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:07,449
Not until you tell them both

1195
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:10,578
who I really am.

1196
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:13,455
Alia,

1197
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,794
daughter of Duke Leto the Just,

1198
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:22,298
and the royal
Lady Jessica.

1199
02:00:22,799 --> 02:00:24,008
Sister

1200
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:28,679
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1201
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:32,600
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1202
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,481
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1203
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:47,489
<i>With the storm, their air power will be useless.</i>

1204
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:51,035
<i>On Arrakis, it's desert power.</i>

1205
02:00:51,328 --> 02:00:52,328
Gurney.

1206
02:00:54,122 --> 02:00:55,122
Now!

1207
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:56,332
Atomics!

1208
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:37,039
My brother is coming with many Fremen warriors.

1209
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,750
Impossible!

1210
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,961
Not impossible.

1211
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:45,339
I told you.
He is here now.

1212
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:55,432
<i>Father, today I will avenge your death.</i>

1213
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:19,164
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm has descended.</i>

1214
02:02:19,165 --> 02:02:22,251
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm has descended.</i>

1215
02:02:22,377 --> 02:02:25,462
<i>The Shield Wall has been penetrated by atomics.</i>

1216
02:02:27,215 --> 02:02:28,549
Release the Sardaukar.

1217
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:33,554
Baron, give this little abomination to the storm.

1218
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:37,099
<i>Wait for my brother, Baron.</i>

1219
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:25,606
Chaa!

1220
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,037
Cha.

1221
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:26,083
<i>Wait for my brother.</i>

1222
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:33,924
Cha!

1223
02:04:34,008 --> 02:04:35,467
Cha!

1224
02:04:39,848 --> 02:04:41,974
Muad'Dib!

1225
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:24,474
Eee-sah!

1226
02:05:26,186 --> 02:05:28,270
Eee-sah!

1227
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:33,066
Cha!

1228
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,323
<i>Alia, now.</i>

1229
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:41,116
<i>Come to me, Baron.</i>

1230
02:06:55,358 --> 02:06:57,025
Muad'Dib!

1231
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,905
<i>Feyd Rautha.</i>

1232
02:07:44,073 --> 02:07:46,742
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1233
02:07:46,826 --> 02:07:48,702
there are Guild Heighliners above us,

1234
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:51,246
containing many Great Houses of the Landsraad.

1235
02:07:51,456 --> 02:07:52,831
Send them back.

1236
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:54,833
How dare you speak to me in...

1237
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:56,793
<i>Stop your speaking.</i>

1238
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:00,964
You have some idea of what I could do.

1239
02:08:04,135 --> 02:08:07,012
Don't try your powers on me.

1240
02:08:08,139 --> 02:08:10,432
Try looking into that place where you dare not look.

1241
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:12,517
You'll find me there staring back at you.

1242
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:14,102
You mustn't speak...

1243
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:15,354
Silence!

1244
02:08:18,733 --> 02:08:20,567
I remember your gom jabbar.

1245
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,403
Now you'll remember mine.

1246
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,280
I can kill with a word.

1247
02:08:27,784 --> 02:08:30,744
And his word shall carry death eternal

1248
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:33,205
to those who stand against the righteous.

1249
02:08:33,289 --> 02:08:34,706
The righteous?

1250
02:08:34,791 --> 02:08:36,750
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1251
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:43,423
Give the Harkonnen a blade, and let him stand forth.

1252
02:08:43,508 --> 02:08:44,633
If Feyd wishes,

1253
02:08:44,717 --> 02:08:47,052
he can meet you with my blade in his hand.

1254
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,387
I wish it.

1255
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:50,472
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1256
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:53,892
Let me. Please, my lord.

1257
02:08:54,227 --> 02:08:56,144
The Emperor's blade.

1258
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:29,428
Why prolong the inevitable?

1259
02:09:31,973 --> 02:09:33,348
I will kill you.

1260
02:09:49,157 --> 02:09:50,699
I will kill him!

1261
02:09:57,707 --> 02:09:58,707
Paul!

1262
02:10:00,126 --> 02:10:01,960
I will kill him!

1263
02:10:11,554 --> 02:10:15,182
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

1264
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:19,227
Will she deserve my special attentions?

1265
02:10:26,486 --> 02:10:27,611
<i>Poisoned.</i>

1266
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:33,658
You see your death.

1267
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:36,077
My blade will finish you.

1268
02:10:38,623 --> 02:10:41,917
<i>I will bend like a reed in the wind.</i>

1269
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:58,141
Chaaksa!

1270
02:11:06,192 --> 02:11:07,734
Muad'Dib.

1271
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:10,695
Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

1272
02:11:12,073 --> 02:11:14,950
<i>Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,</i>

1273
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,869
<i>fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.</i>

1274
02:11:18,454 --> 02:11:19,538
<i>Where there was war,</i>

1275
02:11:19,622 --> 02:11:22,040
<i>Muad'Dib would now bring peace.</i>

1276
02:11:22,375 --> 02:11:25,752
<i>Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,</i>

1277
02:11:26,254 --> 02:11:28,588
<i>to lead the people to true freedom,</i>

1278
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:32,467
<i>and to change the face of Arrakis.</i>

1279
02:11:35,972 --> 02:11:37,889
We Fremen have a saying.

1280
02:11:38,975 --> 02:11:41,977
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.

1281
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:46,106
One cannot go against the word of God.

1282
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,832
And how can this be?

1283
02:12:48,377 --> 02:12:51,796
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach.

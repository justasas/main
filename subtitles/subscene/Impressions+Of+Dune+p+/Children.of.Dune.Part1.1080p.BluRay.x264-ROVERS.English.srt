Edric of the Spacing Guild,

354
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:20,930
and to a new understanding between us.

355
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:24,555
Please allow me the honour
of presenting His Majesty

356
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,057
with a small token of our esteem.

358
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,526
According to our investigators,
this one was killed here on Arrakis.

359
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:49,306
The body recovered
after the unfortunate conflict

360
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,855
between Houses Atreides
and Harkonnen.

361
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:56,806
Terrible wounds required
many months of regrowth

362
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,265
by Tleilaxu technicians.

363
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:04,018
We acquired him
as a gift befitting an emperor.

364
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,432
What is your name, ghola?

365
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,518

366
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,724

And do you enjoy the name?

370
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,807

I know nothing of my past, Sire.

373
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:42,599
How was this one trained?

374
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,725
It amused the Tleilaxu
to train him as a Mentat.

375
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,725

376

379
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:05,225
Majesty, there is the matter
of Reverend Mother Mohiam.

380
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,392
She was removed from our heighliner
by your agents

381
00:31:08,393 --> 00:31:10,309
in violation of our neutrality.

382
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,642
Be careful, Ambassador.

383
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:15,017
To be neutral is to be indifferent.

384
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:16,976
You would do well
to disassociate yourself

385
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:19,193

386
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:25,517

my sister has the pulse of the court.

in such circumstances.

Do the cards answer all your questions?

392
00:31:56,478 --> 00:31:58,977
Answers only breed more questions.

393
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:02,438
What is important is how
one navigates between the two.

394
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,989
So you haven't forgotten
everything we taught you.

395

Has the Emperor explained
why I am to be detained?

396
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,019
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.

397
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,652

in light of the situation.

1
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,800
Arrakis.

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,320
Dune.

3
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
Wasteland of the Empire...

4
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
...and the most valuable planet
in the universe...

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,040
...because it is here,
and only here, where spice is found.

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,000
The spice.

7
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,560
Without it,
there is no commerce in the Empire.

8
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,960
There is no civilisation.

9
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
Arrakis.

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
Dune.

11
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Home of the spice.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,560
Greatest treasure in the universe.

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,360
And he who controls it,
controls our destiny.

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,480
Father!

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,360
Mentat engineers,
please report to fusion plants.

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,040
Life support technicians,
prepare for departure.

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
This move to Arrakis comes
at a delicate moment for House Atreides.

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,440
A test of your father's loyalty
to the Emperor.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
You must remember, Paul...

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,000
...our society is a tangled web
of competing forces.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,760
Our civilisation rests upon
a political tripod...

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,320
...a most unstable of structures.

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,800
A deceptive balance of power exists
between the Emperor...

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,000
...the Congress of Royal Houses, and
the supposedly impartial Spacing Guild...

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,240
...with its invulnerable monopoly
on interstellar transport.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Complicated by a feudal trading culture
that turns its...

27
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,160
Dr. Yueh would be disappointed.

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Then he'd know how I feel.

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
Attention.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Departure from Caladan airspace, 0-10:00.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,240
It's never easy leaving one's home, Paul.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,960
Think of this as a new adventure,
the adventure of a lifetime.

33
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
You call this an adventure:

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Leaving our home for some dry speck
of dust in the middle of nowhere?

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,520
You're a duke's son.

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
You have duties, responsibilities.

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
How could I ever forget?

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,000
Every day I have to eat responsibility
for breakfast and duty for dinner.

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
Sarcasm doesn't become you.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
I just want to see my father.

41
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
So do I.

42
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Attention.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,960
Departure from Caladan airspace, 0-10:00.

44
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,040
All Atreides personnel,
please prepare for departure.

45
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
The Reverend Mother has arrived.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,960
She wants to see you,
before we depart for Arrakis.

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,880
You have given him your face, Jessica.

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,520
But the father has given him his eyes.

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
And his courage.

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
We shall see.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Come here, boy.

52
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Let me have a better look at you.

53
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,480
If you know what's good for you,
you'll do as I say.

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll be the judge of what's good for me.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,720
Your mother has taught you many things,
I see.

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,880
She tells me you dream.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
Your Reverence...

58
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
- ...if I could...
- You're dismissed, Jessica.

59
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,480
Since when is it permitted to treat
the Lady Jessica as a common servant?

60
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,400
She was a common servant.

61
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,640
My servant.

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,160
And a good one, too...

63
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,680
...until she was 16,
and your father took her.

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Now, I would like to hear
about your dreams.

65
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,440
They're just dreams.

66
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
About what?

67
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,840
Why don't you tell me?

68
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Do you know what this is?

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,480
It is a test, young Atreides.

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,560
A test for what?

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Put your hand inside, and we'll see.

72
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
What's in it?

73
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Pain.

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,920
I hold the Gom Jabbar at your throat,
young Atreides.

75
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,720
Keep your hand in the box and live.

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Remove it and die.

77
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,520
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,200
That's right, boy.

79
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,840
Pray.

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,600
I will face my fear,
I will let it pass through me.

81
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,360
And when the fear is gone,
there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

82
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,320
No woman, child,
ever withstood that much pain.

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,720
You are a gifted boy, young Atreides...

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
...but you have much to learn.

85
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
He survived.

86
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
You should've warned me.

87
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
She was forbidden.

88
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,800
Paul.

90
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,320
You were supposed to have a daughter.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,040
You have hopelessly complicated matters.

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,880
An Atreides daughter could've been wed
to the Harkonnen heir.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,040
The feud between the houses
could've been ended.

94
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,640
My duke wanted a son.

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
You arrogant girl.

96
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,840
Putting his desires above our interests.

97
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
How dare you turn your back on
the centuries of our breeding programmes.

98
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,840
I'll pay for my mistakes.

99
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,120
And your son will pay it with you.

100
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
We'll do what we can.

101
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
He may be worth saving...

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
...but for the father, nothing.

103
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Good thing you don't play your baliset
as badly as you fight, Gurney-man.

104
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,280
It's too bad Duncan isn't here.

105
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,920
- Then I could get a real workout.
- Now you've done it.

106
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,480
Whoa, Gurney-man.

107
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,280
Never submit to anger.

108
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,160
Fast on defence, slow on the attack.

109
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,320
You forgot your first principle, Gurney.

110
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Not likely.

111
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Look down, lad.

112
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,400
Perhaps you'd like to sing soprano
next time I play.

113
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,480
Guess I'm just not in the mood today.

114
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
Not in the mood?

115
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Mood is a thing for cattle and women,
young pup.

116
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
Mood is not for fighting.

117
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,840
Even with the Weirding ways
your mother teaches you.

118
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,840
It's that old Bene Gesserit witch.

119
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
Something she said...

120
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,320
...or did.

121
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,000
The navigator is arriving.

122
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,840
Spacing Guild shuttle N-117
arriving central transportpart.

123
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,560
This zone is now restricted.

124
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,680
We'll be on our way to Arrakis soon.

125
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,960
It is said that they depend on the spice...

126
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
...and that without it, they can't navigate.

127
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,080
It is said.

128
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,200
They used to be human, didn't they?

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,640
Until the spice changed them.

130
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,040
I don't think anyone knows for sure.

131
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,800
I've never seen one.

132
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
No one has.

133
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,600
It's forbidden, Paul.

134
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,000
So don't endanger
our shipping privileges trying.

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
All non-Guild personnel,
please secure quarters.

136
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,840
Will Arrakis be as bad as they say, Thufir?

137
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,800
The storms, perhaps.

138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,320
They can eat the flesh off your bones
as you stand.

139
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,640
The only thing that doesn't fear
an Arrakis storm is the giant worm.

140
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
It's not worms I worry about.

141
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,840
Your father is a formidable man, Paul.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Even the Emperor fears him.

143
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
I'd sooner cast my fate with him
than trust anything...

144
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,840
...some Bene Gesserit hag said.

145
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,400
Why do you hate them?

146
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,920
The Bene Gesserits?

147
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,560
I don't hate them.

148
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,280
I don't trust them.

149
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
I am a Mentat.

150
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,560
I trust logic and statistics,
not mysticism and prophecy.

151
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
Attention. All Atreides personnel,
restriction to quarters now in effect.

152
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,520
Please prepare for departure.

153
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Spacing Guild navigator docking central
transport part. This zone is restricted.

154
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,440
Repeat.

155
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,040
Spacing Guild navigator docking central
transport part. This zone is restricted.

156
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
And so it begins.

157
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,840
The trap is set, the prey approaches.

158
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
A glorious winter is about to descend
on House Atreides and all its heirs.

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,520
The centuries of humiliation,
visited upon my family...

160
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,240
...will finally be avenged.

161
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,520
But Arrakis was mine!

162
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
Shut up, Rabban.

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,040
I did what you said, Uncle.

164
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,840
I made the people cower.

165
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,960
I crushed that vile planet.

166
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,440
He said "squeeze", brother, not "crush".

167
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,960
Rabban aspires to rule House Harkonnen
one day, Feyd.

168
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,360
And yet he can't even rule himself.

169
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Explain our plan, Mentat.

170
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,400
The plan is elegant and vicious, dear Baron.

171
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Of course it is.

172
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
I designed it.

173
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,080
In order for the Empire to survive,
the spice must flow.

174
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,080
But the production
has become inconsistent.

175
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,400
In his wisdom, the Emperor decided
only one man is honest enough...

176
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,280
...and loyal enough to be trusted with
restoring the spice production adequately.

177
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,640
Duke Leto Atreides.

178
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,400
Temporarily interrupting
80 years of Harkonnen rule...

179
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,880
...and all the profits that go with it.

180
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,920
I said "temporarily", you moron.

181
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,920
It doesn't take long for Duke Leto
to believe he has Arrakis...

182
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
...firmly under control.

183
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
And then,
at the moment of his greatest confidence...

184
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,200
The traitor strikes.

185
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,880
A traitor? Who?

186
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,080
That remains my little secret for now.

187
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,960
What about the other great houses?
They're sure to protest.

188
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,800
Perverting common wisdom, Nephew,
is a mark of all great conspiracies.

189
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,720
You see, Nephews,
a popular man arouses jealousy...

190
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,080
...and Duke Leto is a very popular man.

191
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,760
The other great houses
will be glad to get rid of him...

192
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,960
...even though they would never admit it.

193
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,120
The spice...

194
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,520
...will flow.

195
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,760
The Emperor will be pleased
and House Harkonnen...

196
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,240
...will be more powerful than ever.

197
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,200
Alone and vulnerable,
at the edge of the universe...

198
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,520
...valiant Duke Leto
will finally come face to face with fear.

199
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,280
When I'm through,
he won't know who to trust...

200
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,840
...not even that Bene Gesserit witch
he sleeps with.

201
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,880
They'll all be turning on one another
like rats in the flood.

202
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,360
By the time the traitor is fully revealed...

203
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,320
...the fate of Atreides
will already be sealed.

204
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,840
My son always says
you have a feline grace, Duncan.

205
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,080
I didn't want to startle you, Milord.

206
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,480
The latest emigration reports.

207
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,680
They fear our regime
will be as bad as the Harkonnens'.

208
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,000
We're losing too many.

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,760
Spice hunters, drivers, weather scanners,
dune men, we'll need.

210
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
Should I persuade some to stay?

211
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,160
No.

212
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,240
I have something more important
for you to do.

213
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,000
I want you to go into the desert.

214
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
The Fremen?

215
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm getting reports of hundreds,
perhaps thousands, in villages...

216
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,400
...what they call "sietches".

217
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,800
In the deep desert.

218
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,440
Beyond the mountains.

219
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,280
The Harkonnen sneered
at the desert people.

220
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,040
Hunted them for sport.

221
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,160
- I doubt they'll expect any better from us.
- Then we have to change that.

222
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,760
We're going to need allies here, Duncan.

223
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,720
I want you to seek out their leader...

224
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,080
...this Liet I keep hearing about.

225
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
A phantom.

226
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
He may not even exist.

227
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,240
He could even be many different men.

228
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,480
Find out.

229
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,120
Negotiate patience so I can demonstrate
our good intentions with deeds.

230
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,160
If I'm lucky, they will judge all of us by you.

231
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,880
You honour me, sir.

232
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,000
I am endangering you and I know it...

233
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
...but you're the only one
I can trust with this.

234
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,680
That's a dusty little garrison town.

235
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,040
A testament of the harsh climate
of the place.

236
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,320
What's he doing?

237
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Water seller, Milady.

238
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,600
You need never bother
with the likes of them.

239
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,280
The cistern at the palace
holds 50,000 gallons...

240
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,480
...and it's always kept full.

241
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,520
What's wrong with their eyes?

242
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,720
Those are Fremen, desert people.

243
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,240
It's the spice.

244
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,640
It's everywhere: the air, the food.

245
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,160
By the time a Fremen child is 12
his eyes have turned completely blue.

246
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,560
Guards everywhere.

247
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,440
We didn't have to live like this on Caladan.

248
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Family apartments are in the west wing.
The furniture is being brought up.

249
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,800
What is this for?

250
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,720
An old custom, I'm told.

251
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,040
Guests ceremoniously splash water
on the floor after washing their hands.

252
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,920
They save the squeezings.

253
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Demeaning custom.

254
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Idaho has prepared for us well, Milord.

255
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,840
Duncan?

256
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Where is Duncan? Can I see him?

257
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,000
I have him occupied on official business
for the moment.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
You must be patient.

259
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,760
I've assembled the general staff,
as you requested.

260
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,160
No, don't take it up there.

261
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,720
I want the coat of arms to hang here.

262
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,280
The first thing visitors must see.

263
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,320
This is House Atreides now.

264
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,520
We are not like the Harkonnen.

265
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,840
You will be treated here with respect.

266
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,640
From now on,
we speak the lady's language at all times.

267
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,520
The Shadout Mapes, Milady,
head of household staff.

268
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,120
Mapes, show Milady our apartments.
Make sure she has everything she needs.

269
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,760
I'll join you after the briefing.

270
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,160
This way, Milady.

271
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,640
Come, Paul.

272
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
The men are waiting.

273
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
Me?

274
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,120
Right now?

275
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,520
It's time you participated.

276
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,400
I've had the girls sandscrub these walls
to within a millimetre of their frames.

277
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,480
The Harkonnen stench is finally gone.

278
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,160
Built by off-worlders many years ago.

279
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,640
A chapel for the memories of what
they left behind when they came here.

280
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
A thousand people
could survive a year on the water...

281
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,360
...it takes to keep this place a month.

282
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,360
And a Harkonnen
never let us forget it, Milady.

283
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,960
Your name, Shadout,
it means "well-dipper", doesn't it?

284
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,520
I was raised in the desert sietches,
Noble-born.

285
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,240
Refer to me as Milady, Mapes.
I'm not noble-born.

286
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,800
I am the bound concubine of the duke.

287
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,800
There is no wife?

288
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm his only companion,
the mother of his son.

289
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,000
You are Bene Gesserit.

290
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
Yes, I know the ancient tongues.

291
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm trained in the ancient ways.

292
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,440
This place is precious.
It should be protected.

293
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,760
Tell the people, Mapes,
this place belongs to them now.

294
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,880
As long as we rule here...

295
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,360
...the Atreides family
will keep it in trust for them.

296
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,200
Stay there.

297
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
Give them back their money.

298
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,160
Go on.

299
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It is a custom, Milady.

300
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,640
This custom stops now.

301
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Do as I said.

302
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
Do as I said.

303
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Water will never again be sold
at the Atreides' door.

304
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,320
At the end of every meal,
any person who calls at this door...

305
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,160
...may receive a full cup, free.

306
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,920
Is it possible?

307
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,840
Could it be possible
that she brings the Mahdi?

308
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,920
The thing must take its course.

309
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,520
What about the mining accounts?

310
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,240
The Harkonnen spice operation took...

311
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,120
...10 billion solaris out of here every year.

312
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,920
Now, does anyone here still think that the
Harkonnen have just packed up and left?

313
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,440
Gurney, I want you to make contact...

314
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
...with the smugglers
operating in the deep desert.

315
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,920
Tell them that we'll ignore
what they're doing from now on...

316
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,400
...as long as they make it worth our while.

317
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,720
The Emperor is extremely jealous
of his spice profits, Milord.

318
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,960
It's one thing
to turn a blind eye to smugglers.

319
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,960
It's quite another
to pocket some of their earnings.

320
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,360
Well, then just tell him what we're doing.

321
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,160
Bank the entire amount to his name,
Shaddam IV.

322
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,400
But then deduct it from our taxes
as a legitimate expense.

323
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,640
In other words, cost of doing business.

324
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,840
What?

325
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,320
I would just love to see the Baron's face
when he hears of this.

326
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,640
All the Harkonnen parasites
who got rich taking smuggler bribes...

327
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,040
...will be flushed into the open.

328
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
No more graft.

329
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,000
The Emperor cannot deny this.

330
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
Not in public, anyhow.

331
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,240
Well done, lad.

332
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,280
Now...

333
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,840
An emperor's daughter must do better.

334
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,960
Worthy to be your first-born.

335
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,680
They tell me her ambitions
tend more to the literary than the political.

336
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,440
Never underestimate the political uses
of an awakened mind, Majesty.

337
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,520
Subterfuge and cunning are often
better allies than a fierce heart...

338
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,840
...and a strong back.

339
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
All she lacks is the primacy of our gender.

340
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,560
Then you must marry her well.

341
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,760
Someone with a suitably
pliable personality.

342
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,120
Too bad it won't be that young Atreides.

343
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,280
The most admirable lad, I'm told.

344
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,840
Good union of breeding and training.

345
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,840
We must arrange to send Duke Leto
a token of our love.

346
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,800
He must continue to think of us fondly.

347
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,280
Why did we come here, Father?

348
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,520
And don't just tell me
it's a matter of honour or duty.

349
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
There's more to it, isn't there?

350
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
I've never lied to you, Son.

351
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We've been entrusted with the most
profitable commodity in the universe.

352
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
That alone makes us many enemies.

353
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
Then why don't we call them out?

354
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,360
Expose them...

355
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
...in front of the Emperor.

356
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,160
What if he's one of them?

357
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,280
This is a hard lesson, Son.

358
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,160
In the world we live in,
self-interest governs all.

359
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,840
The Emperor needs us...

360
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,400
...for the moment, to administer Arrakis,
to make the spice flow.

361
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,120
But he fears us, Paul.

362
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,400
He fears my influence
among the great houses.

363
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,840
If he decides it's in his interests...

364
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,440
...that House Atreides should fall,
he will do nothing to stop it.

365
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,880
He might even...

366
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,760
...invite opportunity to hasten it.

367
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
Well then, if you're right,
this place is a trap.

368
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,480
Perhaps.

369
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,280
But knowing there's a trap
is the first step in evading it.

370
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I should've taken
the House Atreides renegade...

371
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,560
...fled to the darkest corners
of the universe.

372
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,720
You're too honourable for that, my love.

373
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,240
No. I'm too fed up.

374
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,480
This endless feud stops here.

375
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,400
The Harkonnen are a rogue clan, Leto.

376
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,240
No matter how much prestige
they try to buy...

377
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,280
...they'll never have the respect
you've earned.

378
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Respect can't buy us peace.

379
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,000
I'd trade it all for a place somewhere.

380
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,400
Anywhere where we could be alone,
where Paul could be safe.

381
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,480
And all I had to think about
was your happiness.

382
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Maybe then I could finally make...

383
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,280
Please, don't talk about things
that can't be.

384
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,040
You belong to your time,
I was bred to my destiny.

385
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,320
Even if I were able to go back and choose...

386
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
...I would change nothing.

387
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,440
One of yours, Turok?

388
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,400
Harkonnen mercenaries.

389
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,840
Someone is signalling from the palace.

390
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,400
Save your strength for the desert, Atreides.
Word has already been sent to the palace.

391
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,200
We have people among you.

392
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,880
- Are they trustworthy?
- They are Fremen.

393
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,680
I'll take care of these.

394
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,120
I didn't mean to intrude.

395
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,720
Forgive me, Milady.
I was enjoying the morning.

396
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,720
For a moment,
I could imagine my wife walking there.

397
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,880
My Suk conditioning is supposed to rid me
of such unstable emotions as hope.

398
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,160
Still, it's all I have left.

399
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,440
We have spies everywhere, Dr. Yueh.

400
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,120
If she's still alive we'll find her.

401
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,880
Seems almost a sacrilege...

402
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,080
...wasting one's water
in a land starved for it.

403
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,080
Well, I'm sorry we dragged you here
to this dangerous place.

404
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,080
I came willingly, Milady.

405
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,440
Only half the sandcrawlers are operable...

406
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,400
...but we'll have most of the ornithopters
working soon.

407
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,520
That is a harvester factory.

408
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,240
We have about 1,000.

409
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
As big as she is,
there are worms in the deep desert...

410
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
...that could swallow one whole.

411
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,560
Why don't we use shields?

412
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,760
Shields are useless in the desert.

413
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,640
Even a simple body shield
will call every worm within 100 kilometres.

414
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,040
Drives them into a killing frenzy.

415
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,040
The imperial ecologist, Milord, Dr. Kynes.

416
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
We prefer the traditional term,
planetologist.

417
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,760
I understand that we have you to thank
for our stillsuits.

418
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,480
I hope they fit well.

419
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,600
This is basically a high-efficiency filter
and heat-exchange system.

420
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
The skin layer is porous.

421
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,000
Perspiration passes through heat filaments
and salt precipitators.

422
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,880
Water is reclaimed in catchpockets,
which you can draw from this tube.

423
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,040
Properly adjusted, water loss
is kept under 15 millilitres a day.

424
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,480
That's hardly measurable.

425
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,120
That's the point.

426
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,200
You're a Fremen.

427
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,480
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

428
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,760
But I am in the Emperor's employ.

429
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,680
You've worn a stillsuit before?

430
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,960
This is the first time.

431
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,120
Someone adjusted it for you?

432
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,480
No, it just seemed the right way
to put it on, that's all.

433
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Well then...

434
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,120
...the desert awaits.

435
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,960
Maintain 120 degrees southeast, Milord.

436
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,240
Set.

437
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,240
That's where the sandmaster
is concentrating his equipment.

438
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,040
How many men are there
on a mining crew?

439
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
As few as possible.

440
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
Mining is a perilous adventure at best,
Milord.

441
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,280
Has anyone ever been lost out this far
and survived?

442
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,320
Men have walked out of the nearer zones
by crossing the rock areas...

443
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,160
...where worms seldom go.

444
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,080
Fremen?

445
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,640
Fremen.

446
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,880
There it is.

447
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,480
That's the harvester.

448
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
And those are the scouts?

449
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,120
Yes.

450
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,560
Watching for wormsign.

451
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,920
"Wormsign"?

452
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
Wherever there is spice, there are worms.

453
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,840
Always?

454
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,720
They defend the spice sands.

455
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,400
Has there been an effort to wipe them out?

456
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
Too much area to cover. Too many worms.

457
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,840
A rich field by the look of the colour.

458
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,320
Is that wormsign?

459
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,160
Where's the carryall
to evacuate the harvester?

460
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,240
Wormsign, approximately 40 kilometres.

461
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,400
He's got you.

462
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,440
Estimated intercept, six minutes.

463
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,360
Do they always cut it this close?

464
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,120
It's not standard procedure.
The carryall should be here.

465
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,800
- How many men on that harvester?
- Usually 23, Milord.

466
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,480
- Are we sure the worm will attack?
- No doubt about it.

467
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,000
Crew on the harvester,
this is Duke Leto Atreides.

468
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
We're taking you out. Cease operations
and prepare for evacuation.

469
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Spotters, land to the west.
Prepare to be boarded.

470
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Those spotters only carry four men,
in addition to the crew.

471
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
We can only get two in here.

472
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,760
You two work on the back seats.
We'll jettison them when we land.

473
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,600
That'll get in three more.

474
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,880
This is harvester Delta Ajax Niner.
Sir, we have almost a full load.

475
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,240
Damn the spice.
We can always get more. Prepare for evac.

476
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
That's an order!

477
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,920
Worm sighting. 10 degrees southwest.

478
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,560
Estimated speed, 40 knots.
We have an approach.

479
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Worm intercept, five minutes.

480
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,440
Sandmaster,
this is a command from your duke.

481
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,320
Cease operations
and evacuate the station immediately...

482
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,280
...or I'll cut your ship in two with a lasgun.

483
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,200
I can hear it.

484
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,440
The worm.

485
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
I can hear it coming.

486
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Over here! Over here!

487
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,200
Both of you, over here!

488
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,040
The rest to the spotters!

489
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,680
Run, you sand dogs, run!

490
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,840
Get down and hang onto anything you can.

491
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,560
What are they doing?

492
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,480
Milord, we must go now! Hurry!

493
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,840
Capacity overload.

494
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,960
We need altitude or it'll suck us down.

495
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,680
Capacity overload.

496
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
Capacity exceeds lift capability.

497
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,840
Bless the Maker and his water.

498
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,040
Bless his coming and his going.

499
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,520
May his passage cleanse the world.

500
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,960
May he keep the world for his people.

501
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,680
How about the men left behind?

502
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,160
- Send a ship to search for them.
- But they were right by the worm...

503
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,280
Send a ship anyway.

504
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,960
When God ordains a man's time to die...

505
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,880
...he directs that man to the proper place.

506
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,480
Paul.

507
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,640
I want the pilots from that missing carryall
delivered to me personally.

508
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Someone's going to pay for that waste.

509
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,520
This is a different kind of man.

510
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,200
He risked his life and that of his son
to save the men instead of the spice.

511
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,360
A leader like that could have commanded
fanatic loyalty.

512
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,440
This is my legacy to you, Son.

513
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,600
The greatest wealth in the universe
and the never-ending struggle to defend it.

514
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,760
The ancients used to say
danger and opportunity were...

515
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,960
...often the same thing.

516
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,840
This is not one of Yueh's
academic exercises, Paul.

517
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,160
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea.

518
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,200
And here we need desert power.

519
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,960
Desert power.

520
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,760
Remember that.

521
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Mahdi, Mahdi.

522
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,160
Leto is growing more popular
with every passing week.

523
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,520
He has ruined our system
of bribes and patronage.

524
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,920
He's been able to maintain the spice quota
despite our sabotage.

525
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,360
Even that mongrel ecologist Kynes
is sending the Emperor favourable reports.

526
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,040
And what do you deduce
from all of this, Nephew?

527
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,080
The longer we wait,
the harder it will be to dislodge him.

528
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Piter, try again, will you?

529
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,120
Leto's continued success makes
the other great houses nervous, Rabban.

530
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,880
We can hear whispers, petty jealousies
that could easily give birth...

531
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,920
...to considerable envy.

532
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,360
Bugger envy!

533
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,200
We have a traitor among them.

534
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,840
I say strike now!

535
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
For your approval, Uncle.

536
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,040
The slave is quite a specimen this time,
don't you think, Rabban?

537
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,840
Perhaps Feyd
shouldn't be quite so casual today.

538
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,680
No.

539
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,960
Perhaps my dear brother
might even break a sweat today.

540
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,200
What you fail to understand...

541
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,000
...is that I want Leto to become popular.

542
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,360
I want him to feel secure.

543
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,840
I want him to feel confident.

544
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,920
Confidence breeds distraction.

545
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,160
And that is when one is most vulnerable.

546
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,840
Such a beautiful boy.

547
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,440
Little is known about the sandworms
that inhabit the desert regions of Arrakis.

548
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,640
It is known that worms are drawn...

549
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,600
...to the vibration and noise
of mining activity.

550
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,880
However, there is no direct evidence
linking desert worms to spice production.

551
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
Needs a new dew collector.

552
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,240
Dew collector?

553
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,760
Chromaplastic.

554
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,640
At night it cools very fast.

555
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,480
In the morning, daylight heats it.

556
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
The surface condenses moisture
out of the air...

557
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,880
...and it trickles down
to keep the plants alive.

558
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,520
- A simple beauty.
- A meaningless beauty.

559
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,920
In such a godforsaken place.

560
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,600
We deal here with the law of the minimum.

561
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,400
Unless we learn to live with it,
conditions can never change.

562
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,960
Are you saying that conditions here
could change?

563
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,800
Favourable conditions?

564
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,960
To change the ecology of the planet?

565
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,320
That depends.

566
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,960
On what?

567
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,440
On who the steward of the desert is.

568
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,240
Perhaps one day the person will come
who will understand...

569
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,800
...who will see the future
and know what can be.

570
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,800
The one who will change Arrakis:

571
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,360
The Mahdi.

572
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,600
You asked me to inquire
about the shouting the other day.

573
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,600
The words they were calling out
at your shuttle.

574
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
"Mahdi", something like that.

575
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,240
It means "messiah".

576
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,440
They have a legend here, a prophesy...

577
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,000
...that a leader will come to them
from off-world.

578
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,600
A boy. The only son of a Bene Gesserit.

579
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,440
To guide them to true freedom.

580
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,760
Messiah?

581
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,680
Paul?

582
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,840
These are a simple people, Milord.

583
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,720
They survive on hope.

584
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,680
Tell me about the waters
of your homeland, Muad'Dib.

585
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,840
I'm sorry, Milord.

586
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,040
Mapes didn't tell me you were in here.

587
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,560
No wait.

588
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,240
It's fine.

589
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,280
I was tired.

590
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,160
I fell asleep.

591
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,760
You can go on about your work.

592
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
Tell me...

593
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,120
...do the cooks use much spice in our food?

594
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,640
The spice is everywhere on Arrakis, Milord.

595
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,080
Everywhere.

596
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,480
Don't move.

597
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,400
Just do exactly as I say.

598
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,080
It's a hunter-seeker.

599
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,080
They will kill you...

600
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,880
...instantly, if you move.

601
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,240
Listen to me.

602
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,080
The operator, wherever he is...

603
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,960
...can only target movement.

604
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,320
Stay perfectly still.

605
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,840
Don't give in.

606
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,600
Fear is the mind killer.

607
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,760
You're lucky to be alive.

608
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,360
I was its target?

609
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,520
It goes toward movement, that's all.

610
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,680
You could have let it go
and saved yourself.

611
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,280
There is a traitor among you.

612
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,440
Someone close.

613
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,240
Someone very close.

614
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,680
I want him alive!

615
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,280
Hey, you!

616
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,480
They tried to take the life of my son!

617
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,520
He looks local.

618
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,200
- There's nothing to identify him.
- Harkonnen, surely.

619
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,880
- And not working alone...
- Stop it, both of you!

620
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,600
Burn him.

621
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,680
Everything except the hands.

622
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Put some spice in each one...

623
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,800
...and send them to the Baron
on Giedi Prime.

624
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,160
He almost took the life of my son.

625
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Get out, all of you! Out!

626
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,760
You simple ass.

627
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,240
I told you that I wanted
those bastard Atreides to feel secure.

628
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,000
But no, you couldn't wait.
You had to have your own way.

629
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,800
Now your initiative
has made them more defensive.

630
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,000
Now what, Piter?

631
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,800
Advancing our timetable
would seem appropriate at this point.

632
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,480
Another blinding burst of insight!

633
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,320
How is it that I am blessed with such
extraordinary counsellors as these?

634
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,440
There is, of course,
the slight troop-transport problem.

635
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,520
Our negotiations with the Spacing Guild
are not yet concluded.

636
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,400
Damn the Guild and their navigators.

637
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,600
Even the Emperor can't move without the
blessing of the Spacing Guild, dear Baron.

638
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,880
And what would you suggest,
my most devious Mentat?

639
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,400
Offer an increase in spice royalties...

640
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,280
...payable in advance
from Rabban's own reserves...

641
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,120
You are out of your mind, you...

642
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Get on with it, Piter.

643
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,680
We must try and turn this setback
to our advantage.

644
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,440
Perhaps your incompetence
will prove useful after all...

645
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,600
...and hasten the day
House Atreides must fall.

646
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,480
You're tired, Father.

647
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,800
Yes, I am tired.

648
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,360
The degeneration of the great houses
has worn me out.

649
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,440
Our house hasn't degenerated.

650
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,960
Hasn't it?

651
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,400
Your assassin didn't arrive here
without help.

652
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,520
But who could you suspect?

653
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,160
I can only suspect.

654
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,440
I can't prove...

655
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,040
...and there's suspicion enough
to go around.

656
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,400
It can't be Gurney.

657
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,560
He knew your assassin
would be more valuable alive.

658
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,800
Gurney's impulsive, Father.
He doesn't have that kind of cunning.

659
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,720
Or Yueh's intelligence.

660
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,360
Surely not Yueh?

661
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,760
His Suk conditioning
would drive him mad first.

662
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,760
Never let sentiment
cloud your judgement, Son.

663
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,760
There is someone.

664
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,120
Sooner or later
you must face whoever it is.

665
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,360
So this is how it works.

666
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,640
They sow the seeds of distrust...

667
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,920
...and get us to fear each other.

668
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,680
Learn this lesson well, Son.

669
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,440
If you want to hold Arrakis,
you must be ready to fight fear with fear.

670
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,120
Fear and power.

671
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,120
That's our cue.

672
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,400
The man in silver
is a stillsuit manufacturer in Carthag.

673
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,880
An inferior product to the Fremen's.

674
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,000
The hard-faced woman next to him
runs an escort service in Arsunt.

675
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,760
Impressive client list, I'm told.

676
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:18,480
By the fireplace, Lingar Bewt,
water shipper from the polar region.

677
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,840
The man to his right...

678
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,520
A Spacing Guild representative.
How could I miss him?

679
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,440
The man with Thufir is Esmar Tuek,
smuggler, highly successful.

680
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,160
He has fast ships if we need them.

681
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,160
Milady, Milord...

682
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,240
...I was honoured by the invitation.

683
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,920
You are always welcome here, Dr. Kynes.

684
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,200
We found the missing carryall, Milord,
hijacked by Harkonnen agents...

685
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,440
...who tried to sell it at a smuggler's camp.

686
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,920
They are now dead.

687
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,960
We are indebted to you, sir.

688
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,760
Milady will see to it
you have everything you need.

689
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,120
It will be my pleasure.

690
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,040
And my honour, Milady.

691
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,040
I understand they lost another harvester
to a worm.

692
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,200
If they keep this up, they won't even be
able to have enough money to buy water.

693
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,200
Gentlemen and ladies, Her Royal Majesty,
Princess Irulan Corrino.

694
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,320
Your Highness, your attendance
is a most welcome delight.

695
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,120
My father sends you his enduring respect
and affection, my Lord Duke.

696
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,200
The Emperor wishes everyone to know
of the confidence he has in House Atreides.

697
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,440
She brings the Emperor's Sardaukar killers
as her bodyguards.

698
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,160
Water customs here are so fascinating...

699
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,560
...don't you think, Your Highness?

700
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,680
When I arrived, my bathing towels
were hurried away almost before I was dry.

701
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,360
To save their squeezings, I assume.

702
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,880
That's a safe assumption.

703
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,360
Nothing about this place is fascinating.

704
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,240
If it weren't for the spice,
no one would bother about it at all.

705
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,120
Fortunately enough,
for a water seller like you, I would guess.

706
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,480
I enjoy watching the flight of birds
here on Arrakis.

707
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,560
Many exist without any water at all.

708
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,320
Carrion eaters, you know, blood drinkers.

709
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,280
A curious adaptation, don't you think?

710
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,400
You mean they are cannibals?

711
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,360
I said they drink blood,
not necessarily the blood of their own kind.

712
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,120
Why not?

713
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,680
One's fiercest competition
comes from one's own kind.

714
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,640
They eat from the same bowl.

715
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,200
It's said that Fremen
drink the blood of their dead.

716
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,800
Isn't that so, Dr. Kynes?

717
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,800
Not the blood, sir.

718
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,400
All of a man's water.

719
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,880
A necessity
when one lives in the deep desert.

720
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,680
The human body is 70 percent water.

721
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,160
Surely a dead man no longer requires it.

722
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,840
At least here is honest merrymaking.

723
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,040
Careful, lad.

724
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,000
That spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

725
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,960
Play, Gurney.

726
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,040
Let's you and I at least have some peace.

727
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,120
When the son of my beloved duke
orders me to relax...

728
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,800
...then, by God, I intend to do so.

729
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,360
Is that how you really feel, Gurney-man...

730
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,040
...about my father?

731
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,440
"Beloved"?

732
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,880
You young pup.

733
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,760
If I didn't know better, I would take
those words for an accusation.

734
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,600
It was a simple question.

735
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,560
Your father rescued me
from a Harkonnen slave pit, boy.

736
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,840
He took me into his household,
groomed me as his war master.

737
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,520
The man or woman...

738
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,600
...that raises a hand against him...

739
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,320
...will have it cut off by me,
as a prelude to their death.

740
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm ashamed of myself doubting you,
Gurney-man.

741
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,520
That's enough, lad. No more of this.

742
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,160
Gentlemen and ladies,
I use the terms loosely of course.

743
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,240
I, the Baron Harkonnen...

744
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,600
...have decided that the great seal
of our venerable house...

745
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,240
...that confused and ugly Chimera,
the griffin...

746
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,080
...no longer adequately represents
the ambition of our appetites.

747
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,800
Therefore and henceforth, in conclusion
and furthermore, ergo and et cetera...

748
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,000
...our ample and royal self...

749
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,280
...from this day forth,
and throughout the universe...

750
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,200
...we shall no longer be known
as House Harkonnen.

751
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,600
We shall be...

752
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,520
...House Hog.

753
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,280
Now I know why they say
your skill with a knife...

754
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,920
...is exceeded only by your mastery
of the baliset, Gurney Halleck.

755
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,760
Is it Atreides custom
to abandon an honoured guest...

756
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,320
...without even the courtesy
of a lame excuse?

757
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Forgive me, Your Highness.

758
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,080
Careful.

759
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,080
Spice beer can go to your head
before you know it.

760
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,040
So I've noticed.

761
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,480
You were expecting someone
more delicate, perhaps?

762
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,920
"Refined" was the word I had in mind,
actually.

763
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,040
There's an ancient saying
I've learned to trust:

764
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,000
"Never judge a book by its cover."

765
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,440
We are not all that different, Paul Atreides,
you and me.

766
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,880
You don't know what you're talking about.

767
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,960
I've heard all about the moody Paul...

768
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,240
...the grim Paul,
the angry and unhappy Paul...

769
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,120
...who has been exiled to Arrakis where,
poor boy...

770
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,600
...one day he will inherit responsibility
for the greatest treasure in the universe.

771
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,200
And a never-ending struggle to defend it.

772
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,040
We both suffer the solitude
of our birthright.

773
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:12,920
Except that tomorrow you will return
to the comfort of your palaces on Kaitain.

774
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,000
To the confinement of its perfect gardens
and lonely apartments.

775
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,720
To your servants and entourage.

776
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,400
With their slavish flattery
and cautious conversation.

777
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,120
As an heir to an Emperor.

778
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,360
Who damns my mother
for bearing daughters instead of sons.

779
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,480
You're mocking me.

780
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,360
No.

781
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,520
I'm trying to interest you.

782
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,880
Are you gonna dance with me
or just stand there looking confused?

783
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,600
I didn't want to come here, you know.

784
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,680
Being an ornament
of my father's diplomacy...

785
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,080
...is hardly my idea of a good time.

786
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,240
But you turned out to be more complicated
than your reputation.

787
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,320
And I like complicated.

788
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,080
We've been looking for you, Your Highness.

789
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,360
So now you've found me.

790
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,560
- Have you been hurt?
- Be still, Captain.

791
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,800
The Princess has been
under my protection.

792
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,160
Oh, please.

793
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,800
- Gurney, hold.
- Stand down, Captain.

794
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,360
- Gurney.
- I said stand down, Captain!

795
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,360
It's late, Highness. The shuttle awaits.

796
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,920
I am not ready to go.

797
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
Your father left strict orders.

798
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,120
You see?

799
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,360
Perhaps we should be the adults here.

800
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,680
Set an example
for our hot-tempered friends.

801
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,280
You are more interesting than you appear,
Paul Atreides.

802
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,920
I hope this won't be our last encounter.

803
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,200
My father will no doubt reward you
for such mindless obedience, Captain.

804
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,720
Muad'Dib.

805
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,400
Muad'Dib.

806
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,040
Father?

807
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,960
Duncan?

808
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
Forgive the abrupt arrival, Milord.

809
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,120
But we've taken
a force of Harkonnen infiltrators.

810
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,200
The Fremen found them
in the cave of the shield mountains.

811
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,280
One of the Fremen, Turok,
was badly wounded.

812
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,440
- I rushed him here for treatment...
- But he has died.

813
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,240
This is Stilgar, Milord...

814
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,240
...leader of Turok's tribe.

815
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,960
We've heard many things in the desert
about Leto Atreides.

816
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,200
I hope what you've heard
will be the beginning...

817
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,120
...of a friendship between us.

818
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,800
My people have suffered long
under the rule of such as you.

819
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,040
No, not such as me, nor any of my family.

820
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,800
All that changed
when the House Atreides came to Arrakis.

821
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,120
Duncan?

822
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,360
Paul.

823
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,360
Stilgar, this is my son, Paul Atreides.

824
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,800
Yes.

825
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,160
We have heard about him as well.

826
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,240
The Fremen want me
to remain with them, Milord.

827
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,840
He fights well.

828
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,880
And he has done his best for our friend.

829
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,760
It will reassure us.

830
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,000
Dual allegiance, Milord,
to you and to their tribe.

831
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,280
There is a precedent.

832
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,320
Liet serves two masters.

833
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,240
Let it be known among your people,
Stilgar, that Duke Leto Atreides...

834
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,920
...honours the sacrifice
that your warrior has made on our behalf.

835
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,080
I wish nothing but peace between us.

836
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,640
We thank you for the gift
of your body's water, Stilgar...

837
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,360
...and accept it in the spirit
with which it was given.

838
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,920
Duncan Idaho...

839
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,560
...your water now belongs to us.

840
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,560
The body of our friend, Turok,
remains with your duke.

841
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,440
His water now belongs to the Atreides.

842
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,600
That is the bond between us.

843
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,120
Mapes? Mapes!

844
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,600
Mapes, who did this? Who?

845
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,640
Traitor.

846
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,720
Who?

847
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,520
Guard dead.

848
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,520
Shields.

849
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,120
The shields.

850
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,560
Gurney!

851
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,040
Yueh?

852
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,600
God forgive me.

853
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,120
I had no choice.

854
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,680
Why?

855
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,000
Why?

856
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,440
Because I need to save my wife.

857
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,040
We haven't much time.

858
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,080
The Harkonnen will be in the palace soon.

859
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,960
I'm giving you the final revenge, Milord...

860
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,760
...for this terrible thing I've done
to you and your family.

861
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,520
You will have your revenge, Milord,
I promise.

862
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,680
Just remember the tooth.

863
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,120
The tooth, Milord.

864
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,480
When you have the Baron face to face...

865
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,560
...remember the tooth.

866
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,880
An Emperor's Sardaukar.

867
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,720
The duke! Where is the duke!

868
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:26,000
Not in quarters, sir.
We can't find the young master either.

869
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,560
Bastards!

870
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,120
No prisoners.

871
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,880
So, as soon as the city is pacified, Piter...

872
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,640
...remove all of the Sardaukar troops
to our frigate.

873
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,040
No trace of the Emperor's involvement
must ever be found here.

874
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,680
Piter.

875
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,600
A pity she has to remain gagged.

876
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,680
She has such a magnificent mouth.

877
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,440
A pretty mouth
with the sting of a scorpion.

878
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,640
We know all about
your Bene Gesserit witchery, my dear.

879
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,800
Perhaps I should cut your vocal cords...

880
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,400
...and then Piter
could have his way with you.

881
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,120
But then again, perhaps not.

882
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,920
No blood on my hands.

883
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,160
I have no idea what happened to you.

884
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,320
So when I see the Emperor's...

885
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,520
...wrinkled old bitch of a truthsayer...

886
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,240
...I suppose I'll just have to say,
"Don't know."

887
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,080
Aim for the desert.

888
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,440
Let the worms clean up the mess.

889
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,600
The bodies must never be found.

890
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,560
He looks sufficiently paralysed.

891
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,840
My half of the bargain, Baron.

892
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,640
I promised you the duke. There he is.

893
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,480
Well, it's a delicious sight, Doctor.

894
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,600
Now it's time for your half.

895
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,240
And believe it or not,
I'm a man of my word.

896
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,800
Where is she?

897
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,760
You promised we'd be reunited.

898
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,840
You said you'd free her
if I did what you asked.

899
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,480
Well, I've done it.

900
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,400
So where is she?

901
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,880
Your wife is free, my good doctor.

902
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,400
Completely free.

903
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,280
Free of her mortal coil.

904
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,600
Free of her physical cage.

905
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,240
I've freed her.

906
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,800
I promised you'd be reunited,
and I'm a man of my word.

907
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,920
As now you can see.

908
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,960
You think you've defeated me.

909
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,600
Never trust a traitor.

910
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,520
Not even one you create.

911
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,000
My noble duke, are you enjoying the show?
I hope so.

912
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I kept you alive so you could witness
every precious moment of your betrayal.

913
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,720
What?

914
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,760
Paul.

915
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,480
Oh, the boy.

916
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,320
I don't know, I left him to the desert,
he and that gorgeous woman of yours.

917
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,560
My men left them to explore
the beauty of the sands of Arrakis.

918
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,760
Perhaps they'll see some worms.

919
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,640
We couldn't have all that noble blood
all over our hands, could we?

920
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,000
The Emperor was quite insistent
about that.

921
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,440
Yes...

922
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,320
...your beloved Emperor.

923
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,680
Just goes to show,
never get more popular than the boss.

924
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,280
Unless you intend to sack him.

925
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,520
Did I say that? How impolitic of me.

926
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,360
I must be spending too much time
with that idiot nephew of mine, Rabban.

927
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,040
You won't say anything will you,
my dear man?

928
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,240
Perhaps we should get on with it, then.

929
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,800
Get on with it?

930
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,520
This is kanly, Piter!

931
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,000
Vendetta!

932
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,360
And I am going to savour
every minute of it.

933
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:51,440
My family has hated the Atreides
for generations.

934
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,200
They have been the sand in our eyes,
the stink at our meals...

935
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,960
...these arrogant Atreides,
always standing in our way.

936
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,760
I want Leto to appreciate the beauty...

937
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,240
...of what I've done to him.

938
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:15,440
I want him to know that I,
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen...

939
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,680
...am the instrument
of his family's demise...

940
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,600
...the extinction of House Atreides...

941
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,160
...and the ascendance of House Harkonnen.

942
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,120
The tooth.

943
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,440
What did he say?

944
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,840
Tooth.

945
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,440
What did he say, Piter?

946
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,800
The tooth.

947
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,840
No!

948
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,360
Need you more proof
of what heaven's choice is?

949
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,240
Atreides is dead, and Harkonnen lives!

950
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,480
He's dead.

951
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,080
Father's dead.

952
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,800
- What are you doing?
- We won't survive long in the open.

953
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,040
We must find shelter.

954
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,960
But Harkonnen patrols.

955
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,080
Worms.

956
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,880
We have to take our chances.

957
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,000
One of ours?

958
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,400
We can't take the chance.

959
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,840
Could be Harkonnen
coming to finish the job.

960
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,880
Hurry! Harkonnen patrol ships
are in the area, approaching fast.

961
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,400
Strap in.

962
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,440
- What is this place?
- A Fremen sietch. A small one.

963
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,880
There's a storm coming.
We can stay here until it passes.

964
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,000
Liet, we must talk.

965
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,720
Rest here.

966
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,920
How did you know where to find us?

967
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,840
Dr. Yueh sent a courier.

968
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,400
Said you were being taken to the bled,
south of the mountain shield.

969
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,120
Milord...

970
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,520
...I'm supposed to give you this.

971
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,920
Harkonnen patrols are in the area.

972
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,720
- They tracked our thopter.
- They called you Liet.

973
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,080
You're the one, aren't you?

974
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,120
The one who's never seen,
the one who may not even exist at all.

975
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,600
Their leader.

976
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,720
I prefer the term "guide" to "leader".

977
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,160
Guiding them?

978
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,240
Until Mahdi comes.

979
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,320
Harkonnen thopters approaching.

980
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,560
Milord.

981
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,520
- You're coming with us?
- No.

982
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,320
- They'll kill you.
- Me?

983
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,520
I'm Dr. Kynes.

984
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,520
I work for the Emperor, you remember?

985
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,800
I'll just say I was your hostage.

986
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,920
Milord, please.

987
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,720
I must remain with the Fremen, Milord,
as I promised your father.

988
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,880
Just hold on.

989
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,960
We can't lose them.

990
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,080
Paul, the storm. We can't go into that.

991
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,800
We have no choice.

992
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,120
Nothing survives one of those storms.

993
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,480
Unless they want to die,
they won't follow us in, will they?

994
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,480
I must not fear.

995
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,560
Fear is the mind killer.

996
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,840
I will face my fear,
and I will let it pass through me.

997
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,520
When the fear is gone
there will be nothing.

998
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,080
Only I will remain.

999
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,720
There is a legend that the night
House Atreides lost Arrakis...

1000
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:38,200
...a star exploded in the skies
above their homeland on Caladan.

1001
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,920
But, the saga of Dune was far
from over.

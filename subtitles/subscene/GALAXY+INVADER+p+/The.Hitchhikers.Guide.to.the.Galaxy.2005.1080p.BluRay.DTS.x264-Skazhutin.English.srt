[male narrator]
It's an important and popular fact

2
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:37,663
that things are not always
what they seem.

3
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:41,542
For instance, on the planet Earth,
man had always assumed

4
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:45,212
that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet,

5
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,965
instead of the third most intelligent.

6
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:52,553
The second most intelligent creatures
were dolphins, who, curiously enough,

7
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,557
had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth.

8
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,976
They'd made many attempts
to alert mankind,

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,063
but most of their communications
were misinterpreted

10
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:05,650
as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for tidbits.

11
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,196
So they eventually decided they would
leave Earth by their own means.

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,491
The last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted

13
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,827
as a sophisticated attempt
to do a backward somersault

14
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,956
through a hoop, whistling
The Star-Spangled Banner.

15
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,791
In fact, the message was this:

16
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,794
- [bell rings]
- "So long and thanks for all the fish."

It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

171
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,751
[Tricia laughs]

172
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,547
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat-up line is that?

173
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,800
Mm, that does happen.

174
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,845
- Speaking of...
- [beeping]

175
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,222
We've got two minutes.
Drink up.

176
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,266
- [rumbling]
- That's my house.

177
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,111
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone, on me.

178
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,905
[barman] You really think
the world's going to end?

179
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,490
Yes.

180
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:43,036
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

181
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,081
- If you like.
- Will it help?

182
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,834
Not at all. See you.

183
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,168
[barman] Last orders.

184
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,837
[workmen shouting]

185
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,926
[pants]

186
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,013
[engines whir]

187
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,812
- [workman 1] What is that?
- [workman 2] Run!

188
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,814
[workman 3] Look out!

189
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:15,652
[shouts and screams]

190
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,071
[rumbling]

191
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,459
[screeching]

192
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,676
Aha! Towel!

193
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,764
Arthur!

194
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,807
What the hell are those things?

195
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,436
[Ford] Yeow! They're ships
from a Vogon constructor fleet.

196
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,689
I picked up their signal this morning.
You'll need this.

197
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,107
[whimpers]

198
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,319
- [Arthur] What are you doing?
- [Ford] We're hitching a ride.

199
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,447
[feedback]

200
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,157
Um, people of Earth,

201
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,704
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the
Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.

202
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,331
As you are probably aware,

203
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:13,043
plans for the development
of the outlying regions of the galaxy

204
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,673
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

205
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,927
And your planet is one
of those scheduled for demolition.

206
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,637
[screaming]

207
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,893
[sheep bleat]

208
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,479
There's no point
acting surprised about it.

209
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,065
The plans have been on display

210
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,902
at your local planning office
in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years.

211
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,028
[screaming]

212
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,782
If you can't be bothered with
local affairs, that's your lookout.

213
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,326
Apathetic bloody planet.

214
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,413
I've no sympathy at all.

215
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,540
[harsh alien speech]

216
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,417
[zapping]

217
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,421
[Arthur screams]

218
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,549
[Arthur screams]

219
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,871
[boom]

220
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,023
[narrator]
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

221
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,109
is a wholly remarkable book

222
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,445
Perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful,

223
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,616
ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor.

224
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,994
More popular than
The Celestial Homecare Omnibus,

225
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,873
better selling than
53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity,

226
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,960
and more controversial than
Oolon Colluphid's trilogy

227
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,213
of philosophical blockbusters,
Where God Went Wrong,

228
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,799
Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes,

229
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,218
and Who Is This God Person Anyway?

230
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,013
It's already supplanted
The Encyclopedia Galactica

231
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,058
as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom

232
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,727
for two important reasons.

233
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,397
First, it's slightly cheaper,

234
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,608
and second, it has the words
"Don't Panic"

235
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,195
printed in large,
friendly letters on its cover.

236
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,582
So you're not from Guildford?

237
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,794
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

238
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,673
Um, you're not an out-of-work actor,

239
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:52,220
but rather a writer for this...
this book thing.

240
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,723
- [buzzing]
- [Ford] Good, huh?

241
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,225
I don't feel well.
I need a cup of tea.

242
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,687
If I asked where we were,
would I regret it?

243
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,024
- [Ford] We're safe for now.
- [Arthur] Good.

244
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,944
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

245
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,573
- Oh, get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...

246
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:16,244
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.

247
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,873
[hollow clang]

248
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,960
You don't remember.

249
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,297
OK, Arthur, I've got
something to tell you.

250
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,425
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

251
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,678
Your home planet has been blown up.

252
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,358
- Huh, blown up.
- [Ford grunts]

253
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,651
[grunts]

254
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,448
Couldn't you have done something?

255
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,535
I saved your life.
OK, that makes us even.

256
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,581
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here, you've...

257
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,293
...gotta know where your towel is.

258
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,921
OK, give me a hand over here.

259
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,386
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

260
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,554
Before the Vogons find us.

261
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,683
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

262
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,061
- [Arthur] Huh?
- [steam hisses]

263
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,521
[Ford laughs]

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,817
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

265
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,735
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

266
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,572
- [chiming]
- Vogons.

267
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,786
[Guide] Vogons are one of the
most unpleasant races in the galaxy.

268
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,207
Not evil, but bad-tempered,
bureaucratic, officious and callous.

269
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,794
They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers

270
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,131
from the Ravenous Bug blatter Beast
of Traal without orders

271
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,675
signed in triplicate,
sent in, sent back,

272
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,053
queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry,

273
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,598
lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months

274
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,518
and recycled as firelighters.

275
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:09,649
On no account should you allow
a Vogon to read poetry to you.

276
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,192
[screeching]

277
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,905
[Ford] They can't think or imagine.
Most can't spell. They just run things.

278
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,577
Hmm?

279
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,078
[grunts]

280
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,205
And if we don't get a ride soon,

281
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,709
we won't need the Guide to tell us
how unpleasant the Vogons are.

282
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,128
They've already destroyed
a planet today.

283
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,547
That always makes them a little "eeee!"

284
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,259
[unintelligible shouting
over loudspeaker]

285
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,596
Ughh! What is that?

286
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,724
- Put this in your ear.
- Huh?

287
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,394
[Arthur gibbers]

288
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:50,357
[Vogon] We have unwittingly
picked up a couple of hitchhikers.

289
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,109
The fish is translating for you.

290
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,238
[Guide] The Babel fish
is small, yellow, leech-like,

291
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,659
and probably the oddest thing
in the universe.

292
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:06,206
It feeds on brainwave energy,
absorbing unconscious frequencies,

293
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,833
and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies

294
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,169
to the speech centers of the brain.

295
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,798
The practical upshot of which is that,
if you stick one in your ear,

296
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:20,470
you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language.

297
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,516
[rumbling, crashing]

298
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,064
Resistance is useless.

299
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,986
- [Arthur] All right.
- [Vogon 1] Someone's coming.

300
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,489
[Vogon 2] Here we go. Look lively.

301
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,659
[door rumbles, crashes]

302
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,745
[Vogon grunts]

303
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,668
[Vogons chatter]

304
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,594
[crab] Wheee!

305
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,514
- [Vogon grunts]
- [crab squeaks]

306
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,103

- [Vogon] Ha, ha!

307
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,730
[all shriek]

308
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,607
[door clangs]

309
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,486
- [Vogon Jeltz] Hmmm.
- [Vogon minion] Sir.

310
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,322
- [Vogon Jeltz] What?
- [Vogon minion] Hitchhikers.

311
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,366
[Vogon Jeltz groans]

312
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,995

[Vogon Jeltz clears throat]

00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,948
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."

321
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,576
No, really, you don't have to read.

322
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,412
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

323
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:14,626
"...as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee."

324
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:20,089
[Guide] Vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe.

325
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,174
[groans]

326
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,469
[Guide] The second worst
is that of the Azgoths of Kria.

327
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,097
During a recitation by their
Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent,

328
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,100
of his poem
Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty

329
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,770
I Found in My Armpit
One Midsummer Morning,

330
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,106
four of his audience
died of internal hemorrhaging,

331
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,777
and the President of the
Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council

332
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,238
survived by gnawing
one of his own legs off.

333
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,284
"Or I will rend thee
in the gobberwarts..."

00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,287
- [Ford screams weakly]
- "...with my blurgle..."

335
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,792
[Guide] The absolute worst poetry was
by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.

336
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,378
Luckily, it was destroyed
when the Earth was.

337
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,132
"See if I don't." Yeah.

338
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,260
[Vogons chortle]

339
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:10,723
So, Earthlings,
I present you with a choice.

340
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,935
Either die in the vacuum of space,

341
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:18,815
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

342
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,358
[Vogons chuckle]

343
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:24,362
A... a... actually, I rather liked it.

344
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,489
- [Jeltz] Hmm?
- [Ford] Yeah.

345
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,284
- That's good. Run with it.
- Hmm.

346
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,786
Uh, some of the words
I didn't understand,

347
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,290
but I found the imagery quite effective.

348
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,500
Continue.

349
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,296
Well, uh, yes,
interesting rhythmic devices,

350
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,840
which seemed to counterpoint

351
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,592
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of...

352
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,887
- Vogonity!
- Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity...

353
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,308
...of the poet's soul.

354
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,935
[Vogons murmur]

355
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,148
So what you're saying is,

356
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,817
I write poetry because

357
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,322
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

358
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,367
I just want to be loved?

359
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,704
[whispers] Yes, yes, yes.

360
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,206
Yes, yes, yeah, please.

361
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:22,712
Ahh, ooh, ooh, mmm.

362
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,422
Throw them off the ship!

363
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,884
- [Ford] No! No!
- Ford.

364
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,469
Ahh!

365
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,846
All right! All right!

366
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,475
Resistance is useless!

367
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,690
Shut up! Get a job!
Wash your filthy hands!

368
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,485
Don't panic. Don't panic.

369
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,571
So this is it?

370
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,574
We're going to die?

371
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,286
Yeah, we're gonna die.

372
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,331
No, no, what's this?

373
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,041
What is this?

374
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:04,420
What's this? This is... nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

375
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,465
[Arthur sighs]

376
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,633
[hollow clang]

377
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,511
[Arthur sighs]

378
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,680
- [phone beeps]
- [Arthur grunts]

379
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,225
You're sweating.

380
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,481
[Arthur chuckles]

381
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,777
- [Ford] Would you like a hug?
- [Arthur] No.

382
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,948
[alarm blaring]

383
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,243
[banging, hissing]

384
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,956
[noises stop]

385
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,876
[Guide] "Space," says the introduction
to The Hitchhiker's Guide,

386
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,463
"is big. Really big.

387
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:52,927
You just won't believe how vastly,
hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."

388
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,846
A... a... and so on.

389
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,015
It also says that
if you hold a lungful of air,

390
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:03,479
you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about 30 seconds.

391
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,815
But with space being really big and all,

392
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,443
the chances of being picked up
within that time

393
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,737
are two to the power of two billion,

394
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,823
79 million, 460 thousand,

395
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,909
347 to one against.

396
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,786
By a staggering coincidence,

397
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,497
it's also the phone number
of the Islington flat,

398
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,833
where Arthur went to a fancy dress party

399
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,253
and met a very nice young woman
whom he totally blew it with.

400
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,673
[boom]

401
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,802
Though the planet Earth,
the Islington flat and telephone

402
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:40,516
have all now been demolished, Ford
and Arthur were, in fact, rescued.

403
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,436
- [Arthur] Ford?
- [Ford] Yes.

404
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,607
- [Arthur] I think I'm a sofa.
- [Ford] I know how you feel.

405
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,108
[both scream]

406
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,742
So much for the laws of physics.

407
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,702
[woman on TV] And our top story.

408
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:04,040
The sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe,

409
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,083
the starship Heart of Gold.

410
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,711
Stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other

411
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,631
than Galactic President
Zaphod Beeblebrox.

412
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:17,011
[Zaphod] In the name of people, freedom,
and, uh... democracy, stuff like that,

413
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,182
I hereby kidnap myself
and I'm taking the ship with me. Whoo!

414
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,267
- Come on!
- [crowd gasps]

415
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,811
[TV] Beeblebrox,
universally considered

416
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,856
to be the dimmest star
in several solar systems,

417
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,610
is most famous for his controversial
defeat of Humma Kavula

418
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:36,697
who claimed many thought they were
voting for the worst-dressed being

419
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,742
in the universe contest.

420
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,952
Great.

421
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,913
Kavula is best remembered
for his slanderous

422
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,624
"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign.

423
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,211
[woman] Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.

424
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:54,674
If there's anything more important than
my ego, I want it caught and shot now.

425
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,467
Come on, I love it.

426
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,595
[TV] Zaphod's just this guy, you know.

427
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,516
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What d'you...?

428
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,895
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.

429
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,565
Hitchhikers?
Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

430
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,525
I didn't. The ship did.

431
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,902
[Zaphod] What? Wh... wh... Say what?

432
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:19,615
When we engaged the
Improbability Drive... The big button.

433
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,493
- [Zaphod] I know.
- They were picked up here.

434
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:26,122
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Wait.
That's where you picked me up.

435
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,165
- On Earth.
- That's impossible.

436
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,586
- No, just very improbable.
- Listen. I don't have time for this.

437
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:35,965
We've got the police of half the galaxy
after us. We've stopped for hitchhikers.

438
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,426
So ten out of ten for style, but...

439
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,928
...minus several million
for good thinking.

440
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,307
You're too gorgeous, baby, stop it.
You drive me crazy.

441
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,727
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

442
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,730
- Marvin.
- [whirring]

443
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,819
[Marvin] You ought to know,
I'm feeling very depressed.

444
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,282
Well, we have something
that should take your mind off things.

445
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:06,037
[Marvin] It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

446
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:12,084
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

447
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,004
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

448
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,424
[Marvin] Just that? I won't enjoy it.

449
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,135
Yeah, well, that's life.

450
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:25,514
[Marvin] Life?
Don't talk to me about life.

451
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,151
- [radio] Commander Kwaltz.
- [Kwaltz] Yes.

452
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,530
[radio] We have located the spaceship
Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.

453
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:45,826
- Where?
- Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.

454
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,371
Requesting hyperspace clearance.

455
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:54,418
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

456
00:29:54,502 --> 00:30:00,216
- Yes, sir.
- Get me Vice-President Questular.

457
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:06,430
Hyperspace permission granted, captain.

458
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,891
[Vogon crewman] Here we go.

459
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:14,021
- [engines roar]
- [Vogons scream]

460
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,816
[whoosh of engines]

461
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:23,572
[door sighs]

462
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,371
[door sighs]

463
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,207
I think that door just sighed.

464
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,751
[Marvin] Ghastly, isn't it?

465
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,212
All the doors have been programmed

466
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,507
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition.

467
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:48,472
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

468
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,309
Please yourselves.

469
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,604
Here I am,
brain the size of a planet,

470
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,274
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge.

471
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,861
Call that job satisfaction?
'Cause I don't.

472
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,947
You can thank
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation

473
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,949
for building robots with G.P.P.

474
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:11,245
- [Arthur] What's G.P.P.?
- [Marvin] Genuine People Personalities.

475
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,791
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

476
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,335
[electronic bleeps]

477
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,466
- [bleeps]
- [woman] Arthur?

478
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:28,971
[Zaphod] Hey, Slim, are you wearing
my underwear? 'Cause I'm wearing yours.

479
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,807
And they ain't doing the trick.
Come on. All right.

480
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:37,980
- [door sighs]
- [Marvin] Oh, for heaven's sake.

481
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,941
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

482
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,152
[Zaphod] Ah-ha! Ow!

483
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,279
- Freeze!
- [Ford squeals]

484
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,908
[Marvin] Freeze?
I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

485
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:52,578
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- [Marvin] Oh, why do I bother?

486
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,455
- Zaphod?
- Ford!

487
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,001
[Zaphod] Is that you?
Ford! Praxibetel Ix!

488
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,086
What the hell are you doing here?

489
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,590
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.

490
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,510
- [Zaphod] That is so you.
- [Ford] Look at you!

491
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:12,014
President of the Galaxy.
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

492
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,724
[Zaphod] You zarkin' frood.

493
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:18,187
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

494
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,355
Oh.

495
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:24,401
President of the Galaxy. This is my
cousin. He's a semi-half-brother...

496
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,072
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We've met.

497
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:33,661
[laughs] Have we? I'm sorry.
I've got a terrible memory for species.

498
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:38,040
This is him, Ford. The "would you
like to see my spaceship" bloke.

499
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,542
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

500
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:44,880
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia!

501
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,341
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian.

502
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:51,220
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

503
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,098
- Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:58,227
Um, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

505
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,522
You went down on that little planet
and didn't call me?

506
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,441
Sorry, I didn't know.
I had a galaxy to run.

507
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,819
[Arthur] Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

508
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,072
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

509
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,700
I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.

510
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,411
Right. I was thinking
of changing mine to,

511
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,454
I don't know, Arthoolia.

512
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:21,584
[laughs] That's a good one.
Well, this is weird.

513
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,212
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.

514
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,924
- Right. In your pajamas?
- I was in a hurry.

515
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,093
OK. Did you know I was here?

516
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,888
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

517
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,682
Yeah, that's kinda like
the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

518
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,851
OK, um, look.

519
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,771
I left you at the party. I feel bad, but
I was gonna call you when I got back.

520
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:45,816
Well, there is no
going back now, is there?

521
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,527
You do know what happened?

522
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,447
Enough small talk.
We're on the run, remember?

523
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,449
Excuse me, we're having a chat.

524
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,993
Well, I think the girl's getting...
Boo!

525
00:33:56,118 --> 00:34:01,373
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut
your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

526
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,083
- You wanna fight?
- OK.

527
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,961
- No. No.
- I'm just kidding.

528
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,465
I'm a kidder. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

529
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,301
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

530
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:15,846
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah!

531
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,433
Teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

532
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,894
[sings] He's a guest on my ship!

533
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,939
I thought you said you stole it.

534
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,523
[thud]

535
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,485
Stole what?
What are we talking about?

536
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:33,113
- [electronic beeping]
- Whoa! That doesn't sound good.

537
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,034
[whoosh]

538
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,038
- Are you OK?
- Just fabulous, thanks, Trill.

539
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,916
A little help over here.
I'm in over my head.

540
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,378
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

541
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,754
[laughing] Yes, I do!

542
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,006
Hey, this is really pretty.

543
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,676
- Don't!
- Whoo! They're on our tail.

544
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,136
Fire a gun. Launch a missile.
Do some damage!

545
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:58,305
[engines roar]

546
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,689
Ow! Stop that! Ow!

547
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,857
Just kiddin'. I love it rough. Hit me.

548
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,860
- Uh, computer?
- [computer] Hi there.

549
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,029
I'm Eddie, your computer.

550
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,866
I'm pleased to report that it's
a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers.

551
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,244
They're sending you a message.

552
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,705
This is Vice-President Questular Rontok.

553
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,208
I am speaking to the kidnapper
of the president?

554
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,459
[Zaphod] She digs me.

555
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,753
Surrender the stolen vessel at once

556
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:35,342
or we will take action
as defined and permitted by...

557
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:39,346
...section 1-8 of the Galactic
Interstellar Space Bylaws...

558
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,850
Zaphod, please come back now.
This is ridiculous.

559
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,686
Leap to hyperspace! Come on!

560
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,397
[computer] Sure thing, fella!

561
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,857
[engines fire up]

562
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,903
[whoosh]

563
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,405
No.

564
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,910
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorization?

565
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,831
- No, commander.
- Oh.

566
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:11,378
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

567
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,298
- [messenger] I'm coming, sir.
- [footsteps]

568
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:21,096
[panting] I'm boiling!
Oh, oh. Here's the form, sir.

569
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:26,060
So are you along for the ride
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

570
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,480
That depends. Where are you going?

571
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,565
Where am I going?

572
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:37,112
- You OK?
- Yeah. Don't suppose there's any tea.

573
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,282
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

574
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,828
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

575
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:49,333
[Guide] The best drink in existence
is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster,

576
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:54,129
the effect of which is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon

577
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,799
wrapped round a large gold brick.

578
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,926
[both scream]

579
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,473
- Belgium. Hold it one second.
- Belgium.

580
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,310
Ape-man, Earth dude, sorry,
what's your name again?

581
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,854
- [clears throat] Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

582
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,358
No hard feelings, OK?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

583
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,235
- Earth.
- Yeah. I liked Earth.

584
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:19,279
Got these boots there.
But don't mention it to the girl.

585
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:23,158
Because if you do... I'll pull
your spleen out through your throat.

586
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,161
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- OK.

587
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,248
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

588
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:35,087
Hey, hey, Zaphod,
what's with the two-head thing?

589
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,842
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't be
president with a whole brain.

590
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,927
It's crazy.

591
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,179
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

592
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:48,350
Parts of my personality weren't exactly
what you'd call presidential.

593
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,394
You know what I'm talkin' about.

594
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,692
[drinks machine] Your tea is ready.

595
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,282
[gags]

596
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,704
[spits]

597
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:13,375
I suppose I should've said
it resembles tea. [laughs]

598
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,211
So, two heads
is what does it for a girl?

599
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,714
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or three...

600
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,883
Or your own spaceship.

601
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,760
Anything else he's got two of?

602
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,346
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

603
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,684
What am I supposed to be like?
Green? Bleeping?

604
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,562
I can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like.

605
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:37,483
OK, look. Do you see this?

606
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:41,612
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

607
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,947
[machine] Enjoy your doughnut.

608
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,412
- Do you see this?
- [buzzing]

609
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:57,377
This toasts bread

610
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,296
while you're slicing it.

611
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:05,177
We're on a spaceship, Arthur. In space.

612
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,222
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

613
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,643
That was... some sort of test.

614
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,478
And I failed.

615
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:18,106
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

616
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,234
No, I mean your chin.

617
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,486
- Ah...
- I might have an aspirin.

618
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,946
Right.

619
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,825
- [mice squeak]
- Hey!

620
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,791
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

621
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,127
- Please, don't.
- [Zaphod] Showtime, Trill.

622
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,428
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

623
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,180
Buttons aren't toys.

624
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:53,350
Anyway... When I saw
what I'm about to show you,

625
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:58,105
that's when I realized
why I had to do what I did to my brain.

626
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,316
I think. It's all a little...

627
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,151
...shaky.

628
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:06,154
[whirring]

629
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,366
[Marvin] I've seen it. It's rubbish.

630
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,868
[trumpet fanfare]

631
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,205
[Guide] Many millions of years ago,

632
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,709
a race of hyper-intelligent,
pan-dimensional beings

633
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,713
got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life,

634
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,799
that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best

635
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,177
to design and build
a stupendous super-computer

636
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,682
to calculate the answer to life,
the universe and everything.

637
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,727
0 Deep Thought,

638
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:41,064
we want you to tell us the answer.

639
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,400
[Deep Thought] The answer to what?

640
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:48,113
[girl 2] The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

641
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:52,284
[girl 1] We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

642
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,037
[Deep Thought]
Hmm, I'd have to think about that.

643
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,875
Return to this place in exactly
seven-and-a-half million years.

644
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:05,756
- [Ford] Is it finished?
- No, there's more. They go back.

645
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,927
- Seven-and-a-half million years later?
- That's right, they do.

646
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:16,058
[cheering, trumpets]

647
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,113
Deep Thought, do you have...?

648
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:34,618
[Deep Thought] An answer for you?
Yes, but you're not going to like it.

649
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:38,872
- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- All right.

650
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,875
The answer to the ultimate question...

651
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,752
[cheering]

652
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,464
...of life, the universe
and everything...

653
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,049
[cheering]

654
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,258
...is...

655
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,261
[cheering]

656
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,642
...42.

657
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,436
[man] Yeah? What?

658
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,106
[woman] 42?

659
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:08,360
[Deep Thought] Yes, I thought it over
quite thoroughly. It's 42.

660
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,738
It would've been simpler
to have known what the question was.

661
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:16,702
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything!

662
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,662
That's not a question.

663
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:22,499
Only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means.

664
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:27,212
- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can't. But there is one who can.

665
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:31,258
A computer that will calculate
the ultimate question.

666
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,969
A computer of such infinite complexity,

667
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,140
that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix.

668
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:42,352
And you yourselves shall take on new,
more primitive forms

669
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:48,191
and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10-million-year program.

670
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:52,028
I shall design this computer for you,
and it shall be called...

671
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:01,121
- That's it?
- That's it.

672
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:05,000
[Ford] You're looking for
the ultimate question? You? Why?

673
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,919
[Zaphod] I tried that.
Why? 42. Doesn't work.

674
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,881
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why...

675
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:14,509
...do you want to know
the ultimate question?

676
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,179
Partly curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

677
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,682
but, uh, mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

678
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,934
You're president of the Galaxy.

679
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,853
- [Zaphod] Yes, Arman.
- Arthur.

680
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,355
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.

681
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,234
I find the question, that's permanent.
It sticks.

682
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,862
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep.
Win-win.

683
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:39,284
We just hit that button and bam,
we're at Magrathea, I think.

684
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,537
We've hit it twice and
we're still not there, but anyway...

685
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,040
- You in?
- Always.

686
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,959
- [Zaphod] All right!
- [Marvin] Uh, I want to get off.

687
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:51,505
- Uh, sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This!

688
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,090
[boom]

689
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:59,429
[Guide] The Infinite Improbability Drive
is a wonderful new method

690
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:02,390
of crossing interstellar distances
in a few seconds,

691
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,602
without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.

692
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,939
As the Improbability Drive
reaches infinite improbability,

693
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:13,068
it passes through every conceivable
point in every conceivable universe

694
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,861
almost simultaneously.

695
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:17,072
So you're never sure
where you'll end up

696
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,741
or even what species you'll be
when you get there.

697
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,786
It's therefore important
to dress accordingly.

698
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,249
The Drive was invented following
research into finite improbability

699
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:29,417
often used to break the ice at parties

700
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,754
by making all the molecules
in the hostess's undergarments

701
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,881
leap one foot to the left

702
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,509
in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy.

703
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,221
Many physicists said they
wouldn't stand for that sort of thing,

704
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,390
partly because it debased science,

705
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:47,435
but mostly because they didn't get
invited to those sort of parties.

706
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,814
[squeaks, clangs]

707
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:54,818
[engines rumble]

708
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,157
[Zaphod] Wow, is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button?

709
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,118
[Trillian] Very probably, yes.

710
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:06,246
[Marvin] Ah, I think
the Earthman's about to be sick.

711
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,165
[Zaphod] In the trashcan, ape-man.
This ship's new.

712
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,918
Aw, come on!

713
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:14,546
[Trillian] We have normality.

714
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,298
Did it work? Are we there?

715
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,304
Yeah. We're here. Magrathea!

716
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,139
I don't think so. Eddie...

717
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,182
- Ow!
- What planet is this?

718
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,101
[Eddie] I'm checking for you.

719
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:33,189
Did you just pluck
one of my hairs? Off my head?

720
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,818
[Eddie] Thank you for waiting.
Sorry to disappoint,

721
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,987
but this is not Magrathea.

722
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,866
We are currently in orbit around
the planet Viltvodle Six.

723
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,703
- [squelch]
- Humma Kavula!

724
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:51,708
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

- [Zaphod] Humma Kavula!

726
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:03,970
[Guide] In the beginning,
the universe was created.

727
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:08,850
This made a lot of people very angry,
and is widely regarded as a bad move.

728
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,894
[crowd shouting]

729
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,272
Many races believed it was created
by some sort of god,

730
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,941
though the Jatravartid people
of Viltvodle Six

731
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:21,988
firmly believe that the entire universe
was sneezed out of the nose of a being

732
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,866
called the Great Green Arkleseizure.

733
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,618
[Zaphod] Humma Kavula!

734
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,037
[Guide] The Jatravartids,
who lived in fear

735
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,624
of the time they called the
Coming of the Great White Handkerchief,

736
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:36,461
were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each.

737
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,130
They were unique in being
the only race in history

738
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:42,884
to have invented
the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

739
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,846
Mr. President!

740
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,640
Hey, all right. How you doin'?

741
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,393
Hey, what have we here? I love it!

Hey, I love you. Fantastic!

00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,279
Arthur, I want a drink.

What brings you to our humble planet?

No, I don't think I do.

774

I think you think you don't.

But we both know... you do.

Eloquent as always.

00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:11,366
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

778
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,536
[Zaphod] That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

779
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,038
when you were my opponent
running against me,

780
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,041
you said I was stupid.

781
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:44,190
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

782
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,485
...if memory serves, you won,

783
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:50,905
proving that good looks
and charm win

784
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:55,910
over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

785
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:03,418
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

786
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,087
[Arthur] Excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir.

787
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,383
Uh, I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix-up

'cause, actually, he's not with us.

We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,683
He grew, didn't he? He's not that tall.

You didn't come half-way across

is to go to Magrathea.

Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

838
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,813
[Vogon Kwaltz]
Fire upon the kidnapper!

839
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:12,273
Hey, come on!

840
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,942
The president is the kidnapper.
You'll kill him!

841
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:16,944
Bang! Bang!

842
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,988
[Arthur] It's locked!

843
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:24,285
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

844
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,330
[Ford shrieks]

845
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,043
Come on, Zaphod.

846
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,299
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?

847
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,886
Field research. So they found
where we are? Belgium bummer!

848
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,722
They're shooting at us!
What are we going to do?

849
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:48,142
- [Trillian] I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?

850
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,645
[Arthur] What? He's the one they want.

851
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,022
You can't go out there.
What are you doing?

852
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:57,276
- Back off!
- [Vogon] What's going on?

853
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:02,240
I have the president
and I will kill him, I swear.

854
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:06,285
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

855
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,538
- It's an aerosol can.
- Oh.

856
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:12,166
[Arthur] OK, frightened now,
frightened.

857
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:16,254
- [Zaphod] Hi, little guy.
- Get her!

858
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,340
- [Arthur] Zaphod, no, come on!
- [Trillian] Arthur!

859
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:22,969
- [Trillian] Arthur!
- Tricia!

860
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,013
- Arthur!
- Tricia! Wait!

861
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,525
[Trillian] Arthur!

862
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:44,157
Resistance is useless!

863
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:48,411
[engines blasting off]

864
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,003
[Kwaltz] Bring her to Vogsphere
for processing, captain.

865
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,506
- [door sighs]
- [Zaphod] Circus. Circus!

866
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,217
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go!

867
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:04,760
[Zaphod] Let's go!

868
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:10,391
Whoo! Computer, take us to Magrathea!

869
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,935
What? No, no, no.
We've got to go after Tricia.

870
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,437
- Who?
- Trillian.

871
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,065
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git!

872
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:21,235
Right, you're coming out!
[laughs hysterically]

873
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:25,239
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea, we want to follow the ships.

874
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:28,993
[computer] I'd love to, but my
guidance system has been deactivated.

875
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,203
Oh, come on!

876
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,705
[computer] I'm sorry.
It wasn't my fault.

877
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,832
What you doing on this ship?

878
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,542
- Ford?
- Marvin.

879
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,045
I've been talking
to the ship's computer.

880
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,838
And?

881
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:42,423
It hates me.

882
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,760
No, uh-uh. Eddie, computer,

883
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,347
is there another way
to follow the ships?

884
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,935
[computer] Activating Emergency Escape
Pod. It's super-neat and fun to fly!

885
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,270
[Arthur] Ow!

886
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:57,813
[Marvin] Unbelievable!

887
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:02,276
[Arthur] I'm in. I'm in.
OK, Ford, do you have any idea?

888
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,945
[Ford] We'll press this.

889
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,155
[Arthur] Oh, no, no, no, no.

890
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:09,242
- [Ford] This button.
- OK. Nothing's... OK!

891
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:12,286
Good man, good man, good man.

892
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,998
- OK, we're wobbling...
- You forgot your towel.

893
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,584
[Arthur] Get him off me! I'll kill him!

894
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:21,212
- OK, Ford, there's a...
- [Ford] Is that better?

895
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,297
No, that's worse, that's worse.

896
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,717
- Do what... I don't need that.
- OK.

897
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,512
[Arthur] Stop the rocking.
Marvin, any ideas?

898
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,224
[Marvin] I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

899
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,725
[Arthur] Thanks, Marv.

900
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,362
[distant thunder]

901
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:51,701
[crab] Ooh, ooh. Eee. Ooh, ooh.

902
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:56,163
[whine of spaceship plummeting]

903
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,834
- [crash]
- [crab] Whoo!

904
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,294
[explosion]

905
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,380
[crab] Wheel Wheel

906
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,057
[crab] Yeah! Yeah!

907
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:19,645
[coughing]

908
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:24,859
- Magrathea!
- [Ford] No, we're on the Vogon planet.

909
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,570
- Yes, it is. It's Magrathea!
- This is Vogsphere.

910
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,823
- Yeah, Magrathea. I know it.
- [Ford] No, it's not.

911
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,452
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is.

912
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:37,747
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

913
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,708
They have these
on Arcturan megafreighters.

914
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,294
They use them when
they need to concentrate.

915
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,671
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

916
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:48,132
[pulsing]

917
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,553
- [Ford] There you go.
- [pulsing stops]

918
00:57:56,557 --> 00:58:00,353
Should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

919
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:04,857
[Marvin] Now I'm feeling
much better about our predicament.

920
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,736
[crash]

921
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:29,340
[Ford] I checked the Guide for how
to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

922
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,593
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

923
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:35,221
Well, I kind of had this idea
that we could... Ow!

924
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,517
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

925
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,519
- What was it?
- [Arthur] Uh...

926
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:45,940
Nothing, it's, uh, nothing.
It's just my imagination.

927
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:50,277
OK, right. Now, everyone just stop
a minute, please, and look at me.

928
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:55,282
There's... definitely
something going on here.

929
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:59,286
Just... just watch.

930
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:02,790
Just watch.

931
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,211
OK, I think we...

932
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,380
- Oooh!
- Ah-ha! You too!

933
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,467
Yeah, what was that?

934
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:15,636
I thi...

935
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:18,848
Zaphod, what do you think?

936
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:26,856
I think... Ow! Zarquon!
What was that? Jeez!

937
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:30,609
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

938
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,612
- No one ever does.
- [Ford] I have an idea.

939
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:36,824
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Ford!
Kill it! Get rid of it!

940
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,043
OK, don't think.

941
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,671
Nobody think. No ideas.

942
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:52,882
No theories. No nothing.

943
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,971
[All] Ow!

944
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,682
This is crazy.
Trillian is in there somewhere.

945
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:06,645
- We need an idea to save her.
- [Zaphod] I have an ide...

946
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,856
- Ah! Run!
- Yeeaaghh!

947
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,464
[Zaphod imitates kung-fu cries]

948
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,883
[Arthur] Ooh! Ah!

949
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:38,093
[tram bell rings]

950
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:40,304
[Vogon] You're supposed to stop.

951
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:44,391
[siren blaring]

952
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:53,817
OK, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

953
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,782
All right, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

954
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:03,786
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

955
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:08,374
OK, where is she?!

956
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,171
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

957
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:20,386
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus
of... Blaard?

958
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,722
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

959
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,391
Oh. Right.

960
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,977
[keys clank]

961
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,437
[computer squeaks and squeals]

962
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:35,401
Sorry, no record of Earth.

963
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:39,280
Galactic sector
ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

964
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,783
- Oh, yes.
- [Questular] She's lying.

965
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,621
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

966
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:51,500
- Mmmm.
- [Vogon clerk] Here we are. Earth.

967
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:54,962
Oh. Um, "destroyed."

968
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:58,507
Um, do you have
a second home planet?

969
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:02,136
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

970
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:07,391
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

971
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,477
[pulses]

972
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,230
[explosion]

973
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:18,027
Who in their right mind
gives an order to destroy a planet?

974
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:24,158
- He said the grey building, right?
- All the buildings are grey.

975
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:27,578
"Give me a hand." Ha-ha, very funny.

976
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,165
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

977
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,756
[Vogon clerk 2]
Go back and fill that in.

978
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,176
Then, make sure, when you fill in
the facilitating form...

979
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:47,139
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

980
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:51,101
[Vogon clerk 2]
If you'd fill that form in for me,

981
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,896
and return it as soon as possible.

982
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:58,359
- Writing implements to your left...
- You're president. Can you do anything?

983
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:03,322
Presidents don't have power. Their job
is to draw attention away from it.

984
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:07,451
Hey, how you doin'?

985
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:12,247
Hey, it's me, your president!
What's goin' on? Thanks for coming.

986
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:15,167
All right. I know that sponge.
All right!

987
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,628
- Next!
- President coming through.

988
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,714
How you doin', Pinhead?
No, really, it's me.

989
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,384
I love kabuki. Look at that.

990
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,387
- [Arthur] Out the way.
- [alien roars]

991
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,515
- Give us a kiss!
- [alien squeals]

992
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,477
Hi, I've come about
release of a prisoner.

993
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,272
Prisoner release form.

994
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,941
Oh, wha...?

995
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,235
I don't believe you.

996
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,946
These are the orders.

997
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:49,910
"Love and kisses?!"

998
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:54,665
Mm. Now, according
to the Galactic Penal Code,

999
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:59,461
the punishment for
a presidential kidnapping

1000
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:03,298
is to be fed to
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

1001
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,176
Good day.

1002
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,012
[Trillian] Ow, get off of me!

1003
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:12,766
Ow! What the hell is that?

1004
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,352
Ow, no, wait, wait!

1005
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:19,231
There's been some kind of mistake. Ah!

1006
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:25,946
- Tick all the boxes on the right.
- Right. Got it.

1007
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,990
Not that one!

1008
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:32,369
[Guide] What to do if you find yourself
stuck with no hope of rescue.

1009
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:36,832
Consider how lucky you are
that life has been good to you so far.

1010
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:40,294
Alternatively, if life
hasn't been good to you so far,

1011
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:43,589
which, given your current circumstances,
seems more likely,

1012
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,801
consider how lucky you are that
it won't be troubling you much longer.

1013
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,138
[Trillian growls]

1014
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,141
Right, there we go.

1015
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,643
Oh, kidnapping the president.

1016
01:04:56,727 --> 01:05:01,148
Oh, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

1017
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,401
OK. Right.
Look, this is the president.

1018
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,653
- [Vogon] Oh!
- OK. See, there?

1019
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:10,365
He says the kidnapping business
was a horrible misunderstanding.

1020
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:11,992
Oh, yeah.

1021
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:15,788
[Arthur] She meant nothing by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

1022
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:20,626
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

1023
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:23,921
Those are blue.

1024
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:28,091
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Hold that. OK. Wai...

1025
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:30,594
- [roars]
- [Trillian screams]

1026
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:36,850
Oh, he's hungry today, [chuckles]

1027
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,228
That's blue. Right.

1028
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,441
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

1029
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:47,778
OK, this is, uh...
it's for Tricia McMillan.

1030
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:52,157
Tricia McMillan. Mm. OK.

1031
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:57,538
[minion] Sir, it's a release form.

1032
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:58,956
Thank you.

1033
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,125
She's free to go.

1034
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:05,462
- Release her.
- [Trillian screams]

1035
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:10,926
Zaphod's here.
Well, then, uh, that's fine then.

1036
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,637
Let's just go and get him.

1037
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,814
Who are we waiting for again?

1038
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,111
No, I'm serious.

1039
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:34,074
Tricia!

1040
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,705
- Tricia.
- [Zaphod] Trill.

1041
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:42,749
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot!

1042
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,835
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

1043
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,753
- He did?
- I did?

1044
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:51,300
Yes. "Love and kisses, Zaphod?"
You didn't even read it, did you?

1045
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:56,179
Honey, I'm president of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

1046
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:00,100
An entire planet, my home,

1047
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,312
destroyed because you thought
they wanted your autograph.

1048
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:06,189
- [Zaphod] They framed me!
- Are you an idiot?

1049
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:10,193
- Trillian.
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

1050
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:14,364
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

1051
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:19,578
Oh, a backbone? What about coming here
to rescue you? Thank you. My idea. Oh!

1052
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,832
Stupid!

1053
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,463
- Got your arm.
- [Marvin] How considerate.

1054
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:33,884
Right, then, all those lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

1055
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:53,737
Oh, the president tests my patience.

1056
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,659
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

1057
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,662
Fantastic. At last.

1058
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,789
[whistle sounds]

1059
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:10,295
Oh. That's one hour for lunch,
everybody.

1060
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:14,591
I think I'll have soup today.

1061
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:18,845
[Guide] The Encyclopedia Galactica,
in its chapter on love,

1062
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:22,349
states that it is
far too complicated to define.

1063
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:26,853
The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy has this to say on love.

1064
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,523
"Avoid, if at all possible."

1065
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,526
Unfortunately,
Arthur Dent has never read

1066
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,028
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1067
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:39,157
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

1068
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:41,535
I... I didn't...

1069
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:46,123
Um, look, uh...

1070
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:49,126
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right,

1071
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:54,047
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

1072
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:58,552
Um, for what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling...

1073
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:04,641
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

1074
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:08,103
Thank you.

1075
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,189
[Arthur] Actually,
what I was going to say was...

1076
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:17,571
...if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

1077
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:21,491
then neither of us would be here now.

1078
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:25,370
I just thought that might
count for something.

1079
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,625
It doesn't matter.

1080
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,086
[Arthur sighs]

1081
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,382
[door sighs]

1082
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,931
[door sighs]

1083
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:59,362
All right, computer, take us to...
Where are we... where we headed again?

1084
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:02,908
OK, I'm gonna get you
another lemon.

1085
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,951
All right.

1086
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,708
[computer]
Engaging Improbability Drive.

1087
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:15,670
[Ford] No, Zaphod, no.
Buttons are not toys. What did you do?

1088
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:17,631
Magrathean coordinates accepted.

1089
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:21,550
- [blast off]
- [squeaks]

1090
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,721
[blast]

1091
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:28,100
[computer]
It blows my circuits to tell you

1092
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,561
that we're in orbit,
at an altitude of 300 miles,

1093
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:35,315
around the legendary planet
of Magrathea.

1094
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,110
Magrathea! Magrathea!

1095
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:41,780
Magrathea!

1096
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,700
- [sighs]
- [Zaphod] Unbelievable.

1097
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,207
[Marvin] Incredible.

1098
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,751
It's even worse
than I thought it would be.

1099
01:10:55,961 --> 01:11:00,257
[man] Greetings. This is a recorded
announcement as we are all out.

1100
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,802
The Commercial Council of Magrathea
thanks you for your visit,

1101
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,264
but regrets that the entire planet
is temporarily closed.

1102
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:11,143
If you'd like to leave your name
and a planet where you can be contacted,

1103
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:13,353
kindly do so at the tone.

1104
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:18,358
- How can a planet be closed?
- Zarkin' A, cousin.

1105
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,862
OK, computer, keep going.
Take us down.

1106
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:23,530
[computer] I'd be happy to.

1107
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:25,115
[electronic tone]

1108
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,868
[message] It is gratifying
that your enthusiasm

1109
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,036
for our planet continues unabated.

1110
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,998
As a token of our appreciation,

1111
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:36,126
we hope you will enjoy
the two thermo-nuclear missiles

1112
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,504
we've just sent
to converge with your craft.

1113
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,632
To ensure on-going quality of service,

1114
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:46,970
your death may be monitored
for training purposes. Thank you.

1115
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,014
[computer] I'm delighted to tell you

1116
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,975
there are two nuclear missiles
heading right for us.

1117
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:55,395
If you don't mind,
I'm going to take evasive action.

1118
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:57,105
[engines whoosh]

1119
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,107
[shouts and cries]

1120
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,944
[computer] Something's jamming
my guidance system.

1121
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,988
Impact minus 45 seconds.

1122
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,911
Computer, do something!

1123
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:15,332
[computer] Sure. Handing over
manual control. Good luck.

1124
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,919
[brakes screech]

1125
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:22,088
[missiles whoosh]

1126
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:28,762
[Zaphod] I need some help.

1127
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:31,431
I can't do this without my third arm.

1128
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,478
- [clunk]
- Arthur, grab my hand!

1129
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,860
[shouts and groans]

1130
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:46,780
[engines roar]

1131
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:50,659
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

1132
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:57,040
- Why don't I just press this?
- No, we're not back to normal yet.

1133
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,125
- What will happen?
- I don't know.

1134
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:03,213
Don't do it! We're here.
No telling where it'll send us.

1135
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:08,134
- Sod it all.
- No!

1136
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:12,013
[silence]

1137
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:15,517
Wow. Where are we?

1138
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:22,691
Exactly where we were.

1139
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,150
And the missiles?

1140
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:30,740
Apparently, they've turned...
into a bowl of petunias.

1141
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,869
- [clunk]
- And a very surprised-looking whale.

1142
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:37,163
[computer] And an improbability factor

1143
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:42,502
of 8,767,128 to one against.

1144
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,298
We have norm... normality.

1145
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,842
Normality, right. [coughs]

1146
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,845
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

1147
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:56,016
- What is normal?
- What's home?

1148
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,851
What are cows?

1149
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:01,896
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

1150
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,234
[Guide] It is important to note that
suddenly, and against all probability,

1151
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:09,195
a sperm whale had been
called into existence

1152
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,366
several miles above
the surface of an alien planet.

1153
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,328
Since this is not a tenable
position for a whale,

1154
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:21,416
this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity.

1155
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,085
This is what it thought as it fell:

1156
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:27,380
Ah, whoa, what's happening? Who am I?

1157
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:31,092
Why am I here? What's my purpose?
What do I mean by "who am I"?

1158
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,386
OK, OK, calm down, get a grip now.

1159
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,557
Ooh, this is an interesting sensation.
A sort of tingling in my...

1160
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:42,687
I better start finding names for things.
Let's call it a tail. Yeah, tail.

1161
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:46,858
What's this roaring sound whooshing past
what I'm gonna call my head?

1162
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,069
Wind. Is that a good name? That'll do.

1163
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:52,405
Yay, this is really exciting.
I'm dizzy with anticipation.

1164
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:55,075
Or is it the wind?
There's a lot of that now.

1165
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:59,245
And what's this thing coming towards me
very fast? So big and flat and round.

1166
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:04,417
It needs a big wide-sounding name
like ow, ound, round, ground!

1167
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:09,089
That's it, ground. I wonder if it will
be friends with me. Hello, ground.

1168
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,383
[thud]

1169
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:15,261
[Guide] The only thing that went through
the mind of the bowl of petunias

1170
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:19,391
as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again!"

1171
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,272
Many have speculated that if we knew
why the petunias had thought that,

1172
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:31,736
we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now.

1173
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,990
[wind blows]

1174
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,326
[Arthur] What are those things?

1175
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:41,788
[Ford] They're portals
to another dimension.

1176
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:46,334
[Arthur] Right. I don't suppose this
portal has central heating, does it?

1177
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:51,631
- [Zaphod mumbles]
- [Arthur sighs]

1178
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,175
[Zaphod] Ah, this is the one.

1179
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,763
[Marvin] This will all end in tears,
I just know it.

1180
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,810
- Right here.
- [machine starts up]

1181
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,106
- Hey! Whoa!
- [roaring wind]

1182
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,650
OK, in we go!

1183
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:15,905
We can't just step into that... that!
We don't know where it leads.

1184
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,116
If we pick the wrong one,

1185
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:21,953
we just... we come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

1186
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:25,665
[Arthur] What? Yeah, it's a big biggie,
Ford. A big biggie.

1187
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:30,753
What if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?

1188
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:34,382
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

1189
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:38,678
- Ford!
- His hunches are good.

1190
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,181
Arthur, I say we go.

1191
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:47,145
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?!

1192
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:48,855
[Arthur] This is suicide!

1193
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:53,026
- I think I resent that.
- [Arthur] I don't care.

1194
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,987
[Zaphod] I'm getting hostility
from you, Alex...

1195
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:59,616
- Arthur!
- [Zaphod] Have you ever tried yoga?

1196
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:00,742
[portal roars]

1197
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:04,412
- Trillian!
- I think that's supposed to happen.

1198
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,670
[high-pitched] She's gone!
Ford, she's gone!

1199
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,757
Arthur, don't panic!

1200
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:21,387
- Ford!
- [Zaphod] Hey, wait for me!

1201
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,474
Whoo!

1202
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,435
[Arthur whimpers]

1203
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:36,736
Come on.

1204
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:40,281
Idiot! Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1205
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,408
Come on, come on, come on!

1206
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:48,915
Ahhh!

1207
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,417
[silence]

1208
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:55,588
[coughs, splutters]

1209
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,426
[groans, grunts]

1210
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:07,559
No, no, no, don't leave.
Come on, come on, just start!

1211
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,770
[Marvin]
I told you this would end in tears.

1212
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,939
[Arthur] Did you? Did you?

1213
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,697
[Arthur breathes heavily]

1214
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,950
[Zaphod from above] Geronimo!

1215
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:26,578
Ooomph! [laughs]

1216
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:31,165
Far out! Far out! Ha-ha!

1217
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:35,962
This is it. This is it!
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

1218
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,467
[Arthur chuckles]

1219
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:45,096
This is how
it's all going to end, is it?

1220
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:50,101
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

1221
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:52,645
[Marvin]
You think you've got problems.

1222
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,273
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

1223
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:56,566
[man] Excuse me.

1224
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:00,612
- [Arthur screaming]
- [man] Whoa, whoa.

1225
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:08,286
- Who are you?
- No, uh, my name is not important.

1226
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:11,956
Uh, you must come with me.

1227
01:19:11,998 --> 01:19:16,294
- Get away.
- [man] Terrible events are afoot.

1228
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,922
Um, you... you must come
or you'll be late.

1229
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:22,258
- [Arthur] Late? What for?
- What?

1230
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:27,847
No, no. What's...
what's your name, Earthman?

1231
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,225
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- [man] Well,

1232
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:34,020
late as in "the late Dentarthurdent."

1233
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:38,691
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1234
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:41,778
- No.
- [man] Your friends are safe.

1235
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:45,114
- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

1236
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,952
OK, my name is, um...

1237
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:53,956
My name is... is...
is... Slartibartfast.

1238
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,212
I... I... I said it wasn't important.

1239
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,051
Well... so my friends are safe?

1240
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:06,636
Let me show you.

1241
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:12,600
[Marvin] I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

1242
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,361
[clank]

1243
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,336
Did you know we built planets?

1244
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,465
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

1245
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:49,262
Doing the, um... doing the coastlines
was always my favorite.

1246
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:54,976
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1247
01:20:55,059 --> 01:21:00,064
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

1248
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:05,695
are a... are a bit of
a luxury commodity...

1249
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:09,615
Come with me because there's
been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

1250
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,951
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

1251
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,538
- And men.
- What?

1252
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:17,623
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1253
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:22,462
[laughs] Yes, well, I don't think men
have much to do with it. Here.

1254
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:27,133
[vibrations]

1255
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:42,231
- [engine starting up]
- [beeps]

1256
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,911
[siren]

1257
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,421
- [explosion]
- Um, I must warn you,

1258
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:09,008
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

1259
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:11,344
- Huh?
- It may disturb you.

1260
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:15,181
It scares the willies out of me.

1261
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:17,308
Aghh! Aghh!

1262
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:49,507
[Slartibartfast] Ha, ha, ha.
Welcome to our factory floor.

1263
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:09,610
[grunts, groans]

1264
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,405
[Trillian] OK.

1265
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:15,908
[Zaphod] All right. All right.

1266
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:18,870
Yeah, this is it.

1267
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,417
This is it.

1268
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:28,421
0 great Deep Thought!

1269
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,214
We have traveled long...

1270
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,093
...and far.

1271
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:39,682
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

1272
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,143
the universe and everything?

1273
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,978
[Deep Thought yawns] No.

1274
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:46,647
- [Zaphod] What?
- I've been watching TV.

1275
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:47,815
Oh.

1276
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:51,611
I designed
another computer to do that.

1277
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,946
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

1278
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:56,824
No, it's not here. It's another world.

1279
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:59,076
It's on another world.

1280
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,663
It is another world, stupid.

1281
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:05,207
Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it

1282
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,627
to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

1283
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,087
Well... OK.

1284
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:12,256
You sure you don't have the question,

1285
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:15,885
or a way to, you know,
access it or something?

1286
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,929
'Cause I think I've done
a lot to get here.

1287
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:22,475
Oh, shh, shh. The show's back on.

1288
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:26,687
[hiccup]

1289
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:30,900
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

1290
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:35,446
Great. I'm gonna go and find something
else for my entire life to be about.

1291
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:38,824
[Ford] Zaphod, Zaphod,
there's the... the gun.

1292
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:41,160
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

1293
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:45,748
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I... why'd I do that?

1294
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,500
- OK.
- That's stupid.

1295
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:52,713
0 Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

1296
01:24:54,382 --> 01:24:57,718
[crashing, rumbling]

1297
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:06,268
[cart squeals]

1298
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,814
- There you are.
- Hm?

1299
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,565
Look familiar?

1300
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:15,152
[Arthur] So it wasn't destroyed?

1301
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:19,532
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark II.

1302
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,412
So you... you made the Earth?

1303
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:28,165
[chuckles] Not me alone,
but I... I did my part.

1304
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:31,544
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

1305
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:35,506
That was one of mine.
I... I got an award for it.

1306
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,634
[Arthur shrieks]

1307
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,304
[Arthur's shrieks grow louder]

1308
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:45,099
[Arthur] Oh, hoo!

1309
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:48,644
[Slartibartfast] All right, Frank?
That's... that's Frank.

1310
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:54,358
Ah-ha. They...
they've nearly finished the oceans.

1311
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:03,868
[Ford] Zaphod.

1312
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,953
Here, it's...

1313
01:26:08,456 --> 01:26:11,542
It's just like Humma said.

1314
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:14,211
- Now you can go get your head back.
- Hey, Ford.

1315
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:16,756
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarking frood.

1316
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:17,882
- No!
- [gun blast]

1317
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,217
- Whoa!
- This is a bust too.

1318
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:25,890
H... H... Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

1319
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:28,893
You go through all you have,
you don't get an answer,

1320
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:31,604
which means no money or fame,
which you deserve...

1321
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,273
[Guide] The Point-of-View Gun,
conveniently,

1322
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,776
does precisely what its name suggests.

1323
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,445
Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic.

1324
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:43,491
[Guide] If you point it at
someone and pull the trigger,

1325
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:46,243
they instantly see things
from your point of view.

1326
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,287
Give me that thing.

1327
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,372
It was designed by Deep Thought,

1328
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:54,335
but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives

1329
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,504
who, after arguments
with their husbands,

1330
01:26:56,587 --> 01:27:00,299
were sick to the teeth of ending
those arguments with the phrase,

1331
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:02,468
"You just don't get it, do you?"

1332
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:03,636
[blast]

1333
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,556
Uh, uh, and you're right,
I shouldn't be so upset

1334
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,892
because life goes on, you know,

1335
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,770
and I should just go on with it.

1336
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:15,147
Shoot him again.

1337
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,191
- [Zaphod] Whoa.
- [blast]

1338
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:22,196
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

1339
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,616
- [Zaphod] Say what?
- That is brilliant.

1340
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:27,743
[Zaphod] What's goin'...?

1341
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,621
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

1342
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,583
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Who cares?

1343
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:39,213
I do. Especially since we're somewhat
of an endangered species, thanks to you.

1344
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,423
[Zaphod] Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

1345
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:44,343
- You wanna know why I'm edgy?
- [gun]

1346
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:48,347
Argh. Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up

1347
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:52,101
and you've been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order.

1348
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,727
Huh?

1349
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:56,605
Ugh! You actually wanted
to know the question

1350
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,567
because you always wondered
if there was more to life

1351
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:03,529
and now you're crushed
because you find out there really isn't.

1352
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:08,159
Hey, fantastic. [laughs] Psychedelic.

1353
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,869
[fires again]

1354
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:13,706
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

1355
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:17,459
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

1356
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:21,172
Huh? That's not true.

1357
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:24,508
[fires twice more]

1358
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:28,971
And you're worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does.

1359
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,474
Hey, whoops.

1360
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,229
Oh, baby doll.

1361
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:40,691
Give me that thing.

1362
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:46,405
[sighs] It won't affect me.
I'm already a woman.

1363
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:47,990
[boom]

1364
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:51,243
[rumble of grating stone]

1365
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,793
It's OK.
It's only a couple of little mice!

1366
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:03,422
[huge rumbling]

1367
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:07,051
[Slartibartfast] Voilà!
Himalayas. Good, eh?

1368
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,890
Earthman, you must realize

1369
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:14,475
that the planet you lived on

1370
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:19,521
was commissioned, paid for
and run by mice.

1371
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:25,611
When you say mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1372
01:29:25,653 --> 01:29:27,571
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1373
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:32,743
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyper-intelligent beings.

1374
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:36,288
I don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

1375
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:40,125
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1376
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:45,130
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1377
01:29:45,256 --> 01:29:49,134
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

1378
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:53,138
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

1379
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:57,309
[Arthur] Actually, this explains a lot.

1380
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:00,062
All my life,
I've had this strange feeling

1381
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:03,148
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

1382
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:06,986
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1383
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:09,613
[boom]

1384
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:13,867
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

1385
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:16,662
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1386
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:20,833
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1387
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,377
I'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

1388
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,462
- And are you?
- Uh... no.

1389
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:28,215
[laughs] That's where
it all falls down, of course.

1390
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:41,603
Here you are then.

1391
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:57,745
Is this...?

1392
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:14,011
It's, um... It's all there.

1393
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,389
You know, it all works.

1394
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:19,558
Welcome home.

1395
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:38,243
[all cheer]

1396
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:41,413
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

1397
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:43,624
- There you are!
- Surprise!

1398
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,627
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1399
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:48,253
Is that tea?

1400
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:52,633
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1401
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:56,220
But then they made up for it
by making us...

1402
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,597
[tearfully] ...this amazing meal.

1403
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:02,810
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1404
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:07,106
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1405
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,441
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1406
01:32:13,654 --> 01:32:18,325
[chuckles nervously]
The, um, talking... talking mice. Cool.

1407
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:23,580
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1408
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,960
- Please, drink.
- Um, uh, excuse me.

1409
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:31,463
- Uh, is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1410
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:35,300
Um, good, I'll be outside, so...

1411
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:37,594
You were right.

1412
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,471
- [mouse] Please, drink.
- Yes.

1413
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:42,057
He was right.

1414
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,017
Now, to business.

1415
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,936
[both] To business!

1416
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,312
[firmly] Eat!

1417
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:49,148
- Shh.
- Sorry.

1418
01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:51,775
[Mouse] We've spent a lot of time
on your planet

1419
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:53,819
looking for this ultimate question.

1420
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:57,489
Only to have it blow up
in our faces. Literally.

1421
01:32:57,531 --> 01:33:01,076
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1422
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,162
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

1423
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,831
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1424
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:09,126
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

1425
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,295
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

1426
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:14,506
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

1427
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,800
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1428
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,177
[Mouse] More tea?

1429
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,013
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

1430
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,348
Yes, to complete the program.

1431
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:29,021
You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

1432
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:33,984
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... Cheeky mouse.

1433
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:41,033
Zaphod! Trillian!

1434
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,410
- [whirring]
- Ford.

1435
01:33:43,494 --> 01:33:44,995
What was in that food?

1436
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:48,832
What was in my tea?

1437
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,502
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1438
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:54,838
[grunts and whimpers]

1439
01:33:54,922 --> 01:33:56,965
Just wait a sodding minute.

1440
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,635
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1441
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:01,386
What about, what's 6x7?

1442
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,057
Or, um, uh, how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

1443
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:08,894
Here's one: how many roads
must a man walk down?

1444
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,231
Hey, that's not bad.

1445
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:14,024
Fine.

1446
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:18,737
Fine, take it, 'cause my head
is filled with questions,

1447
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,073
and no answer to any one of them

1448
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:24,826
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

1449
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,495
Except for one.

1450
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:29,540
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

1451
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,250
Is she the one?

1452
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:35,754
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

1453
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:41,385
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1454
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:44,346
And for one week,

1455
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:49,226
one week in my sad little...
blip of an existence...

1456
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,981
...it made me happy.

1457
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:57,109
That's a good answer.

1458
01:34:57,234 --> 01:35:00,445
[mouse] We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1459
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:04,199
- What's this "is she the one?" tripe?
- Take his brain!

1460
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:07,452
No, don't take the brain!
Don't take the brain, mice!

1461
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:10,539
[grunts]

1462
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,793
[screams]

1463
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:18,213
- [screams]
- It wasn't me!

1464
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,173
- [gibbers]
- [Zaphod] I'm famous.

1465
01:35:20,257 --> 01:35:22,634
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him!

1466
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,177
Oh, bollocks!

1467
01:35:24,303 --> 01:35:25,804
Agghh!

1468
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,730
I'm gonna be sick.

1469
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:38,984
[coughs] Belgium.

1470
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:42,321
[voices]

1471
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:45,282
[vibrations]

1472
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,620
Follow me.

1473
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,789
[Vogons] Left, right, left, right.

1474
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:55,375
Attention!

1475
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:01,840
[Marvin] Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

1476
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:04,176
Though I can't say I blame you.

1477
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,971
Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

1478
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:10,349
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

1479
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:11,808
Fire!

1480
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:15,228
No! No!

1481
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,359
[Marvin] What's all the fuss about?

1482
01:36:20,484 --> 01:36:23,320
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy. Ooh.

1483
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:28,533
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1484
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:39,670
Now I've got a headache...
headache... headache...

1485
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:49,846
Marvin!

1486
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,223
[Zaphod] Oh, no.

1487
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:56,728
- [Ford's battle shriek]
- He's got a towel, run away!

1488
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:01,900
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1489
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:08,824
We need that gun.

1490
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:11,827
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start!

1491
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:14,955
Come on. Oh, fire, fire!

1492
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,415
Fire, fire!

1493
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:19,626
[Arthur] Oo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

1494
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,255
[Vogon] He's locked it
from the other side.

1495
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,465
We'll have to go the other way.

1496
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,509
Come on, let's go!

1498
01:37:32,806 --> 01:37:35,308
Stop!

1499
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:39,604
[Arthur] Oh, no!

1500
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:45,485
[Zaphod] Stop it! Stop it!
Stop shooting at us!

01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:08,258

1504
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:14,598
I can't face another day.

1505
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:18,268
What's the point?

1506
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:28,570
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1507
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,162
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1508
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:40,499
[Vogons groaning]

1509
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,920
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1510
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:48,256
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

1511
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:51,510
[Vogons moaning]

1512
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,765
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

1513
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:59,643
[workman] Take it away.

1514
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:10,028
You could do all of that,
but it's not gonna... Well, I'll ask...

1515
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,489
I'll just ask.

1516
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:16,368
I... I... I've just been informed
by some of the lads

1517
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:18,912
that since we're so near completion,

1518
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:21,373
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1519
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:22,999
Oh.

1520
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:27,128
We... well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1521
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:30,549
Unless there's, um...

1522
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:34,177
There's, you know,
anything you want to change.

1523
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:41,601
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1524
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:46,356
Yeah. Me.

1525
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:49,067
Oh! Um, hello?

1526
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:52,863
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1527
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:56,408
Let's go somewhere.

1528
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,077
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1529
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:02,414
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1530
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:05,584
I am a little peckish.

1531
01:40:07,586 --> 01:40:10,380
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1532
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:16,094
- I think. I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1533
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:19,806
All right, let's trip the
light fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

1534
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,766
Come on.

1535
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:25,937
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I going to need it?

1536
01:40:26,021 --> 01:40:29,441
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1537
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:33,486
I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel.

1538
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:41,453
OK. Hold tight.

anyone cares what I say,

[Guide] It is, of course, well known
that careless talk costs lives.

1578
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,757
But the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated.

1579
01:45:04,883 --> 01:45:08,511
For instance, at the very moment
that Arthur Dent said,

1580
01:45:08,595 --> 01:45:12,182
"I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel",

1581
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:16,853
a freak wormhole opened up in
the fabric of the space-time continuum

1582
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:20,398
and carried his words far,
far back in time,

1583
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:24,569
across almost infinite reaches of space,
to a distant galaxy

1584
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:28,323
where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink

1585
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,909
of frightful interstellar battle.

1586
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:35,538
The two opposing leaders, resplendent
in their black-jeweled battle shorts

1587
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,624
were meeting for the last time,

1588
01:45:37,749 --> 01:45:40,543
when a dreadful silence fell.

1589
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,587
And at that very moment,

1590
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:46,674
the words "I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel"

1591
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:49,761
drifted across the conference table.

1592
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,555
Unfortunately, in their native tongue,

1593
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:55,600
this was the most appalling
insult imaginable.

1594
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:57,352
So the opposing battle fleets

1595
01:45:57,435 --> 01:46:00,021
decided to settle
their remaining differences,

1596
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:03,483
in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy,

1597
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:07,695
now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark.

1598
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:11,032
For thousands of years,
the mighty starships tore across

1599
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:16,621
the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet Earth,

1600
01:46:16,663 --> 01:46:20,708
where, due to
a terrible miscalculation of scale,

1601
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:25,630
the entire battle fleet was
accidentally swallowed by a small dog.

1602
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:29,300
Those who study the complex
interplay of cause and effect

1603
01:46:29,425 --> 01:46:31,135
in the history of the universe

1604
01:46:31,261 --> 01:46:35,807
say that this sort of thing
is going on all the time.

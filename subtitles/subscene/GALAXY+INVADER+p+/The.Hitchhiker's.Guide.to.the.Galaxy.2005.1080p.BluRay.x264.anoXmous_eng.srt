00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
<i>It's an important and popular fact</i>

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>that things are not always
what they seem.</i>

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>For instance, on the planet Earth,
man had always assumed</i>

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet,</i>

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,400
<i>instead of the third most intelligent.</i>

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>The second most intelligent creatures
were dolphins, who, curiously enough,</i>

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth.</i>

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>They'd made many attempts
to alert mankind,</i>

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
<i>but most of their communications
were misinterpreted</i>

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,100
<i>as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for tidbits.</i>

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,700
<i>So they eventually decided they would
leave Earth by their own means.</i>

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>The last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted</i>

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,300
<i>as a sophisticated attempt
to do a backward somersault</i>

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,400
<i>through a hoop, whistling
The Star-Spangled Banner.</i>

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>In fact, the message was this:</i>

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,200
<i>"So long and thanks for all the fish."</i>

19
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>The extraordinary story
of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>

20
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>begins very simply.</i>

21
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>It begins with a man.</i>

22
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,500
Ooh!

23
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>An Earthman, to be precise.</i>

24
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>Who no more knows his destiny,</i>

25
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,800
<i>than a tea leaf knows the history
of the East India Company.</i>

26
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,900
<i>His name is Arthur Dent.</i>

27
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,200
<i>He is a five-foot-eight-inch-tall
ape descendant</i>

28
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,300
<i>and someone is trying to drive
a bypass through his house.</i>

29
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
What do I want you to do about it?
Find him

30
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,900
and tell him I'm currently lying
flat on my back in front of...

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,300
Fine, I'll hold.

32
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,100
You can't lie in front
of the bulldozers for ever.

33
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

34
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,700
This bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built.

35
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
- Why has it got to be built?
- It's a bypass.

36
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,400
You've got to build bypasses. Besides,
you should've protested months ago.

37
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,900
The plans have been on display
at the planning office for a year.

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,700
On display?
I had to go down to a cellar.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,100
Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer

40
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,700
if I just let it roll straight over you?

41
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,800
- How much?
- None at all.

42
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,800
<i>By a strange coincidence,
none at all</i>

43
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
<i>is exactly how much suspicion
ape-descendant Arthur had</i>

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>that one of his closest friends</i>

45
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,200
<i>was not descended from an ape,
but was, in fact, from a small planet</i>

46
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,600
<i>somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</i>

47
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,900
Arthur! Arthur!

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
- Ford!
- Yes?

49
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
Here.

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
Ah, there you are!

51
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,700
Eat, drink. We gotta talk.

52
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,100
Now's not the best time.
They're going to demolish my home.

53
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Whoa! You already...
You already know? How?

54
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,600
What do you m...?

55
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, they, they? When you say
"they" you mean they? Got it.

56
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Listen. I got somethin' important
I gotta tell you. Right now.

57
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,800
Well, what about my house?

58
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,800
Workers of the Earth, I bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer!

59
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,200
- Good. Let's go to the pub.
- Huh?

60
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,200
They won't demolish it
until they've finished the beers.

61
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,700
- Can we trust 'em?
- To the end of the Earth.

62
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
- How far's that?
- About 12 minutes away.

63
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Huh?

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

65
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,400
Six pints coming up.

66
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,200
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.

67
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,600
Three pints each? At lunchtime?

68
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,200
Sorry. Ah. Time is an illusion.

69
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,400
Lunchtime, doubly so.

70
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,300
And eat those peanuts,
because you'll need the salt.

71
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...

72
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,700
What if I told you
I really wasn't from Guildford?

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,200
I was from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

74
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
Is that something
you're likely to say?

75
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Remember when we met?

76
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Out the way!

77
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,800
- Oof!
- Hi.

78
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,900
Wasn't it strange I was trying
to shake hands with a car?

79
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,500
I assumed you were drunk.

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,700
I thought cars were the dominant
life form. I was introducing myself.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,200
You saved my life. And now
I'm saving yours. Please drink.

82
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,600
It must be Thursday. I could never get
the hang of Thursdays.

83
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,100
- If this is about your house...
- No, it's not about the house.

84
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
- Who's he?
- She. She.

85
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,900
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy-dress party.

86
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,400
<i>I hate those kind of parties.</i>

87
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,400
<i>I'd rather have stayed at home
and ironed my hankies.</i>

88
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,700
<i>- But there I was.
- Who are you?</i>

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,500
<i>- Oh!
- And there she was.</i>

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,300
- Uh, Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Oh, no. I mean, who are you?

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, the costume? Right.
"Livingstone, I presume!"

92
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, it's not as clever as Darwin,
but the best I could do at short notice.

93
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
You're the first to get that right.

94
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,200
- Really?
- Yes. Everyone calls me Santa.

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,800
- Right.
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway.

96
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,500
So did I.

97
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
People at these parties
are drunken idiots.

98
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,500
What?

99
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,900
All these people are idiots!
God!

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,700
That's awkward.

101
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,600
Tell me.

102
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,300
She was amazing though, Ford.

103
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
<i>Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon.</i>

104
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,100
Uh, without the beard,
you look at least 80 years younger.

105
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
Maybe I'm de-evolving.

106
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,600
Well, I should tell you
that I do not date

107
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,400
single-celled organisms, okay?

108
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Let's go somewhere.

109
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,600
Yeah. Definitely.
Um, where do you have in mind?

110
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,700
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?

111
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,100
No, it's a country
off the coast of Africa.

112
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
That Madagascar?
Why are we waiting here?

113
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,300
Wait a sec.

114
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
Go.

115
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,600
God, you're serious.
Um, I can't go to Madagascar.

116
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
- Why not?
- Because, I just, you know...

117
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

118
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,900
I want to go somewhere I've never been
and I'd like to go with you, so...

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
...what do you say, Dr Livingstone?

120
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
I say that's
an extraordinary proposition.

121
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I can't go. I mean, I've got a job.

122
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Quit. Get a new one
when you come back.

123
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,100
I don't even know your real name.
Ow! Ow!

124
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,600
- Tricia McMillan.
- Well, Tricia McMillan.

125
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,100
Um, I have a proposition for you.

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,100
Why don't we go somewhere
a little closer first, say Cornwall,

127
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,100
and we'll see how it goes.

128
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Right, of course, Cornwall.

129
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey, excuse me.

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Is this guy boring you?

131
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,100
Why don't you talk to me instead?

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm from a different planet.

133
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,300
It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

134
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,500
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat-up line is that?

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,700
Mm, that does happen.

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Speaking of...

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
We've got two minutes.
Drink up.

138
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
That's my house.

139
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,100
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone, on me.

140
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,900
You really think
the world's going to end?

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Yes.

142
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,100
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

143
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,100
- If you like.
- Will it help?

144
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,900
Not at all. See you.

145
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,200
Last orders!

146
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,800
- What is that?
- Run!

147
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Look out!

148
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,700
Aha! Towel!

149
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Arthur!

150
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,800
What the hell are those things?

151
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,500
Yeow! They're ships
from a Vogon constructor fleet.

152
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,700
I picked up their signal this morning.
You'll need this.

153
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,300
- What are you doing?
- We're hitching a ride.

154
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Um, people of Earth,

155
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,800
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the
Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.

156
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,500
As you are probably aware,

157
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,100
plans for the development of the
outlying regions of the galaxy

158
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,800
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

159
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,100
<i>And your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition.</i>

160
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,600
<i>There's no point
acting surprised about it.</i>

161
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,200
<i>The plans have been on display</i>

162
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,000
<i>at your local planning office
in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years.</i>

163
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,900
<i>If you can't be bothered with
local affairs, that's your lookout.</i>

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Apathetic bloody planet.

165
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,600
I've no sympathy at all.

166
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,300
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

167
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
<i>is a wholly remarkable book.</i>

168
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,700
<i>Perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful,</i>

169
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,800
<i>ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor.</i>

170
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,200
<i>More popular than
The Celestial Homecare Omnibus,</i>

171
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,100
<i>better selling than
53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity,</i>

172
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
<i>and more controversial than
Oolon Colluphid's trilogy</i>

173
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,400
<i>of philosophical blockbusters,
Where God Went Wrong,</i>

174
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes,

175
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>and Who Is This God Person Anyway?</i>

176
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,200
<i>It's already supplanted
the Encyclopedia Galactica</i>

177
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
<i>as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom</i>

178
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,000
<i>for two important reasons.</i>

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
<i>First, it's slightly cheaper,</i>

180
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,800
<i>and second, it has the words
"Don't Panic"</i>

181
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,400
<i>printed in large,
friendly letters on its cover.</i>

182
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,900
So you're not from Guildford?

183
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

184
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Um, you're not an out-of-work actor,

185
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,500
but rather a writer for this,
this book thing.

186
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
Good, huh?

187
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,500
I don't feel well.
I need a cup of tea.

188
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,000
If I asked where we were,
would I regret it?

189
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,400
- We're safe for now.
- Good.

190
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,300
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

191
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,900
- Oh, get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.

193
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,300
You don't remember.

194
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,700
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell
you. It's unfortunate, but it's true.

195
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Your home planet has been blown up.

196
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,700
Huh, blown up.

197
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Couldn't you have done something?

198
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,900
I saved your life.
Okay, that makes us even.

199
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,900
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here, you've...

200
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
...gotta know where your towel is.

201
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay, give me a hand over here.

202
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

203
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,900
Before the Vogons find us.

204
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

205
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,400
Huh?

206
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,200
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

207
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,200
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

208
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,000
Vogons.

209
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,200
<i>Vogons are one of the
most unpleasant races in the galaxy.</i>

210
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,600
<i>Not evil, but bad-tempered,
bureaucratic, officious and callous.</i>

211
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers</i>

212
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,600
<i>from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast
of Traal without orders</i>

213
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,100
<i>signed in triplicate,
sent in, sent back,</i>

214
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,500
<i>queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry,</i>

215
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months</i>

216
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,900
<i>and recycled as firelighters.</i>

217
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,100
<i>On no account should you allow
a Vogon to read poetry to you.</i>

218
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,300
They can't think or imagine.
Most can't spell. They just run things.

219
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Hmm?

220
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
And if we don't get a ride soon,

221
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,100
we won't need the Guide to tell us
how unpleasant the Vogons are.

222
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,600
They've already destroyed
a planet today.

223
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,000
That always makes them a little eee!

224
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Ughh! What is that?

225
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,100
- Put this in your ear.
- Huh?

226
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,800
<i>We have unwittingly
picked up a couple of hitchhikers.</i>

227
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,600
The fish is translating for you.

228
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,700
<i>The Babel fish
is small, yellow, leech-like,</i>

229
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,100
<i>and probably the oddest thing
in the universe.</i>

230
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,600
<i>It feeds on brainwave energy,
absorbing unconscious frequencies,</i>

231
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,300
<i>and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies</i>

232
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
<i>to the speech centers of the brain.</i>

233
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,300
<i>The practical upshot of which is that,
if you stick one in your ear,</i>

234
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,000
<i>you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language.</i>

235
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,600
Resistance is useless.

236
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
- All right.
- Someone's coming.

237
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Here we go. Look lively.

238
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,100
Wheee!

239
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Ha, ha!

240
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,000
- Hmmm.
- Sir.

241
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,800
- What?
- Hitchhikers.

242
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,600
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."

243
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,200
No, really, you don't have to read.

244
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,000
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

245
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,300
"... as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee."

246
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,700
<i>Vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe.</i>

247
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,100
<i>The second worst
is that of the Azgoths of Kria.</i>

248
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,700
<i>During a recitation by their
Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent,</i>

249
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,700
<i>of his poem
Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty</i>

250
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
I Found in my Armpit
One Midsummer Morning,

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,700
<i>four of his audience
died of internal hemorrhaging,</i>

252
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,400
<i>and the President of the
Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council</i>

253
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,900
<i>survived by gnawing
one of his own legs off.</i>

254
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
"Or I will rend thee
in the gobberwarts..."

255
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,900
"... with my blurgle..."

256
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
<i>The absolute worst poetry was
by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.</i>

257
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,000
<i>Luckily, it was destroyed
when the Earth was.</i>

258
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,800
"See if I don't." Yeah.

259
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,400
So, Earthlings,
I present you with a choice.

260
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,600
Either die in the vacuum of space,

261
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,500
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

262
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,000
A... a... actually, I rather liked it.

263
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,900
- That's good. Run with it.
- Hmmm.

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Uh, some of the words
I didn't understand,

266
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,900
but I found the imagery quite effective.

267
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,100
Continue.

268
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,900
Well, uh, yes,
interesting rhythmic devices,

269
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,500
which seemed to counterpoint

270
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,200
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of...

271
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,600
- Vogonity!
- Vogonity, sorry, vogonity...

272
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,000
of the poet's soul.

273
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,900
So what you're saying is,

274
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,500
I write poetry because

275
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

276
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I just want to be loved?

277
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes, yes, yes.

278
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,900
Yes, yes, yeah, please.

279
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Ahh, ooh, ooh, mmm.

280
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Throw them off the ship!

281
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,600
- No! No!
- Ford. Ford!

282
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,200
Ahh!

283
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,600
All right! All right!

284
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,200
Resistance is useless!

285
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,400
Shut up! Get a job!
Wash your filthy hands!

286
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,200
Don't panic. Don't panic.

287
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,300
So this is it?
We're going to die?

288
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, we're gonna die.

289
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,100
No, no, what's this?

290
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,800
What is this?

291
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,200
What's this? This is... nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

292
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,900
You're sweating.

293
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,500
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

294
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,700
<i>"Space," says the introduction
to The Hitchhiker's Guide,</i>

295
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,300
<i>"is big. Really big."</i>

296
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,700
<i>"You just won't believe how vastly,
hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."</i>

297
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,700
<i>A... a... and so on.</i>

298
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,800
<i>It also says that
if you hold a lungful of air,</i>

299
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,300
<i>you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about 30 seconds.</i>

300
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600
<i>But with space being really big and all,</i>

301
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,300
<i>the chances of being picked up
within that time</i>

302
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,600
<i>are two to the power of two billion,</i>

303
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,700
<i>79 million, 460 thousand,</i>

304
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,700
<i>347 to one against.</i>

305
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,600
<i>By a staggering coincidence,</i>

306
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,300
<i>it's also the phone number

<i>where Arthur went to a fancy dress party</i>

308

<i>and met a very nice young woman

309
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,600
<i>Though the planet Earth,
the Islington flat and telephone</i>

310
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,400
<i>have all now been demolished, Ford
and Arthur were, in fact, rescued.</i>

311
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,300
- Ford?
- Yes.

312
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,400
- I think I'm a sofa.
- I know how you feel.

313
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,600
So much for the laws of physics.

314
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,500
<i>And our top story.</i>

315
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,900
<i>The sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe,</i>

316
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,900
<i>the starship Heart of Gold.</i>

317
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>Stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other</i>

318
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,500
<i>than Galactic President
Zaphod Beeblebrox.</i>

319
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,800
<i>In the name of people, freedom,
and, uh... democracy, stuff like that,</i>

320
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,000
<i>I hereby kidnap myself
and I'm taking the ship with me. Whoo!</i>

321
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
<i>Come on!</i>

322
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
<i>Beeblebrox,
universally considered</i>

<i>to be the dimmest star

<i>is most famous for his controversial

<i>who claimed many thought they were

<i>in the universe contest.</i>

327
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,900
Great.

328
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,900
<i>Kavula is best remembered
for his slanderous</i>

329
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,600
<i>"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign.</i>

330
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,100
Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.

331
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,600
If there's anything more important than
my ego, I want it caught and shot now.

332
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,400
Come on, I love it.

333
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
<i>Zaphod's just this guy, you know.</i>

334
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What d'you...?

335
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,800
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.

336
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,500
Hitchhikers?
Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

337
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
I didn't. The ship did.

338
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
What? Wh... wh... Say what?

339
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,500
When we engaged the
Improbability Drive... The big button.

340
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
- I know.
- They were picked up here.

341
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,100
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Wait.
That's where you picked me up.

342
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,100
- On Earth.
- That's impossible.

343
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,500
- No, just very improbable.
- Listen. I don't have time for this.

344
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,900
We've got the police of half the galaxy
after us. We've stopped for hitchhikers.

345
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,300
So ten out of ten for style, but...

346
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,900
...minus several million
for good thinking.

347
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,200
You're too gorgeous, baby, stop it.
You drive me crazy.

348
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

349
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,700
Marvin.

350
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,700
You ought to know,
I'm feeling very depressed.

351
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,200
Well, we have something
that should take your mind off things.

352
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,000
It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

353
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,100
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

354
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

355
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,500
Just that? I won't enjoy it.

356
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Yeah, well, that's life.

357
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,500
Life?
Don't talk to me about life.

358
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,200
<i>- Commander Kwaltz.
- Yes.</i>

359
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,600
<i>We have located the spaceship
Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.</i>

360
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>- Where?
- Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.</i>

361
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,400
<i>Requesting hyperspace clearance.</i>

362
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

363
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Get me Vice-President Questular.</i>

364
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,500
<i>Hyperspace permission granted, captain.</i>

365
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,900
Here we go.

366
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,200
I think that door just sighed.

367
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,800
Ghastly, isn't it?

368
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
All the doors have been programmed

369
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,500
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition.

370
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,500
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

371
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Please yourselves.

372
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Here I am,
brain the size of a planet,

373
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,400
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge.

374
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,000
Call that job satisfaction?
'Cause I don't.

375
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
You can thank the Sirius Cybernetics
Corp. For building robots with G.P.P.

376
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,400
- What's G.P.P.?
- Genuine People Personalities.

377
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,900
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

378
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,600
Arthur?

379
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,100
<i>Hey, Slim, are you wearing
my underwear? 'Cause I'm wearing yours.</i>

380
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,000
<i>And they ain't doing the trick.
Come on. All right.</i>

381
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,100
Oh, for heaven's sake.

382
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,100
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

383
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,300
Ah-ha! Ow!

384
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Freeze!

385
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,000
Freeze?
I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

386
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,700
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- Oh, why do I bother?

387
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,600
- Zaphod?
- Ford!

388
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,100
Is that you?
Ford! Praxibetel Ix!

389
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
What the hell are you doing here?

390
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,700
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.

391
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,600
- That is so you.
- Look at you!

392
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,100
President of the Galaxy.
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

393
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,900
You zarkin' frood.

394
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,300
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

395
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,500
Oh.

396
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,500
President of the Galaxy. This is my
cousin. He's a semi-half brother...

397
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,200
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We've met.

398
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,800
Have we? I'm sorry.
I've got a terrible memory for species.

399
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,200
This is him, Ford. The would-you-like-
to-see-my-spaceship bloke.

400
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,700
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

401
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,000
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia!

402
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian.

403
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,500
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

404
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

405
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Um, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

406
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,700
You went down on that little planet
and didn't call me?

407
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Sorry, I didn't know.
I had a galaxy to run.

408
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,000
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

409
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,300
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

410
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,900
I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.

411
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,600
Right. I was thinking
of changing mine to,

412
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
I don't know, Arthoolia.

413
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
That's a good one.
Well, this is weird.

414
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,400
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.

415
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,100
- Right. In your pajamas?
- I was in a hurry.

416
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Okay. Did you know I was here?

417
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,100
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

418
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,900
Yeah, that's kinda like
the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

419
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,100
Okay, um, look.

420
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,000
I left you at the party. I feel bad, but
I was gonna call you when I got back.

421
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Well, there is no
going back now, is there?

422
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,700
You do know what happened?

423
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,700
Enough small talk.
We're on the run, remember?

424
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Excuse me, we're having a chat.

425
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,200
Well, I think the girl's getting...
Boo!

426
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,600
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut
your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

427
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,300
- You wanna fight?
- Okay.

428
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,200
- No. No.
- I'm just kidding.

429
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,700
I'm a kidder. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

430
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,500
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

431
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,100
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah!

432
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,700
Teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

433
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,100
He's a guest on my ship!

434
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,200
I thought you said you stole it.

435
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,700
Stole what?
What are we talking about?

436
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,400
Whoa! That doesn't sound good.

437
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,400
- Are you okay?
- Just fabulous, thanks, "Trill".

438
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,200
A little help over here.
I'm in over my head.

439
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,700
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

440
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,100
Yes, I do!

441
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,300
Hey, this is really pretty.

442
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,000
- Don't!
- Whoo! They're on our tail.

443
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,500
Fire a gun. Launch a missile.
Do some damage!

444
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Ow! Stop that! Ow!

445
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,200
Just kiddin'. I love it rough. Hit me.

446
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
<i>- Uh, computer?
- Hi, there.</i>

447
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,300
<i>I'm Eddie, your computer.</i>

448
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,200
<i>I'm pleased to report that it's
a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers.</i>

449
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,600
<i>They're sending you a message.</i>

450
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,000
<i>This is Vice-President Questular Rontok.</i>

451
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,500
<i>I am speaking to the kidnapper
of the President?</i>

452
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,800
She digs me.

453
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,100
<i>Surrender the stolen vessel at once</i>

454
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,700
<i>or we will take action
as defined and permitted by...</i>

455
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,700
<i>section 1-8 of the Galactic Interstellar
Space Bylaws...</i>

456
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,200
<i>Zaphod, please come back now.
This is ridiculous.</i>

457
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,000
Leap to hyperspace! Come on!

458
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,700
<i>Sure thing, fella!</i>

459
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,700
No.

460
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,300
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorization?

461
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,200
- No, commander.
- Oh.

462
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,700
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

463
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm coming, sir.

464
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,500
I'm boiling!
Oh, oh. Here's the form, sir.

465
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,500
So are you along for the ride
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

466
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,900
That depends. Where are you going?

467
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Where am I going?

468
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,500
- You okay?
- Yeah. Don't suppose there's any tea.

469
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

470
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,300
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

471
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,800
<i>The best drink in existence
is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster,</i>

472
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,600
<i>the effect of which is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon</i>

473
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,200
<i>wrapped round a large gold brick.</i>

474
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,900
- Belgium. Hold it one second.
- Belgium.

475
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,800
Ape-man, Earth dude, sorry,
what's your name again?

476
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,300
- Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

477
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,800
No hard feelings, okay?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

478
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,700
- Earth.
- Yeah. I liked Earth.

479
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Got these boots there.
But don't mention it to the girl.

480
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,600
Because if you do... I'll pull your
spleen out through your throat.

481
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,600
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- Okay.

482
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,700
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

483
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,500
Hey, hey, Zaphod,
what's with the two-head thing?

484
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,200
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't be
president with a whole brain.

485
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,300
It's crazy.

486
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

487
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,800
Parts of my personality weren't exactly
what you'd call presidential.

488
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,800
You know what I'm talkin' about.

489
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,100
<i>Your tea is ready.</i>

490
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,900
I suppose I should've said
it resembles tea.

491
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,800
So, two heads
is what does it for a girl?

492
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or three...

493
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,400
Or your own spaceship.

494
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
Anything else he's got two of?

495
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,900
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

496
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,200
What am I supposed to be like?
Green? Bleeping?

497
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,100
I can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like.

498
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay, look. Do you see this?

499
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,100
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

500
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,500
<i>Enjoy your doughnut.</i>

501
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you see this?

502
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,800
This toasts bread
while you're slicing it.

503
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,700
We're on a spaceship, Arthur. In space.

504
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,700
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

505
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,000
That was... some sort of test.
And I failed.

506
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,600
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

507
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
No, I mean your chin.

508
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,000
- Ah...
- I might have an aspirin.

509
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,500
Right.

510
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,400
Hey!

511
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,300
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

512
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,700
- Please, don't.
- Showtime, Trill.

513
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

514
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,700
Buttons aren't toys.

515
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,000
Anyway... When I saw
what I'm about to show you,

516
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,700
that's when I realized
why I had to do what I did to my brain.

517
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,000
I think. It's all a little...

518
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
...shaky.

519
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,000
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

520
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>Many millions of years ago,</i>

521
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,300
<i>a race of hyper intelligent,
pan-dimensional beings</i>

522
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
<i>got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life,</i>

523
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
<i>that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best</i>

524
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,800
<i>to design and build
a stupendous super-computer</i>

525
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,300
<i>to calculate the answer to life,
the universe and everything.</i>

526
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
O Deep Thought,

527
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,700
we want you to tell us the answer.

528
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
<i>The answer to what?</i>

529
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,700
The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

530
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,900
We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

531
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,700
<i>Hmm, I'd have to think about that.</i>

532
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,600
Return to this place in exactly
seven-and-a-half million years.

533
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,400
- Is it finished?
- No, there's more. They go back.

534
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,600
- Seven-and-a-half million years later?
- That's right, they do.

535
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,700
Deep Thought, do you have...

536
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,300
<i>An answer for you?
Yes, but you're not going to like it.</i>

537
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,500
<i>- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- All right.</i>

538
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,600
<i>The answer to the ultimate question...</i>

539
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,200
<i>...of life, the universe
and everything...</i>

540
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,000
<i>...is...</i>

541
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
<i>...42.</i>

542
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah? What?

543
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,800
42?

544
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,100
<i>Yes, I thought it over
quite thoroughly. It's 42.</i>

545
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,500
<i>It would've been simpler
to have known what the question was.</i>

546
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,400
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything!

547
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,400
<i>That's not a question.</i>

548
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,200
<i>Only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means.</i>

549
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,900
<i>- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can't. But there is one who can.</i>

550
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
<i>A computer that will calculate
the ultimate question.</i>

551
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,700
<i>A computer of such infinite complexity,</i>

552
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,800
<i>that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix.</i>

553
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,100
<i>And you yourselves shall take on new,
more primitive forms,</i>

554
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,900
<i>and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10-million-year program.</i>

555
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,800
<i>I shall design this computer for you,
and it shall be called...</i>

556
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,800
- That's it?
- That's it.

557
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,800
You're looking for
the ultimate question? You? Why?

558
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,600
I tried that.
Why? 42. Doesn't work.

559
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,600
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why...

560
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,200
...do you want to know
the ultimate question?

561
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,900
Partly curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

562
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,400
but, uh, mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

563
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,700
You're President of the Galaxy.

564
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,600
- Yes, Arman.
- Arthur.

565
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,200
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.

566
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,100
I find the question, that's permanent.
It sticks.

567
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,700
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep.
Win-win.

568
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,100
We just hit that button and bam,
we're at Magrathea, I think.

569
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,400
We've hit it twice and
we're still not there, but anyway...

570
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,900
- You in?
- Always.

571
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,800
- All right!
- Uh, I want to get off.

572
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,300
- Uh, sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This!

573
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,300
<i>The Infinite Improbability Drive
is a wonderful new method</i>

574
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,200
<i>of crossing interstellar distances
in a few seconds,</i>

575
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,400
<i>without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.</i>

576
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,800
<i>As the Improbability Drive
reaches infinite improbability,</i>

577
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,900
<i>it passes through every conceivable
point in every conceivable universe</i>

578
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,700
<i>almost simultaneously.</i>

579
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,900
<i>So you're never sure
where you'll end up</i>

580
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
<i>or even what species you'll be
when you get there.</i>

581
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,600
<i>It's therefore important
to dress accordingly.</i>

582
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,100
<i>The Drive was invented following
research into finite improbability</i>

583
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,300
<i>often used to break the ice at parties</i>

584
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,600
<i>by making all the molecules
in the hostess's undergarments</i>

585
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
<i>leap one foot to the left</i>

586
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,300
<i>in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy.</i>

587
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,000
<i>Many physicists said they
wouldn't stand for that sort of thing,</i>

588
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,200
<i>partly because it debased science,</i>

589
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,300
<i>but mostly because they didn't get
invited to those sort of parties.</i>

590
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,000
Wow, is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button?

591
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,000
Very probably, yes.

592
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,100
Ah, I think
the Earthman's about to be sick.

593
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,000
In the trashcan, ape-man.
This ship's new.

594
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,700
Aw, come on!

595
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,500
We have normality.

596
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,200
Did it work? Are we there?

597
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,200
Yeah. We're here. Magrathea!

598
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't think so. Eddie...

599
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,100
- Ow!
- What planet is this?

600
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,000
<i>I'm checking for you.</i>

601
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Did you just pluck
one of my hairs? Off my head?

602
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,800
<i>Thank you for waiting.
Sorry to disappoint,</i>

603
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,900
<i>but this is not Magrathea.</i>

604
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,800
<i>We are currently in orbit around
the planet Viltvodle Six.</i>

605
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,600
Humma Kavula!

606
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,600
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

607
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,700
Humma Kavula!

608
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,900
<i>In the beginning,
the universe was created.</i>

609
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,800
<i>This made a lot of people very angry,
and is widely regarded as a bad move.</i>

610
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,200
<i>Many races believed it was created
by some sort of god,</i>

611
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,900
<i>though the Jatravartid people
of Viltvodle Six</i>

612
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,900
<i>firmly believe that the entire universe
was sneezed out of the nose of a being</i>

613
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
<i>called the Great Green Arkleseizure.</i>

614
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,500
Humma Kavula!

615
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,000
<i>The Jatravartids,
who lived in fear</i>

616
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,500
<i>of the time they called the
Coming of the Great White Handkerchief,</i>

617
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,400
<i>were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each.</i>

618
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,100
<i>They were unique in being
the only race in history</i>

619
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,800
<i>to have invented
the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.</i>

620
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Mr. President!

621
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,600
Hey, all right. How you doin'?

622
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,300
Hey, what have we here? I love it!

623
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,300
Hey, I love you. Fantastic!

624
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,100
You guys related? Don't go changing.

625
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,300
Arthur, I want a drink.

626
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,600
I think I've been here before.
Have I been here before?

627
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
Ixxie!

628
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,300
- I've been here before.
- Humma Kavula!

629
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,200
Come on.

630
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,100
Tricia! Tricia, I...

631
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,500
Hello, Humma.

632
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,400
- Join us. Sit down.
- Good to see you. Thanks. All right.

633
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,600
The handkerchief is coming.

634
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:07,500
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

635
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,200
So that's Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.

636
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,200
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown,

637
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,400
in reverence to you.

638
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Send the handkerchief, O Blessed One,
so that it may wipe us clean.

639
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,800
We ask this and all things
in Thy precious and alliterative name.

640
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,600
Bless you.

641
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,500
We goin' in here?

642
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,400
All right, I like it. It's big,
it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants.

643
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,100
Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous President.

644
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,900
What brings you to our humble planet?

645
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,500
Oh, I think you know
why I'm here.

646
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,200
No, I don't think I do.

647
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,700
I think you think you don't.
But we both know... you do.

648
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,600
Eloquent as always.

649
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,500
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

650
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,700
That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

651
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,200
when you were my opponent
running against me,

652
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,200
you said I was stupid.

653
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,300
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

654
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,600
...if memory serves, you won,

655
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,000
proving that good looks
and charm win

656
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,000
over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

657
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,600
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

658
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,200
Excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir.

659
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,500
Uh, I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix up

660
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,900
'cause, actually, he's not with us.

661
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

662
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,800
He grew, didn't he. He's not that tall.

663
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,900
You didn't come half-way across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge.

664
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Why are you here?

665
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,700
Of course not,
that's, that's ridiculous.

666
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:39,400
I've been stranded on a strange planet
for years, I haven't been avoiding you.

667
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,600
You look great. You're doing well.

668
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,400
You've grown, obviously.

669
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,600
- Aggh! Oomph!
- Wait! We don't know why we're here.

670
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,200
We were trying to get to Magrathea
and our ship brought us here.

671
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,300
How very, very improbable.

672
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,600
I kept a few souvenirs
from my former life.

673
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,600
Ah, the heady days of space piracy.

674
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:18,300
But... even an Infinite Improbability
Drive requires coordinates.

675
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,900
Which I happen to have.

676
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,600
No, no, no.

677
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,100
You don't get something
for nothing, Zaphod.

678
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,800
You must bring me something in return.

679
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,800
- Wh... What?
- A gun.

680
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
- A gun?
- A very special gun.

681
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,300
Designed by the greatest computer
ever invented.

682
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,300
But the only way to find it
is to go to Magrathea.

683
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,900
Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

684
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,800
And what will you give me
to ensure your return?

685
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,000
My word as President.

686
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,800
No. I need a hostage.

687
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:04,500
Only... what does
Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

688
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,300
Come on.

689
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Oh, no!

690
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,100
Hey, take it easy now.

691
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,300
No, stop it.
Ah! Oh, that kind of tickles.

692
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,000
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.

693
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,000
You need me!

694
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,300
Come back! Come back!
Don't leave me alone.

695
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Come back!

696
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,200
I thought I alone
considered your boyfriend

697
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,900
a narcissistic moron,
but the whole galaxy does.

698
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,800
What about you?
"Excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir."

699
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,300
"We're not with him. We just came
to worship you." Very brave.

700
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,700
Where the hell is Ford?

701
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:05,000
By the left, march.
Left, right, left, right.

702
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,300
Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

703
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,000
Fire upon the kidnapper!

704
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,500
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

705
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,200
The President is the kidnapper.
You'll kill him!

706
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,200
Bang! Bang!

707
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
It's locked!

708
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,500
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

709
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,200
Come on, Zaphod.

710
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,500
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?

711
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,100
Field research. So they found
where we are? Belgium bummer!

712
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,900
They're shooting at us!
What are we going to do?

713
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,300
- I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?

714
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,900
What? He's the one they want.

715
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,200
You can't go out there.
What are you doing?

716
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,500
- Back off!
- What's going on?

717
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,400
I have the President
and I will kill him, I swear.

718
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,500
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

719
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,800
- It's an aerosol can.
- Oh.

720
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,500
Okay, frightened now,
frightened.

721
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,600
- Hi, little guy.
- Get her!

722
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,600
- Zaphod, no, come on!
- Arthur!

723
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,300
- Arthur!
- Tricia!

724
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,300
- Arthur!
- Tricia! Wait!

725
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,800
Arthur!

726
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,500
Resistance is useless!

727
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,300
<i>Bring her to Vogsphere
for processing, captain.</i>

728
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,800
Where's the circus?

729
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,500
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go!

730
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,100
Let's go!

731
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,700
Whoo! Computer, take us to Magrathea!

732
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,300
What? No, no, no.
We've got to go after Tricia.

733
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,800
- Who?
- Trillian.

734
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,400
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git!

735
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,600
Right, you're coming out!

736
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea, we want to follow the ships.

737
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,300
<i>I'd love to, but my
guidance system has been deactivated.</i>

738
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,500
Oh, come on!

739
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,000
<i>I'm sorry.
It wasn't my fault.</i>

740
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,100
What you doing on this ship?

741
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,800
- Ford?
- Marvin.

742
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,300
I've been talking
to the ship's computer.

743
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,100
And?

744
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,700
It hates me.

745
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,100
No, uh-uh. Eddie, computer,

746
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,600
is there another way
to follow the ships?

747
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,200
<i>Activating Emergency Escape
Pod. It's super-neat and fun to fly!</i>

748
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,600
Ow!

749
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,200
Unbelievable!

750
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,700
I'm in. I'm in.
Okay, Ford, do you have any idea?

751
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,400
We'll press this.

752
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

753
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,600
- This button.
- Okay. Nothing's... Okay!

754
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,700
Good man, good man, good man.

755
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,400
- Okay, we're wobbling...
- You forgot your towel.

756
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,000
Get him off me! I'll kill him!

757
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,600
- Okay, Ford, there's a...
- Is that better?

758
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,700
No, that's worse, that's worse.

759
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,100
- Do what... I don't need that.
- Okay.

760
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,900
Stop the rocking.
Marvin, any ideas?

761
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,600
I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

762
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,100
Thanks, Marv.

763
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,100
Ooh, ooh. Eee. Ooh, ooh.

764
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,200
Whoo!

765
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,800
Whee! Whee!

766
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,500
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,300
- Magrathea!
- No, we're on the Vogon planet.

768
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,000
- Yes, it is. It's Magrathea!
- This is Vogsphere.

769
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,200
- Yeah, Magrathea. I know it.
- No, it's not.

770
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,900
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is.

771
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,200
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

772
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,100
They have these
on Arcturan mega freighters.

773
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,700
They use them when
they need to concentrate.

774
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,200
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

775
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,000
There you go.

776
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,900
Should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

777
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,400
Now I'm feeling
much better about our predicament.

778
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,800
I checked the Guide for how
to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

779
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,100
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

780
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,700
Well, I kind of had this idea
that we could... Ow!

781
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,000
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

782
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,000
- What was it?
- Uh...

783
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,400
Nothing, it's, uh, nothing.
It's just my imagination.

784
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,800
Okay, right. Now, everyone just stop
a minute, please, and look at me.

785
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,800
There's... definitely
something going on here.

786
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Just... just watch.

787
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,300
Just watch.

788
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,700
Okay, I think we...

789
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,900
- Oooh!
- Ah-ha! You too!

790
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, what was that?

791
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,100
I thi...

792
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Zaphod, what do you think?

793
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,400
I think... Ow! Zarquon!
What was that? Jeez!

794
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,100
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

795
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,200
- No one ever does.
- I have an idea.

796
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Ford!
Kill it! Get rid of it!

797
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,700
Okay, don't think.

798
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,300
Nobody think. No ideas.

799
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,500
No theories. No nothing.

800
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,600
Ow!

801
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,300
This is crazy.
Trillian is in there somewhere.

802
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,200
- We need an idea to save her.
- I have an ide...

803
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,400
- Ah! Run!
- Yeeaaghh!

804
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,500
Ooh! Ah!

805
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,900
You're supposed to stop.

806
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,400
Okay, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

807
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,400
Okay, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

808
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,400
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

809
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,000
Okay, where is she?!

810
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,800
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

811
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:23,000
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus
of... Blaard?

812
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,400
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

813
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,100
Oh. Right.

814
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,100
Sorry, no record of Earth.

815
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,000
Galactic sector
ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

816
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,500
- Oh, yes.
- She's lying.

817
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,300
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

818
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,200
- Mmmm.
- Here we are. Earth.

819
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,700
Oh. Um, "destroyed."

820
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,200
Um, do you have
a second home planet?

821
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,900
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

822
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:10,100
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

823
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,700
Who in their right mind
gives an order to destroy a planet?

824
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,800
- He said the gray building, right?
- All the buildings are gray.

825
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,300
"Give me a hand." Ha-ha, very funny.

826
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,900
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

827
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
Go and fill that in.

828
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,900
Then, make sure, when you fill in
the facilitating form...

829
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,800
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

830
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,800
If you'd fill that form in for me,

831
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,600
and return it as soon as possible.

832
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:01,100
- Writing implements to your left...
- You're President. Can you do anything?

833
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,000
Presidents don't have power. Their job
is to draw attention away from it.

834
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,300
Hey, how you doin'?

835
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:15,100
Hey, it's me, your President!
What's goin' on? Thanks for coming.

836
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,000
All right. I know that sponge.
All right!

837
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,400
- Next!
- President coming through.

838
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,500
How you doin', Pinhead?
No, really, it's me.

839
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,200
I love kabuki. Look at that.

840
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,200
Out the way.

841
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,300
Give us a kiss!

842
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,300
Hi, I've come about
release of a prisoner.

843
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,100
Prisoner release form.

844
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,800
Oh, wha...?

845
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,100
I don't believe you.

846
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,800
These are the orders.

847
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,700
"Love and kisses"?!

848
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,500
Mm. Now, according
to the Galactic Penal Code,

849
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,300
the punishment for
a presidential kidnapping

850
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,100
is to be fed to
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

851
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Good day.

852
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,800
Ow, get off of me!

853
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,600
Ow! What the hell is that?

854
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:22,000
Ow, no, wait, wait! There's been
some kind of mistake. Ah!

855
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,700
- Tick all the boxes on the right.
- Right. Got it.

856
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
Not that one!

857
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,200
<i>What to do if you find yourself
stuck with no hope of rescue.</i>

858
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,700
<i>Consider how lucky you are
that life has been good to you so far.</i>

859
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,100
<i>Alternatively, if life
hasn't been good to you so far,</i>

860
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,400
<i>which, given your current circumstances
seems more likely,</i>

861
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,600
<i>consider how lucky you are that
it won't be troubling you much longer.</i>

862
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,000
Right, there we go.

863
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,500
Oh, kidnapping the President.

864
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:04,100
Oh, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

865
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,300
Okay. Right.
Look, this is the President.

866
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,500
- Oh!
- Okay. See, there?

867
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,300
He says the kidnapping business
was a horrible misunderstanding.

868
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,900
Oh, yeah.

869
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,700
She meant nothing by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

870
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,500
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

871
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,800
Those are blue.

872
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,000
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Hold that. Okay. Wai...

873
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,700
Oh, he's hungry today.

874
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,100
That's blue. Right.

875
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,400
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

876
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,700
Okay, this is, uh,
it's for Tricia McMillan.

877
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,100
Tricia McMillan. Mm. Okay.

878
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,400
Sir, it's a release form.

879
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,900
Thank you.

880
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
She's free to go.

881
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,400
Release her.

882
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,800
Zaphod's here.
Well, then, uh, that's fine then.

883
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,300
Who are we waiting for again?

884
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,600
No, I'm serious.

885
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,600
Tricia!

886
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,200
- Tricia.
- Trill.

887
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,200
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot!

888
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,400
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

889
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,300
- He did?
- I did?

890
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,900
Yes."Love and kisses, Zaphod"?
You didn't even read it, did you?

891
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,800
Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

892
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,700
An entire planet, my home,

893
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,900
destroyed because you thought
they wanted your autograph.

894
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,800
- They framed me!
- Are you an idiot?

895
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,800
- Trillian.
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

896
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,000
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

897
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,200
Oh, a backbone? What about coming here
to rescue you? Thank you. My idea. Oh!

898
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Stupid!

899
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,100
- Got your arm.
- How considerate.

900
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,500
Right, then, all those lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

901
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:53,400
Oh, the President tests my patience.

902
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:58,300
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

903
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,300
Fantastic. At last.

904
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,900
Oh. That's one hour for lunch,
everybody.

905
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,200
I think I'll have soup today.

906
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,500
<i>The Encyclopedia Galactica,
in its chapter on love,</i>

907
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,000
<i>states that it is
far too complicated to define.</i>

908
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,500
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy has this to say on love.</i>

909
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,100
<i>"Avoid, if at all possible."</i>

910
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,200
<i>Unfortunately,
Arthur Dent has never read</i>

911
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,800
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

912
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:38,900
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

913
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,200
I... I didn't...

914
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,800
Um, look, uh...

915
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,800
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right,

916
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:53,800
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

917
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,200
Um, for what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling...

918
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,400
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

919
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Thank you.

920
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,900
Actually,
what I was going to say was...

921
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:17,300
...if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

922
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,200
then neither of us would be here now.

923
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,100
I just thought that might
count for something.

924
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,300
It doesn't matter.

925
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:59,000
All right, computer, take us to...
Where are we... Where we headed again?

926
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,500
Okay, I'm gonna get you
another lemon.

927
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
All right.

928
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,300
<i>Engaging Improbability Drive.</i>

929
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,300
No, Zaphod, no.
Buttons are not toys. What did you do?

930
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,300
<i>Magrathean coordinates accepted.</i>

931
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,800
<i>It blows my circuits to tell you</i>

932
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,300
<i>that we're in orbit,
at an altitude of 300 miles,</i>

933
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,000
<i>around the legendary planet
of Magrathea.</i>

934
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,800
Magrathea! Magrathea!

935
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,500
Magrathea!

936
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,400
Unbelievable.

937
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Incredible.

938
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,500
It's even worse
than I thought it would be.

939
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,000
<i>Greetings. This is a recorded
announcement as we are all out.</i>

940
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,500
<i>The Commercial Council of Magrathea
thanks you for your visit,</i>

941
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,000
<i>but regrets that the entire planet
is temporarily closed.</i>

942
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,900
<i>If you'd like to leave your name
and a planet where you can be contacted,</i>

943
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,100
<i>kindly do so at the tone.</i>

944
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,100
- How can a planet be closed?
- Zarkin' A, cousin.

945
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,600
Okay, computer, keep going.
Take us down.

946
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,300
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

947
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,600
<i>It is gratifying
that your enthusiasm</i>

948
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,800
<i>for our planet continues unabated.</i>

949

<i>As a token of our appreciation,</i>

<i>I'm delighted to tell you</i>

955
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,700
<i>there are two nuclear missiles

956
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,100
<i>If you don't mind,

957
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,700
<i>Something's jamming
my guidance system.</i>

958
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,800
<i>Impact minus 45 seconds.</i>

959
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,800
Computer, do something!

960
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,200
<i>Sure. Handing over
manual control. Good luck.</i>

961
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,600
I need some help.

962
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,300
I can't do this without my third arm.

963
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,300
Arthur, grab my hand!

964
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,500
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

965
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,900
- Why don't I just press this?
- No, we're not back to normal yet.

966
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
- What will happen?
- I don't know.

967
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,000
Don't do it! We're here.
No telling where it'll send us.

968
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,000
- Sod it all.
- No!

969
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,400
Wow. Where are we?

970
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,500
Exactly where we were.

971
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,000
And the missiles?

972
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,600
Apparently, they've turned...
into a bowl of petunias.

973
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,000
And a very surprised-looking whale.

974
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:42,400
<i>And an improbability factor
of 8,767, 128 to 1 against.</i>

975
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,100
We have norm... normality.

976
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,700
Normality, right.

977
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,700
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

978
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,000
- What is normal?
- What's home?

979
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,800
What are cows?

980
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,800
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

981
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:06,200
<i>It is important to note that
suddenly, and against all probability,</i>

982
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,200
<i>a sperm whale had been
called into existence</i>

983
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:13,300
<i>several miles above
the surface of an alien planet.</i>

984
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,300
<i>Since this is not a tenable
position for a whale,</i>

985
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:21,400
<i>this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity.</i>

986
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,000
<i>This is what it thought as it fell:</i>

987
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,300
<i>Ah, whoa, what's happening? Who am I?</i>

988
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,000
<i>Why am I here? What's my purpose?
What do I mean by who am I?</i>

989
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,300
<i>Okay, Okay, calm down, get a grip now.</i>

990
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,500
<i>Ooh, this is an interesting sensation.
A sort of tingling in my...</i>

991
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,600
<i>I better start finding names for things.
Let's call it a tail. Yeah, tail.</i>

992
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:46,800
<i>What's this roaring sound whooshing past
what I'm gonna call my head?</i>

993
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,000
<i>Wind. Is that a good name? That'll do.</i>

994
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,400
<i>Yay, this is really exciting.
I'm dizzy with anticipation.</i>

995
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,000
<i>Or is it the wind?
There's a lot of that now.</i>

996
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,200
<i>And what's this thing coming towards me
very fast? So big and flat and round.</i>

997
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:04,400
<i>It needs a big wide-sounding name
like ow, ound, round, ground!</i>

998
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,000
<i>That's it, ground. I wonder if it will
be friends with me. Hello, ground.</i>

999
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,200
<i>The only thing that went through
the mind of the bowl of petunias</i>

1000
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,300
<i>as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again!"</i>

1001
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,200
<i>Many have speculated that if we knew
why the petunias had thought that,</i>

1002
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,700
<i>we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now.</i>

1003
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,300
What are those things?

1004
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,800
They're portals
to another dimension.

1005
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,400
Right. I don't suppose this
portal has central heating, does it?

1006
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,200
Ah, this is the one.

1007
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,800
This will all end in tears,
I just know it.

1008
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,800
Right here.

1009
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,100
Hey! Whoa!

1010
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,700
Okay, in we go!

1011
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,900
We can't just step into that... that!
We don't know where it leads.

1012
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,100
If we pick the wrong one,

1013
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,000
we just... we come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

1014
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,700
What? Yeah, it's a big biggie,
Ford. A big biggie.

1015
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,800
What if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?

1016
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,400
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

1017
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,700
- Ford!
- His hunches are good.

1018
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,200
Arthur, I say we go.

1019
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:47,200
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?!

1020
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,900
This is suicide!

1021
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
- I think I resent that.
- I don't care.

1022
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,000
I'm getting hostility
from you, Alex...

1023
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,700
- Arthur!
- Have you ever tried yoga?

1024
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,500
- Trillian!
- I think that's supposed to happen.

1025
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,700
She's gone!
Ford, she's gone!

1026
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,800
Arthur, don't panic!

1027
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,400
- Ford!
- Hey, wait for me!

1028
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,500
Whoo!

1029
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,900
Come on.

1030
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:43,000
Idiot! Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1031
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,100
Ahhh!

1032
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,700
No, no, no, don't leave.
Come on, come on, just start!

1033
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,900
I told you this would end in tears.

1034
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,100
Did you? Did you?

1035
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,100
Geronimo!

1036
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,700
Ooomph!

1037
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,300
Far out! Far out! Ha-ha!

1038
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,100
This is it. This is it!
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

1039
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:45,200
So, this is how
it's all going to end, is it?

1040
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:50,200
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

1041
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,800
You think you've got problems.

1042
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,400
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

1043
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,700
Excuse me.

1044
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,700
- Aaaaagghhh!
- Whoa, whoa.

1045
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,400
- Who are you?
- No, uh, my name is not important.

1046
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,100
Uh, you must come with me.

1047
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,500
- Get away.
- Terrible events are afoot.

1048
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,200
Um, you... you must come
or you'll be late.

1049
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,500
- Late? What for?
- What?

1050
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,100
No, no. What's...
what's your name, Earthman?

1051
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,500
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Well...

1052
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,300
late as in
"the late Dentarthurdent."

1053
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,900
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1054
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
- No.
- Your friends are safe.

1055
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,400
- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

1056
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,200
Okay, my name is, um...

1057
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,200
...my name is... is...
is... Slartibartfast.

1058
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,400
I... I... I said it wasn't important.

1059
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:05,300
Well... so my friends are safe?

1060
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,900
Let me show you.

1061
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:12,900
I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

1062
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,600
Did you know we built planets?

1063
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,700
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

1064
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,500
Doing the, um... doing the coastlines
was always my favorite.

1065
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,200
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1066
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:00,300
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

1067
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:06,000
are a... are a bit of
a luxury commodity...

1068
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:10,000
Come with me because there's
been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

1069
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,300
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

1070
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,900
- And men.
- What?

1071
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,900
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1072
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,800
Yes, well, I don't think men
have much to do with it. Here.

1073
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,800
Um, I must warn you,

1074
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,300
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

1075
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,700
- Huh?
- It may disturb you.

1076
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:15,500
It scares the willies out of me.

1077
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Aghh! Aghh!

1078
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,800
Ha, ha, ha.
Welcome to our factory floor.

1079
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,800
Okay.

1080
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,400
All right. All right.

1081
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,300
Yeah, this is it.

1082
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,900
This is it.

1083
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,800
O great Deep Thought!

1084
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,600
We have traveled long...

1085
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,500
...and far.

1086
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:40,100
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

1087
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,600
the universe and everything?

1088
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,400
<i>No.</i>

1089
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,100
<i>- What?
- I've been watching TV.</i>

1090
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,300
Oh.

1091
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,000
<i>I designed
another computer to do that.</i>

1092
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,400
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

1093
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,300
<i>No, it's not here. It's another world.</i>

1094
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,500
It's on another world.

1095
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,100
<i>It is another world, stupid.</i>

1096
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,700
<i>Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it</i>

1097
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,100
<i>to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.</i>

1098
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,500
Well... Okay.

1099
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,700
You sure you don't have the question,

1100
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,300
or a way to, you know,
access it or something?

1101
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
'Cause I think I've done
a lot to get here.

1102
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,900
<i>Oh, shh, shh. The show's back on.</i>

1103
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,300
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

1104
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,900
Great. I'm gonna go and find something
else for my entire life to be about.

1105
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,400
Zaphod, Zaphod,
there's the... the gun.

1106
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,700
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

1107
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,300
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I... Why'd I do that?

1108
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,100
- Okay.
- That's stupid.

1109
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,300
O Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

1110
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,300
- There you are.
- Hm?

1111
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,100
Look familiar?

1112
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,700
So it wasn't destroyed?

1113
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:20,100
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark II.

1114
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,000
So you... you made the Earth?

1115
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,700
Not me alone,
but I... I did my part.

1116
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,100
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

1117
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,000
That was one of mine.
I... I got an award for it.

1118
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,600
Oh, hoo!

1119
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,200
All right, Frank?
That's... that's Frank.

1120
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,900
Ah-ha. They...
they've nearly finished the oceans.

1121
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,400
Zaphod.

1122
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Here, it's...

1123
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,100
...it's just like Humma said.

1124
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,700
- Now you can go get your head back.
- Hey, Ford.

1125
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,300
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarking frood.

1126
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,400
No!

1127
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,800
- Whoa!
- This is a bust too.

1128
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:26,400
H... H... Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

1129
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,500
You go through all you have,
you don't get an answer,

1130
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,200
which means no money or fame,
which you deserve...

1131
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,900
<i>The Point-of-View Gun,
conveniently,</i>

1132
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,400
<i>does precisely what its name suggests.</i>

1133
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,100
Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic.

1134
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,100
<i>If you point it at
someone and pull the trigger,</i>

1135
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,900
<i>they instantly see things
from your point of view.</i>

1136
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Give me that thing.

1137
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,000
<i>It was designed by Deep Thought,</i>

1138
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:55,000
<i>but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives</i>

1139
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,500
<i>who, after arguments
with their husbands,</i>

1140
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,000
<i>were sick of ending
those arguments with the phrase,</i>

1141
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,100
<i>"You just don't get it, do you?"</i>

1142
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,200
Uh, uh, and you're right,
I shouldn't be so upset

1143
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,500
because life goes on, you know,

1144
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,400
and I should just go on with it.

1145
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,800
Shoot him again.

1146
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,800
Whoa.

1147
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,800
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

1148
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,300
- Say what?
- That is brilliant.

1149
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,400
What's goin'...?

1150
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,300
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

1151
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,200
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Who cares?

1152
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,900
I do. Especially since we're somewhat
of an endangered species, thanks to you.

1153
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,100
Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

1154
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,000
You wanna know why I'm edgy?

1155
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:49,000
Argh. Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up

1156
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,700
and you've been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order.

1157
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,400
Huh?

1158
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,200
Ugh! You actually wanted
to know the question

1159
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,300
because you always wondered
if there was more to life

1160
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,200
and now you're crushed
because you find out there really isn't.

1161
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,800
Hey, fantastic. Psychedelic.

1162
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,500
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

1163
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,200
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

1164
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,900
Huh? That's not true.

1165
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:29,700
And you're worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does.

1166
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,200
Hey, whoops.

1167
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,000
Oh, baby doll.

1168
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,400
Give me that thing.

1169
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:47,100
It won't affect me.
I'm already a woman.

1170
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,500
It's okay.
It's only a couple of little mice!

1171
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,800
Voilà!
Himalayas. Good, eh?

1172
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,600
Earthman, you must realize

1173
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:20,300
that the planet you lived on was
commissioned, paid for and run by mice.

1174
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,300
When you say mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1175
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,300
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1176
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:33,500
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyper intelligent beings.

1177
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,000
I don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

1178
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,900
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1179
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,900
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1180
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,900
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

1181
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:53,900
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

1182
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,100
Actually, this explains a lot.

1183
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,900
All my life,
I've had this strange feeling

1184
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

1185
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,800
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1186
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,700
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

1187
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,500
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1188
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,700
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1189
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,200
I'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

1190
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,300
- And are you?
- Uh... no.

1191
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,100
That's where
it all falls down, of course.

1192
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,400
Here you are then.

1193
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,600
Is this...?

1194
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,800
It's, um... It's all there.

1195
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,200
You know, it all works.

1196
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,400
Welcome home.

1197
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,300
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

1198
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,500
- There you are!
- Surprise!

1199
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,600
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1200
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,200
Is that tea?

1201
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,600
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1202
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:57,100
But then they made up for it
by making us...

1203
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,500
...this amazing meal.

1204
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,800
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1205
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,100
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1206
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,400
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1207
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,300
The, um, talking... talking mice. Cool.

1208
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:24,500
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1209
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,900
- Please, drink.
- Um, uh, excuse me.

1210
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,400
- Uh, is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1211
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,200
Um, good, I'll be outside, so...

1212
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,500
You were right.

1213
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,400
- Please, drink.
- Yes.

1214
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,000
He was right.

1215
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,000
Now, to business.

1216
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,900
To business!

1217
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,200
Eat!

1218
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,100
- Shh.
- Sorry.

1219
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,700
We've spent a lot of time
on your planet

1220
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,700
looking for this ultimate question.

1221
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,400
Only to have it blow up
in our faces. Literally.

1222
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,000
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1223
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,100
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

1224
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,800
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1225
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,100
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

1226
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,200
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

1227
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,500
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

1228
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,700
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1229
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,100
More tea?

1230
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,900
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

1231
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,300
Yes, to complete the program.

1232
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,000
You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

1233
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:34,900
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... Cheeky mouse.

1234
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,100
Zaphod! Trillian!

1235
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,500
Ford.

1236
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,000
What was in that food?

1237
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,900
What was in my tea?

1238
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,500
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1239
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Just wait a sodding minute.

1240
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,700
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1241
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,400
What about, what's 6x7?

1242
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,100
Or, um, uh, how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

1243
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:10,000
Here's one: How many roads
must a man walk down?

1244
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,300
Hey, that's not bad.

1245
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:19,800
Fine. Fine, take it, 'cause my head
is filled with questions,

1246
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,100
and no answer to any one of them

1247
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:25,900
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

1248
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,500
Except for one.

1249
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,600
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

1250
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,300
Is she the one?

1251
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,800
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

1252
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:42,400
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1253
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,400
And for one week,

1254
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:50,300
one week in my sad little...
blip of an existence...

1255
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,000
...it made me happy.

1256
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,200
That's a good answer.

1257
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,500
We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1258
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:05,200
- What's this "Is she the one" tripe?
- Take his brain!

1259
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,500
No, don't take the brain!
Don't take the brain, mice!

1260
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,300
It wasn't me!

1261
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,300
I'm famous.

1262
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,800
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him!

1263
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,300
Oh, bollocks!

1264
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,000
Agghh!

1265
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,900
I'm gonna be sick.

1266
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,100
Belgium.

1267
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,800
Follow me.

1268
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,900
Left, right, left, right.

1269
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,500
Attention!

1270
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

1271
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,300
Though I can't say I blame you.

1272
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,100
Mr. President,
we're here for your protection.

1273
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,500
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

1274
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,900
Fire!

1275
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,400
No! No!

1276
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,500
What's all the fuss about?

1277
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,500
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy. Ooh.

1278
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:29,700
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1279
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,800
Now I've got a headache...
headache... headache...

1280
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Marvin!

1281
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,300
Oh, no.

1282
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:57,900
He's got a towel, run away!

1283
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:03,100
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1284
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,100
We need that gun.

1285
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:13,100
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start!

1286
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,200
Come on. Oh, fire, fire!

1287
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,600
Fire, fire!

1288
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,900
Oo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

1289
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,500
He's locked it
from the other side.

1290
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,700
We'll have to go the other way.

1291
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,800
Come on, let's go!

1292
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,600
Stop!

1293
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Oh, no!

1294
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:46,700
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop shooting at us!

1295
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,500
Oh, I feel so depressed.

1296
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:15,800
I can't face another day.

1297
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,500
What's the point?

1298
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,800
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1299
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,400
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1300
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,200
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1301
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,500
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

1302
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,100
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

1303
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,000
Take it away.

1304
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,800
You could do all of that, but it's not
gonna... Well, I'll ask... I'll just ask.

1305
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:17,700
I... I... I've just been informed
by some of the lads

1306
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,300
that since we're so near completion,

1307
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,700
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1308
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,300
Oh.

1309
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,500
We, well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1310
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,900
Unless there's, um...

1311
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,500
...there's, you know,
anything you want to change.

1312
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:43,000
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1313
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,700
Yeah. Me.

1314
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,400
Oh! Um, hello?

1315
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:54,200
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1316
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,800
Let's go somewhere.

1317
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,400
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1318
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,800
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1319
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,900
I am a little peckish.

1320
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,700
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1321
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:17,400
- I think. I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1322
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,200
All right, let's trip the
light fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

1323
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,100
Come on.

1324
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,300
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I going to need it?

1325
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,800
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1326
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,800
I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel.

1327
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,800
Okay. Hold tight.

1328
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,600
<i>Stand by for commencement
of life cycle. In three, two, one...</i>

1329
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:55,300
<i>All right! Whoo!</i>

1330
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,100
Not that
anyone cares what I say,

1331
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,400
but the restaurant
is at the other end of the universe.

1332
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,000
Yeah!

1333
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,600
Play it!

1334
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,200
<i>It is, of course, well known
that careless talk costs lives.</i>

1335
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:06,400
<i>But the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated.</i>

1336
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:10,100
<i>For instance, at the very moment
that Arthur Dent said,</i>

1337
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,800
<i>"I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel"</i>

1338
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:18,500
<i>a freak wormhole opened up in
the fabric of the space-time continuum</i>

1339
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,100
<i>and carried his words far,
far back in time,</i>

1340
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:26,200
<i>across almost infinite reaches of space,
to a distant galaxy</i>

1341
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:30,000
<i>where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink</i>

1342
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,500
<i>of frightful interstellar battle.</i>

1343
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:37,200
<i>The two opposing leaders, resplendent
in their black-jeweled battle shorts</i>

1344
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,300
<i>were meeting for the last time,</i>

1345
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,200
<i>when a dreadful silence fell.</i>

1346
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
<i>And at that very moment,</i>

1347
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:48,300
<i>the words "I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel"</i>

1348
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,400
<i>drifted across the conference table.</i>

1349
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,200
<i>Unfortunately, in their native tongue,</i>

1350
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,300
<i>this was the most appalling
insult imaginable.</i>

1351
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,000
<i>So the opposing battle fleets</i>

1352
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,700
<i>decided to settle
their remaining differences,</i>

1353
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:05,100
<i>in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy,</i>

1354
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:09,400
<i>now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark.</i>

1355
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,800
<i>For thousands of years,
the mighty starships tore across</i>

1356
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:18,400
<i>the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet Earth,</i>

1357
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,400
<i>where, due to
a terrible miscalculation of scale,</i>

1358
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:27,400
<i>the entire battle fleet was
accidentally swallowed by a small dog.</i>

1359
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:31,100
<i>Those who study the complex
interplay of cause and effect</i>

1360
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,900
<i>in the history of the universe,</i>

1361
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,500
<i>say that this sort of thing
is going on all the time.</i>

1362
01:46:38,500 --> 01:47:03,500

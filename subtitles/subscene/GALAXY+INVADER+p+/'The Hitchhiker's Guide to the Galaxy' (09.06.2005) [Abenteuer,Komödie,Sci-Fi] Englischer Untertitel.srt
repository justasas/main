1
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:33,733
<i>It's an important and popular fact</i>

2
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:37,653
<i>that things are not always
what they seem.</i>

3
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:41,365
<i>For instance, on the planet Earth,
man had always assumed</i>

4
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:45,293
<i>that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet,</i>

5
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,046
<i>instead of the third most intelligent.</i>

6
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,627
<i>The second most intelligent creatures
were dolphins, who, curiously enough,</i>

7
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,638
<i>had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth.</i>

8
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,015
<i>They'd made many attempts
to alert mankind,</i>

9
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:02,136
<i>but most of their communications
were misinterpreted</i>

10
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:05,681
<i>as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for titbits.</i>

11
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:10,277
<i>So they eventually decided they would
leave Earth by their own means.</i>

12
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:13,564
<i>The last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted</i>

13
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:16,867
<i>as a sophisticated attempt
to do a backward somersault</i>

14
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,987
through a hoop,
<i>whistling</i> The Star-Spangled Banner.

15
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:21,830
<i>In fact, the message was this:</i>

16
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,825
<i>"So long and thanks for all the fish."</i>

17
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,525
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

18
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,613
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

19
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,819
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

20
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,953
<i>You may not share our intellect</i>

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,156
<i>Which might explain your disrespect</i>

22
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:08,328
<i>For all the natural wonders
that grow around you</i>

23
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,748
<i>So long, so long and thanks
for all the fish</i>

24
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,797
<i>Your world's about to be destroyed</i>

25
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,004
<i>There's no point getting all annoyed</i>

26
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:23,551
<i>Lie back and let the planet
dissolve around you</i>

27
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,556
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

28
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,638
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

29
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:31,817
<i>Especially tiny tots
and your pregnant women</i>

30
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,065
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

31
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,317
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

32
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:40,401
<i>So long, so long
and thanks for all the fish</i>

33
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,957
<i>If I had just one last wish</i>

34
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:51,128
<i>I would like a tasty fish</i>

35
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:55,503
<i>If we could just change one thing</i>

36
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,757
<i>We would all have learned to sing</i>

37
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:03,970
<i>Come one and all</i>

38
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:08,187
<i>Man and mammal</i>

39
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:11,641
<i>Side by side</i>

40
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:17,730
<i>In life's great gene pool</i>

41
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,008
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

42
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,177
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

43
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:47,226
<i>So long, so long
and thanks for all the fish</i>

44
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:05,077
The extraordinary <i>story</i>
of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

45
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,824
<i>begins very simply.</i>

46
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,828
<i>It begins with a man.</i>

47
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,507
<i>An Earthman, to be precise,
who no more knows his destiny,</i>

48
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,090
<i>than a tea leaf knows the history
of the East India Company.</i>

49
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,182
<i>His name is Arthur Dent.</i>

50
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,560
<i>He is a five-foot-eight-inch-tall
ape descendant,</i>

51
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:38,686
<i>and someone is trying to drive
a bypass through his house.</i>

52
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,984
What do I want you to do about it?

53
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:50,201
Find him and tell him I'm currently
lying flat on my back in front of...

54
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,577
Fine, I'll hold.

55
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,371
You can't lie in front
of the bulldozers forever.

56
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,578
I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

57
00:04:56,714 --> 00:05:00,002
This bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built.

58
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:04,132
- Why has it got to be built?
- It's a bypass.

59
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:08,762
You've got to build bypasses. Besides,
you should've protested months ago.

60
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:12,261
The plans have been on display
at the planning office for a year.

61
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,017
On display?
I had to go down to a cellar.

62
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:20,485
Mr Dent, have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer

63
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,029
if I just let it roll straight over you?

64
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,234
- How much?
- None at all.

65
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,119
<i>By a strange coincidence,
"none at all"</i>

66
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,915
<i>is exactly how much suspicion
ape-descendant Arthur Dent had</i>

67
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,993
<i>that one of his closest friends</i>

68
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,580
<i>was not descended from an ape,
but was, in fact, from a small planet</i>

69
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,966
<i>somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</i>

70
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,253
Arthur.

71
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,133
- Ford.
- Yes?

72
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,680
Here.

73
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,144
There you are.

74
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,059
Eat, drink. We gotta talk.

75
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:56,347
Now's not the best time.
They're going to demolish my home.

76
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,855
You already know? How?

77
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,856
What do you...?

78
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,744
Oh, they, they? When you say
"they" you mean they? Got it.

79
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:12,495
Listen. I got somethin' important
I gotta tell you. Right now.

80
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,040
Well, what about my house?

81
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:25,042
Workers of the Earth, I bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer.

82
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,437
Good. Let's go to the pub.

83
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,474
They won't demolish it
until they've finished the beers.

84
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,977
- Can we trust 'em?
- To the end of the Earth.

85
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,486
- How far's that?
- About 12 minutes away.

86
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,693
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

87
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:52,653
Six pints coming up.

88
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,453
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.

89
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,876
Three pints each? At lunchtime?

90
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,006
Sorry.

91
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,467
Time is an illusion.

92
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,678
Lunchtime, doubly so.

93
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,602
And eat those peanuts
because you'll need the salt.

94
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,350
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...

95
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,978
What if I told you
I really wasn't from Guildford?

96
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,445
I was from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

97
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:34,073
- Is it something you're likely to say?
- Remember when we met?

98
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,248
Out the way.

99
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:46,915
Hi.

100
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,047
Wasn't it strange I was trying
to shake hands with a car?

101
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,678
I assumed you were drunk.

102
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,849
I thought cars were the dominant
life form. I was introducing myself.

103
00:07:55,935 --> 00:08:00,395
You saved my life.
And now I'm saving yours. Please drink.

104
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,773
It must be Thursday. I could never
get the hang of Thursdays.

105
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,235
- If this is about your house...
- No, it's not about the house.

106
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,358
- Who's he?
- She.

107
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:17,075
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy-dress party.

108
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,581
<i>I hate those kind of parties.</i>

109
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,577
<i>I'd rather have stayed at home
and ironed my hankies.</i>

110
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,833
<i>- But there I was.</i>
- <i>Who are</i> you?

111
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,664
<i>And there she was.</i>

112
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:32,468
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- No. I mean, who are you?

113
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,798
Oh, the costume? Right.
"Livingstone, I presume."

114
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,303
Yeah, it's not as clever as Darwin,
but the best I could do at short notice.

115
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,434
You're the first to get that right.

116
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,312
- Really?
- Yes. Everyone calls me Santa.

117
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,939
- Right.
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway.

118
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,646
So did I.

119
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,152
People at these parties
are drunken idiots.

120
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,653
What?

121
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,361
All these people are idiots. God.

122
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,908
That's awkward.

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,792
Tell me.

124
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,460
She was amazing though, Ford.

125
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,542
<i>Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon.</i>

126
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:17,256
Without the beard,
you look at least 80 years younger.

127
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,092
Maybe I'm de-evolving.

128
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:28,563
Well, I should tell you that I do not
date single-celled organisms, OK?

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,487
Let's go somewhere.

130
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,696
Yeah. Definitely.
Where do you have in mind?

131
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:41,746
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?

132
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,166
No, it's a country
off the coast of Africa.

133
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:48,211
That Madagascar?
Why are we waiting here?

134
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,331
Wait a sec.

135
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,007
Go.

136
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:00,632
God, you're serious.
I can't go to Madagascar.

137
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,768
- Why not?
- Because, I just, you know...

138
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,231
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,978
I want to go somewhere I've never been
and I'd like to go with you,

140
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,734
so what do you say, Dr Livingstone?

141
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:17,695
I say that's
an extraordinary proposition.

142
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,777
I can't go. I mean, I've got a job.

143
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,124
Quit. Get a new one
when you come back.

144
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,198
I don't even know your real name.

145
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,668
- Tricia McMillan.
- Well, Tricia McMillan.

146
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,167
I have a proposition for you.

147
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,545
Why don't we go somewhere

148
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:39,178
a little closer first, say Cornwall,

149
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:43,182
and we'll see how it goes.

150
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,812
Right, of course, Cornwall.

151
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,105
Hey, excuse me.

152
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,148
Is this guy boring you?
Why don't you talk to me instead?

153
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,108
I'm from a different planet.

154
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,368
It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

155
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:11,541
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
What kind of chat-up line is that?

156
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,793
That does happen.

157
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,875
Speaking of...

158
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,215
We've got two minutes.
Drink up.

159
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,309
That's my house.

160
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:34,105
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone, on me.

161
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,903
You really think
the world's going to end?

162
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,483
Yes.

163
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:43,031
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

164
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,078
- If you like.
- Will it help?

165
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,831
Not at all.

166
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,124
Last orders, then.

167
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,809
- What is that?
- Run.

168
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,811
Look out.

169
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,837
Towel.

170
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,753
Arthur.

171
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:45,805
What the hell are those things?

172
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,433
They're ships
from a Vogon constructor fleet.

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,683
I picked up their signal this morning.
Here, you'll need this.

174
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,309
- What are you doing?
- We're hitching a ride.

175
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:05,025
People of Earth,
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz

176
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,694
of the Galactic Hyperspace
Planning Council.

177
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,362
As you are probably aware,

178
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:13,033
plans for the development
of the outlying regions of the galaxy

179
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:17,667
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

180
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,920
And your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition.

181
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,469
<i>There's no point
acting surprised about it.</i>

182
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,055
<i>The plans have been on display</i>

183
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,900
<i>at your local planning office
in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years.</i>

184
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,779
<i>If you can't be bothered
with local affairs, that's your lookout.</i>

185
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,324
Apathetic bloody planet.

186
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,402
I've no sympathy at all.

187
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:40,017
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

188
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,098
<i>is a wholly remarkable book.</i>

189
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,435
<i>Perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful,</i>

190
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,614
<i>ever to come out of the great
publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.</i>

191
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,988
More popular <i>than</i>
The Celestial Homecare Omnibus,

192
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,867
<i>better selling than
53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity,</i>

193
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,949
<i>and more controversial than
Oolon Colluphid's trilogy</i>

194
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:03,207
<i>of philosophical blockbusters,
Where God Went Wrong,</i>

195
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,789
Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes,

196
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,215
and Who ls This God Person Anyway?

197
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:12,011
<i>It's already supplanted
the Encyclopaedia Galactica</i>

198
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,055
<i>as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom</i>

199
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,725
<i>for two important reasons.</i>

200
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,394
<i>First, it's slightly cheaper,</i>

201
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,605
<i>and second, it has the words
"Don't Panic"</i>

202
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,185
<i>printed in large,
friendly letters on its cover.</i>

203
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,576
So you're not from Guildford?

204
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,788
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

205
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,667
You're not an out-of-work actor,

206
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:52,218
but rather a writer for this...
this book thing.

207
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,720
Good, huh?

208
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,223
I don't feel well.
I need a cup of tea.

209
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,680
If I asked where we were,
would I regret it?

210
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,014
- We're safe for now.
- Good.

211
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,942
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

212
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,563
- Get me home, Ford.
- Arthur, your home is...

213
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:16,242
Oh, God, my home.
My home was demolished.

214
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,116
You don't remember.

215
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,295
OK, Arthur, I've got
something to tell you.

216
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,419
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

217
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,676
Your home planet has been blown up.

218
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,512
Blown up.

219
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,438
Couldn't you have done something?

220
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,529
I saved your life.
OK, that makes us even.

221
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,995
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here,

222
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,283
you've gotta know where your towel is.

223
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,914
OK, give me a hand over here.

224
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,379
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

225
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,552
<i>Before the Vegans find us.</i>

226
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,676
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

227
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,815
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

228
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,733
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

229
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,566
Vogons.

230
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,780
<i>Vogons are one of the
most unpleasant races in the galaxy.</i>

231
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,205
<i>Not evil, but bad-tempered,
bureaucratic, officious and callous.</i>

232
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,787
<i>They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers</i>

233
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,121
<i>from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast
of Traal without orders</i>

234
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,673
<i>signed in triplicate,
sent in, sent back,</i>

235
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,051
<i>queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry,</i>

236
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,589
<i>lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months</i>

237
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,515
<i>and recycled as firefighters.</i>

238
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:09,643
<i>On no account should you allow
a Vogon to read poetry to you.</i>

239
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,895
They can't think or imagine.
Most can't spell. They just run things.

240
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,195
And if we don't get a ride soon,

241
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,702
we won't need the Guide to tell us
how unpleasant the Vogons are.

242
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,118
They've already destroyed
a planet today.

243
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,544
That always makes them a little...

244
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,929
- What is that?
- Put this in your ear.

245
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:50,346
<i>We have unwittingly picked up
a couple of hitchhikers.</i>

246
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,102
The fish is translating for you.

247
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:57,229
<i>The Babel fish
is small, yellow, leech-like,</i>

248
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,650
<i>and probably the oddest thing
in the universe.</i>

249
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:06,203
<i>It feeds on brainwave energy,
absorbing unconscious frequencies,</i>

250
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,827
<i>and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies</i>

251
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,166
<i>to the speech centres of the brain.</i>

252
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,788
<i>The practical upshot of which is that,
if you stick one in your ear,</i>

253
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:20,468
<i>you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language.</i>

254
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,062
Resistance is useless.

255
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,976
- All right.
- Someone's coming.

256
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,482
Here we go. Look lively.

257
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,484
Sir.

258
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,316
- What?
- Hitchhikers.

259
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,946
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."

260
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,569
No, really, you don't have to read.

261
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:09,410
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

262
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:14,616
"...as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee."

263
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,080
<i>Vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe.</i>

264
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,467
<i>The second worst
is that of the Azgoths of Kria.</i>

265
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:28,091
<i>During a recitation by their
Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent,</i>

266
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,090
of his poem
Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty

267
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,763
I Found in My Armpit
One Midsummer Morning,

268
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,100
<i>four of his audience
died of internal haemorrhaging,</i>

269
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,770
<i>and the president of the
Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council</i>

270
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,228
<i>survived by gnawing
one of his own legs off.</i>

271
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,275
"Or I will rend thee
in the gobberwarts

272
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,284
with my blurgle..."

273
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,786
<i>The absolute worst poetry was
by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.</i>

274
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,371
<i>Luckily, it was destroyed
when the Earth was.</i>

275
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:03,127
"See if I don't." Yeah.

276
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:10,672
So, Earthlings,
I present you with a choice.

277
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,929
Either die in the vacuum of space,

278
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,809
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

279
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:24,356
Actually, I rather liked it.

280
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,281
That's good. Run with it.

281
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,779
Some of the words I didn't understand,

282
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,283
but I found the imagery quite effective.

283
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,497
Continue.

284
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,293
Well, yes,
interesting rhythmic devices,

285
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,830
which seemed to counterpoint

286
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,590
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of...

287
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,885
- Vogonity.
- Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity

288
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,962
of the poet's soul.

289
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,138
So what you're saying is,

290
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,807
I write poetry because

291
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:07,316
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

292
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:11,358
I just want to be loved?

293
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,698
Yes.

294
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,204
Yes, yeah, please.

295
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,374
Throw them off the ship.

296
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,874
- No.
- Ford.

297
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,794
All right.

298
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,426
Resistance is useless.

299
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:42,643
Shut up. Get a job.
Wash your filthy hands.

300
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,474
Don't panic.

301
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:51,565
So this is it?
We're gonna die?

302
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,242
Yeah, we're gonna die.

303
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,283
No. No, what's this?

304
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:59,989
What is this?

305
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:04,418
What's this? This is nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

306
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,180
You're sweating.

307
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,729
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

308
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,833
<i>"Space," says the introduction
to The Hitchhiker's Guide,</i>

309
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,412
<i>"is big. Really big."</i>

310
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:52,880
<i>"You just won't believe how vastly,
hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."</i>

311
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,801
<i>And so on.</i>

312
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,968
<i>It also says that
if you hold</i> a <i>lungful of air,</i>

313
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,469
<i>you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about 30 seconds.</i>

314
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,770
<i>But with space being really big and all,</i>

315
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,394
<i>the chances of being picked up
within that time</i>

316
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,692
<i>are two to the power of two billion,</i>

317
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,817
<i>79 million, 460 thousand,</i>

318
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,865
<i>347 to one against.</i>

319
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,734
<i>By a staggering coincidence,</i>

320
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,487
<i>it's also the phone number
of the lslington flat</i>

321
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,788
<i>where Arthur went to a fancy dress party</i>

322
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,209
<i>and met a very nice young woman
whom he totally blew it with.</i>

323
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,754
<i>Though the planet Earth,
the lslington flat and telephone</i>

324
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:40,510
<i>have all now been demolished, Ford
and Arthur were, in fact, rescued.</i>

325
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,391
- Ford?
- Yes.

326
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:47,563
- I think I'm a sofa.
- I know how you feel.

327
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,693
So much for the laws of physics.

328
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,658
<i>And once again, our top story.</i>

329
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:04,038
<i>The sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe,</i>

330
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,035
<i>the starship Heart of Gold.</i>

331
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,663
<i>Stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other</i>

332
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,586
<i>than Galactic President
Zaphod Beeblebrox.</i>

333
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:16,960
<i>In the name of people, freedom,
and democracy, stuff like that,</i>

334
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,138
<i>I hereby kidnap myself
and I'm taking the ship with me.</i>

335
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,215
<i>Come on.</i>

336
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,768
<i>Beeblebrox, universally considered</i>

<i>to be the dimmest star
in several solar systems,</i>

338
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,558
<i>is most famous for his controversial
defeat of Humma Kavula</i>

339
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,653
<i>who claimed many thought they were
voting for the worst-dressed being</i>

340
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,731
<i>in the universe contest.</i>

341
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:40,907
Great.

342
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,910
<i>Kavula is best remembered
for his slanderous</i>

343
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,580
<i>"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign.</i>

344
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,117
Put your ego aside.
Something important has happened.

345
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:54,580
If there's anything more important than
my ego, I want it caught and shot now.

346
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,423
Come on, I love it.

347
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:59,506
<i>Zaphod's just this guy, you know.</i>

348
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,422
What d'you...?

349
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,802
- I was just watching myself.
- We have a couple of hitchhikers.

350
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,474
Hitchhikers?
Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

351
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,431
I didn't. The ship did.

352
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,808
What? Say what?

353
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:19,522
When we engaged the
lmprobability Drive... The big button.

354
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,357
- I know.
- They were picked up here,

355
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:26,070
in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Wait.
That's where you picked me up.

356
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,121
- On Earth.
- That's impossible.

357
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,500
- No, just very improbable.
- Listen. I don't have time for this.

358
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:35,872
We've got the police of half the galaxy
after us. We've stopped for hitchhikers.

359
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,343
So ten out of ten for style, but

360
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,838
minus several million
for good thinking.

361
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,217
You're too gorgeous, baby, stop it.
You drive me crazy.

362
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

363
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,644
Marvin.

364
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,730
You ought to know,
I'm feeling very depressed.

365
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:01,196
Well, we have something
that should take your mind off things.

366
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:05,992
It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

367
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,995
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

368
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,960
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

369
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,334
Just that? I won't enjoy it.

370
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,049
Yeah, well, that's life.

371
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:25,421
Life? Don't talk to me about life.

372
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,894
<i>- Commander Kwaltz.
- Yes.</i>

373
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:41,479
<i>We have located the spaceship
Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.</i>

374
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,741
<i>- Where'?
- Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.</i>

375
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,319
<i>Requesting hyperspace clearance.</i>

376
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:54,375
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

377
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,754
- Yes, sir.
- Get me Vice President Questular.

378
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:06,382
<i>Hyperspace permission granted, captain.</i>

379
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,805
Here we go.

380
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,121
I think that door just sighed.

381
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,666
Ghastly, isn't it?

382
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,119
All the doors have been programmed

383
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,422
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition.

384
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:48,429
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

385
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,257
Please yourselves.

386
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,553
Here I am,
brain the size of a planet,

387
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,188
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge.

388
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:01,775
Call that job satisfaction?
Cos I don't.

389
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,146
You can thank
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation

390
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,572
for building robots with GPP.

391
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:11,155
- What's GPP?
- Genuine People Personalities.

392
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:15,702
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

393
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,375
Arthur?

394
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,885
<i>Hey, Slim, are you wearing
my underwear? Cos I'm wearing yours.</i>

395
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,760
<i>And they ain't doing the trick.
Come on. All right.</i>

396
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,973
Oh, for heaven's sake.

397
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,848
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

398
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,189
Freeze.

399
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,814
Freeze? I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

400
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,492
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- Why do I bother?

401
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,361
- Zaphod?
- Ford.

402
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:58,912
Is that you? Ford. Praxibetel Ix.

403
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,993
What the hell are you doing here?

404
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,500
I just stuck out my thumb and here I am.

405
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:07,420
- That is so you.
- Look at you.

406
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:11,921
President of the Galaxy.
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

407
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,676
<i>You zarkin' flood.</i>

408
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:18,140
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

409
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:24,350
President of the Galaxy. This is
my cousin. He's a semi-half-brother...

410
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:28,020
- We share three of the same mothers.
- We've met.

411
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:33,575
Have we? I'm sorry.
I've got a terrible memory for species.

412
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,996
This is him, Ford. The "would you
like to see my spaceship" bloke.

413
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:44,833
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia.

414
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,248
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian.

415
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:51,172
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

416
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,053
- Hi.
- Hi.

417
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,134
Would you excuse us
for a second, please?

418
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,436
You went down on that little planet
and didn't call me?

419
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,389
Sorry, I didn't know.
I had a galaxy to run.

420
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,729
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

421
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,028
I think he called you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

422
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,610
I shortened it
Something a little more spacey.

423
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,325
Right. I was thinking
of changing mine to,

424
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,402
I don't know, Arthoolia.

425
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:21,491
That's a good one.
Well, this is weird.

426
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:25,122
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb.

427
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:28,831
- Right. In your pyjamas?
- I was in a hurry.

428
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,048
OK. Did you know I was here?

429
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,836
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

430
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,592
Yeah, that's kinda like
the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

431
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,761
OK, look.

432
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:42,685
I left you at the party. I feel bad, but
I was gonna call you when I got back.

433
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,772
Well, there is no
going back now, is there?

434
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,437
You do know what happened?

435
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:51,357
Enough small talk.
We're on the run, remember?

436
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,358
Excuse me, we're having a chat.

437
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,949
Well, I think the girl's getting...
Boo.

438
00:33:56,035 --> 00:34:01,280
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut
your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

439
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,998
- You wanna fight?
- OK.

440
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,868
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

441
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:09,375
I'm a kidder. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

442
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,210
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

443
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:15,794
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah.

444
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,348
Teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

445
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,807
He's a guest on my ship.

446
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,849
I thought you said you stole it.

447
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,391
Stole what?
What are we talking about?

448
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,019
That doesn't sound good.

449
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,986
- Are you OK?
- Just fabulous, thanks, Trill.

450
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,822
A little help over here.
I'm in over my head.

451
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:47,326
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

452
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,660
Yes, I do.

453
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,962
Hey, this is really pretty.

454
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,590
- Don't.
- They're on our tail.

455
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,050
Fire a gun. Launch a missile.
Do some damage.

456
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,686
Stop that.

457
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,768
Just kiddin'. I love it rough. Hit me.

458
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,771
<i>- Computer'?
- Hi there.</i>

459
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,943
<i>I'm Eddie, your computer.</i>

460
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:17,814
<i>I'm pleased to report that it's
a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers.</i>

461
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,199
<i>They're sending you a message.</i>

462
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,622
<i>This is
Vice President Questular Bumbes Rontok.</i>

463
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:26,118
<i>I am speaking to the kidnapper

464
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,370
She digs me.

465
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,709
<i>Surrender the stolen vessel at once</i>

466
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:33,255

Interstellar Space Bylaws...</i>

468
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,756
<i>Zaphod, please come back now.
This is ridiculous.</i>

469
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,592
Leap to hyperspace. Come on.

470
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,719
<i>Sure thing, fella.</i>

471
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,315
No.

472
00:35:56,447 --> 00:36:01,863
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorisation?

473
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,743
No, commander.

474
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:11,285
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

475
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,370
I'm coming, sir.

476
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,257
I'm boiling. Here's the form, sir.

477
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:25,966
So are you along for the ride
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

478
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,428
That depends. Where are you going?

479
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,471
Where am I going?

480
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:37,027
- You OK?
- Yeah. Don't suppose there's any tea.

481
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,231
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

482
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:44,777
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

483
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:49,286
<i>The best drink in existence
is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster,</i>

484
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:54,078
<i>the effect of which is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon</i>

485
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,747
<i>wrapped round a large gold brick.</i>

486
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,383
- Belgium. Hold it one second.
- Belgium.

487
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,262
Ape-man, Earth dude, sorry,
what's your name again?

488
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,810
- Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

489
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,310
No hard feelings, OK?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

490
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,144
- Earth.
- Yeah. I liked Earth.

491
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,193
Got these boots there.
But don't mention it to the girl.

492
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:23,065
Because if you do... I'll pull your
spleen out through your throat.

493
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,072
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- OK.

494
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:29,154
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

495
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,993
Zaphod, what's with the two-head thing?

496
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:39,749
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't be
president with a whole brain.

497
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,833
It's crazy.

498
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,085
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

499
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,299
Parts of my personality weren't exactly
what you'd call presidential.

500
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:50,342
You know what I'm talkin' about.

501
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,606
<i>Your tea is ready.</i>

502
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:13,332
I suppose I should've said
it resembles tea.

503
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,164
So two heads
is what does it for a girl?

504
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,624
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or three...

505
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,830
Or your own spaceship.

506
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,712
Anything else he's got two of?

507
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,295
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

508
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:30,599
What am I supposed to be like?
Green? Bleeping?

509
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:33,473
I can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like.

510
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:37,396
OK, look. Do you see this?

511
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:41,564
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

512
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,899
<i>Enjoy your doughnut.</i>

513
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,609
Do you see this?

514
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:57,493
This toasts bread

515
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,247
while you're slicing it.

516
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:05,084
We're on a spaceship, Arthur. In space.

517
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,132
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

518
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:11,681
That was some sort of test.

519
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,426
And I failed.

520
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,013
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

521
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,144
No, I mean your chin.

522
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,441
I might have an aspirin.

523
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,897
Right.

524
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:35,702
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

525
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:39,079
- Please, don't.
- Showtime, Trill.

526
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,338
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

527
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,132
Buttons aren't toys.

528
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:53,299
Anyway... When I saw
what I'm about to show you,

529
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:58,015
that's when I realised
why I had to do what I did to my brain.

530
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:01,265
I think. It's all a little...

531
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:03,103
...shaky.

532
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:09,318
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

533
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,157
<i>Many millions of years ago,</i>

534
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:18,665
<i>a race of hyper-intelligent,
pan-dimensional beings</i>

535
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:22,668
<i>got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life,</i>

536
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,705
<i>that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best</i>

537
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,129
<i>to design and build
a stupendous super-computer</i>

538
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:33,593
<i>to calculate the answer to life,
the universe and everything.</i>

539
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:36,674
O Deep Thought,

540
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:41,013
we want you to tell us the answer.

541
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:43,348
<i>The answer to what?</i>

542
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:48,027
The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

543
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:52,194
We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

544
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,992
<i>I'd have to think about that.</i>

545
00:40:55,037 --> 00:41:00,498
<i>Return to this place in exactly
seven-and-a-half million years.</i>

546
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:05,711
- Is it finished?
- No, there's more. They go back.

547
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:10,876
- Seven-and-a-half million years later?
- That's right, they do.

548
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,062
Deep Thought, do you have...?

549
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:34,574
<i>An answer for you?
Yes, but you're not going to like it.</i>

550
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,782
- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- All right.

551
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,786
<i>The answer to the ultimate question</i>

552
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:47,416
<i>of life, the universe
and everything...</i>

553
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:50,172
<i>...is...</i>

554
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,590
<i>...42.</i>

555
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,553
Yeah? What?

556
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,057
<i>42'?</i>

557
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:08,270
<i>Yes, I thought it over quite thoroughly.
It's 42.</i>

558
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:11,645
<i>It would've been simpler
to have known what the question was.</i>

559
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,616
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything.

560
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,613
<i>That's not a question.</i>

561
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:22,447
<i>Only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means.</i>

562
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:27,118
<i>- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can't. But there is one who can.</i>

563
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:31,168
<i>A computer that will calculate
the ultimate question.</i>

564
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,883
<i>A computer of such infinite complexity,</i>

565
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,054
<i>that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix.</i>

566
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:42,301
<i>And you yourselves shall take on new,
more primitive forms,</i>

567
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:48,140
<i>and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10-million-year program.</i>

568
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:51,977
<i>I shall design this computer for you,
and it shall be called...</i>

569
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:01,031
- That's it?
- That's it.

570
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:04,955
You're looking for
the ultimate question? You? Why?

571
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,826
I tried that.
Why? 42. Doesn't work.

572
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,829
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why

573
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:13,255
do you want to know
the ultimate question?

574
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,093
Partly curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

575
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:20,634
but mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

576
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,845
You're president of the Galaxy.

577
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,843
- That's right, Arman.
- Arthur.

578
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,304
Whatever.
Presidential fame is temporary.

579
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:31,190
I find the question, that's permanent.
It sticks.

580
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:33,769
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep.
Win-win.

581
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,195
We just hit that button and barn,
we're at Magrathea, I think.

582
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,494
We've hit it twice and
we're still not there, but anyway...

583
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,991
- You in?
- Always.

584
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:47,870
- All right.
- I want to get off.

585
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,419
- Sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This.

586
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:59,377
<i>The Infinite Improbability Drive
is a wonderful new method</i>

587
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,297
<i>of crossing interstellar distances
in a few seconds,</i>

588
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:05,554
<i>without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.</i>

589
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,887
<i>As the improbability Drive
reaches infinite improbabiiity,</i>

590
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:12,978
<i>it passes through every conceivable
point in every conceivable universe</i>

591
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,775
<i>almost simultaneously.</i>

592
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,985
<i>So you're never sure
where you'll end up</i>

593
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,689
<i>or even what species you'll be
when you get there.</i>

594
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,734
<i>It's therefore important
to dress accordingly.</i>

595
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:27,155
<i>The Drive was invented following
research into finite improbability</i>

596
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,373
<i>often used to break the ice at parties</i>

597
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:32,706
<i>by making all the molecules
in the hostess's undergarments</i>

598
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:34,792
<i>leap one foot to the left</i>

599
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:37,419
<i>in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy.</i>

600
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:41,135
<i>Many physicists said they
wouldn't stand for that sort of thing,</i>

601
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,303
<i>partly because it debased science,</i>

602
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:47,391
<i>but mostly because they didn't get
invited to those sort of parties.</i>

603
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:01,106
Is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button?

604
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,069
Very probably, yes.

605
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,160
Ah, I think
the Earthman's about to be sick.

606
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:09,121
In the trashcan, ape-man.
This ship's new.

607
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,828
Come on.

608
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,452
We have normality.

609
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,204
Did it work? Are we there?

610
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:22,256
Yeah. We're here. Magrathea.

611
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,045
I don't think so. Eddie...

612
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,130
What planet is this?

613
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,011
<i>I'm checking for you.</i>

614
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:33,138
Did you just pluck
one of my hairs? Off my head?

615
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:36,766
<i>Thank you for waiting.
Sorry to disappoint you,</i>

616
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,901
<i>but this is not Magrathea.</i>

617
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:42,818
<i>We are currently in orbit around
the planet Viltvodle Six.</i>

618
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:45,817
Humma Kavula.

619
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:51,664
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

620
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:55,368
Humma Kavula.

621
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:03,885
<i>In the beginning,
the universe was created.</i>

622
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:08,802
<i>This made a lot of people very angry
and is widely regarded as a bad move.</i>

623
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:14,179
<i>Many races believed it was created
by some sort of god,</i>

624
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,851
<i>though the Jatravartid people
of Viltvodle Six</i>

625
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:21,899
<i>firmly believe that the entire universe
was sneezed out of the nose of a being</i>

626
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,818
<i>called the Great Green Arkleseizure.</i>

627
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,528
Humma Kavula.

628
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,992
<i>The Jatravartids, who lived in fear</i>

629
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:32,530
<i>of the time they called the
Coming of the Great White Handkerchief,</i>

630
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:36,367
<i>were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each.</i>

631
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,040
<i>They were unique in being
the only race in history</i>

632
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:42,840
<i>to have invented
the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.</i>

633
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:46,752
Mr President.

634
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,554
Hey, all right. How you doin'?

635
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,548
What have we here? I love it.

636
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,313
Hey, I love you. Fantastic.

637
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,062
You guys related? Don't go changing.

638
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,227
Arthur, I want a drink.

639
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,444
I think I've been here before.
Have I been here before?

640
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,116
<i>Bode.</i>

641
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,240
- I've been here before.
- Humma Kavula.

642
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,079
Come on.

643
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,958
Tricia. Tricia, I...

644
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,465
<i>Now we await</i>

645
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:34,096
<i>With eager expectation</i>

646
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,474
<i>Thy handkerchief</i>

647
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,773
<i>To bring us back to Thee</i>

648
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,408
Hello, Humma.

649
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:57,286
- Join us. Sit down.
- Good to see you. Thanks. All right.

650
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,450
The handkerchief is coming.

651
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:05,457
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

652
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:11,049
So that's Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.

653
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:16,054
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown,

654
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:18,272
in reverence to you.

655
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:24,984
Send the handkerchief, O Blessed One,
so that it may wipe us clean.

656
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:30,740
We ask this and all things
in Thy precious and alliterative name.

657
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,534
Bless you.

658
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:44,336
<i>We goin' in here?</i>

659
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:48,298
All right, I like it. It's big,
it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants.

660
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,881
Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous president.

661
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,676
What brings you to our humble planet?

662
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:58,972
- I think you know why I'm here.
- No, I don't think I do.

663
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,728
I think you think you don't.

664
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:04,690
But we both know you do.

665
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,355
Eloquent as always.

666
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:11,314
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

667
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:14,484
That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

668
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,994
when you were my opponent
running against me,

669
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,030
you said I was stupid.

670
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:43,100
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

671
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,399
...if memory serves, you won,

672
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:50,148
proving that good looks
and charm

673
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:55,824
win over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

674
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:03,370
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

675
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,001
Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir.

676
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:10,293
I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix-up

677
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:12,751
cos, actually, he's not with us.

678
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,757
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

679
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:18,589
He grew, didn't he? He's not that tall.

680
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:23,720
You didn't come half-way across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge.

681
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,269
Why are you here?

682
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,522
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

683
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:37,234
I've been stranded on a strange planet
for years. I haven't been avoiding you.

684
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:40,323
You look great. You're doing well.

685
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:42,116
You've grown, obviously.

686
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:46,287
Wait. We don't know why we're here.

687
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:49,962
We were trying to get to Magrathea
and our ship brought us here.

688
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,009
How very, very improbable.

689
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:05,310
I kept a few souvenirs
from my former life.

690
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:08,268
Ah, the heady days of space piracy.

691
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:13,645
But even an Infinite lmprobability Drive

692
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:16,026
requires coordinates.

693
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:18,570
Which I happen to have.

694
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,276
No, no, no.

695
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,824
You don't get something
for nothing, Zaphod.

696
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,531
You must bring me something in return.

697
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,534
- What?
- A gun.

698
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,619
- A gun?
- A very special gun,

699
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:34,006
designed by the greatest computer
ever invented.

700
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,008
But the only way to find it
is to go to Magrathea.

701
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:41,597
Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

702
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:44,471
And what will you give me
to ensure your return?

703
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,685
My word as president.

704
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:52,517
No. I need a hostage.

705
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,862
Only...

706
00:51:56,907 --> 00:52:02,198
...what does
Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

707
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,032
Come on.

708
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,878
Oh, no.

709
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,794
Hey, take it easy now. Think about this.

710
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:19,047
No, stop it.
That kind of tickles.

711
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:22,721
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.

712
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:26,559
It's not fair. You need me.

713
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:30,896
Come back. Come back!
Don't leave me alone.

714
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,980
Come back.

715
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:39,905
And I thought I was the only one
who considered your boyfriend

716
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,658
a narcissistic moron,
but the whole galaxy does.

717
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,577
What about you?
"Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir."

718
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:50,082
"We're not with him. We just came
to worship you." Very brave.

719
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,159
Where the hell is Ford?

720
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:57,384
By the left, march.

721
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:02,670
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

722
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:06,974
Mr President,
we're here for your protection.

723
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,094
Fire upon the kidnapper.

724
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:12,225
<i>Hey, come on.</i>

725
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,891
The president is the kidnapper.
You'll kill him.

726
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:18,936
It's locked.

727
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,192
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

728
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,949
Come on, Zaphod, man.

729
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,251
- Hey, what did I miss?
- What have you been doing?

730
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,793
Field research. So they found
where we are? Belgium bummer.

731
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,629
They're shooting at us.
What are we going to do?

732
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:48,052
- I have an idea.
- Pushing him out and running away?

733
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:50,601
What? He's the one they want.

734
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,977
You can't go out there.
What are you doing?

735
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:57,190
- Back off.
- What's going on?

736
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:02,150
I have the president
and I will kill him, I swear.

737
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,199
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

738
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,490
It's an aerosol can.

739
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:11,075
OK, frightened now, frightened.

740
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:16,168
- Hi, little guy.
- Get her.

741
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:19,246
- Zaphod, no, come on.
- Arthur.

742
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,883
- Arthur.
- Tricia.

743
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,961
- Arthur.
- Tricia. Wait.

744
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,435
Arthur.

745
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:43,187
Resistance is useless.

746
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:56,909
<i>Bring her to Vogsphere
for processing, captain.</i>

747
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:00,413
Circus. Circus!

748
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:03,169
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go.

749
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,708
Let's go.

750
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,343
Computer, take us to Magrathea.

751
00:55:10,392 --> 00:55:12,884
What? No.
We've got to go after Tricia.

752
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:14,392
- Who?
- Trillian.

753
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:17,975
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git.

754
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,398
Right, you're coming out.

755
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:25,195
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea, we want to follow the ships.

756
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,904
<i>I'd love to, but my guidance system
has been deactivated.</i>

757
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,116
Oh, come on.

758
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,612
<i>I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault.</i>

759
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,738
What you doing on this ship?

760
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:36,456
- Ford?
- Marvin.

761
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:38,962
I've been talking
to the ship's computer.

762
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:40,748
And?

763
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:42,375
It hates me.

764
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,670
No. Eddie, computer,

765
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,253
is there another way
to follow the ships?

766
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:53,849
<i>Activating Emergency Escape Pod.
It's super-neat and fun to fly.</i>

767
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:57,761
Unbelievable.

768
00:55:57,814 --> 00:56:02,183
I'm in. OK,
Ford, do you have any idea?

769
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,525
- We'll press this button.
- No.

770
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:09,155
- This button.
- OK. Nothing's... OK.

771
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,242
Good man.

772
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,951
- OK, we're wobbling...
- You forgot your towel.

773
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:18,491
Get him off me. I'll kill him.

774
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,118
- OK, Ford, there's a...
- Is that better?

775
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:23,211
No, that's worse.

776
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:26,632
- Do what... I don't need that.
- OK.

777
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,468
Stop the rocking.
Marvin, any ideas?

778
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:33,130
I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

779
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,631
Thanks, Marv.

780
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,815
- Magrathea.
- No, we're on the Vogon planet.

781
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:27,521
- Yes, it is. It's Magrathea.
- This is Vogsphere.

782
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,733
- Yeah, Magrathea. I know it.
- No, it's not.

783
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:34,358
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is.

784
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:37,699
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

785
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,622
They have these
on Arcturan megafreighters.

786
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,200
They use them
when they need to concentrate.

787
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:45,577
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

788
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,463
There you go.

789
00:57:56,516 --> 00:58:00,259
That should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

790
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:03,766
Now I'm feeling much better
about our predicament.

791
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:29,247
I checked the Guide for how
to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

792
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,549
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

793
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:35,131
Well, I kind of had this idea
that we could...

794
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:39,423
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

795
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,425
What was it?

796
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:45,850
Nothing, it's nothing.
It's just my imagination.

797
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,229
OK, right. Now, everyone just stop
a minute, please, and look at me.

798
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:55,193
There's definitely something
going on here.

799
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,200
Just watch.

800
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:01,278
Just watch.

801
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,125
OK, I think we...

802
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:09,960
You too.

803
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:13,381
Yeah, what was that?

804
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:18,795
Zaphod, what do you think?

805
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:25,935
I think... Zarquon.
What was that?

806
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:30,516
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

807
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:33,519
- No one ever does.
- I have an idea.

808
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,773
Ford. Kill it. Get rid of it.

809
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,999
OK, don't think.

810
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:50,578
Nobody think. No ideas.

811
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:52,834
No theories. No nothing.

812
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,630
This is crazy.
Trillian is in there somewhere.

813
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:06,560
- We need an idea to help save her.
- I have an...

814
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,762
Run.

815
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:40,210
You're supposed to stop.

816
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,724
OK, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

817
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:59,734
All right, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

818
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:03,738
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

819
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:08,280
OK, where is she?

820
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,085
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

821
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:20,292
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard?

822
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:23,637
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

823
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,301
Oh. Right.

824
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:34,606
Sorry, no record of Earth.

825
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:39,190
Galactic sector
ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

826
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,739
- Oh, yes.
- She's lying.

827
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:47,577
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

828
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,448
Here we are. Earth.

829
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:54,917
"Destroyed."

830
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:58,459
Do you have
a second home planet?

831
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:02,046
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

832
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:07,302
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

833
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:17,975
Who in their right mind
gives an order to destroy a planet?

834
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:24,065
- He said the grey building, right?
- All the buildings are grey.

835
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:27,492
"Give me a hand." Very funny.

836
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:31,071
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

837
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:38,662
So you need to go back
and fill that in.

838
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:42,090
Then, make sure, when you fill in
the facilitating form...

839
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:47,046
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

840
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:53,849
If you'd fill that form in for me,
and return it as soon as possible.

841
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:58,265
- Writing implements to your left...
- You're president. Can you do anything?

842
01:02:58,359 --> 01:02:59,861
Presidents don't have power.

843
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:04,359
Their job is to draw attention away
from it. No offence. You're a great guy.

844
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,361
Hey, how you doin'?

845
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:12,197
Hey, it's me, your president.
What's goin' on? Thanks for coming.

846
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:15,081
All right. I know
that sponge. All right.

847
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,541
- Next.
- President coming through.

848
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,628
How you doin', Pinhead?
No, really, it's me.

849
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,339
I love kabuki. Look at that.

850
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:25,375
Out the way.

851
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:29,425
Give us a kiss.

852
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:33,388
Hi, I've come about
release of a prisoner.

853
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,560
Prisoner release form.

854
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,194
I don't believe you.

855
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,226
These are the orders.

856
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,324
"Love and kisses"?

857
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,579
Now, according
to the Galactic Penal Code,

858
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:59,410
the punishment for
a presidential kidnapping

859
01:03:59,462 --> 01:04:03,251
is to be fed to
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

860
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,090
Good day.

861
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:12,097
Get off of me. What the hell is that?

862
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:17,765
No, wait, wait.
There's been some kind of mistake.

863
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:25,854
- Tick all the boxes on the right.
- Right. Got it.

864
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:27,938
Not that one.

865
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:32,279
<i>What to do if you find yourself
stuck with no hope of rescue.</i>

866
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:36,780
<i>Consider how lucky you are
that life has been good to you so far.</i>

867
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:40,291
<i>Alternatively, if life
hasn't been good to you so far,</i>

868
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:43,496
<i>which, given your current circumstances,
seems more likely,</i>

869
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:47,708
<i>consider how lucky you are that
it won't be troubling you much longer.</i>

870
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:54,051
Right, there we go.

871
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,553
Kidnapping the president.

872
01:04:56,644 --> 01:05:01,104
Oh, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

873
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:04,311
OK. Right.
Look, this is the President.

874
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:06,571
OK. See, there?

875
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:10,318
He says the kidnapping business
was a horrible misunderstanding.

876
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:11,902
Oh, yeah.

877
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:15,702
She meant nothing by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

878
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:20,540
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

879
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,659
Those are blue.

880
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:28,002
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Hold that. OK.

881
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,012
Oh, he's hungry today.

882
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,179
That's blue. Right.

883
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,355
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

884
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:46,979
OK, this is for Tricia McMillan.

885
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:51,146
Tricia McMillan. OK.

886
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:57,445
Sir, it's a release form.

887
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:58,869
Thank you.

888
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:02,081
She's free to go.

889
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:04,159
Release her.

890
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:10,882
Zaphod's here.
Well, then, that's fine then.

891
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,959
Let's just go and get him.

892
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:23,724
Who are we waiting for again?

893
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:29,768
No, I'm serious.

894
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:34,026
Tricia.

895
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,069
- Tricia.
- Trill.

896
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:42,660
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot.

897
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,741
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

898
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:46,667
- He did?
- I did?

899
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:51,248
Yes. "Love and kisses, Zaphod"?
You didn't even read it, did you?

900
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,090
Honey, I'm president of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

901
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:00,056
An entire planet, my home,

902
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:03,264
destroyed because you thought
they wanted your autograph.

903
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:06,100
- They framed me.
- Are you an idiot?

904
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,104
- Trillian.
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

905
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:14,279
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

906
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:19,485
Oh, a backbone? What about coming here
to rescue you? Thank you. My idea.

907
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:22,737
Stupid.

908
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:29,422
- Got your arm.
- How considerate.

909
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:33,798
Right, then, all those lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

910
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:53,651
The president tests my patience.

911
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:58,615
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

912
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,617
Fantastic. At last.

913
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:10,210
That's one hour for lunch, everybody.

914
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:13,174
I think I'll have soup today.

915
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,797
The Encyclopaedia Galactica,
<i>in its</i> chapter on <i>love,</i>

916
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:22,305
<i>states that it is
far too complicated to define.</i>

917
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:26,809
The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy has <i>this</i> to say on <i>love:</i>

918
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,474
<i>"Avoid, if at all possible."</i>

919
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:32,436
<i>Unfortunately,
Arthur Dent has never read</i>

920
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,984
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

921
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:39,071
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

922
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,441
I didn't...

923
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,032
Look...

924
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:49,036
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right,

925
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:54,709
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

926
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:58,466
For what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling.

927
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:04,556
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

928
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,051
Thank you.

929
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:11,095
Actually, what I was going to say was

930
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,485
if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

931
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:19,687
then neither of us would be here now.

932
01:09:21,534 --> 01:09:25,277
I just thought that might
count for something.

933
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,573
It doesn't matter.

934
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:59,277
All right, computer, take us to...
Where we headed again?

935
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:01,900
OK, I'm gonna get you another lemon.

936
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,899
All right.

937
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,618
<i>Engaging Improbability Drive.</i>

938
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:15,623
No, Zaphod, no.
Buttons are not toys. What did you do?

939
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:17,537
<i>Magrathean coordinates accepted.</i>

940
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:28,006
<i>It blows my circuits to tell you</i>

941
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,468
<i>that we're in orbit,
at an altitude of 300 miles,</i>

942
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:35,222
<i>around the legendary planet
of Magrathea.</i>

943
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:38,104
Magrathea! Magrathea!

944
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:40,769
Magrathea!

945
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:46,649
Unbelievable.

946
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,154
Incredible.

947
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:54,665
It's even worse
than I thought it would be.

948
01:10:55,878 --> 01:11:00,167
<i>Greetings. This is a recorded
announcement as we are all out.</i>

949
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:03,712
<i>The Commercial Council of Magrathea
thanks you for your visit,</i>

950
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:07,178
<i>but regrets that the entire planet
is temporarily closed.</i>

951
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:11,053
<i>If you'd like to leave your name
and a planet where you can be contacted,</i>

952
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,267
<i>kindly do so at the tone.</i>

953
01:11:14,355 --> 01:11:18,314
- How can a planet be closed?
- Zarkin' A, cousin.

954
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:21,818
OK, computer, keep going.
Take us down.

955
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:23,486
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

956
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:30,201
<i>It is gratifying that your enthusiasm
for our planet continues unabated.</i>

957
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,904
<i>As a token of our appreciation,</i>

958
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,032
<i>we hope you will enjoy
the two thermo-nuclear missiles</i>

959
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:39,411
<i>we've just sent
to converge with your craft.</i>

960
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:42,539
<i>To ensure on-going quality of service,</i>

961
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:46,885
<i>your death may be monitored
for training purposes. Thank you.</i>

962
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,889
<i>I'm delighted to tell you there are two
nuclear missiles heading right for us.</i>

963
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:55,309
<i>If you don't mind,
I'm going to take evasive action.</i>

964
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,893
<i>Somethings jamming
my guidance system.</i>

965
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,902
<i>Impact minus 45 seconds.</i>

966
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:10,863
Computer, do something.

967
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:15,238
<i>Sure. Handing over manual control.
Good luck.</i>

968
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:27,959
I need some help.

969
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:31,341
I can't do this without my third arm.

970
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,437
Arthur, grab my hand.

971
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:50,607
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

972
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:56,954
- Why don't I just press this?
- No, we're not back to normal yet.

973
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,077
- What will happen?
- I don't know.

974
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:03,120
Don't do it. We're here.
No telling where it'll send us.

975
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,090
- No, sod it all.
- No.

976
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:16,299
Where are we?

977
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:24,064
- Exactly where we were.
- And the missiles?

978
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:30,647
Apparently, they've turned into
a bowl of petunias.

979
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,026
And a very surprised-looking whale.

980
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,119
<i>And an improbability factor</i>

981
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:42,455
<i>of 8,767,128 to one against.</i>

982
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:45,328
We have normality.

983
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,752
Normality, right.

984
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:51,755
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

985
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,968
- What is normal?
- What's home?

986
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,760
What are cows?

987
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:01,849
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

988
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:06,186
<i>It is important to note that suddenly,
and against all probability,</i>

989
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:09,148
a <i>sperm whale had been
called into existence</i>

990
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:13,315
<i>several miles above
the surface of an alien planet.</i>

991
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:16,234
<i>Since this is not a tenable position
for a whale,</i>

992
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:21,368
<i>this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity.</i>

993
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,033
<i>This is what it thought as it fell:</i>

994
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:27,329
<i>What's happening? Who am I?</i>

995
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:31,045
<i>Why am I here? What's my purpose?
What do I mean by "who am I"?</i>

996
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:33,292
<i>OK, calm down, get a grip now.</i>

997
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:37,472
<i>This is an interesting sensation.
A sort of tingling in my...</i>

998
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:42,598
<i>I better start finding names for things.
Let's call it a tail. Yeah, tail.</i>

999
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:46,768
<i>What's this roaring sound whooshing past
what I'm gonna call my head?</i>

1000
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,982
<i>Wind. Is that</i> a <i>good name? That'll do.</i>

1001
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:52,357
<i>Ya y, this is really exciting.
I'm dizzy with anticipation.</i>

1002
01:14:52,406 --> 01:14:55,023
<i>Or is it the wind?
There's a lot of that now.</i>

1003
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:59,160
<i>And what's this thing coming towards me
very fast? So big and flat and round.</i>

1004
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:04,366
<i>It needs a big wide-sounding name
like ow, ound, round, ground.</i>

1005
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,999
<i>That's it, ground. I wonder if it will
be friends with me. Hello, ground.</i>

1006
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:15,214
<i>The only thing that went through
the mind of the bowl of petunias</i>

1007
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:19,301
<i>as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again."</i>

1008
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:26,180
<i>Many have speculated that if we knew
why the petunias had thought that,</i>

1009
01:15:26,273 --> 01:15:31,643
<i>we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now.</i>

1010
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:38,278
What are those things?

1011
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:41,695
They're portals to another dimension.

1012
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:46,282
Right. I don't suppose this portal
has central heating, does it?

1013
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,127
This is the one.

1014
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:58,674
This will all end in tears,
I just know it.

1015
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,720
Right here.

1016
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:10,606
OK, in we go.

1017
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:15,817
We can't just step into that... that.
We don't know where it leads.

1018
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:18,022
If we pick the wrong one,

1019
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,867
we just come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

1020
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:25,579
What? Yeah, it's a big biggie, Ford.
A big biggie.

1021
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:30,661
What if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?

1022
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:34,338
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

1023
01:16:34,383 --> 01:16:38,593
- Ford.
- His hunches are good.

1024
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:41,091
Arthur, I say we go.

1025
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:47,052
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?

1026
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:48,806
This is suicide.

1027
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:52,940
- I think I resent that.
- I don't care.

1028
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:55,893
I'm getting hostility from you, Alex...

1029
01:16:55,988 --> 01:16:59,526
- Arthur.
- Have you ever tried yoga?

1030
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:04,360
- Trillian.
- I think that's supposed to happen.

1031
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,541
She's gone. Ford, she's gone.

1032
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:14,954
Arthur, don't panic.

1033
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:21,343
- Ford.
- Hey, wait for me.

1034
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:36,642
Come on.

1035
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:38,728
Idiot. Come on.

1036
01:18:03,764 --> 01:18:07,473
No, don't leave.
Come on, just start.

1037
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,677
I told you this would all end in tears.

1038
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,887
Did you? Did you?

1039
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,901
Geronimo.

1040
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:27,951
Far out.

1041
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,362
Far out!

1042
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,328
This is it. This is it.

1043
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:35,876
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

1044
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:43,509
So... this is how it's
all going to end, is it?

1045
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:50,008
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

1046
01:18:50,102 --> 01:18:52,093
You think you've got problems.

1047
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:55,183
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

1048
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:57,306
Excuse me.

1049
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:08,192
- Who are you?
- No, my name is not important.

1050
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,870
You must come with me.

1051
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:16,201
- Get away.
- Terrible events are afoot.

1052
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:19,829
You must come or you'll be late.

1053
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:22,164
- Late? What for?
- What?

1054
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:27,800
No. What's your name, Earthman?

1055
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,177
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Well...

1056
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:33,968
Well, late as in
"the late Dentarthurdent."

1057
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:38,602
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1058
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:41,684
- No.
- Your friends are safe.

1059
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:45,021
- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

1060
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,866
OK, my name is...

1061
01:19:49,953 --> 01:19:53,867
My name is... is... is...
Slartibartfast.

1062
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:59,125
I said it wasn't important.

1063
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:05,007
Well... So my friends are safe?

1064
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:06,549
Let me show you.

1065
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:12,552
I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

1066
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:40,247
Did you know we built planets?

1067
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:43,541
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

1068
01:20:44,466 --> 01:20:49,176
Doing the coastlines
was always my favourite.

1069
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:53,347
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1070
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:59,971
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

1071
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:04,145
are a bit of a luxury commodity...

1072
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:09,563
Come with me because there's
been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

1073
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,903
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

1074
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:15,452
- And men.
- What?

1075
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,529
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1076
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,375
Yes, well, I don't think men
have much to do with it. Here.

1077
01:22:03,295 --> 01:22:05,332
I must warn you,

1078
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:08,915
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

1079
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:11,296
It may disturb you.

1080
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:13,506
It scares the willies out of me.

1081
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:48,583
Welcome to our factory floor.

1082
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:14,396
All right.

1083
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:18,776
Yeah, this is it.

1084
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:24,368
This is it.

1085
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:28,327
O great Deep Thought.

1086
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:30,128
We have travelled long...

1087
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:33,999
...and far.

1088
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:39,589
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

1089
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,094
the universe and everything?

1090
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:43,967
<i>No.</i>

1091
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:46,599
- What?
- <i>I've been watching TV.</i>

1092
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:50,023
<i>I designed
another computer to do that.</i>

1093
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,898
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

1094
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:56,776
<i>No, it's not here. It's another world.</i>

1095
01:23:56,825 --> 01:23:58,987
It's on another world.

1096
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,612
<i>It is another world, stupid.</i>

1097
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:05,122
<i>Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it</i>

1098
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,540
<i>to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.</i>

1099
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:09,993
Well... OK.

1100
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:12,170
You sure you don't have the question,

1101
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:15,791
or a way to, you know,
access it or something?

1102
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,842
I think I've done a lot to get here.

1103
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:21,305
<i>Oh, shh. The show's back on.</i>

1104
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:30,810
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

1105
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:35,357
Great. I'm gonna go find something
else for my entire life to be about.

1106
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:38,735
Zaphod, there's the gun.

1107
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:41,112
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

1108
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:45,662
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I do that?

1109
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,455
- OK.
- That's stupid.

1110
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:52,662
O Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

1111
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,720
There you are.

1112
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:11,521
Look familiar?

1113
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:15,059
So it wasn't destroyed?

1114
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:19,442
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark ll.

1115
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,367
So you made the Earth?

1116
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:28,072
Not me alone, but I did my part.

1117
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:31,451
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

1118
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:35,412
That was one of mine.
I... I got an award for it.

1119
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:48,558
All right, Frank? That's Frank.

1120
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:53,063
They've nearly finished the oceans.

1121
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,781
Zaphod.

1122
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,901
Here, it's...

1123
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,452
It's just like Humma said.

1124
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:14,126
- Now you can go get your head back.
- Hey, Ford.

1125
01:26:14,254 --> 01:26:16,712
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarkin' frood.

1126
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:17,791
No.

1127
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:21,166
This is a bust too.

1128
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:25,801
Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

1129
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:28,799
You go through all you have,
you don't get an answer,

1130
01:26:28,935 --> 01:26:31,518
which means no money or fame,
which you deserve...

1131
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:36,724
<i>The Point-of-View Gun, conveniently,
does precisely what its name suggests.</i>

1132
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:39,355
Fantastic.

1133
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:43,438
<i>If you point it at someone
and pull the trigger,</i>

1134
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:46,158
<i>they instantly see things
from your point of view.</i>

1135
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:48,243
Give me that thing.

1136
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:50,286
<i>It was designed by Deep Thought,</i>

1137
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:54,287
<i>but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives</i>

1138
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,793
<i>who, after arguments
with their husbands,</i>

1139
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:02,423
<i>"You just don't get it, do you?"</i>

1140
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:07,470
And you're right,
I shouldn't be so upset

1141
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:12,142
because life goes on, you know,
and I should just go on with it.

1142
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,057
Shoot him again.

1143
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:22,148
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

1144
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:25,530
- Say what?
- That is brilliant.

1145
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:27,654
<i>What' s goin' ...?</i>

1146
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:30,532
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

1147
01:27:31,789 --> 01:27:34,497
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Who cares?

1148
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:39,169
I do. Especially since we're somewhat
of an endangered species, thanks to you.

1149
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:41,341
Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

1150
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:44,249
"Why so edgy?"
You wanna know why I'm edgy?

1151
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:48,303
Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up,

1152
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:52,257
and you've been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order.

1153
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:56,644
You actually wanted
to know the question

1154
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,522
because you always wondered
if there was more to life

1155
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:03,481
and now you're crushed
because you find out there really isn't.

1156
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:08,069
Hey, fantastic. Psychedelic.

1157
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:13,658
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

1158
01:28:13,748 --> 01:28:17,366
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

1159
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:21,787
That's not true.

1160
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:28,878
And you're worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does.

1161
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:36,510
Oh, baby doll.

1162
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:39,221
Give me that thing.

1163
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:46,312
It won't affect me.
I'm already a woman.

1164
01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:59,749
It's OK.
It's only a couple of little mice.

1165
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:06,957
Voila. Himalayas. Good, eh?

1166
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:12,797
Earthman, you must realise

1167
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:16,050
that the planet you lived
on was commissioned,

1168
01:29:16,102 --> 01:29:19,436
paid for and run by mice.

1169
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:25,521
When you say mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1170
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:27,477
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1171
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:32,653
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyper-intelligent beings.

1172
01:29:32,744 --> 01:29:36,237
I don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

1173
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:40,073
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1174
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:45,083
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1175
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:49,041
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

1176
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:53,094
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

1177
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:57,265
Actually, this explains a lot.

1178
01:29:57,351 --> 01:29:59,968
All my life,
I've had this strange feeling

1179
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:03,145
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

1180
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:06,475
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1181
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:13,819
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

1182
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:16,576
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1183
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:20,781
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1184
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:23,333
I'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

1185
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,376
- And are you?
- No.

1186
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:28,163
That's where it all falls down.

1187
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:41,517
Here you are then.

1188
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:57,696
Is this...?

1189
01:31:11,676 --> 01:31:13,917
It's all there.

1190
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:17,341
You know, it all works.

1191
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,472
Welcome home.

1192
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:43,579
- There you are.
- Surprise.

1193
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,582
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1194
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:48,167
Is that tea?

1195
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:52,589
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1196
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:56,126
But then they made up for it
by making us

1197
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,507
this amazing meal.

1198
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:02,766
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1199
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:07,061
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1200
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:09,393
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1201
01:32:13,613 --> 01:32:18,278
The talking mice. Cool.

1202
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:23,487
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1203
01:32:24,457 --> 01:32:27,916
- Please, drink.
- Excuse me.

1204
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:31,370
- Is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1205
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:35,207
Good, I'll be outside, so...

1206
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:37,508
You were right.

1207
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:39,381
- Please, drink.
- Yes.

1208
01:32:40,056 --> 01:32:41,967
He was right.

1209
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:43,973
Now, to business.

1210
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,892
To business.

1211
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,264
Eat.

1212
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:49,804
Sorry.

1213
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:53,767
We've spent a lot of time on your planet
looking for this ultimate question.

1214
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:57,437
Only to have it blow up in our faces.
Literally.

1215
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:01,028
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1216
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:03,155
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

1217
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:05,787
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1218
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:09,074
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

1219
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:11,250
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

1220
01:33:11,337 --> 01:33:14,500
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

1221
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:16,755
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1222
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,128
More tea?

1223
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:20,965
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

1224
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,300
Yes, to complete the program.

1225
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:29,010
You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

1226
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:33,941
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... cheeky mouse.

1227
01:33:38,406 --> 01:33:40,989
Zaphod. Trillian.

1228
01:33:41,075 --> 01:33:43,362
Ford.

1229
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:44,954
What was in that food?

1230
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,787
What was in my tea?

1231
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,457
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1232
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,917
Just wait a sodding minute.

1233
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:59,586
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1234
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:01,338
What about, what's 6x7?

1235
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:05,013
Or how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

1236
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:08,891
Here's one: how many roads
must a man walk down?

1237
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,220
Hey, that's not bad.

1238
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:15,227
Fine.

1239
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:18,730
Fine, take it, cos my head
is filled with questions,

1240
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:21,062
and no answer to any one of them

1241
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:24,775
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

1242
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:26,451
Except for one.

1243
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:29,495
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

1244
01:34:29,582 --> 01:34:31,198
Is she the one?

1245
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:35,710
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

1246
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:41,337
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1247
01:34:41,427 --> 01:34:44,294
And for one week,

1248
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:49,175
one week in my sad little blip
of an existence,

1249
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:53,470
it made me happy.

1250
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:57,105
That's a good answer.

1251
01:34:57,193 --> 01:35:00,402
Rubbish. We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1252
01:35:00,446 --> 01:35:04,155
- What's this "is she the one?" tripe?
- Take his brain.

1253
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:07,450
No, don't take the brain.
Don't take the brain, mice.

1254
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:20,125
It wasn't me. I'm famous.

1255
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,628
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him.

1256
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:24,132
Oh, bollocks.

1257
01:35:33,187 --> 01:35:34,677
I'm gonna be sick.

1258
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:39,648
Belgium.

1259
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,571
Follow me.

1260
01:35:50,204 --> 01:35:52,741
Left, right, left, right.

1261
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:55,324
Attention.

1262
01:35:58,838 --> 01:36:01,796
Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

1263
01:36:01,882 --> 01:36:04,169
Though I can't say I blame you.

1264
01:36:04,218 --> 01:36:07,927
Mr President,
we're here for your protection.

1265
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:10,345
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

1266
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:11,763
Fire.

1267
01:36:13,561 --> 01:36:15,177
No.

1268
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:20,348
What's all the fuss about?

1269
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:23,275
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy.

1270
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:28,482
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1271
01:36:35,124 --> 01:36:37,115
Now I've got a headache.

1272
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,802
Marvin.

1273
01:36:49,889 --> 01:36:51,175
Oh, no.

1274
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:56,680
He's got a towel, run away.

1275
01:36:58,898 --> 01:37:01,890
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1276
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,729
We need that gun.

1277
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:11,779
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start.

1278
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:14,903
Come on. Oh, fire, fire.

1279
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,366
Fire, fire.

1280
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:23,248
He's locked it from the other side.

1281
01:37:23,297 --> 01:37:25,413
We'll have to go the other way.

1282
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,460
Come on, let's go.

1283
01:37:32,765 --> 01:37:35,257
Stop.

1284
01:37:41,315 --> 01:37:45,434
Stop it. Stop shooting at us.

1285
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:08,210
Oh, I feel so depressed.

1286
01:38:09,635 --> 01:38:14,550
I can't face another day.

1287
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:18,219
What's the point?

1288
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:28,518
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1289
01:38:34,243 --> 01:38:37,110
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1290
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:44,875
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1291
01:38:44,962 --> 01:38:48,205
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

1292
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,717
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

1293
01:38:56,849 --> 01:38:58,886
Take it away.

1294
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:12,437
You could do all of that, but it's
not gonna... I'll ask... I'll just ask.

1295
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:16,365
I've just been informed
by some of the lads

1296
01:39:16,452 --> 01:39:18,864
that since we're so near completion,

1297
01:39:18,954 --> 01:39:21,366
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1298
01:39:23,042 --> 01:39:27,081
Well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1299
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:30,539
Unless there's...

1300
01:39:30,632 --> 01:39:34,125
There's, you know,
anything you want to change.

1301
01:39:36,263 --> 01:39:41,554
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1302
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,308
Yeah. Me.

1303
01:39:46,774 --> 01:39:49,061
Oh. Hello?

1304
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:52,818
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1305
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:56,398
Let's go somewhere.

1306
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:59,067
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1307
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:02,404
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1308
01:40:03,207 --> 01:40:05,539
I am a little peckish.

1309
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:10,332
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1310
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:16,043
- I think. I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1311
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:19,754
All right, let's trip the
light fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

1312
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:21,722
Come on.

1313
01:40:21,809 --> 01:40:25,894
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I going to need it?

1314
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:29,438
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1315
01:40:29,525 --> 01:40:32,517
I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel.

1316
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:41,447
OK. Hold tight.

1317
01:40:44,957 --> 01:40:50,123
<i>Stand by for commencement
of life cycle. In three, two, one...</i>

1318
01:40:50,212 --> 01:40:52,078
<i>All right.</i>

1319
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:38,628
Not that anyone cares what I say,

1320
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:41,920
but the restaurant
is at the other end of the universe.

1321
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:14,540
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

1322
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:18,756
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

1323
01:42:18,884 --> 01:42:23,720
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

1324
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:30,719
<i>You may not share our intellect</i>

1325
01:42:30,854 --> 01:42:34,722
<i>Which might explain your disrespect</i>

1326
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:37,854
<i>For all the natural wonders</i>

1327
01:42:37,903 --> 01:42:42,238
<i>That grow around you</i>

1328
01:42:42,324 --> 01:42:47,239
<i>So long, so long and thanks
for all the fish</i>

1329
01:42:54,878 --> 01:42:58,746
<i>The world's about to be destroyed</i>

1330
01:42:58,882 --> 01:43:02,716
<i>There's no point getting all annoyed</i>

1331
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:08,757
<i>Lie back and let the planet dissolve</i>

1332
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:14,763
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

1333
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:18,724
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

1334
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,652
<i>Especially tiny tots</i>

1335
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:26,153
<i>And your pregnant women</i>

1336
01:43:26,243 --> 01:43:30,202
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

1337
01:43:30,289 --> 01:43:34,248
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

1338
01:43:34,293 --> 01:43:39,288
<i>So long, so long and thanks
for all the fish</i>

1339
01:43:45,137 --> 01:43:46,468
Yeah.

1340
01:43:57,608 --> 01:43:59,019
Play it.

1341
01:44:02,654 --> 01:44:06,739
<i>So long and thanks for all the fish</i>

1342
01:44:06,825 --> 01:44:10,784
<i>So sad that it should come to this</i>

1343
01:44:10,871 --> 01:44:16,867
<i>We tried to warn you all but, oh, dear</i>

1344
01:44:17,002 --> 01:44:18,663
<i>Oh, dear</i>

1345
01:44:18,754 --> 01:44:22,668
<i>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</i>

1346
01:44:22,799 --> 01:44:26,793
<i>We thought that most of you were sweet</i>

1347
01:44:26,887 --> 01:44:29,174
<i>Especially tiny tots</i>

1348
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:34,183
<i>And your pregnant women</i>

1349
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:38,183
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

1350
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:42,187
<i>So long, so long
so long, so long, so long</i>

1351
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:44,852
<i>So long, so long and thanks</i>

1352
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:50,241
<i>For all the fish</i>

1353
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:53,778
<i>For all the fish</i>

1354
01:44:57,292 --> 01:45:01,536
<i>it is, of course, well known
that careless talk costs lives.</i>

1355
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,713
<i>But the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated.</i>

1356
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:08,459
<i>For instance, at the very moment
that Arthur Dent said,</i>

1357
01:45:08,553 --> 01:45:12,137
<i>"I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel,"</i>

1358
01:45:12,224 --> 01:45:16,809
a <i>freak wormhole opened up in
the fabric of the space-time continuum</i>

1359
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:20,388
<i>and carried his words
far, far back in time,</i>

1360
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:24,525
<i>across almost infinite reaches of space,
to a distant galaxy</i>

1361
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:28,278
<i>where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink</i>

1362
01:45:28,365 --> 01:45:30,857
<i>of frightful interstellar battle.</i>

1363
01:45:30,909 --> 01:45:35,494
<i>The two opposing leaders, resplendent
in their black-jewelled battle shorts</i>

1364
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,571
<i>were meeting for the last time,</i>

1365
01:45:37,749 --> 01:45:40,491
<i>when a dreadful silence fell.</i>

1366
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,542
<i>And at that very moment,</i>

1367
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:46,623
<i>the words "I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel"</i>

1368
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:49,750
<i>drifted across the conference table.</i>

1369
01:45:49,803 --> 01:45:52,511
<i>Unfortunately, in their native tongue,</i>

1370
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:55,589
<i>this was the most appalling
insult imaginable.</i>

1371
01:45:55,684 --> 01:45:57,300
<i>So the opposing battle fleets</i>

1372
01:45:57,394 --> 01:45:59,977
<i>decided to settle
their remaining differences,</i>

1373
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:03,431
<i>in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy,</i>

1374
01:46:03,567 --> 01:46:07,652
<i>now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark.</i>

1375
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:10,988
<i>For thousands of years,
the mighty starships tore across</i>

1376
01:46:11,116 --> 01:46:16,577
<i>the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet Earth,</i>

1377
01:46:16,621 --> 01:46:20,660
<i>where, due to
a terrible miscalculation of scale,</i>

1378
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:25,628
<i>the entire battle fleet was
accidentally swallowed by a small dog.</i>

1379
01:46:25,672 --> 01:46:29,290
<i>Those who study the complex
interplay of cause and effect</i>

1380
01:46:29,384 --> 01:46:31,125
<i>in the history of the universe</i>

1381
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:35,759
<i>say that this sort of thing
is going on all the time.</i>

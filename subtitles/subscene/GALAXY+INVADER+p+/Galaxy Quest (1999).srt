1
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,265
- Exiting time knot now, sir.
- We're alive.

2
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,225
We made it, Commander. We made it.

3
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,771
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,898
Systems register functional.

5
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,776
All systems are working, Commander.

6
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,277
I don't like it. It was too easy.

7
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,199
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

8
00:01:01,283 --> 00:01:02,909
There are time knots
opening everywhere!

9
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:05,369
- A trap!
- We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,502
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

11
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:16,379
Surrender may be our only option.

12
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:20,467
No! Never give up! Never surrender!

13
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:22,761
Your orders, sir?

14
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:26,388
Sir? Your orders?

15
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,019
Activate the Omega 13.

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,524
Well?

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,028
Well, there you are. Yeah!

18
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:48,952
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

19
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:53,123
You are the first people to see

20
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:57,876
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter

21
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:00,587
since it was originally aired in 1982!

22
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,006
Yeah! All right.

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,594
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

24
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:14,559
The intrepid crew
ofthe NSEA Protector! Yeah!

25
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:18,563
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

26
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:23,901
White scarf, black buttons,
white shoes...

27
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,989
Man, where the hell is he?
An hour and a half late?

28
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:32,242
- An hour and a half.
- I mean, this is unreal.

29
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,619
They're gonna start
eating each other out there.

30
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:38,248
Did you hear? He booked
another appearance without us.

31
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,332
You're kidding!

32
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:50,593
- How did I come to this?
- Not again.

33
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:53,179
- I played Richard the Third.
- Five curtain calls.

34
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:55,556
There were five curtain calls.
I was an actor once,

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,349
damn it, now look at me. Look at me!

36
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:01,728
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

37
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:06,441
- I can't, I won't.
- Well, Alex, at least you had a part.

38
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,860
Okay? You had
a character people loved.

39
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:12,906
I mean, my TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

40
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,741
and how they fit into my suit.

41
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:18,243
No one even bothered to ask me
what I do on the show.

42
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:23,123
You had the... Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

43
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,459
I repeated the computer, Fred.

44
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:28,629
Your commander is on deck!

45
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:32,798
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

46
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,718
Am I too late
for Alexander's panic attack?

47
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:41,766
Apparently not. You know,
you should get that looked at. Yeah.

48
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,560
Let's take a look at a few more clips.

49
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,103
Okay. What did I do?

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,523
What?

51
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,234
- We want the crew!
- For those four seasons,

52
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,612
we developed
the same affection for the crew

53
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:57,197
as the crew had for each other.

54
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:02,868
I mean, these weren'tjust adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

55
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,788
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it, man!

56
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,207
It's not a big deal. These guys put
a little set in their basement.

57
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,084
I'm there about an hour.

58
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:13,337
It's nothing, Gwen.
They wanted the Commander.

59
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,257
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him! Grab him!

60
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,466
- We want the crew!
- We want the crew!

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,929
Okay! Yeah! Here we go!

62
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,431
- Come on, old friend, old friend.
- Friend?

63
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,102
You stole all my best lines,
you cut me out of episode two entirely!

64
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:34,106
Tawny Madison, my personal favorite,
Gwen DeMarco!

65
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,775
Yeah!

66
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,610
It's getting hotter, Commander.

67
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

68
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:46,368
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo, Tommy Webber!

69
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,288
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

70
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,124
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

71
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,709
Freddie Kwan!

72
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,213
Damn you.

73
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:04,635
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,555
Tev'Meck, Alexander Dane!

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,224
Yeah! All right!

76
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:17,814
By Grabthar's hammer,
you shall be avenged!

77
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:20,150
Yeah! All right!

78
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,068
That guy can act.

79
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:27,364
And finally, my fellow Questerians,

80
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,244
the brave commander
ofthe NSEA Protector,

81
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,330
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter...

82
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,539
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy...

83
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:38,291
Taggart, Taggart, Taggart, Taggart...

84
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,002
Jason Nesmith!

85
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,921
Yeah! All right!

86
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,886
We love you, Commander!

87
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:53,638
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

88
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,390
- Never surrender!
- Never surrender!

89
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,184
- Damn the resonance cannons,
- Damn the resonance cannons,

90
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,853
- full speed ahead!
- full speed ahead!

91
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:05,525
The Commander and his crew
will be signing autographs

92
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,944
on imperial decks C and B
near the Coke machines.

93
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,907
Quest forever, man!

94
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,993
Excuse me, pardon me,
crew member coming through.

95
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,496
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, man.

96
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,957
I want to thank you for that nice intro
you gave us today.

97
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:26,461
Guy. Probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses, right?

98
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:29,089
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

99
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,717
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

100
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:37,722
Listen, maybe I could sit in
and sign a couple of autographs?

101
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:41,767
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

102
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,149
By Grabthar's...

103
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:51,777
Next.

104
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,613
Had I moved an inch to the left,
the beast would have killed me.

105
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,407
On the other hand,
my crew was in danger.

106
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:58,741
How did you know what to do?

107
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:02,328
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

108
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:07,667
I think we all remember what happened
to that beast on Enok Vll, right?

109
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,920
You've got to admit,
they really do love him.

110
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,507
Yeah, almost as much
as he loves himself.

111
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,262
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

112
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,347
I was wondering if you could help
settle the dispute

113
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:25,016
that my crew and I seem to be having.

114
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,935
If you remember,
in "Quasar Dilemma"...

115
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,354
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

116
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,900
Hadn't even gotten to
the relevant conundrum.

117
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:38,028
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V,"

118
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:42,449
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander kind of had a thing.

119
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,950
Did you?

120
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,953
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

121
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,913
Well, that's her story.

122
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,086
Excuse me.

123
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,130
Gwen.

124
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:04,303
Gwen!

125
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,639
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

126
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:10,309
I must speak to you.
It is a matter of supreme importance.

127
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:12,603
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula

128
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,770
and we need your help.

129
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:18,983
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

130
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,735
Just hammer out the details
with my agent,

131
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,612
and make sure
there's a limo at my house.

132
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:26,699
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.

133
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:28,783
Remember, mum's the word.

134
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,536
Certainly, but...

135
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,539
- Mum.
- Mum.

136
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,084
Here, and beautiful!

137
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,673
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

138
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,010
is filling my head with such thoughts.

139
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,596
It was cute when I didn't know you.

140
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,876
What a freak show, man.
This is hilarious.

141
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:27,047
Bunch of losers! Begging
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

142
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,676
These guys haven't had a real acting
job for 20 years. This is all they've got.

143
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,385
And did you check out Nesmith?

144
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,512
- He actually gets off on those retards...
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,347
...thinking he's a space commander!

146
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:39,350
- And his friends...
- I know, they can't stand him!

147
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,560
Did you hear them ragging
on him in there?

148
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,104
Dude, he has no idea
he's a laughingstock,

149
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,480
even to his buddies.

150
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,649
- He's pathetic!
- Come on, come on.

151
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,234
The Galaxy Quest dancers
are almost on.

152
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:51,528
Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

153
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,791
Hey, Commander,

154
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,877
so as I was saying
in "The Quasar Dilemma,"

155
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,963
remember, you used
the auxiliary deck B for...

156
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,340
Can you get this?
Deck B for gamma override.

157
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,302
The thing is that
online blueprints clearly indicate that

158
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:19,012
deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

159
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:22,682
So we were wondering,
just where the error lies in that?

160
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:26,686
It's just a television show.
That's all, okay?

161
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,189
Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering
if the quantum flux, nowjust listen...

162
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:33,776
There is no quantum flux.
There's no auxiliary.

163
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,195
There's no goddamn ship!

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,655
You got it?

165
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,876
I mean it. I mean it, Alex.

166
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,129
I've never seen him lose it like that.
Not to a fan.

167
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,256
I mean, it was just weird.

168
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,594
Gwen, I have said it for years.

169
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,554
He's mentally unstable.

170
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,141
I... I'm worried. It just was not like him.

171
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:31,205
As long as there is injustice,

172
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:34,166
whenever a Targathian baby cries out,

173
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,001
wherever a distress signal sounds,

174
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,251
- among the stars...
- Among the stars...

175
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:38,461
...we'll be there.

176
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:41,881
- This fine ship and this fine crew.
- This fine ship and this fine crew.

177
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,383
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

178
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,302
- Never surrender.
- Never surrender.

179
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,065
Can I help you?

180
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,735
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach
in protocol...

181
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,029
- You shouldn't come to my house, man.
- Please, I beg you to hear our plea.

182
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,615
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

183
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,576
Our people are being systematically
hunted and slaughtered

184
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,745
by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

185
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,329
We are to meet in negotiation.

186
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:04,125
However, our efforts in this regard
have been disastrous.

187
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,504
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

188
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:14,593
- We have secured our limousine.
- What?

189
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,640
It's the thing for the thing that's...

190
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,438
Maybe I should get some pants on.

191
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,356
Come on in.

192
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,324
Commander, I must say that
standing here in your presence

193
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:42,869
is the greatest honor we could ever
have hoped to achieve in our lifetime.

194
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,497
That's... I really appreciate that.

195
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,667
Would you guys look for another shoe
that looks like this, please?

196
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,595
Sir, I am Lahnk,
senior requisition officer.

197
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,890
Before we travel to the ship, please let
me know if you have any requirements.

198
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,184
Weapons, documents, personnel.

199
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,895
A Coca-Cola, do you have one of those?

200
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:12,898
Sir, I am Teb.

201
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,609
I would like to explain the history
between our people

202
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,653
and the Sarris dominion
in greater detail.

203
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:19,862
Hey, how you doing?

204
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:23,491
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

205
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,992
our people were one...

206
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,702
What's your name?

207
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:30,997
- Doesn't she talk?
- Her translator is broken.

208
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:36,962
Okey-dokey.

209
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:41,091
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast,

210
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:45,344
so I'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit.

211
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:49,682
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, okay?

212
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,018
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

213
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:54,562
our people were one people.

214
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:59,942
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

215
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:04,237
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

216
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,700
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths. The foolishness!

217
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:12,412
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

218
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,880
Commander. Commander?

219
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,548
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

220
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,926
but your presence is requested
on the command deck.

221
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,390
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.

222
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:37,560
We are approaching his ship
at the Ni-Delta now.

223
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,937
He wants an answer to his proposal.
I understand...

224
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,440
I got most of it in the car.
Sarris is the bad guy, right?

225
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,609
Oh, yes, sir.
He's a very bad man indeed.

226
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,319
He has tortured our scientists,

227
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,695
put us to work
in the gallium arsenide mines,

228
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,822
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

229
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,198
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.

230
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,618
Do you have pages
orjust want me to wing this?

231
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:56,244
I am not sure I understand you.

232
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,747
Commander, welcome
to the Protector Two.

233
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,207
- Good to see you.
- Would you like to don your uniform?

234
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,626
No, you know what? I'd like to skip that.

235
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,794
I got this gig in Van Nuys in about
a quarter of an hour. Is that all right?

236
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,673
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

237
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:19,057
General, I have just received word

238
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,975
the Thermians have appointed
a new commander

239
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,186
to handle the negotiations.

240
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,146
What?

241
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:34,155
This is great. You know, usually
it's just cardboard walls in a garage.

242
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,240
Sir, we apologize
for operating in low-power mode,

243
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:40,410
but we are experiencing
a reflective flux field

244
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,121
this close to the galactic axis.

245
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,249
You know, what I could use is
a cup holder and a couple ofAdvil.

246
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:49,628
We're approaching in five ticks, sir.
Command to slow?

247
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:52,171
Set it on screensaver two.

248
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:57,301
I guess, we, you know, got to...

249
00:16:57,386 --> 00:17:00,638
I'm sorry to break up the mood here.

250
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,224
Slow it down to mark two, Lieutenant.

251
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,518
I see fear. That is expected.

252
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,190
- They bring a new commander.
- It's good.

253
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,567
- Here are my demands.
- Scary. I mean, you know, it looks...

254
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,278
- And if I do not hear what I like,
- ... real.

255
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:23,033
then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine!

256
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:25,953
- First...
- Backwash.

257
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:29,540
...I require the Omega 13.

258
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:32,876
Second, I will require a technician...

259
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:37,672
Okey-dokey! Okey-dokey!
Let's fire blue particle cannons full,

260
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,257
red particle cannons full,

261
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:43,636
gannet magnets, fire them left and right
and let them run all chutes.

262
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:46,848
And while you're at it,
why don't you toss that at them, killer?

263
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,517
That should take care
of old lobster head, shouldn't it?

264
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,727
Yeah.

265
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,694
Commander, where are you going?

266
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,946
- Home.
- You mean Earth?

267
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,573
Yeah, Earth.
I need to get back to Earth, kids.

268
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,784
But the negotiations, you fired on him.

269
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,286
Yeah. Yeah. Long live...
What was your planet called?

270
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,830
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia. This way?

271
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:14,331
What if Sarris survives?

272
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,334
- I doubt it. We gave him both barrels.
- He has a very powerful ship.

273
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,211
If you got any more problems
with the guy,

274
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,589
just, you know, give me a call.

275
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:27,552
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

276
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,929
How can we thank you, Commander?

277
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:33,308
You have saved our people.

278
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,812
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:40,731
You know, you kids have been great.
You really have.

280
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,524
This thing is real-looking.

281
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,151
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

282
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,698
Hey! Where's my limo?

283
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,481
Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

284
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:14,235
But we've never seen space-age
values like we've seen here at...

285
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,988
Tech Value Electronics Superstore!

286
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,165
By Grabthar's hammer,

287
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,085
what a savings.

288
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,383
All right! Yeah, let's hear it
for the NSEA Protector.

289
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:39,634
Vacuum laser...

290
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,469
What, no, no, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.

291
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,305
Yes, if he's down in the Omega 13...

292
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,224
- Brandon, are you okay?
- Commander! My apologies.

293
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,102
You know, evidently we had
a little miscommunication

294
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:53,939
regarding the voyage.
You didn't show up.

295
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:59,737
- He...
- He did it again.

296
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:05,241
Do you know what time it is?

297
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:07,535
Why do you even bother
to show up at all?

298
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,039
No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.

299
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:12,749
I was up there.

300
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,627
Remember yesterday at the convention,
those people dressed like aliens?

301
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:18,378
They were aliens.
They were Termites or Dalmatians.

302
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:20,756
I can't really remember
'cause I was kind of hung-over.

303
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,384
But what they built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

304
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:28,138
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

305
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:34,602
I know what you're thinking.
But I can prove it. They gave me this.

306
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:40,816
No, no, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

307
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,236
Protector, this is the Commander. Over.

308
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,197
- Oh, for God's sake.
- That's it. It's time to go!

309
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:47,907
This isn't mine.

310
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,200
That kid. Where's that kid?

311
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:54,037
Begging your pardon, Commander,
we come with news. Sarris lives.

312
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,247
- He was able upon your departure...
- Listen.

313
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,581
- ... to make an escape.
- Tell them.

314
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,124
- However, he has contacted us...
- Sarris.

315
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,626
...and wishes to negotiate a surrender.

316
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,421
We humbly implore you to come
and negotiate the terms.

317
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,091
They want me back?
You want me back?

318
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,425
Is this amazing? They want me back,

319
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,219
and I want you guys
to go with me, please.

320
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:13,097
Don't even think about it. Let's go. Yes!

321
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:17,017
You're going? Alexander, this is not...
I'm not kidding here!

322
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:21,104
This isn't some kind of prank!
I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen.

323
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:24,440
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.
Stop, come here.

324
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,651
You know me.
I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?

325
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,861
You know,
it's one thing to treat us this way.

326
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,739
It's another thing to do it to your fans.

327
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:35,034
She's not a fan! This is a Termite!

328
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:38,745
You should've just let me hit him.

329
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,208
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

330
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:46,336
I think we should've just taken the gig.

331
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,755
I mean, who knows
the next time he'll ask us.

332
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,967
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

333
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:00,641
But you live with your mother.

334
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:04,562
- Did Jason come through here?
- Yeah, he's in there. Hey, guys.

335
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,856
We are coming, too.

336
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,485
- All of you wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

337
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,488
You see, we work together, or not at all.

338
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:18,658
Wonderful. The Commander
had me continue transmission

339
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,785
in case you changed your mind.

340
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,456
- Protector, requesting four interstellar...
- Me, too.

341
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,958
Five pods for immediate departure.

342
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:34,340
Guys. Guys?

343
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:37,885
I look forward to meeting you all
in person when you arrive at the ship.

344
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,594
End transmission.

345
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:43,598
Oh, my God.

346
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,727
Anybody got any change?

347
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:58,126
Our most sincere apologies.

348
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,295
We forgot about
our appearance generators.

349
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,090
You guys came!
Who wants the grand tour?

350
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,348
Anybody else?

351
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,687
That was a hell of a thing.

352
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,277
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

353
00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:28,112
That's right, guys, just keep shaking
it off, it gets better.

354
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,240
- Hey, try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

355
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:33,451
The 23rd quadrant
of the Gamma sector.

356
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,828
There's a map in the core room.
I'll show you, come on.

357
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:39,832
- Welcome, my friends!
- This is Mathesar, he's their leader.

358
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:44,294
I am Mathesar. On behalf of
all my people I wish to thank you

359
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,465
- from the deepest place in our hearts.
- Mathesar, this is my crew.

360
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,303
Dr. Lazarus.

361
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,430
- Dr. Lazarus.
- Dr. Lazarus.

362
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,392
Lieutenant Madison.

363
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,187
- Lieutenant Madison.
- Lieutenant Madison.

364
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,652
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

365
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,905
- Young Laredo.
- Young Laredo.

366
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,283
Tech Sergeant Chen.

367
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,036
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Tech Sergeant Chen.

368
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,835
Crewman number... Guy.

369
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,879
- Guy.
- Guy.

370
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,464
You know us?

371
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:39,221
I don't believe there is a man, woman
or child on my planet who does not.

372
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:41,223
For years since we first
received transmission

373
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,974
of your historical documents,

374
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,268
we have studied every facet
of your missions and strategies.

375
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,686
You've been watching the show?

376
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:51,065
Lieutenant, historical documents.

377
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,859
Historical documents from out here?

378
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:57,863
Yes. The past 100 years,
our society had fallen into disarray.

379
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:01,200
Our goals, our values had become
scattered, but since the transmission,

380
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:05,495
we have modeled every aspect
of our society from your example,

381
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,997
and it has saved us.

382
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:12,460
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

383
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,046
In fact, all you see around you
has been taken

384
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,465
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

385
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,385
Is this a spaceship?

386
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:25,097
No, this is a star port for the ship.

387
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,725
Would you guys like to see the ship?

388
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:52,872
Oh, my God!

389
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,171
It's real.

390
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:11,724
The generator room.

391
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:15,102
The beryllium sphere, of course.

392
00:28:15,186 --> 00:28:19,023
And as we continue,
the medical quarters are to the left.

393
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:22,233
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

394
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:24,152
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- What the hell is going on?

395
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,779
- What are we doing here?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

396
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:29,699
We're just here to negotiate
this guy Sarris' surrender.

397
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:30,867
It's no big deal.

398
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:34,954
And the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

399
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,958
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

400
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:43,587
- Come on, guys.
- Jason, we're actors, not astronauts.

401
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,465
You guys want to go home?
You say the word, we'll go home.

402
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,800
Pay our bills, feed our fish,

403
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:53,387
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

404
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,931
Come on.
Do you guys want to do that? Anybody?

405
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:59,518
Gwen, come on, think about it.
Look at where we are. We're in space.

406
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:03,481
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime.
You guys want to leave?

407
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:07,484
We have enjoyed preparing
many of your esoteric dishes.

408
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:11,905
Your Monte Cristo sandwich is
a current favorite of the adventurous.

409
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:13,657
The main barracks.

410
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,128
At ease.

411
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:35,594
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.

412
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:41,015
What?

413
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm just jazzed about
being on the show, man.

414
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,736
If you would all take your positions.

415
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,238
Our what?

416
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:57,447
Guys.

417
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:01,785
Oh, my!

418
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,501
Look, this thingy.

419
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:14,338
I remember I had it all worked out.

420
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:17,675
This is forward. This is back.

421
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,679
Commander, some of
the crew has requested

422
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:24,348
to be present at this historic event.

423
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,308
Sure. Bring them in.

424
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:46,452
No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

425
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:49,705
Laredo, take us out.

426
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,542
Excuse me?

427
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,671
They designed those controls
after watching you.

428
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,468
- Take her out.
- Right, right.

429
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:06,345
Okay. Right.

430
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:11,517
Right. Take her out.

431
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,994
Okay, you got to move to the right.
Move more to the right.

432
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,332
Would you sit your ass down? Sit!
Move! You want to drive this thing?

433
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:15,925
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander?

434
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,761
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed Iowa beef.

435
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:23,223
Yes, we programmed the food
synthesizer for each of you

436
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:25,767
based on the regional menu
of your birthplace.

437
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:29,187
I don't care where you did it,
it tastes great.

438
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:32,065
Are you enjoying your Kep-mok
blood ticks, Dr. Lazarus?

439
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,400
Just like Mother used to make.

440
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:41,616
So, tell me, Mathesar,

441
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,994
this Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

442
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,913
what does he want?

443
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:50,498
He heard about the device,
the Omega 13.

444
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,960
What is it? What does it do?

445
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:56,087
We don't know.

446
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,840
We were hoping you could enlighten us.

447
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,514
The Omega 13 device.

448
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:12,770
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

449
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:16,148
Why don't you just turn it on
and see what it does?

450
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:21,527
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

451
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:23,404
If we were mistaken in our construction,

452
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,033
the device would act as a molecular
explosive, causing a chain reaction

453
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:30,286
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

454
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,624
Has Sarris ever seen
any of the historical records?

455
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,708
No, thank God, he has not.

456
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,463
So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

457
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,055
Our former commander was not strong.

458
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,556
Former commander?

459
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:57,353
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

460
00:34:57,437 --> 00:35:00,982
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

461
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,776
Originally, one of our own tried to lead.

462
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,444
Is that all?

463
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:10,865
After three days of this,
you still require incentive?

464
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,662
I have told you all I know.

465
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,623
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

466
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:23,336
When I grow weary of
the noises you make, you shall die.

467
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,809
Hey, guys, come on, hold on a minute.

468
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:40,977
You just can't leave.
Give me some time to think.

469
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:42,020
- Think.
- He wants to think.

470
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,522
No, Jason. That's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about!

471
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:45,690
I'm not even supposed to be here.

472
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:47,817
I'm just crewman number six.
I'm expendable.

473
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,528
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious.

474
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:51,738
I got to get out of here.

475
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,531
Commander! Commander?

476
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:56,199
We got to prepare
the pods for my crew's departure.

477
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,868
But begging your
Commander's pardon, sir,

478
00:35:57,952 --> 00:35:59,536
we can't launch pods at the moment.

479
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,164
Sarris will surely detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

480
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:04,082
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here now.

481
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,169
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

482
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,053
There's nobody here.

483
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,889
While my people are talented scientists,

484
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:21,849
our attempt to operate
our own technologies

485
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:25,227
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

486
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:27,604
I have raised Sarris on Zeta frequency.

487
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:31,024
- Mathesar...
- We meet again, Commander.

488
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:34,861
Hello, Sarris. How you doing?

489
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,988
Better than my lieutenant.

490
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:41,409
He failed to activate
the ship's neutron armor

491
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:45,204
as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.

492
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,247
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say

493
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,957
I'm real sorry about
what happened before.

494
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,544
The whole thing was just
a misunderstanding.

495
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:57,674
Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship!

496
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,427
You know, we'd like to do that,

497
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,972
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

498
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,725
You have 10 seconds!

499
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,603
I don't... Ten seconds? I don't... There...

500
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,773
You know, okay. Gosh darn it, I give up.
It's yours. You can have it.

501
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,443
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay?

502
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,611
Gwen.

503
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,490
Don't panic.
I've dealt with this guy before.

504
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,033
He's as stupid as he is ugly.

505
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,159
- Come here.
- Jason.

506
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,452
Not now, Gwen.

507
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,370
- No!
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

508
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,288
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right?

509
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:33,332
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

510
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,376
Push these red buttons and
send everything we have towards him.

511
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,169
- Okay?
- Okay.

512
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:40,798
All right, Gwen,
put me back on with him.

513
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:44,718
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back on.

514
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:48,972
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander!

515
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:56,980
I gave you the "kill" gesture.

516
00:37:57,064 --> 00:38:00,400
Yeah. No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

517
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:04,486
- Like I know where the hold button is.
- Hey, you guys.

518
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:08,157
There's a red thingy

519
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:11,201
- moving toward the green thingy.
- What?

520
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:15,372
Red thingy moving toward
the green thingy.

521
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:18,666
I think we're the green thingy.

522
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,003
A little present for you, Commander.

523
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,671
We got to get out of here!
Move the ship! Turn it! Move it! Go!

524
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh, no!

525
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:31,554
Oh, my God!

526
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:42,772
Tommy, Tommy, let's go!

527
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:43,899
- Get us out of here!
- Jason, what do I do?

528
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:45,942
- Let's go! Go, go, go!
- What do I do?

529
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:01,373
They're turning. They're coming!

530
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:09,130
Thrust ahead, full!

531
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,717
Fire at will.

532
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,348
- Go faster, Tommy!
- I'm going as fast as I can, Jason!

533
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:21,391
She's still behind us!

534
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,143
Well, press "turbo. "

535
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,603
I've always said,
"Press the turbo," right?

536
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:28,607
- It's right here! Right here!
- Well, press it and hold it down!

537
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,821
The enemy is matching velocity.

538
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,533
- Enemy is matching velocity.
- We heard it the first time!

539
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:42,870
Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

540
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:45,581
Hi, guys. Listen,

541
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:51,419
they're telling me
the generators won't take it.

542
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:56,716
The ship is breaking apart and all that.
Just FYl.

543
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,427
- We've got to stop!
- We stop and we die.

544
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:02,222
- Tommy, just hold that thing down!
- You cannot hold the turbo down!

545
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,683
- It's for quick boosts!
- Like you know!

546
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:13,565
I remember that sound.
That's a bad sound.

547
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,861
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We might
be able to lose them in this cloud here.

548
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:21,073
- I don't think that's a cloud.
- Mathesar, what is it?

549
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:25,618
This is the Tothian minefield left
standing from the great war of 12185.

550
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,750
Oh, God!

551
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:49,725
Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one?

552
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:53,894
Sorry, man, they're drifting towards us.
I think they're magnetic!

553
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:00,443
Continue forward, sir?

554
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:03,571
Patience, Lieutenant.

555
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:06,741
Patience.

556
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,461
- We've got to stop!
- We're almost through this.

557
00:41:40,272 --> 00:41:43,024
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

558
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:45,610
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?

559
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:48,905
- Tommy! You all right?
- Oh, man!

560
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,575
No, my arm is broke.
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

561
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:56,578
- I'll take him to medical quarters.
- Thanks, Mathesar.

562
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:06,213
Alex, where are you going?

563
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:08,256
To see if there's a pub!

564
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:21,477
Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

565
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:24,438
Aft vector guards, 96% damage.

566
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:29,859
Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 34, 40...

567
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:34,906
- What about the engines?
- Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

568
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,952
Computer, what about the engines?
Why don't we have power?

569
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:42,163
The beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress.

570
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,581
It's fractured.

571
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,418
Can it be repaired?

572
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:49,628
Computer, can it be repaired?

573
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:52,589
Damage to
beryllium sphere irreparable.

574
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:55,092
New source of beryllium
must be secured.

575
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,760
We need another one.

576
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:59,846
You broke the ship.
You broke the bloody ship!

577
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:09,939
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

578
00:43:10,023 --> 00:43:14,818
Negative. No reserve
beryllium sphere exists on board.

579
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:18,613
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

580
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:20,991
You know, that is
really getting annoying!

581
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:23,827
Look, I have one job on this lousy ship.

582
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:27,456
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay?

583
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,207
Sure, no problem.

584
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:40,134
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

585
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,136
How have you failed us?

586
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,931
We have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations.

587
00:43:47,016 --> 00:43:50,518
The fault must lie with us, with the ship.

588
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:54,105
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

589
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,942
It's my fault. We screwed...

590
00:43:58,027 --> 00:44:01,528
We are not the people you think we are.

591
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:03,363
I don't understand.

592
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:14,208
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theater? Films?

593
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:17,668
The historical documents
of your culture. Yes, in fact,

594
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:21,005
we have begun to document
our history from your example.

595
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:24,884
No, not historical documents.
They're not all historical documents.

596
00:44:24,968 --> 00:44:28,763
I mean, surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

597
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:32,308
Those poor people.

598
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:35,143
Oh, brother.

599
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:38,688
We're screwed.

600
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:43,652
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way

601
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:46,071
that's contrary to reality?

602
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:50,032
You are speaking of...

603
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:52,826
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

604
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:55,871
We have only recently
become aware of this concept

605
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:57,915
in our dealings with Sarris.

606
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:00,960
Often, Sarris will say
one thing and do another.

607
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:03,712
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.

608
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:07,799
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great cost.

609
00:45:07,883 --> 00:45:09,926
But if you are saying that any of you

610
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,804
could have traits
in common with Sarris...

611
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,734
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

612
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:34,283
And we might be able to get there
if we reconfigure the solar matrix

613
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:37,577
in parallel for endothermic propulsion.

614
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,328
What do you think?

615
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,585
- We'll do that!
- All right!

616
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:51,506
That's right again. That's...
Come on, group hug. Come on.

617
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,813
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

618
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:12,067
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

619
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:14,695
I have studied
your missions extensively.

620
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:18,115
Though I am Thermian,
I have lived my life by your philosophy,

621
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:20,200
by the code of the Mak'tar.

622
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:23,536
Good, that's very nice.

623
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:25,455
By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus...

624
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:28,458
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was only...

625
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:29,876
Just don't.

626
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:33,504
Yes, sir.

627
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,724
Never give up. Never surrender.

628
00:46:53,024 --> 00:46:56,192
Dr. Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

629
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:58,819
I have programmed it
to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere

630
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:01,530
of sufficient density.

631
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:03,949
Good luck on your mission, sir.

632
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:06,702
Thanks.

633
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,712
You're doing good, Tommy.

634
00:47:23,386 --> 00:47:26,220
I changed my mind. I want to go back.

635
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:29,390
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

636
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:32,351
Yeah, but that's when I thought I was
the crewman that stays on the ship

637
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:34,687
and something is up there
then it kills me.

638
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:36,939
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster

639
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,816
five minutes after we land on the planet!

640
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,942
You're not gonna die on the planet, Guy.

641
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:43,695
I'm not? Then what's my last name?

642
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:46,864
It's... I don't know.

643
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:49,701
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

644
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,537
Because my character isn't important
enough for a last name.

645
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,206
Because I'm gonna die five minutes in.

646
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,125
Guy, you have a last name.

647
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,420
- Do I? Do I?
- Yes!

648
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,841
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

649
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,970
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

650
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,471
Are we there yet?

651
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,265
- Mommy!
- Tommy!

652
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,226
- Look out!
- Oh, no! Pull out!

653
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,936
Oh, yeah!

654
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,189
Come on. Oh, boy! Come on.

655
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:40,790
Hey! Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

656
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,209
Is there air? You don't know!

657
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:51,884
Seems okay.

658
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:08,524
Here we go.

659
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:15,405
Which way, Alexander?

660
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:23,205
This way!

661
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,541
Wait. No.

662
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,047
That way.

663
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:35,299
- You were holding it upside down.
- Shut up.

664
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:36,592
You know,
with all that makeup and stuff,

665
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:38,511
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.

666
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,513
You think you could do better, Laredo?

667
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:43,808
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- We're screwed. We're so screwed.

668
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:45,684
Come on, come on, come on.
If we want to finish this mission,

669
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,227
we have to use some self-control.

670
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:50,313
Self-control?
That's funny coming from a guy

671
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:53,691
who slept with every Terrakian slave girl
and moon princess on the show.

672
00:49:53,776 --> 00:49:55,568
Did it ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive

673
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,737
we might have been able...

674
00:49:58,656 --> 00:50:02,741
Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

675
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,410
Where are the miners?

676
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:09,248
- Something bad happened here.
- Will you relax?

677
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:17,214
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

678
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:47,242
Look at that. Would you look at that?

679
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:51,620
They look like little children.

680
00:50:53,123 --> 00:50:55,374
Could they be the miners?

681
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:58,544
Sure, they're like, three years old.

682
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:03,757
Miners, not minors!

683
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:05,925
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

684
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,387
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

685
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:13,349
Sure, they're cute now, but in a second,
they're gonna get mean.

686
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:14,934
They're gonna get ugly somehow,

687
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:18,021
then there's gonna be
a million more of them.

688
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:20,981
Look. There's a little hurt one.

689
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:32,576
Hi. Hi there.

690
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,413
Did you guys ever watch the show?

691
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:43,836
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

692
00:51:52,678 --> 00:51:55,180
I'm so sick of being right.

693
00:51:55,264 --> 00:51:57,390
Let's get out of here
before one of those things kills Guy.

694
00:51:57,475 --> 00:52:00,477
Wait a minute! We're not going
anywhere without a beryllium sphere.

695
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,520
We need a plan.
Fred, I need a diversion

696
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,314
to clear the compound of those things.

697
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:06,691
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.

698
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:07,816
Tommy, get up on that ridge.

699
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:09,944
If you see them come back
give me a signal, all right?

700
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:11,737
Why does this sound so familiar?

701
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:14,448
"Assault on Voltareck lll," episode 81.

702
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:17,284
- We're doing episode 81?
- Whatever. The one with the hologram.

703
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,536
- The wall of fire.
- Well, how the hell is Fred

704
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:21,455
supposed to project a hologram?

705
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:24,290
- Are we doing episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan, Guy.

706
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,292
What difference does it make
if it's episode 81 or not?

707
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,836
'Cause I died in episode 81.

708
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:30,338
- Episode 51, right?
-51. 51.

709
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:33,466
This is ludicrous.
Why are you listening to this fellow?

710
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,970
May I remind you he's wearing
a costume, not a uniform.

711
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:40,889
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.

712
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:44,309
Look, they're gone.

713
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,770
- Where'd they go? Back inside?
- I don't know.

714
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:48,897
Nobody was watching?

715
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:50,607
All right, all right. Listen up.
Here's the plan.

716
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,776
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will go down and get a sphere.

717
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,694
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter
and Tommy, you're lookout.

718
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:57,113
You see anything at all,
you give us a signal, all right?

719
00:52:57,197 --> 00:52:58,489
What kind of a signal?

720
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:02,034
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands like this.

721
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:06,247
What are you, an infant?
Look, we have these.

722
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:10,709
That. Sorry.

723
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:12,544
Let's go.

724
00:53:19,093 --> 00:53:22,762
- Does the rolling help actually?
- It helps.

725
00:53:22,847 --> 00:53:25,515
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

726
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:35,816
What?

727
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,112
Never give up. Never surrender.

728
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:42,030
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, shut up.

729
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:46,034
Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of them, Jason!

730
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:49,454
Run, Jason! Run!
They're coming! They're everywhere!

731
00:53:50,622 --> 00:53:53,207
- They're everywhere!
- Jason, they're everywhere!

732
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:56,044
- They're everywhere!
- Come on, let's go!

733
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:59,212
- They're coming!
- Hurry!

734
00:54:01,382 --> 00:54:04,634
- They're everywhere! Come on!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

735
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,887
Don't look back. Do not look back!

736
00:54:06,971 --> 00:54:09,431
- Oh, God.
- We're not gonna make it!

737
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:12,600
Oh, God!

738
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:16,479
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

739
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:20,316
Go, go, go! Come on! Push it harder!
Let's go, Tommy!

740
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,568
I got it but it's gonna
take a few seconds.

741
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:24,195
I got it, I got it!

742
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:25,905
- Oh, yeah!
- Go ahead.

743
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:27,406
There's no time. Get in! Get in!

744
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:29,574
Come on. I've forgotten you've got
to be the hero, haven't you?

745
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:34,245
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight! Oh, no! Jason Nesmith...

746
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,873
Jason! Jason, come on! Hurry!

747
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:40,085
- I'm on it!
- Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

748
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:43,004
No, no, no! Jason, please!

749
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:46,924
- Tommy, stop the pod! He's not in!
- But I can't stop it, it's on autopilot!

750
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:48,634
- Go! Leave him!
- No!

751
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:01,687
Oh, right!

752
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:04,690
Of course, it's always about you, isn't it?

753
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:45,521
- Gorignak! Gorignak!
- Gorignak! Gorignak!

754
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:50,608
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

755
00:55:50,693 --> 00:55:52,610
Yeah, Gwen, you got me.

756
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:54,821
- Thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

757
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:58,575
As a matter of fact, I have Gorignak
staring me in the face right now.

758
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,911
But you know what?
I think I can take him.

759
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:06,999
Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.

760
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,876
- The digital conveyor?
- Yes.

761
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,461
You mean
I'm gonna be diced into cubes

762
00:56:11,546 --> 00:56:13,338
and sent up there in a million pieces?

763
00:56:13,423 --> 00:56:16,383
- Right.
- Well, you know what?

764
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:19,260
I think I'll take my chance
with Gorignak.

765
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:24,182
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?

766
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:26,517
It has never been successfully tested.

767
00:56:26,602 --> 00:56:29,770
- What did he say?
- Hold, please.

768
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:32,231
Theoretically the mechanism
is fully operational.

769
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:36,109
However it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.

770
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:38,695
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.

771
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:43,116
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.

772
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:46,369
I mean, I can't. I can supervise...

773
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:48,246
Jason, we're gonna test it.

774
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:51,248
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

775
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,167
Hey, I'm doing all right
with the pig lizard.

776
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,294
Please, Fred? And hurry.

777
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:02,468
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.

778
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,887
The operation of the conveyor is
much more art than science.

779
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:07,639
Stand back, Jason.

780
00:57:32,997 --> 00:57:35,374
What? What was that?

781
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,625
- Nothing.
- I hear some squealing or something.

782
00:57:37,709 --> 00:57:41,587
- Oh, no. Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

783
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:44,173
I heard that. It turned inside out?

784
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:49,929
And it exploded.

785
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:54,641
Did I just hear that that animal
turned inside out and then it exploded?

786
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:55,892
Hello?

787
00:57:58,354 --> 00:57:59,854
Hold, please.

788
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,440
Hey, wait a minute, guys, guys.

789
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:05,485
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?

790
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:07,987
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

791
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:14,868
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!

792
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:21,709
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

793
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,502
What the hell you talking about?

794
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,179
Oh, darn.

795
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,567
Digitize me!

796
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:50,319
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys. Digitize me!

797
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:51,820
- Oh, no, not me.
- Come on, they...

798
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:53,322
They based it on your hand movements.

799
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:54,864
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

800
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,241
- No, no, no.
- I'm not the guy.

801
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,993
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen,
I'm Fred Kwan.

802
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,995
I'm not even...
Kwan's not even my real name.

803
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,247
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.

804
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:07,168
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

805
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,004
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!

806
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,755
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

807
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,716
Go for the mouth or the throat,
its vulnerable spots!

808
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,635
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!

809
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,014
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.

810
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:23,600
Can you form some sort of
rudimentary lathe?

811
00:59:23,684 --> 00:59:25,935
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!

812
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,936
Alexander, you're my advisor.
Advise me!

813
00:59:28,021 --> 00:59:30,981
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.

814
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,025
What is its motivation?

815
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:36,820
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

816
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:41,283
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.

817
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:45,244
Fred! Fred, can you hear me?
Fred, are you there?

818
00:59:46,372 --> 00:59:48,790
- Kind of.
- You can do it, Fred! It's up to you!

819
00:59:48,874 --> 00:59:52,085
Oh, no, no, no.
Jason, I'll just... I'll just mess it up.

820
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:54,462
You did it for four years on the show!
Do it now!

821
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:57,340
That was the show. I'm not that guy!

822
00:59:57,424 --> 01:00:00,884
Fred, you never forgot a line!
You never missed a mark!

823
01:00:01,636 --> 01:00:03,470
That's not me anymore man.

824
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:09,142
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.

825
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:14,105
You can do this, Fred! I know
in my heart you're gonna save my life.

826
01:00:14,189 --> 01:00:17,274
- I am?
- No doubt about it, Fred.

827
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:19,318
Fred!

828
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:22,488
Fred, can you hear me?

829
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:25,199
Fred!

830
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:29,536
Fred? I don't want to die down here.

831
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:32,163
Digitize me, Fred!

832
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,460
Oh, wow.

833
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:40,463
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

834
01:00:48,054 --> 01:00:50,848
I see you managed to get your shirt off.

835
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:57,479
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

836
01:00:58,481 --> 01:01:00,982
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?

837
01:01:01,066 --> 01:01:05,111
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Great! Engines and pods?

838
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,113
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

839
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,282
Well, crank this sucker up,
you could drop us off

840
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:11,742
and you guys can be back in
your home planet before supper.

841
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:14,162
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.

842
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:16,621
Sure you do. Family, friends. Come on!

843
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,707
We are all that is left.

844
01:01:25,256 --> 01:01:29,009
- I didn't know that.
- Sir, I have raised the command deck.

845
01:01:32,971 --> 01:01:36,474
Mathesar, meet us
up at the command deck.

846
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:37,725
Mathesar.

847
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:41,979
Mathesar! Quellek!

848
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:44,899
Why can't we reach them?

849
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:09,129
Commander. Thank God you're alive.

850
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:14,301
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

851
01:02:14,385 --> 01:02:19,639
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

852
01:02:19,723 --> 01:02:21,307
Leave him alone.

853
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,812
You wish to save the life of this man?

854
01:02:26,897 --> 01:02:28,397
Yeah. Yes.

855
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:36,696
Then tell me, what does it do,
this Omega 13?

856
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,782
I don't know what it does.

857
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:44,287
I said I don't know!

858
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:50,209
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

859
01:02:50,293 --> 01:02:53,170
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

860
01:02:53,255 --> 01:02:55,297
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

861
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:58,717
Do you think I'm a fool?

862
01:02:58,802 --> 01:03:03,013
That the Commander does not know
every bolt, every weld in his ship?

863
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:07,350
Prepare a tear harness

864
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:10,103
for the female.

865
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:13,815
No! Gwen, no!

866
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,609
You brute! Let go of me!

867
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:19,904
I'm not the Commander.

868
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:21,738
What did you say?

869
01:03:21,823 --> 01:03:24,157
I said, "I'm not the Commander. "

870
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:27,786
Leave them alone.
There's no reason to hurt them.

871
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,372
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

872
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,168
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

873
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:39,088
Computer,

874
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:43,217
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

875
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,784
Wonderful.

876
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:19,043
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

877
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:21,670
Bravo!

878
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:24,297
Bravo.

879
01:04:24,757 --> 01:04:27,508
This is a moment I will treasure.

880
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:31,929
Explain to him who you all really are.

881
01:04:34,558 --> 01:04:35,808
Tell him!

882
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:39,771
Explain!

883
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:48,570
Mathesar, there's no such person
as Captain Taggart.

884
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:53,533
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am an actor.

885
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:57,328
We're all actors.

886
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:00,414
He doesn't understand.

887
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:05,294
Explain as you would a child.

888
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,800
We pretended.

889
01:05:17,431 --> 01:05:18,765
We lied.

890
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:25,105
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

891
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:28,524
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I...

892
01:05:29,401 --> 01:05:33,529
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

893
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:36,031
We don't have a ship.

894
01:05:36,116 --> 01:05:37,825
But there it is.

895
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,913
That ship is that big.

896
01:05:43,997 --> 01:05:47,041
But inside, I see many rooms.

897
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:50,837
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

898
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:55,675
Our beryllium sphere is wire
with plaster around it.

899
01:05:56,427 --> 01:05:57,802
And our...

900
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,304
Our digital conveyor is...

901
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,891
...Christmas tree lights.

902
01:06:04,976 --> 01:06:07,352
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

903
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,690
Just like me.

904
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,528
But why?

905
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:22,491
It's difficult to explain.

906
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:25,828
On our planet, we...

907
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:32,917
We pretend to entertain and...

908
01:06:35,337 --> 01:06:39,841
Mathesar, I am so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

909
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:43,970
So now you know.

910
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:50,017
Lieutenant Lathe,
hardwire the reactor core to overload.

911
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:54,062
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

912
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:56,398
Sarris, what about my people?

913
01:06:56,483 --> 01:07:00,360
Yes, far too simple a death for them,
isn't it?

914
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:04,697
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.

915
01:07:04,782 --> 01:07:07,825
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

916
01:07:08,994 --> 01:07:10,369
Son of a...

917
01:07:16,043 --> 01:07:18,001
Release them

918
01:07:18,085 --> 01:07:19,503
into space.

919
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:26,176
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

920
01:07:26,803 --> 01:07:29,763
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

921
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:34,975
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

922
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,143
Hey!

923
01:07:36,228 --> 01:07:38,479
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

924
01:07:38,563 --> 01:07:40,940
Where's the happy ending, Jason?

925
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:44,485
"Never give up. Never surrender. "

926
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:53,868
Maybe it's about time
you just backed off,

927
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:56,329
you fin-headed monstrosity.

928
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:57,622
Jason.

929
01:07:58,249 --> 01:07:59,374
You what?

930
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:02,961
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

931
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,712
you scene-stealing hack.

932
01:08:08,299 --> 01:08:09,967
Oh, right!

933
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:16,723
Well, how does it feel, Jason?
Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!

934
01:08:16,808 --> 01:08:19,642
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die just because of you!

935
01:08:19,726 --> 01:08:21,602
- I told you to shut up!
- Both of you, get in there.

936
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:23,020
Hundreds to die,

937
01:08:23,105 --> 01:08:26,732
just because you want to play
at being commander, you raving lunatic.

938
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:28,901
Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?

939
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:44,040
Look out, Jason!

940
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,626
Get his gun! Get the gun!

941
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,296
Take that!

942
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,853
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.
Did you see that?

943
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:10,231
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

944
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:17,113
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.

945
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:18,740
- Raving egomaniac?
- Wonder where I got that from?

946
01:09:18,824 --> 01:09:20,241
Hey, guys.

947
01:09:21,994 --> 01:09:23,160
Look.

948
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,082
They're suffocating.

949
01:09:34,339 --> 01:09:38,341
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

950
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:41,761
Core implosion
estimated in eight minutes.

951
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,767
General, your transport
is ready for departure.

952
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:56,816
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

953
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,029
Core implosion
estimated in seven minutes.

954
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,951
- Computer, shut down the core.
- Unable.

955
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:11,246
Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.

956
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,248
All right, all right, listen up.
This is what we gotta do.

957
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,876
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to
the core and shut it down manually.

958
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,754
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve, shut it off,

959
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:20,172
before those Thermians run out of air.

960
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:21,507
Alexander, get to the barracks,

961
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:23,467
see if you can't wedge a door open
in case they can't do that.

962
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:25,259
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me?

963
01:10:25,344 --> 01:10:26,386
What do I do?

964
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,222
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!

965
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:32,016
Practice driving.

966
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:34,811
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

967
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:37,230
- That's right.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason,

968
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:40,233
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

969
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:42,734
and unless you took a Learning Annex
course I don't know about,

970
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:45,570
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor, either.

971
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:48,824
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

972
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:55,580
Brandon, honey, the garbage.

973
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:57,665
Mother, I'm quite busy.

974
01:10:57,749 --> 01:11:01,043
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

975
01:11:01,128 --> 01:11:03,963
Just 10 more minutes, okay, Ma?
I promise.

976
01:11:18,436 --> 01:11:20,437
Hello? Anybody there?

977
01:11:22,606 --> 01:11:26,609
Hello?

978
01:11:27,278 --> 01:11:30,612
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.

979
01:11:30,864 --> 01:11:35,034
I play Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, NSEA Protector.

980
01:11:35,118 --> 01:11:39,121
We accidentally traded voxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.

981
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:44,876
Commander, I see. Okay.

982
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,836
What's your name, son?

983
01:11:48,297 --> 01:11:49,380
Brandon.

984
01:11:49,465 --> 01:11:52,383
Brandon, I remember you.
From the convention, right?

985
01:11:52,468 --> 01:11:55,803
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

986
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:57,972
and I was a little short with you.

987
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:02,559
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna...

988
01:12:02,643 --> 01:12:05,312
I just wanted to tell you that
I thought a lot about what you said...

989
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:08,065
- It's okay. Now, listen.
- But I want you to know

990
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:10,859
that I'm not
a complete brain case, okay?

991
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:14,737
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

992
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:17,239
- Hold... Wait a minute...
- I know there's no beryllium sphere...

993
01:12:17,324 --> 01:12:20,117
- Stop. Stop for a second. Stop. Wait.
- ... no digital conveyor, no ship.

994
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,535
It's all real.

995
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:24,538
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

996
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:28,584
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble
and we need your help.

997
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:33,755
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

998
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:37,926
Core implosion
estimated in six minutes.

999
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:43,223
Sir, it's you. Thank Ipthar.

1000
01:12:45,184 --> 01:12:48,060
Quellek? What are you doing up there?

1001
01:12:50,688 --> 01:12:54,108
I avoided capture
by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.

1002
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,443
Where is everyone?

1003
01:12:56,528 --> 01:12:59,363
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

1004
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:06,202
All right, we're at level C, hallway five.
Now what?

1005
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:09,831
Go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1006
01:13:09,915 --> 01:13:11,874
Now, that leads to
a system of utility corridors

1007
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:13,084
through the bowels of the ship.

1008
01:13:13,168 --> 01:13:15,878
- Open.
- You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.

1009
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:18,713
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1010
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,509
38, 39, 40.

1011
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:29,474
All right. All we have to do
is turn off the valve to the barracks.

1012
01:13:34,563 --> 01:13:35,521
Hi, Brandon.

1013
01:13:35,605 --> 01:13:38,941
No time for pleasantries, Kyle.
We have a level 5 emergency.

1014
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:41,235
You've still got the utility systems
walk-through, right?

1015
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:44,697
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28.
I think Hollister has the upper levels.

1016
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:46,740
Great, we'll get everybody online.

1017
01:13:54,915 --> 01:13:59,002
- PedaI to the metaI, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

1018
01:14:01,797 --> 01:14:05,340
General! I have just received word
that the commander of the Protector

1019
01:14:05,425 --> 01:14:08,260
and his command crew
have escaped custody.

1020
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:10,304
What?

1021
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:14,725
Find them!

1022
01:14:14,809 --> 01:14:18,395
But, sir! My men...
The core implosion is not reversible.

1023
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:20,771
Find them!

1024
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:24,525
All right, Brandon,
I see five ducts in this room.

1025
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,985
Which way do we go?

1026
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:31,199
Enter the passage second to your left,
and just continue straight for 50 meters.

1027
01:14:31,283 --> 01:14:33,743
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

1028
01:14:33,827 --> 01:14:36,077
There will be a slight drop.

1029
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:47,214
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?

1030
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:55,137
They're dying.

1031
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:57,223
Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing?

1032
01:14:57,307 --> 01:14:59,225
- Yes.
- Don't look down.

1033
01:14:59,309 --> 01:15:01,810
Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.

1034
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:02,895
What are you talking about?

1035
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:05,814
You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13!

1036
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:07,732
It must be spectacular.

1037
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:12,820
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls

1038
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:16,574
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single...

1039
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:34,383
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

1040
01:15:35,176 --> 01:15:38,552
Many have believed
that it is a matter-collapser.

1041
01:15:38,637 --> 01:15:42,682
A bomb capable of destroying pretty
much everything in about 13 seconds.

1042
01:15:42,766 --> 01:15:48,229
But myself and others are convinced
that what it is is a matter-rearranger,

1043
01:15:48,313 --> 01:15:51,065
effecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1044
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:52,108
Why 13 seconds?

1045
01:15:52,192 --> 01:15:56,027
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1046
01:15:56,112 --> 01:15:59,281
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1047
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:03,868
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

1048
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,957
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1049
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:13,377
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction.
I got this. I'm okay,

1050
01:16:13,461 --> 01:16:16,755
I might be able to hold them back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1051
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,007
That's suicide.

1052
01:16:18,091 --> 01:16:21,135
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.
I'm a dead man anyway.

1053
01:16:21,219 --> 01:16:23,971
If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1054
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:28,224
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

1055
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:30,810
You ever think about that?

1056
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:32,979
- Plucky?
- Well, besides,

1057
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:35,857
I just had this really interesting idea.

1058
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:38,776
Are you stoned?

1059
01:16:40,404 --> 01:16:43,488
Gotta get it open, give them some time.

1060
01:16:43,573 --> 01:16:45,240
Sir, perhaps together,

1061
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:48,493
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
"Larak tarath. "

1062
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:51,747
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1063
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:56,917
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!

1064
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,219
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

1065
01:17:07,304 --> 01:17:11,557
You want to take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1066
01:17:11,641 --> 01:17:13,224
"The chompers"?

1067
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:20,190
Well, screw that.

1068
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:22,025
How are we supposed
to get through this?

1069
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:24,069
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

1070
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:29,114
Okay, the sequence is 2242...

1071
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,116
- What is this thing?
- ... 2242...

1072
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:32,868
I mean, there's no useful purpose
for there to be

1073
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:35,371
a bunch of chompy-crushy
things in the middle of a hallway!

1074
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:37,998
- Gwen! Gwen!
- No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.

1075
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,542
It makes no logical sense!
Why is it here?

1076
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:42,669
- 'Cause it's on the television show!
- Well, forget it!

1077
01:17:42,754 --> 01:17:46,381
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1078
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:49,550
Okay, Commander, now,
as soon as the first crusher hits you...

1079
01:17:49,635 --> 01:17:50,676
It just did!

1080
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:52,970
- Okay, go now.
- Go!

1081
01:17:53,597 --> 01:17:54,639
Go!

1082
01:17:54,932 --> 01:17:56,057
Stop!

1083
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:57,141
Go!

1084
01:17:58,769 --> 01:18:00,811
Come on, come on, come on.

1085
01:18:03,481 --> 01:18:07,317
Go!

1086
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:08,693
Go! Go!

1087
01:18:08,778 --> 01:18:10,237
No, stop! Stop!

1088
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:11,530
Go!

1089
01:18:11,614 --> 01:18:13,073
Stop! Wait a minute! No!

1090
01:18:13,157 --> 01:18:16,117
I want you to jump, Commander, jump!

1091
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:18,828
Whoever wrote this episode should die!

1092
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,290
This should be interesting.

1093
01:18:43,394 --> 01:18:46,312
It's the simple things
in life you treasure.

1094
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,399
That's great.

1095
01:18:52,485 --> 01:18:54,319
Now, we better get...

1096
01:18:59,617 --> 01:19:01,743
Hey, get a room, guys, okay?

1097
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:14,464
Hey, Fred.

1098
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,052
That's not right.

1099
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:53,082
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.

1100
01:19:55,294 --> 01:19:56,669
Open!

1101
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:01,382
We are saved.

1102
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:03,676
He has saved us.

1103
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:07,179
Commander Taggart has saved us!

1104
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,311
It's just not fair.

1105
01:20:16,523 --> 01:20:20,025
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the command deck.

1106
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,321
I'm... I'm shot.

1107
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,213
Quellek? Quellek?

1108
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,721
It's not too bad.

1109
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:55,724
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

1110
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,852
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.

1111
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,313
I have been blessed, sir. I...

1112
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,275
Don't speak, Quellek.

1113
01:21:08,904 --> 01:21:11,155
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

1114
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,658
but even though
we had never before met,

1115
01:21:13,742 --> 01:21:16,578
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1116
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:21,666
Quellek,

1117
01:21:24,335 --> 01:21:26,169
by Grabthar's hammer,

1118
01:21:27,297 --> 01:21:29,756
by the sons of Warvan,

1119
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:35,178
you shall be avenged.

1120
01:22:13,089 --> 01:22:16,050
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!

1121
01:22:16,676 --> 01:22:18,636
All right, Brandon, I'm here.
How do I shut this thing down?

1122
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,304
Okay, just push the blue button.

1123
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:23,140
- The blue button? Is that it?
- Yeah, why, what's wrong?

1124
01:22:23,224 --> 01:22:26,934
Nothing, I just thought
it'd be more complicated than that.

1125
01:22:27,811 --> 01:22:31,606
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.

1126
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:44,368
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!

1127
01:22:46,996 --> 01:22:49,206
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

1128
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,751
- of the Commander's predicament.
- Don't forget the recyclables!

1129
01:22:53,252 --> 01:22:57,047
Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.

1130
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,299
-9,8...
- Gwen, I...

1131
01:23:00,384 --> 01:23:02,218
- ... 7,6...
- I've always...

1132
01:23:02,302 --> 01:23:05,012
- ... 5,4...
- Jason, Jason.

1133
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:07,932
...3,2,1.

1134
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:20,318
It always stops at one on the show.

1135
01:23:21,195 --> 01:23:22,946
What were you saying?

1136
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:24,906
- Sir!
- What?

1137
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:28,118
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.

1138
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:30,577
Impossible! Impossible!

1139
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:35,124
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

1140
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:37,626
Tear her apart!

1141
01:23:47,511 --> 01:23:48,720
He's finished, he's finished.

1142
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:52,306
Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.

1143
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:56,519
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.

1144
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:00,022
We need that armor back up!

1145
01:24:00,107 --> 01:24:04,317
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armor engaged.

1146
01:24:06,028 --> 01:24:08,238
All right, Tommy, see if you can't
lose them in that minefield.

1147
01:24:08,322 --> 01:24:10,782
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal, right now!

1148
01:24:10,867 --> 01:24:13,076
- Pedal to the metal!
- All right, let's go!

1149
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:25,463
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

1150
01:24:25,839 --> 01:24:27,965
Thrust ahead, full!

1151
01:24:28,717 --> 01:24:31,093
Into the field, go!

1152
01:24:37,349 --> 01:24:40,685
Tommy, can you get us closer
to these mines?

1153
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,020
Closer?

1154
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,524
I could try.

1155
01:24:53,114 --> 01:24:55,616
General, I've lost them.

1156
01:24:56,284 --> 01:25:00,120
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

1157
01:25:00,872 --> 01:25:03,372
Wait! I see something.

1158
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:07,293
Yes. Yes! There they are.

1159
01:25:07,377 --> 01:25:09,879
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1160
01:25:09,963 --> 01:25:13,466
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1161
01:25:14,134 --> 01:25:15,635
Fire at will.

1162
01:25:21,724 --> 01:25:24,810
We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

1163
01:25:24,894 --> 01:25:27,813
No! Divert all energy to the armor!

1164
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:29,397
How adorable!

1165
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:33,068
The actors
are going to play war with me.

1166
01:25:33,152 --> 01:25:36,153
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us
at mark two.

1167
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:37,947
Accelerate to mark four.

1168
01:25:42,285 --> 01:25:45,246
Let me remind you, sonny,

1169
01:25:45,997 --> 01:25:48,249
I am a general.

1170
01:25:49,084 --> 01:25:54,963
If you are counting on me to blink,
then you are making a deadly mistake.

1171
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,675
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.

1172
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:02,178
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognize a bad one.

1173
01:26:02,596 --> 01:26:04,347
You're sweating!

1174
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:06,348
Armor almost gone, Jason!

1175
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:11,603
You fool! You fail to realize
that with your armor gone,

1176
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:15,816
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1177
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:20,988
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.

1178
01:26:23,782 --> 01:26:26,325
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

1179
01:26:42,925 --> 01:26:44,217
- Yes!
- Yes!

1180
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:49,598
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1181
01:26:51,642 --> 01:26:53,475
This is fantastic!

1182
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:00,482
Mathesar!

1183
01:27:01,818 --> 01:27:03,861
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1184
01:27:05,155 --> 01:27:06,196
Come here.

1185
01:27:06,281 --> 01:27:09,782
"The ship was a model as big as this. "

1186
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:13,036
A very clever deception indeed.

1187
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:24,963
Set a course for home, Commander?

1188
01:27:25,048 --> 01:27:27,716
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, it's just point and click.

1189
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,760
But we're going to have to go through
the black hole, though.

1190
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,428
Any objections?

1191
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:34,389
All right, set her up.

1192
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,187
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1193
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:45,191
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1194
01:27:45,943 --> 01:27:49,028
My people have no commander.

1195
01:27:50,781 --> 01:27:54,867
Mathesar, I think your people
have a great commander,

1196
01:27:55,952 --> 01:27:57,035
sir.

1197
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:08,213
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.

1198
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:26,647
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1199
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,690
Systems register functional.

1200
01:28:28,774 --> 01:28:30,775
All systems are working, Commander.

1201
01:28:30,859 --> 01:28:32,694
Jason, before the black hole,

1202
01:28:32,778 --> 01:28:35,154
there was an energy surge
from Sarris' ship.

1203
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:38,157
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander.

1204
01:28:38,242 --> 01:28:41,077
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we...

1205
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:44,746
Hey, you know,
you could put an eye out with that thing.

1206
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,875
Fred?

1207
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:05,933
No!

1208
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:32,666
Mathesar!

1209
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,627
Activate the Omega 13!

1210
01:29:59,902 --> 01:30:02,652
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1211
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:06,031
Systems register functional.

1212
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:08,075
All systems are working, Commander.

1213
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,035
Jason, before the black hole,

1214
01:30:10,119 --> 01:30:12,996
there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1215
01:30:14,707 --> 01:30:18,793
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1216
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:22,254
Let go of me. Let... It's not Fred!

1217
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,256
That's Sarris. Listen to me!

1218
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:26,675
I'm telling you, it's not Fred,
that's Sarris!

1219
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,178
He's gonna try to kill all of us!

1220
01:30:37,686 --> 01:30:40,021
Never give up. Never surrender.

1221
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:44,943
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!

1222
01:30:45,027 --> 01:30:47,820
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.

1223
01:30:47,904 --> 01:30:50,364
We need to separate, or we'll die.

1224
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:58,539
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.

1225
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:01,875
Crew to the secondary deck.

1226
01:31:03,877 --> 01:31:05,169
Mathesar!

1227
01:31:09,466 --> 01:31:11,259
Goodbye, my friends.

1228
01:31:17,266 --> 01:31:20,392
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

1229
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,252
On, Teb, on!

1230
01:31:55,926 --> 01:31:57,802
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,

1231
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:02,599
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,

1232
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,560
much to the disappointment
of all these fans.

1233
01:32:05,644 --> 01:32:06,977
Bye. Be back soon!

1234
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:10,355
Well... Wait. Brandon, where are you
going with all those fireworks?

1235
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,442
The Protectorgot super-accelerated
coming out of the black hole

1236
01:32:13,526 --> 01:32:15,736
and it's, like, nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

1237
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,864
which, you guys know,
is pretty unstable, obviously,

1238
01:32:18,948 --> 01:32:22,116
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it
on the vox ultra-frequency carrier

1239
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:25,411
and use Roman candles
for visual confirmation.

1240
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:27,663
All right, dinner's at 7:00.

1241
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:32,585
Well, he's outside.

1242
01:34:01,585 --> 01:34:04,754
Lieutenant Laredo, Tommy Webber!

1243
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:08,717
Hi, Tommy!

1244
01:34:10,803 --> 01:34:14,221
The beautiful Tawny Madison,
Gwen DeMarco!

1245
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:19,101
Yes!

1246
01:34:20,186 --> 01:34:21,895
Wow, what effects!

1247
01:34:22,689 --> 01:34:26,859
Another shipmate!
Yes, the more, the merrier!

1248
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:32,864
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen,
Fred Kwan, and a friend.

1249
01:34:33,866 --> 01:34:38,161
Dr. Lazarus, Alexander Dane!

1250
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:41,914
Give him a big hand. He's British!
Yes, sir!

1251
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:47,252
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
Jason Nesmith!

1252
01:34:57,096 --> 01:34:58,763
Great driving, Tommy.

1253
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:00,598
Yes! Yes!

1254
01:35:08,523 --> 01:35:10,983
Quick, quick! Go, go! Move, move!

1255
01:35:18,157 --> 01:35:22,202
Once again,
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,

1256
01:35:22,286 --> 01:35:23,995
Mr. Jason Nesmith!

1257
01:35:26,624 --> 01:35:31,752
Come on, give it up for the crew,
the NSEA Protector!

1258
01:35:33,004 --> 01:35:35,381
True love! Yes!

1259
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,634
Wow!

1260
01:35:40,345 --> 01:35:41,637
Come on!

1261
01:35:44,682 --> 01:35:47,266
They're here for you, folks. Come on!

1262
01:35:47,893 --> 01:35:49,310
What a show!

1263
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:52,688
What a show! Yes!

1264
01:35:55,692 --> 01:35:58,736
Yes! Give it up! Wow!

1265
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,698
Come on, give it up! Give it all up

1266
01:36:03,783 --> 01:36:08,120
for the crew of your favorite show,
Galaxy Quest! Wow!

1267
01:36:11,582 --> 01:36:13,250
Come on, come on!

1268
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:27,805
Don't forget to buy a Galaxy Quest
T- shirt on your way out. Thank you.

1269
01:36:33,727 --> 01:36:38,773
And now, back again after 18 years,
the new adventures ofGalaxy Quest.

1270
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:57,405
Never give up. Never surrender.

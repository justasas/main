1
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,201
- Exiting time knot now, sir.
- We're alive.

2
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:46,161
We made it, Commander. We made it.

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,707
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,834
Systems register functional.

5
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,712
All systems are working, Commander.

6
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:57,214
I don't like it. It was too easy.

7
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:02,136
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

8
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,846
There are time knots
opening everywhere!

9
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,306
- A trap!
- We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,440
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

11
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:17,317
Surrender may be our only option.

12
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:21,405
No! Never give up! Never surrender!

13
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,699
Your orders, sir?

14
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:27,327
Sir? Your orders?

15
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:32,958
Activate the Omega 13.

16
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,463
Well?

17
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,968
Well, there you are. Yeah!

18
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:49,892
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,063
You are the first people to see

20
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,817
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter

21
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,528
since it was originally aired in 1982!

22
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,947
Yeah! All right.

23
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,535
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,501
The intrepid crew
of the NSEA Protector! Yeah!

25
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:19,505
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

26
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,843
White scarf, black buttons,
white shoes...

27
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:29,932
Man, where the hell is he?
An hour and a half late?

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,185
- An hour and a half.
- I mean, this is unreal.

29
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,562
They're gonna start
eating each other out there.

30
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:39,191
Did you hear? He booked
another appearance without us.

31
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,275
You're kidding!

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,537
- How did I come to this?
- Not again.

33
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,123
- I played Richard the Third.
- Five curtain calls.

34
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,500
There were five curtain calls.
I was an actor once,

35
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,293
damn it, now look at me. Look at me!

36
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,673
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

37
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,386
- I can't, I won't.
- Well, Alex, at least you had a part.

38
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,805
Okay? You had
a character people loved.

39
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,851
I mean, my TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

40
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:15,686
and how they fit into my suit.

41
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,189
No one even bothered to ask me
what I do on the show.

42
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,069
You had the... Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

43
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,405
I repeated the computer, Fred.

44
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,575
Your commander is on deck!

45
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,745
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

46
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,665
Am I too late
for Alexander's panic attack?

47
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,713
Apparently not. You know,
you should get that looked at. Yeah.

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,507
Let's take a look at a few more clips.

49
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,051
Okay. What did I do?

50
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,471
What?

51
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,182
- We want the crew!
- For those four seasons,

52
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,560
we developed
the same affection for the crew

53
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,145
as the crew had for each other.

54
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,817
I mean, these weren't just adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

55
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,737
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it, man!

56
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,156
It's not a big deal. These guys put
a little set in their basement.

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,033
I'm there about an hour.

58
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,286
It's nothing, Gwen.
They wanted the Commander.

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,206
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him! Grab him!

60
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,416
- We want the crew!
- We want the crew!

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,879
Okay! Yeah! Here we go!

62
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,381
- Come on, old friend, old friend.
- Friend?

63
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,052
You stole all my best lines,
you cut me out of episode two entirely!

64
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:35,057
Tawny Madison, my personal favorite,
Gwen DeMarco!

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,726
Yeah!

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,561
It's getting hotter, Commander.

67
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,271
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

68
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:47,319
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo, Tommy Webber!

69
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,240
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

70
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,076
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,661
Freddie Kwan!

72
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,165
Damn you.

73
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,587
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

74
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,508
Tev'Meck, Alexander Dane!

75
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:12,177
Yeah! All right!

76
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,767
By Grabthar's hammer,
you shall be avenged!

77
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,103
Yeah! All right!

78
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,022
That guy can act.

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,318
And finally, my fellow Questerians,

80
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:33,198
the brave commander
of the NSEA Protector,

81
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,284
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter...

82
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,494
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy...

83
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,246
Taggart, Taggart, Taggart, Taggart...

84
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,957
Jason Nesmith!

85
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,876
Yeah! All right!

86
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:50,841
We love you, Commander!

87
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,594
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

88
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,346
- Never surrender!
- Never surrender!

89
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,140
- Damn the resonance cannons,
- Damn the resonance cannons,

90
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,809
- full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!

91
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,481
The Commander and his crew
will be signing autographs

92
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,901
on imperial decks C and B
near the Coke machines.

93
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,864
Quest forever, man!

94
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,950
Excuse me, pardon me,
crew member coming through.

95
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:19,453
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, man.

96
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:22,914
I want to thank you for that nice intro
you gave us today.

97
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:27,419
Guy. Probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses, right?

98
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,047
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

99
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:33,675
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

100
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,680
Listen, maybe I could sit in
and sign a couple of autographs?

101
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,726
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

102
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,108
By Grabthar's...

103
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,736
Next.

104
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,573
Had I moved an inch to the left,
the beast would have killed me.

105
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,367
On the other hand,
my crew was in danger.

106
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,701
How did you know what to do?

107
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,288
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

108
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:08,627
I think we all remember what happened
to that beast on Enok Vll, right?

109
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:12,881
You've got to admit,
they really do love him.

110
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,468
Yeah, almost as much
as he loves himself.

111
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,223
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

112
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,308
I was wondering if you could help
settle the dispute

113
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:25,977
that my crew and I seem to be having.

114
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,897
If you remember,
in "Quasar Dilemma"...

115
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,316
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

116
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,862
Hadn't even gotten to
the relevant conundrum.

117
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,990
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V,"

118
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:43,412
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander kind of had a thing.

119
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,913
Did you?

120
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,916
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,876
Well, that's her story.

122
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:56,049
Excuse me.

123
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,094
Gwen.

124
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:05,267
Gwen!

125
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,603
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

126
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,273
I must speak to you.
It is a matter of supreme importance.

127
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,567
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula

128
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,735
and we need your help.

129
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,948
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

130
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,700
Just hammer out the details
with my agent,

131
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,577
and make sure
there's a limo at my house.

132
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:27,664
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.

133
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,749
Remember, mum's the word.

134
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:32,502
Certainly, but...

135
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,505
- Mum.
- Mum.

136
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,050
Here, and beautiful!

137
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,640
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

138
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,977
is filling my head with such thoughts.

139
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,563
It was cute when I didn't know you.

140
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,845
What a freak show, man.
This is hilarious.

141
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,016
Bunch of losers! Begging
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

142
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,645
These guys haven't had a real acting
job for 20 years. This is all they've got.

143
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,355
And did you check out Nesmith?

144
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,482
- He actually gets off on those retards...
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,317
...thinking he's a space commander!

146
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:40,320
- And his friends...
- I know, they can't stand him!

147
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:41,530
Did you hear them ragging
on him in there?

148
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,074
Dude, he has no idea
he's a laughingstock,

149
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:45,450
even to his buddies.

150
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,619
- He's pathetic!
- Come on, come on.

151
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,205
The Galaxy Quest dancers
are almost on.

152
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,499
Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

153
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:06,763
Hey, Commander,

154
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,849
so as I was saying
in "The Quasar Dilemma,"

155
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,935
remember, you used
the auxiliary deck B for...

156
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,312
Can you get this?
Deck B for gamma override.

157
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,274
The thing is that
online blueprints clearly indicate that

158
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:19,985
deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

159
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,655
So we were wondering,
just where the error lies in that?

160
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:27,659
It's just a television show.
That's all, okay?

161
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:31,162
Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering
if the quantum flux, nowjust listen...

162
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,749
There is no quantum flux.
There's no auxiliary.

163
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,169
There's no goddamn ship!

164
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:39,629
You got it?

165
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,851
I mean it. I mean it, Alex.

166
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:56,104
I've never seen him lose it like that.
Not to a fan.

167
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,231
I mean, it was just weird.

168
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:02,569
Gwen, I have said it for years.

169
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,529
He's mentally unstable.

170
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:09,117
I... I'm worried. It just was not like him.

171
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:32,182
As long as there is injustice,

172
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:35,143
whenever a Targathian baby cries out,

173
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,978
wherever a distress signal sounds,

174
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,229
- among the stars...
- Among the stars...

175
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,439
...we'll be there.

176
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:42,859
- This fine ship and this fine crew.
- This fine ship and this fine crew.

177
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,361
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

178
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:47,280
- Never surrender.
- Never surrender.

179
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,047
Can I help you?

180
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,717
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach
in protocol...

181
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,011
- You shouldn't come to my house, man.
- Please, I beg you to hear our plea.

182
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,597
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

183
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,559
Our people are being systematically
hunted and slaughtered

184
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,728
by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

185
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,312
We are to meet in negotiation.

186
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:05,108
However, our efforts in this regard
have been disastrous.

187
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:09,487
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

188
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,577
- We have secured our limousine.
- What?

189
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,624
It's the thing for the thing that's...

190
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,422
Maybe I should get some pants on.

191
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,341
Come on in.

192
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:39,309
Commander, I must say that
standing here in your presence

193
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:43,855
is the greatest honor we could ever
have hoped to achieve in our lifetime.

194
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:46,483
That's... I really appreciate that.

195
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:50,653
Would you guys look for another shoe
that looks like this, please?

196
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,582
Sir, I am Lahnk,
senior requisition officer.

197
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,877
Before we travel to the ship, please let
me know if you have any requirements.

198
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,171
Weapons, documents, personnel.

199
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,882
A Coca-Cola, do you have one of those?

200
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,885
Sir, I am Teb.

201
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:17,597
I would like to explain the history
between our people

202
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,641
and the Sarris dominion
in greater detail.

203
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,850
Hey, how you doing?

204
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:24,479
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

205
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,980
our people were one...

206
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,690
What's your name?

207
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,986
- Doesn't she talk?
- Her translator is broken.

208
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,951
Okey-dokey.

209
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:42,080
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast,

210
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:46,334
so I'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit.

211
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:50,672
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, okay?

212
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,008
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

213
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,552
our people were one people.

214
00:14:55,636 --> 00:15:00,932
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

215
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:05,228
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

216
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:09,691
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths. The foolishness!

217
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,403
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

218
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:23,872
Commander. Commander?

219
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

220
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,918
but your presence is requested
on the command deck.

221
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:35,383
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.

222
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,553
We are approaching his ship
at the Ni-Delta now.

223
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,930
He wants an answer to his proposal.
I understand...

224
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:43,433
I got most of it in the car.
Sarris is the bad guy, right?

225
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,602
Oh, yes, sir.
He's a very bad man indeed.

226
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,312
He has tortured our scientists,

227
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,689
put us to work
in the gallium arsenide mines,

228
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,816
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

229
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.

230
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,612
Do you have pages
or just want me to wing this?

231
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,238
I am not sure I understand you.

232
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,741
Commander, welcome
to the Protector Two.

233
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,201
- Good to see you.
- Would you like to don your uniform?

234
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,620
No, you know what? I'd like to skip that.

235
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,789
I got this gig in Van Nuys in about
a quarter of an hour. Is that all right?

236
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:10,668
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

237
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,053
General, I have just received word

238
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,971
the Thermians have appointed
a new commander

239
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,182
to handle the negotiations.

240
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,142
What?

241
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:35,151
This is great. You know, usually
it's just cardboard walls in a garage.

242
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:38,237
Sir, we apologize
for operating in low-power mode,

243
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:41,407
but we are experiencing
a reflective flux field

244
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,118
this close to the galactic axis.

245
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,246
You know, what I could use is
a cup holder and a couple ofAdvil.

246
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,625
We're approaching in five ticks, sir.
Command to slow?

247
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,169
Set it on screensaver two.

248
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,299
I guess, we, you know, got to...

249
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,636
I'm sorry to break up the mood here.

250
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,222
Slow it down to mark two, Lieutenant.

251
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:07,517
I see fear. That is expected.

252
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,189
- They bring a new commander.
- It's good.

253
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,566
- Here are my demands.
- Scary. I mean, you know, it looks...

254
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,277
- And if I do not hear what I like,
...real.

255
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:24,033
Then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine!

256
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:26,953
- First...
- Backwash.

257
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:30,540
...I require the Omega 13.

258
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,876
Second, I will require a technician...

259
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:38,673
Okey-dokey! Okey-dokey!
Let's fire blue particle cannons full,

260
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,258
red particle cannons full,

261
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,637
gannet magnets, fire them left and right
and let them run all chutes.

262
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,849
And while you're at it,
why don't you toss that at them, killer?

263
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,518
That should take care
of old lobster head, shouldn't it?

264
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,728
Yeah.

265
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,696
Commander, where are you going?

266
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,948
- Home.
- You mean Earth?

267
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,575
Yeah, Earth.
I need to get back to Earth, kids.

268
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,786
But the negotiations, you fired on him.

269
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,289
Yeah. Yeah. Long live...
What was your planet called?

270
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,833
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia. This way?

271
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,334
What if Sarris survives?

272
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,337
- I doubt it. We gave him both barrels.
- He has a very powerful ship.

273
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,214
If you got any more problems
with the guy,

274
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,592
just, you know, give me a call.

275
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:28,556
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,933
How can we thank you, Commander?

277
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,312
You have saved our people.

278
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,816
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,736
You know, you kids have been great.
You really have.

280
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,529
This thing is real-looking.

281
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,156
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

282
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,703
Hey! Where's my limo?

283
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:10,491
Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

284
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:15,246
But we've never seen space-age
values like we've seen here at...

285
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,999
Tech Value Electronics Superstore!

286
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,176
By Grabthar's hammer,

287
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,097
what a savings.

288
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,395
All right! Yeah, let's hear it
for the NSEA Protector.

289
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,646
Vacuum laser...

290
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:42,481
What, no, no, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.

291
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:44,317
Yes, if he's down in the Omega 13...

292
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:48,237
- Brandon, are you okay?
- Commander! My apologies.

293
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:51,115
You know, evidently we had
a little miscommunication

294
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,952
regarding the voyage.
You didn't show up.

295
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:00,750
- He...
- He did it again.

296
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,255
Do you know what time it is?

297
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,549
Why do you even bother
to show up at all?

298
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,053
No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.

299
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,763
I was up there.

300
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,641
Remember yesterday at the convention,
those people dressed like aliens?

301
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,393
They were aliens.
They were Termites or Dalmatians.

302
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,771
I can't really remember
'cause I was kind of hung-over.

303
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:25,399
But what they built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

304
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,153
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

305
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,618
I know what you're thinking.
But I can prove it. They gave me this.

306
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:41,832
No, no, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

307
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,252
Protector, this is the Commander. Over.

308
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,213
- Oh, for God's sake.
- That's it. It's time to go!

309
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:48,923
This isn't mine.

310
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,217
That kid. Where's that kid?

311
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:55,054
Begging your pardon, Commander,
we come with news. Sarris lives.

312
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,264
- He was able upon your departure...
- Listen.

313
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,598
...to make an escape.
- Tell them.

314
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,141
- However, he has contacted us...
- Sarris.

315
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:00,643
...and wishes to negotiate a surrender.

316
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:04,438
We humbly implore you to come
and negotiate the terms.

317
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,109
They want me back?
You want me back?

318
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,443
Is this amazing? They want me back,

319
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,237
and I want you guys
to go with me, please.

320
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:14,115
Don't even think about it. Let's go. Yes!

321
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,035
You're going? Alexander, this is not...
I'm not kidding here!

322
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,123
This isn't some kind of prank!
I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen.

323
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,459
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.
Stop, come here.

324
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,670
You know me.
I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?

325
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,880
You know,
it's one thing to treat us this way.

326
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,758
It's another thing to do it to your fans.

327
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,053
She's not a fan! This is a Termite!

328
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,765
You should've just let me hit him.

329
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,228
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

330
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:47,356
I think we should've just taken the gig.

331
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,775
I mean, who knows
the next time he'll ask us.

332
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,988
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

333
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,662
But you live with your mother.

334
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,583
- Did Jason come through here?
- Yeah, he's in there. Hey, guys.

335
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,878
We are coming, too.

336
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:13,507
- All of you wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

337
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,510
You see, we work together, or not at all.

338
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,680
Wonderful. The Commander
had me continue transmission

339
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,807
in case you changed your mind.

340
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:26,479
- Protector, requesting four interstellar...
- Me, too.

341
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:28,981
Five pods for immediate departure.

342
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,363
Guys. Guys?

343
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,908
I look forward to meeting you all
in person when you arrive at the ship.

344
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,618
End transmission.

345
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,622
Oh, my God.

346
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,751
Anybody got any change?

347
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,155
Our most sincere apologies.

348
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,324
We forgot about
our appearance generators.

349
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:05,119
You guys came!
Who wants the grand tour?

350
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,378
Anybody else?

351
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,717
That was a hell of a thing.

352
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,307
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

353
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,143
That's right, guys, just keep shaking
it off, it gets better.

354
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,271
- Hey, try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

355
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,482
The 23rd quadrant
of the Gamma sector.

356
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,859
There's a map in the core room.
I'll show you, come on.

357
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:40,863
- Welcome, my friends!
- This is Mathesar, he's their leader.

358
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:45,326
I am Mathesar. On behalf of
all my people I wish to thank you

359
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,497
- from the deepest place in our hearts.
- Mathesar, this is my crew.

360
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:54,335
Dr. Lazarus.

361
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,462
- Dr. Lazarus.
- Dr. Lazarus.

362
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,425
Lieutenant Madison.

363
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,220
- Lieutenant Madison.
- Lieutenant Madison.

364
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:11,685
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

365
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,938
- Young Laredo.
- Young Laredo.

366
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,317
Tech Sergeant Chen.

367
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:21,070
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Tech Sergeant Chen.

368
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:28,869
Crewman number... Guy.

369
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,913
- Guy.
- Guy.

370
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:33,499
You know us?

371
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,256
I don't believe there is a man, woman
or child on my planet who does not.

372
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,258
For years since we first
received transmission

373
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:44,009
of your historical documents,

374
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:47,304
we have studied every facet
of your missions and strategies.

375
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,722
You've been watching the show?

376
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,101
Lieutenant, historical documents.

377
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,895
Historical documents from out here?

378
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,899
Yes. The past 100 years,
our society had fallen into disarray.

379
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,236
Our goals, our values had become
scattered, but since the transmission,

380
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,532
we have modeled every aspect
of our society from your example,

381
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:09,034
and it has saved us.

382
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,497
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

383
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:16,083
In fact, all you see around you
has been taken

384
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,503
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

385
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:22,423
Is this a spaceship?

386
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:26,135
No, this is a star port for the ship.

387
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,763
Would you guys like to see the ship?

388
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:53,912
Oh, my God!

389
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,211
It's real.

390
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,765
The generator room.

391
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:16,143
The beryllium sphere, of course.

392
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:20,064
And as we continue,
the medical quarters are to the left.

393
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:23,275
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

394
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,194
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- What the hell is going on?

395
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:27,821
- What are we doing here?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

396
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,741
We're just here to negotiate
this guy Sarris' surrender.

397
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:31,909
It's no big deal.

398
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,996
And the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

399
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:41,001
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

400
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,630
- Come on, guys.
- Jason, we're actors, not astronauts.

401
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:47,508
You guys want to go home?
You say the word, we'll go home.

402
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,843
Pay our bills, feed our fish,

403
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:54,431
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

404
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,975
Come on.
Do you guys want to do that? Anybody?

405
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,562
Gwen, come on, think about it.
Look at where we are. We're in space.

406
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:04,525
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime.
You guys want to leave?

407
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,529
We have enjoyed preparing
many of your esoteric dishes.

408
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,950
Your Monte Cristo sandwich is
a current favorite of the adventurous.

409
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,702
The main barracks.

410
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,174
At ease.

411
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,640
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.

412
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,062
What?

413
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,107
I'm just jazzed about
being on the show, man.

414
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,783
If you would all take your positions.

415
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,286
Our what?

416
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,495
Guys.

417
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:02,833
Oh, my!

418
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:10,549
Look, this thingy.

419
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,387
I remember I had it all worked out.

420
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,724
This is forward. This is back.

421
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:22,728
Commander, some of
the crew has requested

422
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:25,397
to be present at this historic event.

423
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,358
Sure. Bring them in.

424
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,503
No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

425
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,756
Laredo, take us out.

426
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,593
Excuse me?

427
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:59,723
They designed those controls
after watching you.

428
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,520
- Take her out.
- Right, right.

429
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,397
Okay. Right.

430
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:12,569
Right. Take her out.

431
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:18,051
Okay, you got to move to the right.
Move more to the right.

432
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:22,389
Would you sit your ass down? Sit!
Move! You want to drive this thing?

433
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:16,985
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander?

434
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,822
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

435
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:24,284
Yes, we programmed the food
synthesizer for each of you

436
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,828
based on the regional menu
of your birthplace.

437
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:30,248
I don't care where you did it,
it tastes great.

438
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,126
Are you enjoying your Kep-mok
blood ticks, Dr. Lazarus?

439
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,462
Just like Mother used to make.

440
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,678
So, tell me, Mathesar,

441
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:46,056
this Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

442
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,975
what does he want?

443
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,561
He heard about the device,
the Omega 13.

444
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,023
What is it? What does it do?

445
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,150
We don't know.

446
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,903
We were hoping you could enlighten us.

447
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:08,578
The Omega 13 device.

448
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:13,834
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

449
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,212
Why don't you just turn it on
and see what it does?

450
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,592
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

451
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,469
If we were mistaken in our construction,

452
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:28,098
the device would act as a molecular
explosive, causing a chain reaction

453
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:31,351
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

454
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:35,689
Has Sarris ever seen
any of the historical records?

455
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,774
No, thank God, he has not.

456
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,529
So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

457
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:51,121
Our former commander was not strong.

458
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,623
Former commander?

459
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:58,420
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

460
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:02,049
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

461
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,843
Originally, one of our own tried to lead.

462
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:06,511
Is that all?

463
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:11,933
After three days of this,
you still require incentive?

464
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,730
I have told you all I know.

465
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,691
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

466
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:24,404
When I grow weary of
the noises you make, you shall die.

467
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,878
Hey, guys, come on, hold on a minute.

468
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:42,047
You just can't leave.
Give me some time to think.

469
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,090
- Think.
- He wants to think.

470
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,592
No, Jason. That's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about!

471
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,760
I'm not even supposed to be here.

472
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,887
I'm just crewman number six.
I'm expendable.

473
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:51,598
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious.

474
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,808
I got to get out of here.

475
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,601
Commander! Commander?

476
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,270
We got to prepare
the pods for my crew's departure.

477
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,939
But begging your
Commander's pardon, sir,

478
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,607
we can't launch pods at the moment.

479
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,235
Sarris will surely detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

480
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:05,153
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here now.

481
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:08,240
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

482
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,125
There's nobody here.

483
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,961
While my people are talented scientists,

484
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,921
our attempt to operate
our own technologies

485
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:26,299
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

486
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,677
I have raised Sarris on Zeta frequency.

487
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:32,097
- Mathesar...
- We meet again, Commander.

488
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,934
Hello, Sarris. How you doing?

489
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:38,061
Better than my lieutenant.

490
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:42,482
He failed to activate
the ship's neutron armor

491
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,278
as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.

492
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:48,321
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say

493
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,031
I'm real sorry about
what happened before.

494
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:53,618
The whole thing was just
a misunderstanding.

495
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:58,748
Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship!

496
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:02,502
You know, we'd like to do that,

497
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,047
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

498
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,800
You have 10 seconds!

499
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:11,678
I don't... Ten seconds? I don't... There...

500
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,849
You know, okay. Gosh darn it, I give up.
It's yours. You can have it.

501
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,519
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay?

502
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,687
Gwen.

503
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,566
Don't panic.
I've dealt with this guy before.

504
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,109
He's as stupid as he is ugly.

505
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:27,235
- Come here.
- Jason.

506
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,528
Not now, Gwen.

507
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,447
- No!
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

508
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,365
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right?

509
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,409
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

510
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:36,453
Push these red buttons and
send everything we have towards him.

511
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,246
- Okay?
- Okay.

512
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:41,875
All right, Gwen,
put me back on with him.

513
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,795
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back on.

514
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,050
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander!

515
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:58,058
I gave you the "kill" gesture.

516
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,478
Yeah. No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

517
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:05,565
- Like I know where the hold button is.
- Hey, you guys.

518
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,236
There's a red thingy

519
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,280
- moving toward the green thingy.
- What?

520
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:16,451
Red thingy moving toward
the green thingy.

521
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:19,746
I think we're the green thingy.

522
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,083
A little present for you, Commander.

523
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,751
We got to get out of here!
Move the ship! Turn it! Move it! Go!

524
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,380
Oh, no!

525
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,634
Oh, my God!

526
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:43,853
Tommy, Tommy, let's go!

527
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:44,980
- Get us out of here!
- Jason, what do I do?

528
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:47,023
- Let's go! Go, go, go!
- What do I do?

529
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,455
They're turning. They're coming!

530
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,213
Thrust ahead, full!

531
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,800
Fire at will.

532
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,432
- Go faster, Tommy!
- I'm going as fast as I can, Jason!

533
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,475
She's still behind us!

534
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,227
Well, press "turbo."

535
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:25,687
I've always said,
"Press the turbo," right?

536
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:29,691
- It's right here! Right here!
- Well, press it and hold it down!

537
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,906
The enemy is matching velocity.

538
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:40,618
- Enemy is matching velocity.
- We heard it the first time!

539
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:43,955
Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

540
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,666
Hi, guys. Listen,

541
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:52,505
they're telling me
the generators won't take it.

542
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,802
The ship is breaking apart and all that.
Just FYI.

543
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:00,513
- We've got to stop!
- We stop and we die.

544
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,308
- Tommy, just hold that thing down!
- You cannot hold the turbo down!

545
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:05,769
- It's for quick boosts!
- Like you know!

546
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,652
I remember that sound.
That's a bad sound.

547
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:18,948
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We might
be able to lose them in this cloud here.

548
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:22,160
- I don't think that's a cloud.
- Mathesar, what is it?

549
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:26,706
This is the Tothian minefield left
standing from the great war of 12185.

550
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:33,838
Oh, God!

551
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:50,814
Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one?

552
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:54,984
Sorry, man, they're drifting towards us.
I think they're magnetic!

553
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,533
Continue forward, sir?

554
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,661
Patience, Lieutenant.

555
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:07,831
Patience.

556
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,552
- We've got to stop!
- We're almost through this.

557
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,117
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

558
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,703
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?

559
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,998
- Tommy! You all right?
- Oh, man!

560
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:53,668
No, my arm is broke.
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

561
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,672
- I'll take him to medical quarters.
- Thanks, Mathesar.

562
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,307
Alex, where are you going?

563
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,350
To see if there's a pub!

564
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,572
Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

565
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:25,533
Aft vector guards, 96% damage.

566
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:30,955
Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 34, 40...

567
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,002
- What about the engines?
- Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

568
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:40,048
Computer, what about the engines?
Why don't we have power?

569
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:43,259
The beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress.

570
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:45,678
It's fractured.

571
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,515
Can it be repaired?

572
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,725
Computer, can it be repaired?

573
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,686
Damage to
beryllium sphere irreparable.

574
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,189
New source of beryllium
must be secured.

575
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,857
We need another one.

576
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,944
You broke the ship.
You broke the bloody ship!

577
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:11,037
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

578
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,917
Negative. No reserve
beryllium sphere exists on board.

579
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,712
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

580
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,090
You know, that is
really getting annoying!

581
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:24,926
Look, I have one job on this lousy ship.

582
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,555
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay?

583
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,306
Sure, no problem.

584
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,234
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

585
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,236
How have you failed us?

586
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,032
We have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations.

587
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:51,619
The fault must lie with us, with the ship.

588
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:55,206
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

589
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:59,043
It's my fault. We screwed...

590
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:02,630
We are not the people you think we are.

591
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:04,465
I don't understand.

592
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:15,310
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theater? Films?

593
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:18,771
The historical documents
of your culture. Yes, in fact,

594
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,108
we have begun to document
our history from your example.

595
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,987
No, not historical documents.
They're not all historical documents.

596
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:29,866
I mean, surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

597
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:33,411
Those poor people.

598
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,247
Oh, brother.

599
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,792
We're screwed.

600
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,756
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way

601
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,175
that's contrary to reality?

602
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,137
You are speaking of...

603
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,931
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

604
00:44:54,016 --> 00:44:56,976
We have only recently
become aware of this concept

605
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,020
in our dealings with Sarris.

606
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,065
Often, Sarris will say
one thing and do another.

607
00:45:02,149 --> 00:45:04,817
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.

608
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:08,905
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great cost.

609
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:11,032
But if you are saying that any of you

610
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:13,910
could have traits
in common with Sarris...

611
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:28,841
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

612
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:35,390
And we might be able to get there
if we reconfigure the solar matrix

613
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:38,685
in parallel for endothermic propulsion.

614
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,436
What do you think?

615
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,693
- We'll do that!
- All right!

616
00:45:48,404 --> 00:45:52,615
That's right again. That's...
Come on, group hug. Come on.

617
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:08,923
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

618
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:13,177
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

619
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:15,805
I have studied
your missions extensively.

620
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:19,225
Though I am Thermian,
I have lived my life by your philosophy,

621
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,310
by the code of the Mak'tar.

622
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:24,647
Good, that's very nice.

623
00:46:24,732 --> 00:46:26,566
By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus...

624
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,569
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was only...

625
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,987
Just don't.

626
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,615
Yes, sir.

627
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,836
Never give up. Never surrender.

628
00:46:54,136 --> 00:46:57,305
Dr. Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

629
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,932
I have programmed it
to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere

630
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,643
of sufficient density.

631
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:05,062
Good luck on your mission, sir.

632
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,815
Thanks.

633
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:18,826
You're doing good, Tommy.

634
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,335
I changed my mind. I want to go back.

635
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:30,505
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

636
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:33,466
Yeah, but that's when I thought I was
the crewman that stays on the ship

637
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,802
and something is up there
then it kills me.

638
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,054
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster

639
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:39,931
five minutes after we land on the planet!

640
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:42,058
You're not gonna die on the planet, Guy.

641
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:44,811
I'm not? Then what's my last name?

642
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,980
It's... I don't know.

643
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,817
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

644
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,653
Because my character isn't important
enough for a last name.

645
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,322
Because I'm gonna die five minutes in.

646
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,242
Guy, you have a last name.

647
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:02,537
- Do I? Do I?
- Yes!

648
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:06,958
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

649
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:11,087
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

650
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,588
Are we there yet?

651
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:15,383
- Mommy!
- Tommy!

652
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:18,344
- Look out!
- Oh, no! Pull out!

653
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,054
Oh, yeah!

654
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:23,307
Come on. Oh, boy! Come on.

655
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:41,909
Hey! Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

656
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:44,328
Is there air? You don't know!

657
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,004
Seems okay.

658
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,645
Here we go.

659
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:16,527
Which way, Alexander?

660
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:24,327
This way!

661
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,663
Wait. No.

662
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:34,170
That way.

663
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,422
- You were holding it upside down.
- Shut up.

664
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,715
You know,
with all that makeup and stuff,

665
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:39,634
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.

666
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:41,636
You think you could do better, Laredo?

667
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,931
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- We're screwed. We're so screwed.

668
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,807
Come on, come on, come on.
If we want to finish this mission,

669
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:48,351
we have to use some self-control.

670
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:51,437
Self-control?
That's funny coming from a guy

671
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,815
who slept with every Terrakian slave girl
and moon princess on the show.

672
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,692
Did it ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive

673
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:58,861
we might have been able...

674
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,866
Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

675
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:06,535
Where are the miners?

676
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,373
- Something bad happened here.
- Will you relax?

677
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:18,339
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

678
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,369
Look at that. Would you look at that?

679
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:52,748
They look like little children.

680
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,502
Could they be the miners?

681
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,672
Sure, they're like, three years old.

682
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,885
Miners, not minors!

683
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,054
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

684
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,516
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

685
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,478
Sure, they're cute now, but in a second,
they're gonna get mean.

686
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:16,063
They're gonna get ugly somehow,

687
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:19,150
then there's gonna be
a million more of them.

688
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:22,111
Look. There's a little hurt one.

689
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,706
Hi. Hi there.

690
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,544
Did you guys ever watch the show?

691
00:51:41,673 --> 00:51:44,967
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

692
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,312
I'm so sick of being right.

693
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:58,522
Let's get out of here
before one of those things kills Guy.

694
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:01,609
Wait a minute! We're not going
anywhere without a beryllium sphere.

695
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:03,652
We need a plan.
Fred, I need a diversion

696
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,446
to clear the compound of those things.

697
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,823
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.

698
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:08,949
Tommy, get up on that ridge.

699
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:11,077
If you see them come back
give me a signal, all right?

700
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,870
Why does this sound so familiar?

701
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:15,581
"Assault on Voltareck III," episode 81.

702
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,417
- We're doing episode 81?
- Whatever. The one with the hologram.

703
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,669
- The wall of fire.
- Well, how the hell is Fred

704
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,588
supposed to project a hologram?

705
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,424
- Are we doing episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan, Guy.

706
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,426
What difference does it make
if it's episode 81 or not?

707
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,970
'Cause I died in episode 81.

708
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:31,472
- Episode 51, right?
- 51. 51.

709
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:34,600
This is ludicrous.
Why are you listening to this fellow?

710
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,104
May I remind you he's wearing
a costume, not a uniform.

711
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:42,024
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.

712
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,444
Look, they're gone.

713
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,905
- Where'd they go? Back inside?
- I don't know.

714
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:50,032
Nobody was watching?

715
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:51,742
All right, all right. Listen up.
Here's the plan.

716
00:52:51,827 --> 00:52:53,911
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will go down and get a sphere.

717
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:55,830
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter
and Tommy, you're lookout.

718
00:52:55,914 --> 00:52:58,249
You see anything at all,
you give us a signal, all right?

719
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,625
What kind of a signal?

720
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:03,170
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands like this.

721
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:07,383
What are you, an infant?
Look, we have these.

722
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:11,846
That. Sorry.

723
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,681
Let's go.

724
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,899
- Does the rolling help actually?
- It helps.

725
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:26,652
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

726
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:36,954
What?

727
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:41,250
Never give up. Never surrender.

728
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,169
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, shut up.

729
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:47,173
Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of them, Jason!

730
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,593
Run, Jason! Run!
They're coming! They're everywhere!

731
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,346
- They're everywhere!
- Jason, they're everywhere!

732
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,183
- They're everywhere!
- Come on, let's go!

733
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,352
- They're coming!
- Hurry!

734
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:05,774
- They're everywhere! Come on!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

735
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:08,027
Don't look back. Do not look back!

736
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,571
- Oh, God.
- We're not gonna make it!

737
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:13,741
Oh, God!

738
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:17,620
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

739
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:21,457
Go, go, go! Come on! Push it harder!
Let's go, Tommy!

740
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,709
I got it but it's gonna
take a few seconds.

741
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,336
I got it, I got it!

742
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,046
- Oh, yeah!
- Go ahead.

743
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,547
There's no time. Get in! Get in!

744
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,716
Come on. I've forgotten you've got
to be the hero, haven't you?

745
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,387
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight! Oh, no! Jason Nesmith...

746
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,015
Jason! Jason, come on! Hurry!

747
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:41,227
- I'm on it!
- Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

748
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:44,146
No, no, no! Jason, please!

749
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:48,067
- Tommy, stop the pod! He's not in!
- But I can't stop it, it's on autopilot!

750
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,777
- Go! Leave him!
- No!

751
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,831
Oh, right!

752
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,834
Of course, it's always about you, isn't it?

753
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:46,667
- Gorignak! Gorignak!
- Gorignak! Gorignak!

754
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,755
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

755
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,757
Yeah, Gwen, you got me.

756
00:55:53,842 --> 00:55:55,968
- Thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

757
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:59,722
As a matter of fact, I have Gorignak
staring me in the face right now.

758
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:03,058
But you know what?
I think I can take him.

759
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,147
Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.

760
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,024
- The digital conveyor?
- Yes.

761
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:12,609
You mean
I'm gonna be diced into cubes

762
00:56:12,694 --> 00:56:14,486
and sent up there in a million pieces?

763
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,531
- Right.
- Well, you know what?

764
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:20,409
I think I'll take my chance
with Gorignak.

765
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:25,331
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?

766
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,666
It has never been successfully tested.

767
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,919
- What did he say?
- Hold, please.

768
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:33,380
Theoretically the mechanism
is fully operational.

769
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:37,259
However it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.

770
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:39,845
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.

771
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:44,266
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.

772
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:47,519
I mean, I can't. I can supervise...

773
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,396
Jason, we're gonna test it.

774
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:52,399
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

775
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:54,318
Hey, I'm doing all right
with the pig lizard.

776
00:56:54,402 --> 00:56:56,445
Please, Fred? And hurry.

777
00:57:00,158 --> 00:57:03,619
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.

778
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:07,039
The operation of the conveyor is
much more art than science.

779
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,791
Stand back, Jason.

780
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,527
What? What was that?

781
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:38,779
- Nothing.
- I hear some squealing or something.

782
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:42,741
- Oh, no. Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

783
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,327
I heard that. It turned inside out?

784
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,083
And it exploded.

785
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:55,796
Did I just hear that that animal
turned inside out and then it exploded?

786
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,047
Hello?

787
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,009
Hold, please.

788
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,595
Hey, wait a minute, guys, guys.

789
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,640
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?

790
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:09,143
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

791
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:16,024
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!

792
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:22,865
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

793
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,659
What the hell you talking about?

794
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,336
Oh, darn.

795
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:49,725
Digitize me!

796
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:51,477
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys. Digitize me!

797
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:52,978
- Oh, no, not me.
- Come on, they...

798
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,480
They based it on your hand movements.

799
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,023
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

800
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:58,400
- No, no, no.
- I'm not the guy.

801
00:58:58,485 --> 00:59:00,152
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen,
I'm Fred Kwan.

802
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,154
I'm not even...
Kwan's not even my real name.

803
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,406
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.

804
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:08,327
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

805
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,163
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!

806
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,915
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

807
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:15,876
Go for the mouth or the throat,
its vulnerable spots!

808
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,795
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!

809
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,174
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.

810
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,760
Can you form some sort of
rudimentary lathe?

811
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:27,095
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!

812
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,097
Alexander, you're my advisor.
Advise me!

813
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:32,142
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.

814
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:34,186
What is its motivation?

815
00:59:35,063 --> 00:59:37,981
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

816
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:42,444
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.

817
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:46,406
Fred! Fred, can you hear me?
Fred, are you there?

818
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:49,952
- Kind of.
- You can do it, Fred! It's up to you!

819
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:53,247
Oh, no, no, no.
Jason, I'll just... I'll just mess it up.

820
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:55,624
You did it for four years on the show!
Do it now!

821
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,502
That was the show. I'm not that guy!

822
00:59:58,586 --> 01:00:02,047
Fred, you never forgot a line!
You never missed a mark!

823
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,633
That's not me anymore man.

824
01:00:07,512 --> 01:00:10,305
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.

825
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:15,269
You can do this, Fred! I know
in my heart you're gonna save my life.

826
01:00:15,353 --> 01:00:18,438
- I am?
- No doubt about it, Fred.

827
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:20,482
Fred!

828
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,652
Fred, can you hear me?

829
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,363
Fred!

830
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,701
Fred? I don't want to die down here.

831
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,328
Digitize me, Fred!

832
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,625
Oh, wow.

833
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:41,628
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

834
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,014
I see you managed to get your shirt off.

835
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,645
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

836
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:02,149
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?

837
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:06,278
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Great! Engines and pods?

838
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,280
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

839
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,449
Well, crank this sucker up,
you could drop us off

840
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,909
and you guys can be back in
your home planet before supper.

841
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:15,329
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.

842
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,789
Sure you do. Family, friends. Come on!

843
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,875
We are all that is left.

844
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:30,177
- I didn't know that.
- Sir, I have raised the command deck.

845
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,643
Mathesar, meet us
up at the command deck.

846
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:38,894
Mathesar.

847
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:43,148
Mathesar! Quellek!

848
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,068
Why can't we reach them?

849
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,300
Commander. Thank God you're alive.

850
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:15,472
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

851
01:02:15,556 --> 01:02:20,811
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

852
01:02:20,895 --> 01:02:22,479
Leave him alone.

853
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:27,984
You wish to save the life of this man?

854
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:29,569
Yeah. Yes.

855
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:37,869
Then tell me, what does it do,
this Omega 13?

856
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,955
I don't know what it does.

857
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,460
I said I don't know!

858
01:02:48,715 --> 01:02:51,383
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

859
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,344
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

860
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:56,471
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

861
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,891
Do you think I'm a fool?

862
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:04,187
That the Commander does not know
every bolt, every weld in his ship?

863
01:03:06,357 --> 01:03:08,525
Prepare a tear harness

864
01:03:09,736 --> 01:03:11,278
for the female.

865
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:14,990
No! Gwen, no!

866
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,784
You brute! Let go of me!

867
01:03:18,953 --> 01:03:21,079
I'm not the Commander.

868
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,914
What did you say?

869
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,333
I said, "I'm not the Commander."

870
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:28,962
Leave them alone.
There's no reason to hurt them.

871
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:31,548
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

872
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:36,344
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

873
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:40,265
Computer,

874
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:44,394
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

875
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,963
Wonderful.

876
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:20,222
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

877
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,849
Bravo!

878
01:04:24,185 --> 01:04:25,477
Bravo.

879
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:28,688
This is a moment I will treasure.

880
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:33,109
Explain to him who you all really are.

881
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:36,988
Tell him!

882
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,951
Explain!

883
01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:49,751
Mathesar, there's no such person
as Captain Taggart.

884
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:54,714
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am an actor.

885
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,510
We're all actors.

886
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:01,596
He doesn't understand.

887
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,476
Explain as you would a child.

888
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:12,983
We pretended.

889
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,948
We lied.

890
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:26,288
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

891
01:05:26,747 --> 01:05:29,708
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I...

892
01:05:30,585 --> 01:05:34,713
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

893
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,215
We don't have a ship.

894
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,009
But there it is.

895
01:05:43,222 --> 01:05:45,098
That ship is that big.

896
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:48,226
But inside, I see many rooms.

897
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,022
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

898
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:56,860
Our beryllium sphere is wire
with plaster around it.

899
01:05:57,612 --> 01:05:58,987
And our...

900
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:02,490
Our digital conveyor is...

901
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:06,077
...Christmas tree lights.

902
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,538
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

903
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,876
Just like me.

904
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:18,715
But why?

905
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:23,678
It's difficult to explain.

906
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,015
On our planet, we...

907
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:34,105
We pretend to entertain and...

908
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:41,029
Mathesar, I am so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

909
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,158
So now you know.

910
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:51,206
Lieutenant Lathe,
hardwire the reactor core to overload.

911
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:55,251
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

912
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:57,587
Sarris, what about my people?

913
01:06:57,672 --> 01:07:01,549
Yes, far too simple a death for them,
isn't it?

914
01:07:01,634 --> 01:07:05,887
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.

915
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:09,015
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

916
01:07:10,184 --> 01:07:11,559
Son of a...

917
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,192
Release them

918
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:20,694
into space.

919
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:27,367
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

920
01:07:27,994 --> 01:07:30,954
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

921
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:36,167
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

922
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,335
Hey!

923
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,671
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

924
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,132
Where's the happy ending, Jason?

925
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,677
"Never give up. Never surrender."

926
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:55,061
Maybe it's about time
you just backed off,

927
01:07:55,146 --> 01:07:57,522
you fin-headed monstrosity.

928
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,815
Jason.

929
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,567
You what?

930
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:04,154
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

931
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,906
you scene-stealing hack.

932
01:08:09,493 --> 01:08:11,161
Oh, right!

933
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:17,917
Well, how does it feel, Jason?
Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!

934
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:20,837
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die just because of you!

935
01:08:20,921 --> 01:08:22,797
- I told you to shut up!
- Both of you, get in there.

936
01:08:22,882 --> 01:08:24,215
Hundreds to die,

937
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,927
just because you want to play
at being commander, you raving lunatic.

938
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:30,096
Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?

939
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:45,236
Look out, Jason!

940
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,822
Get his gun! Get the gun!

941
01:08:49,116 --> 01:08:50,492
Take that!

942
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,051
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.
Did you see that?

943
01:09:08,135 --> 01:09:11,429
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

944
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:18,311
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.

945
01:09:18,395 --> 01:09:19,938
- Raving egomaniac?
- Wonder where I got that from?

946
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,439
Hey, guys.

947
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,359
Look.

948
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:30,281
They're suffocating.

949
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:39,541
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

950
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:42,961
Core implosion
estimated in eight minutes.

951
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,967
General, your transport
is ready for departure.

952
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:58,017
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

953
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:02,230
Core implosion
estimated in seven minutes.

954
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:07,152
- Computer, shut down the core.
- Unable.

955
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:12,448
Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.

956
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:14,450
All right, all right, listen up.
This is what we gotta do.

957
01:10:14,535 --> 01:10:17,078
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to
the core and shut it down manually.

958
01:10:17,163 --> 01:10:19,956
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve, shut it off,

959
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,374
before those Thermians run out of air.

960
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:22,709
Alexander, get to the barracks,

961
01:10:22,793 --> 01:10:24,669
see if you can't wedge a door open
in case they can't do that.

962
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,462
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me?

963
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:27,589
What do I do?

964
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:30,425
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!

965
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:33,219
Practice driving.

966
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,014
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

967
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,433
- That's right.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason,

968
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:41,436
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

969
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,938
and unless you took a Learning Annex
course I don't know about,

970
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:46,774
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor, either.

971
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:50,028
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

972
01:10:54,491 --> 01:10:56,784
Brandon, honey, the garbage.

973
01:10:56,869 --> 01:10:58,870
Mother, I'm quite busy.

974
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:02,248
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

975
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:05,168
Just 10 more minutes, okay, Ma?
I promise.

976
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,643
Hello? Anybody there?

977
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:27,815
Hello?

978
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:31,819
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.

979
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:36,241
I play Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, NSEA Protector.

980
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:40,328
We accidentally traded voxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.

981
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:46,084
Commander, I see. Okay.

982
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,044
What's your name, son?

983
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:50,588
Brandon.

984
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,591
Brandon, I remember you.
From the convention, right?

985
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:57,011
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

986
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:59,180
and I was a little short with you.

987
01:11:59,265 --> 01:12:03,768
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna...

988
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,521
I just wanted to tell you that
I thought a lot about what you said...

989
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:09,274
- It's okay. Now, listen.
- But I want you to know

990
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:12,068
that I'm not
a complete brain case, okay?

991
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,947
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

992
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,449
- Hold... Wait a minute...
- I know there's no beryllium sphere...

993
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,327
- Stop. Stop for a second. Stop. Wait.
...no digital conveyor, no ship.

994
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:22,745
It's all real.

995
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,748
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

996
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,794
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble
and we need your help.

997
01:12:31,005 --> 01:12:34,966
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

998
01:12:35,759 --> 01:12:39,137
Core implosion
estimated in six minutes.

999
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,434
Sir, it's you. Thank lpthar.

1000
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,272
Quellek? What are you doing up there?

1001
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,320
I avoided capture
by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.

1002
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,655
Where is everyone?

1003
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,575
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

1004
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:07,415
All right, we're at level C, hallway five.
Now what?

1005
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:11,044
Go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1006
01:13:11,128 --> 01:13:13,087
Now, that leads to
a system of utility corridors

1007
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,297
through the bowels of the ship.

1008
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:17,091
- Open.
- You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.

1009
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:19,927
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1010
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:23,723
38, 39, 40.

1011
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:30,688
All right. All we have to do
is turn off the valve to the barracks.

1012
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:36,736
Hi, Brandon.

1013
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:40,156
No time for pleasantries, Kyle.
We have a level 5 emergency.

1014
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,450
You've still got the utility systems
walk-through, right?

1015
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:45,912
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28.
I think Hollister has the upper levels.

1016
01:13:45,996 --> 01:13:47,955
Great, we'll get everybody online.

1017
01:13:56,131 --> 01:14:00,218
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

1018
01:14:03,013 --> 01:14:06,557
General! I have just received word
that the commander of the Protector

1019
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:09,477
and his command crew
have escaped custody.

1020
01:14:10,396 --> 01:14:11,521
What?

1021
01:14:14,566 --> 01:14:15,942
Find them!

1022
01:14:16,026 --> 01:14:19,612
But, sir! My men...
The core implosion is not reversible.

1023
01:14:19,696 --> 01:14:21,989
Find them!

1024
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,743
All right, Brandon,
I see five ducts in this room.

1025
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,203
Which way do we go?

1026
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:32,417
Enter the passage second to your left,
and just continue straight for 50 meters.

1027
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,961
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

1028
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:37,296
There will be a slight drop.

1029
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,433
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?

1030
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:56,357
They're dying.

1031
01:14:56,442 --> 01:14:58,443
Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing?

1032
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,445
- Yes.
- Don't look down.

1033
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:03,030
Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.

1034
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:04,115
What are you talking about?

1035
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,034
You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13!

1036
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:08,953
It must be spectacular.

1037
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:14,041
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls

1038
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:17,795
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single...

1039
01:15:32,144 --> 01:15:35,605
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

1040
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:39,775
Many have believed
that it is a matter-collapser.

1041
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,905
A bomb capable of destroying pretty
much everything in about 13 seconds.

1042
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:49,452
But myself and others are convinced
that what it is is a matter-rearranger,

1043
01:15:49,536 --> 01:15:52,288
effecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1044
01:15:52,372 --> 01:15:53,331
Why 13 seconds?

1045
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:57,251
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1046
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:00,505
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1047
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,092
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

1048
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:10,181
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1049
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:14,602
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction.
I got this. I'm okay,

1050
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:17,980
I might be able to hold them back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1051
01:16:18,065 --> 01:16:19,232
That's suicide.

1052
01:16:19,316 --> 01:16:22,360
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.
I'm a dead man anyway.

1053
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,196
If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1054
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,450
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

1055
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,036
You ever think about that?

1056
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:34,205
- Plucky?
- Well, besides,

1057
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,083
I just had this really interesting idea.

1058
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,002
Are you stoned?

1059
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,715
Gotta get it open, give them some time.

1060
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,467
Sir, perhaps together,

1061
01:16:46,552 --> 01:16:49,720
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
"Larak tarath."

1062
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,974
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1063
01:16:53,058 --> 01:16:58,145
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!

1064
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,447
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

1065
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:12,785
You want to take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1066
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:14,453
"The chompers"?

1067
01:17:19,918 --> 01:17:21,419
Well, screw that.

1068
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,254
How are we supposed
to get through this?

1069
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,298
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

1070
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:30,344
Okay, the sequence is 2242...

1071
01:17:30,429 --> 01:17:32,346
- What is this thing?
...2242...

1072
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:34,098
I mean, there's no useful purpose
for there to be

1073
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,601
a bunch of chompy-crushy
things in the middle of a hallway!

1074
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:39,228
- Gwen! Gwen!
- No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.

1075
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:41,772
It makes no logical sense!
Why is it here?

1076
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,899
- 'Cause it's on the television show!
- Well, forget it!

1077
01:17:43,984 --> 01:17:47,612
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1078
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:50,781
Okay, Commander, now,
as soon as the first crusher hits you...

1079
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:51,907
It just did!

1080
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:54,201
- Okay, go now.
- Go!

1081
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:55,870
Go!

1082
01:17:56,163 --> 01:17:57,288
Stop!

1083
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,372
Go!

1084
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,043
Come on, come on, come on.

1085
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:08,549
Go!

1086
01:18:08,759 --> 01:18:09,925
Go! Go!

1087
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,469
No, stop! Stop!

1088
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:12,762
Go!

1089
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:14,305
Stop! Wait a minute! No!

1090
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:17,350
I want you to jump, Commander, jump!

1091
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:20,061
Whoever wrote this episode should die!

1092
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,523
This should be interesting.

1093
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:47,546
It's the simple things
in life you treasure.

1094
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:51,634
That's great.

1095
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,554
Now, we better get...

1096
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:02,978
Hey, get a room, guys, okay?

1097
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:15,700
Hey, Fred.

1098
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,289
That's not right.

1099
01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:54,321
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.

1100
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:57,908
Open!

1101
01:20:00,787 --> 01:20:02,621
We are saved.

1102
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:04,915
He has saved us.

1103
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,419
Commander Taggart has saved us!

1104
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,551
It's just not fair.

1105
01:20:17,763 --> 01:20:21,265
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the command deck.

1106
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:26,562
I'm... I'm shot.

1107
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:44,455
Quellek? Quellek?

1108
01:20:51,296 --> 01:20:52,963
It's not too bad.

1109
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:56,967
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

1110
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:00,095
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.

1111
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,556
I have been blessed, sir. I...

1112
01:21:03,683 --> 01:21:05,518
Don't speak, Quellek.

1113
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:12,399
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

1114
01:21:12,484 --> 01:21:14,902
but even though
we had never before met,

1115
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:17,822
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1116
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:22,910
Quellek,

1117
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,414
by Grabthar's hammer,

1118
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:31,001
by the sons of Warvan,

1119
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:36,423
you shall be avenged.

1120
01:22:14,337 --> 01:22:17,298
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!

1121
01:22:17,924 --> 01:22:19,884
All right, Brandon, I'm here.
How do I shut this thing down?

1122
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,552
Okay, just push the blue button.

1123
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,388
- The blue button? Is that it?
- Yeah, why, what's wrong?

1124
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:28,183
Nothing, I just thought
it'd be more complicated than that.

1125
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,855
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.

1126
01:22:42,532 --> 01:22:45,618
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!

1127
01:22:48,246 --> 01:22:50,456
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

1128
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,001
- of the Commander's predicament.
- Don't forget the recyclables!

1129
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:58,297
Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.

1130
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,550
- 9,8...
- Gwen, I...

1131
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:03,469
...7,6...
- I've always...

1132
01:23:03,553 --> 01:23:06,263
...5,4...
- Jason, Jason.

1133
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,183
...3,2,1.

1134
01:23:19,069 --> 01:23:21,570
It always stops at one on the show.

1135
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:24,198
What were you saying?

1136
01:23:24,783 --> 01:23:26,158
- Sir!
- What?

1137
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:29,370
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.

1138
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:31,830
Impossible! Lmpossible!

1139
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:36,377
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

1140
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:38,879
Tear her apart!

1141
01:23:48,765 --> 01:23:49,974
He's finished, he's finished.

1142
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:53,560
Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.

1143
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:57,773
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.

1144
01:23:59,526 --> 01:24:01,276
We need that armor back up!

1145
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:05,572
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armor engaged.

1146
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:09,493
All right, Tommy, see if you can't
lose them in that minefield.

1147
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,037
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal, right now!

1148
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:14,331
- Pedal to the metal!
- All right, let's go!

1149
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:26,719
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

1150
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,221
Thrust ahead, full!

1151
01:24:29,973 --> 01:24:32,349
Into the field, go!

1152
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:41,942
Tommy, can you get us closer
to these mines?

1153
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:43,277
Closer?

1154
01:24:47,657 --> 01:24:48,782
I could try.

1155
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:56,874
General, I've lost them.

1156
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:01,378
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

1157
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,631
Wait! I see something.

1158
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:08,552
Yes. Yes! There they are.

1159
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:11,138
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1160
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:14,725
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1161
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:16,894
Fire at will.

1162
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:26,070
We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

1163
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:29,073
No! Divert all energy to the armor!

1164
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,657
How adorable!

1165
01:25:31,284 --> 01:25:34,328
The actors
are going to play war with me.

1166
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:37,414
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us
at mark two.

1167
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,208
Accelerate to mark four.

1168
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:46,507
Let me remind you, sonny,

1169
01:25:47,258 --> 01:25:49,510
I am a general.

1170
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:56,225
If you are counting on me to blink,
then you are making a deadly mistake.

1171
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,937
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.

1172
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:03,440
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognize a bad one.

1173
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,609
You're sweating!

1174
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,611
Armor almost gone, Jason!

1175
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:12,866
You fool! You fail to realize
that with your armor gone,

1176
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:17,079
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1177
01:26:18,164 --> 01:26:22,251
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.

1178
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,589
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

1179
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,482
- Yes!
- Yes!

1180
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,863
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1181
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,741
This is fantastic!

1182
01:27:00,456 --> 01:27:01,748
Mathesar!

1183
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,127
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1184
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,462
Come here.

1185
01:27:07,547 --> 01:27:11,049
"The ship was a model as big as this."

1186
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,303
A very clever deception indeed.

1187
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,231
Set a course for home, Commander?

1188
01:27:26,316 --> 01:27:28,984
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, it's just point and click.

1189
01:27:29,068 --> 01:27:31,028
But we're going to have to go through
the black hole, though.

1190
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,696
Any objections?

1191
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,657
All right, set her up.

1192
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,456
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1193
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,460
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1194
01:27:47,212 --> 01:27:50,297
My people have no commander.

1195
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:56,136
Mathesar, I think your people
have a great commander,

1196
01:27:57,222 --> 01:27:58,305
sir.

1197
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:09,483
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.

1198
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,918
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1199
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:29,962
Systems register functional.

1200
01:28:30,046 --> 01:28:32,047
All systems are working, Commander.

1201
01:28:32,131 --> 01:28:33,966
Jason, before the black hole,

1202
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,426
there was an energy surge
from Sarris' ship.

1203
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,429
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander.

1204
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:42,349
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we...

1205
01:28:42,433 --> 01:28:46,019
Hey, you know,
you could put an eye out with that thing.

1206
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,148
Fred?

1207
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:07,207
No!

1208
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:33,942
Mathesar!

1209
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,903
Activate the Omega 13!

1210
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,930
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1211
01:30:05,183 --> 01:30:07,309
Systems register functional.

1212
01:30:07,393 --> 01:30:09,353
All systems are working, Commander.

1213
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:11,313
Jason, before the black hole,

1214
01:30:11,397 --> 01:30:14,274
there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1215
01:30:15,985 --> 01:30:20,072
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1216
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:23,533
Let go of me. Let... It's not Fred!

1217
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,535
That's Sarris. Listen to me!

1218
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,954
I'm telling you, it's not Fred,
that's Sarris!

1219
01:30:28,039 --> 01:30:30,457
He's gonna try to kill all of us!

1220
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:41,301
Never give up. Never surrender.

1221
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:46,223
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!

1222
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:49,101
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.

1223
01:30:49,185 --> 01:30:51,645
We need to separate, or we'll die.

1224
01:30:56,275 --> 01:30:59,820
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.

1225
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,156
Crew to the secondary deck.

1226
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:06,451
Mathesar!

1227
01:31:10,748 --> 01:31:12,541
Goodbye, my friends.

1228
01:31:18,548 --> 01:31:21,675
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

1229
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:49,536
On, Teb, on!

1230
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,087
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,

1231
01:31:59,172 --> 01:32:03,884
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,

1232
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,845
much to the disappointment
of all these fans.

1233
01:32:06,929 --> 01:32:08,263
Bye. Be back soon!

1234
01:32:08,347 --> 01:32:11,641
Well... Wait. Brandon, where are you
going with all those fireworks?

1235
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:14,728
The Protectorgot super-accelerated
coming out of the black hole

1236
01:32:14,812 --> 01:32:17,022
and it's, like, nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

1237
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:20,150
which, you guys know,
is pretty unstable, obviously,

1238
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:23,403
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it
on the vox ultra-frequency carrier

1239
01:32:23,488 --> 01:32:26,698
and use Roman candles
for visual confirmation.

1240
01:32:26,782 --> 01:32:28,950
All right, dinner's at 7:00.

1241
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:33,872
Well, he's outside.

1242
01:34:02,878 --> 01:34:06,047
Lieutenant Laredo, Tommy Webber!

1243
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,010
Hi, Tommy!

1244
01:34:12,096 --> 01:34:15,515
The beautiful Tawny Madison,
Gwen DeMarco!

1245
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:20,395
Yes!

1246
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,189
Wow, what effects!

1247
01:34:23,983 --> 01:34:28,153
Another shipmate!
Yes, the more, the merrier!

1248
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:34,159
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen,
Fred Kwan, and a friend.

1249
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:39,456
Dr. Lazarus, Alexander Dane!

1250
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:43,209
Give him a big hand. He's British!
Yes, sir!

1251
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:48,548
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
Jason Nesmith!

1252
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:00,060
Great driving, Tommy.

1253
01:35:00,144 --> 01:35:01,895
Yes! Yes!

1254
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:12,280
Quick, quick! Go, go! Move, move!

1255
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:23,500
Once again,
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,

1256
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:25,293
Mr. Jason Nesmith!

1257
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:33,051
Come on, give it up for the crew,
the NSEA Protector!

1258
01:35:34,303 --> 01:35:36,680
True love! Yes!

1259
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:39,933
Wow!

1260
01:35:41,644 --> 01:35:42,936
Come on!

1261
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:48,566
They're here for you, folks. Come on!

1262
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:50,610
What a show!

1263
01:35:52,321 --> 01:35:53,988
What a show! Yes!

1264
01:35:56,992 --> 01:36:00,036
Yes! Give it up! Wow!

1265
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,999
Come on, give it up! Give it all up

1266
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:09,421
for the crew of your favorite show,
Galaxy Quest! Wow!

1267
01:36:12,883 --> 01:36:14,551
Come on, come on!

1268
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:29,107
Don't forget to buy a Galaxy Quest
T-shirt on your way out. Thank you.

1269
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:40,076
And now, back again after 18 years,
the new adventures of Galaxy Quest.

1270
01:41:56,393 --> 01:41:58,728
Never give up. Never surrender.

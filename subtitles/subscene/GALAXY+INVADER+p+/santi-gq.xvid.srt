1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,251
- Exiting time knot now, sir.
- We're alive.

2
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,211
We made it, Commander. We made it.

3
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,757
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,884
Systems register functional.

5
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,762
All systems are working, Commander.

6
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,264
I don't like it. It was too easy.

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,186
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

8
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,896
There are time knots
opening everywhere!

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,356
- A trap!
- We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,490
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

11
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,367
Surrender may be our only option.

12
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,455
No! Never give up! Never surrender!

13
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,749
Your orders, sir?

14
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,377
Sir? Your orders?

15
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,008
Activate the Omega 13.

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,513
Well?

17
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,018
Well, there you are. Yeah!

18
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,942
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,113
You are the first people to see

20
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:58,867
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,578
since it was originally aired in 1982!

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,997
Yeah! All right.

23
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,585
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:15,551
The intrepid crew
ofthe NSEA Protector! Yeah!

25
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,555
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

26
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,893
White scarf, black buttons,
white shoes...

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,982
Man, where the hell is he?
An hour and a half late?

28
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,235
- An hour and a half.
- I mean, this is unreal.

29
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,612
They're gonna start
eating each other out there.

30
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,241
Did you hear? He booked
another appearance without us.

31
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,325
You're kidding!

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,587
- How did I come to this?
- Not again.

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,173
- I played Richard the Third.
- Five curtain calls.

34
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,550
There were five curtain calls.
I was an actor once,

35
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,343
damn it, now look at me. Look at me!

36
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,723
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

37
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,436
- I can't, I won't.
- Well, Alex, at least you had a part.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,855
Okay? You had
a character people loved.

39
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,901
I mean, my TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

40
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,736
and how they fit into my suit.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,239
No one even bothered to ask me
what I do on the show.

42
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,119
You had the... Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

43
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,455
I repeated the computer, Fred.

44
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,625
Your commander is on deck!

45
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,795
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,715
Am I too late
for Alexander's panic attack?

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,763
Apparently not. You know,
you should get that looked at. Yeah.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,557
Let's take a look at a few more clips.

49
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,101
Okay. What did I do?

50
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,521
What?

51
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,232
- We want the crew!
- For those four seasons,

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,610
we developed
the same affection for the crew

53
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,195
as the crew had for each other.

54
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:03,867
I mean, these weren'tjust adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

55
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,787
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it, man!

56
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,206
It's not a big deal. These guys put
a little set in their basement.

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,083
I'm there about an hour.

58
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,336
It's nothing, Gwen.
They wanted the Commander.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,256
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him! Grab him!

60
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,466
- We want the crew!
- We want the crew!

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,929
Okay! Yeah! Here we go!

62
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,431
- Come on, old friend, old friend.
- Friend?

63
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,102
You stole all my best lines,
you cut me out of episode two entirely!

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:35,107
Tawny Madison, my personal favorite,
Gwen DeMarco!

65
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,776
Yeah!

66
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,611
It's getting hotter, Commander.

67
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,321
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

68
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:47,369
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo, Tommy Webber!

69
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,290
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

70
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,126
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

71
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,711
Freddie Kwan!

72
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,215
Damn you.

73
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,637
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

74
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,558
Tev'Meck, Alexander Dane!

75
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,227
Yeah! All right!

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,817
By Grabthar's hammer,
you shall be avenged!

77
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,153
Yeah! All right!

78
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,072
That guy can act.

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,368
And finally, my fellow Questerians,

80
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,248
the brave commander
ofthe NSEA Protector,

81
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,334
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter...

82
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,544
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy...

83
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,296
Taggart, Taggart, Taggart, Taggart...

84
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,007
Jason Nesmith!

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,926
Yeah! All right!

86
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,891
We love you, Commander!

87
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,644
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

88
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,396
- Never surrender!
- Never surrender!

89
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,190
- Damn the resonance cannons,
- Damn the resonance cannons,

90
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,859
- full speed ahead!
- full speed ahead!

91
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,531
The Commander and his crew
will be signing autographs

92
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,951
on imperial decks C and B
near the Coke machines.

93
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,914
Quest forever, man!

94
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,000
Excuse me, pardon me,
crew member coming through.

95
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,503
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, man.

96
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,964
I want to thank you for that nice intro
you gave us today.

97
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,469
Guy. Probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses, right?

98
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,097
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

99
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,725
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,730
Listen, maybe I could sit in
and sign a couple of autographs?

101
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,776
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

102
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,158
By Grabthar's...

103
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,786
Next.

104
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,623
Had I moved an inch to the left,
the beast would have killed me.

105
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,417
On the other hand,
my crew was in danger.

106
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,751
How did you know what to do?

107
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,338
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

108
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,677
I think we all remember what happened
to that beast on Enok Vll, right?

109
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,931
You've got to admit,
they really do love him.

110
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,518
Yeah, almost as much
as he loves himself.

111
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,273
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

112
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,358
I was wondering if you could help
settle the dispute

113
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,027
that my crew and I seem to be having.

114
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,947
If you remember,
in "Quasar Dilemma"...

115
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,366
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

116
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,912
Hadn't even gotten to
the relevant conundrum.

117
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,040
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V,"

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,462
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander kind of had a thing.

119
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,963
Did you?

120
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,966
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

121
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,926
Well, that's her story.

122
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,099
Excuse me.

123
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,144
Gwen.

124
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,317
Gwen!

125
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,653
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

126
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,323
I must speak to you.
It is a matter of supreme importance.

127
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,617
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula

128
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,785
and we need your help.

129
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,998
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

130
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,750
Just hammer out the details
with my agent,

131
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,627
and make sure
there's a limo at my house.

132
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,714
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.

133
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,799
Remember, mum's the word.

134
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,552
Certainly, but...

135
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,555
- Mum.
- Mum.

136
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,100
Here, and beautiful!

137
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,690
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

138
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,027
is filling my head with such thoughts.

139
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,613
It was cute when I didn't know you.

140
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,895
What a freak show, man.
This is hilarious.

141
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,066
Bunch of losers! Begging
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

142
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,695
These guys haven't had a real acting
job for 20 years. This is all they've got.

143
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,405
And did you check out Nesmith?

144
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,532
- He actually gets off on those retards...
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,367
...thinking he's a space commander!

146
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,370
- And his friends...
- I know, they can't stand him!

147
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,580
Did you hear them ragging
on him in there?

148
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,124
Dude, he has no idea
he's a laughingstock,

149
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,500
even to his buddies.

150
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,669
- He's pathetic!
- Come on, come on.

151
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,255
The Galaxy Quest dancers
are almost on.

152
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,549
Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

153
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,813
Hey, Commander,

154
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,899
so as I was saying
in "The Quasar Dilemma,"

155
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,985
remember, you used
the auxiliary deck B for...

156
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,362
Can you get this?
Deck B for gamma override.

157
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,324
The thing is that
online blueprints clearly indicate that

158
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,035
deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

159
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,705
So we were wondering,
just where the error lies in that?

160
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,709
It's just a television show.
That's all, okay?

161
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,212
Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering
if the quantum flux, nowjust listen...

162
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,799
There is no quantum flux.
There's no auxiliary.

163
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,219
There's no goddamn ship!

164
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,679
You got it?

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,901
I mean it. I mean it, Alex.

166
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,154
I've never seen him lose it like that.
Not to a fan.

167
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,281
I mean, it was just weird.

168
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,619
Gwen, I have said it for years.

169
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,579
He's mentally unstable.

170
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,167
I... I'm worried. It just was not like him.

171
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,232
As long as there is injustice,

172
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,193
whenever a Targathian baby cries out,

173
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,028
wherever a distress signal sounds,

174
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,279
- among the stars...
- Among the stars...

175
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,489
...we'll be there.

176
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,909
- This fine ship and this fine crew.
- This fine ship and this fine crew.

177
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,411
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

178
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,330
- Never surrender.
- Never surrender.

179
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,097
Can I help you?

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,767
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach
in protocol...

181
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,061
- You shouldn't come to my house, man.
- Please, I beg you to hear our plea.

182
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,647
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

183
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,609
Our people are being systematically
hunted and slaughtered

184
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,778
by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

185
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,362
We are to meet in negotiation.

186
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,158
However, our efforts in this regard
have been disastrous.

187
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,537
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

188
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,627
- We have secured our limousine.
- What?

189
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,674
It's the thing for the thing that's...

190
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,472
Maybe I should get some pants on.

191
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,391
Come on in.

192
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,359
Commander, I must say that
standing here in your presence

193
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,905
is the greatest honor we could ever
have hoped to achieve in our lifetime.

194
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,533
That's... I really appreciate that.

195
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,703
Would you guys look for another shoe
that looks like this, please?

196
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,632
Sir, I am Lahnk,
senior requisition officer.

197
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,927
Before we travel to the ship, please let
me know if you have any requirements.

198
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,221
Weapons, documents, personnel.

199
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,932
A Coca-Cola, do you have one of those?

200
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,935
Sir, I am Teb.

201
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,647
I would like to explain the history
between our people

202
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,691
and the Sarris dominion
in greater detail.

203
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,900
Hey, how you doing?

204
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,529
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

205
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,030
our people were one...

206
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,740
What's your name?

207
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,036
- Doesn't she talk?
- Her translator is broken.

208
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,001
Okey-dokey.

209
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,130
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast,

210
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,384
so I'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit.

211
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,722
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, okay?

212
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,058
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

213
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,602
our people were one people.

214
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:00,982
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

215
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,278
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

216
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,741
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths. The foolishness!

217
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,453
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

218
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,922
Commander. Commander?

219
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

220
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,968
but your presence is requested
on the command deck.

221
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,433
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.

222
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,603
We are approaching his ship
at the Ni-Delta now.

223
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,980
He wants an answer to his proposal.
I understand...

224
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,483
I got most of it in the car.
Sarris is the bad guy, right?

225
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,652
Oh, yes, sir.
He's a very bad man indeed.

226
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,362
He has tortured our scientists,

227
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,739
put us to work
in the gallium arsenide mines,

228
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,866
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

229
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.

230
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,662
Do you have pages
orjust want me to wing this?

231
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,288
I am not sure I understand you.

232
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,791
Commander, welcome
to the Protector Two.

233
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,251
- Good to see you.
- Would you like to don your uniform?

234
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,670
No, you know what? I'd like to skip that.

235
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,839
I got this gig in Van Nuys in about
a quarter of an hour. Is that all right?

236
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,718
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

237
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,103
General, I have just received word

238
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,021
the Thermians have appointed
a new commander

239
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,232
to handle the negotiations.

240
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,192
What?

241
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,201
This is great. You know, usually
it's just cardboard walls in a garage.

242
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,287
Sir, we apologize
for operating in low-power mode,

243
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,457
but we are experiencing
a reflective flux field

244
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,168
this close to the galactic axis.

245
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,296
You know, what I could use is
a cup holder and a couple ofAdvil.

246
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,675
We're approaching in five ticks, sir.
Command to slow?

247
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,219
Set it on screensaver two.

248
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,349
I guess, we, you know, got to...

249
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,686
I'm sorry to break up the mood here.

250
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,272
Slow it down to mark two, Lieutenant.

251
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,567
I see fear. That is expected.

252
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,239
- They bring a new commander.
- It's good.

253
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,616
- Here are my demands.
- Scary. I mean, you know, it looks...

254
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,327
- And if I do not hear what I like,
- ... real.

255
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:24,083
then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine!

256
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,003
- First...
- Backwash.

257
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,590
...I require the Omega 13.

258
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,926
Second, I will require a technician...

259
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,723
Okey-dokey! Okey-dokey!
Let's fire blue particle cannons full,

260
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,308
red particle cannons full,

261
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,687
gannet magnets, fire them left and right
and let them run all chutes.

262
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,899
And while you're at it,
why don't you toss that at them, killer?

263
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,568
That should take care
of old lobster head, shouldn't it?

264
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,778
Yeah.

265
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,746
Commander, where are you going?

266
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,998
- Home.
- You mean Earth?

267
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,625
Yeah, Earth.
I need to get back to Earth, kids.

268
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,836
But the negotiations, you fired on him.

269
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,339
Yeah. Yeah. Long live...
What was your planet called?

270
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,883
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia. This way?

271
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,384
What if Sarris survives?

272
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,387
- I doubt it. We gave him both barrels.
- He has a very powerful ship.

273
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,264
If you got any more problems
with the guy,

274
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,642
just, you know, give me a call.

275
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,606
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

276
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,983
How can we thank you, Commander?

277
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,362
You have saved our people.

278
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,866
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,786
You know, you kids have been great.
You really have.

280
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,579
This thing is real-looking.

281
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,206
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

282
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,753
Hey! Where's my limo?

283
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,541
Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

284
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:15,296
But we've never seen space-age
values like we've seen here at...

285
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,049
Tech Value Electronics Superstore!

286
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,226
By Grabthar's hammer,

287
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,147
what a savings.

288
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,445
All right! Yeah, let's hear it
for the NSEA Protector.

289
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,696
Vacuum laser...

290
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,531
What, no, no, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.

291
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,367
Yes, if he's down in the Omega 13...

292
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,287
- Brandon, are you okay?
- Commander! My apologies.

293
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,165
You know, evidently we had
a little miscommunication

294
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,002
regarding the voyage.
You didn't show up.

295
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,800
- He...
- He did it again.

296
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,305
Do you know what time it is?

297
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,599
Why do you even bother
to show up at all?

298
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,103
No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.

299
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,813
I was up there.

300
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,691
Remember yesterday at the convention,
those people dressed like aliens?

301
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,443
They were aliens.
They were Termites or Dalmatians.

302
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,821
I can't really remember
'cause I was kind of hung-over.

303
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,449
But what they built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

304
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,203
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

305
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,668
I know what you're thinking.
But I can prove it. They gave me this.

306
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,882
No, no, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

307
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,302
Protector, this is the Commander. Over.

308
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,263
- Oh, for God's sake.
- That's it. It's time to go!

309
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,973
This isn't mine.

310
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,267
That kid. Where's that kid?

311
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,104
Begging your pardon, Commander,
we come with news. Sarris lives.

312
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,314
- He was able upon your departure...
- Listen.

313
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,648
- ... to make an escape.
- Tell them.

314
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,191
- However, he has contacted us...
- Sarris.

315
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,693
...and wishes to negotiate a surrender.

316
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,488
We humbly implore you to come
and negotiate the terms.

317
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,159
They want me back?
You want me back?

318
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,493
Is this amazing? They want me back,

319
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,287
and I want you guys
to go with me, please.

320
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,165
Don't even think about it. Let's go. Yes!

321
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,085
You're going? Alexander, this is not...
I'm not kidding here!

322
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,173
This isn't some kind of prank!
I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen.

323
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,509
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.
Stop, come here.

324
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,720
You know me.
I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?

325
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,930
You know,
it's one thing to treat us this way.

326
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,808
It's another thing to do it to your fans.

327
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,103
She's not a fan! This is a Termite!

328
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,815
You should've just let me hit him.

329
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,278
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

330
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,406
I think we should've just taken the gig.

331
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,825
I mean, who knows
the next time he'll ask us.

332
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,038
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

333
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,712
But you live with your mother.

334
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,633
- Did Jason come through here?
- Yeah, he's in there. Hey, guys.

335
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,928
We are coming, too.

336
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,557
- All of you wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

337
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,560
You see, we work together, or not at all.

338
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,730
Wonderful. The Commander
had me continue transmission

339
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,857
in case you changed your mind.

340
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,529
- Protector, requesting four interstellar...
- Me, too.

341
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,031
Five pods for immediate departure.

342
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,413
Guys. Guys?

343
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,958
I look forward to meeting you all
in person when you arrive at the ship.

344
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,668
End transmission.

345
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,672
Oh, my God.

346
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,801
Anybody got any change?

347
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,205
Our most sincere apologies.

348
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,374
We forgot about
our appearance generators.

349
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,169
You guys came!
Who wants the grand tour?

350
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,428
Anybody else?

351
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,767
That was a hell of a thing.

352
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,357
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

353
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,193
That's right, guys, just keep shaking
it off, it gets better.

354
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,321
- Hey, try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

355
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,532
The 23rd quadrant
of the Gamma sector.

356
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,909
There's a map in the core room.
I'll show you, come on.

357
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,913
- Welcome, my friends!
- This is Mathesar, he's their leader.

358
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,376
I am Mathesar. On behalf of
all my people I wish to thank you

359
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,547
- from the deepest place in our hearts.
- Mathesar, this is my crew.

360
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,385
Dr. Lazarus.

361
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,512
- Dr. Lazarus.
- Dr. Lazarus.

362
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,475
Lieutenant Madison.

363
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,270
- Lieutenant Madison.
- Lieutenant Madison.

364
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,735
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

365
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,988
- Young Laredo.
- Young Laredo.

366
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,367
Tech Sergeant Chen.

367
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,120
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Tech Sergeant Chen.

368
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,919
Crewman number... Guy.

369
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,963
- Guy.
- Guy.

370
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,549
You know us?

371
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,306
I don't believe there is a man, woman
or child on my planet who does not.

372
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,308
For years since we first
received transmission

373
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,059
of your historical documents,

374
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,354
we have studied every facet
of your missions and strategies.

375
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,772
You've been watching the show?

376
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,151
Lieutenant, historical documents.

377
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,945
Historical documents from out here?

378
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,949
Yes. The past 100 years,
our society had fallen into disarray.

379
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,286
Our goals, our values had become
scattered, but since the transmission,

380
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,582
we have modeled every aspect
of our society from your example,

381
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,084
and it has saved us.

382
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,547
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

383
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,133
In fact, all you see around you
has been taken

384
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,553
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

385
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,473
Is this a spaceship?

386
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,185
No, this is a star port for the ship.

387
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,813
Would you guys like to see the ship?

388
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,962
Oh, my God!

389
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,261
It's real.

390
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,815
The generator room.

391
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,193
The beryllium sphere, of course.

392
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:20,114
And as we continue,
the medical quarters are to the left.

393
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,325
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

394
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,244
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- What the hell is going on?

395
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,871
- What are we doing here?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

396
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,791
We're just here to negotiate
this guy Sarris' surrender.

397
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,959
It's no big deal.

398
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,046
And the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

399
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:41,051
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

400
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,680
- Come on, guys.
- Jason, we're actors, not astronauts.

401
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,558
You guys want to go home?
You say the word, we'll go home.

402
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,893
Pay our bills, feed our fish,

403
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:54,481
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

404
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,025
Come on.
Do you guys want to do that? Anybody?

405
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,612
Gwen, come on, think about it.
Look at where we are. We're in space.

406
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,575
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime.
You guys want to leave?

407
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,579
We have enjoyed preparing
many of your esoteric dishes.

408
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:13,000
Your Monte Cristo sandwich is
a current favorite of the adventurous.

409
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,752
The main barracks.

410
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,224
At ease.

411
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,690
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.

412
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,112
What?

413
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,157
I'm just jazzed about
being on the show, man.

414
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,833
If you would all take your positions.

415
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,336
Our what?

416
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,545
Guys.

417
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,883
Oh, my!

418
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,599
Look, this thingy.

419
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,437
I remember I had it all worked out.

420
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,774
This is forward. This is back.

421
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,778
Commander, some of
the crew has requested

422
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,447
to be present at this historic event.

423
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,408
Sure. Bring them in.

424
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,553
No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

425
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,806
Laredo, take us out.

426
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,643
Excuse me?

427
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,773
They designed those controls
after watching you.

428
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,570
- Take her out.
- Right, right.

429
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,447
Okay. Right.

430
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,619
Right. Take her out.

431
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,101
Okay, you got to move to the right.
Move more to the right.

432
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:22,439
Would you sit your ass down? Sit!
Move! You want to drive this thing?

433
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,035
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander?

434
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,872
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed Iowa beef.

435
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,334
Yes, we programmed the food
synthesizer for each of you

436
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,878
based on the regional menu
of your birthplace.

437
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,298
I don't care where you did it,
it tastes great.

438
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,176
Are you enjoying your Kep-mok
blood ticks, Dr. Lazarus?

439
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,512
Just like Mother used to make.

440
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,728
So, tell me, Mathesar,

441
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,106
this Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

442
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,025
what does he want?

443
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,611
He heard about the device,
the Omega 13.

444
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,073
What is it? What does it do?

445
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,200
We don't know.

446
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,953
We were hoping you could enlighten us.

447
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,628
The Omega 13 device.

448
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,884
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

449
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,262
Why don't you just turn it on
and see what it does?

450
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,642
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

451
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,519
If we were mistaken in our construction,

452
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,148
the device would act as a molecular
explosive, causing a chain reaction

453
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,401
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

454
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,739
Has Sarris ever seen
any of the historical records?

455
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,824
No, thank God, he has not.

456
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,579
So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

457
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,171
Our former commander was not strong.

458
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,673
Former commander?

459
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,470
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

460
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,099
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

461
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,893
Originally, one of our own tried to lead.

462
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,561
Is that all?

463
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,983
After three days of this,
you still require incentive?

464
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,780
I have told you all I know.

465
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,741
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

466
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,454
When I grow weary of
the noises you make, you shall die.

467
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,928
Hey, guys, come on, hold on a minute.

468
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,097
You just can't leave.
Give me some time to think.

469
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,140
- Think.
- He wants to think.

470
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,642
No, Jason. That's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about!

471
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,810
I'm not even supposed to be here.

472
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,937
I'm just crewman number six.
I'm expendable.

473
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,648
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious.

474
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,858
I got to get out of here.

475
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,651
Commander! Commander?

476
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,320
We got to prepare
the pods for my crew's departure.

477
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,989
But begging your
Commander's pardon, sir,

478
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,657
we can't launch pods at the moment.

479
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,285
Sarris will surely detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

480
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,203
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here now.

481
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,290
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

482
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,175
There's nobody here.

483
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,011
While my people are talented scientists,

484
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,971
our attempt to operate
our own technologies

485
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,349
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

486
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,727
I have raised Sarris on Zeta frequency.

487
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,147
- Mathesar...
- We meet again, Commander.

488
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,984
Hello, Sarris. How you doing?

489
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,111
Better than my lieutenant.

490
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,532
He failed to activate
the ship's neutron armor

491
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,328
as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.

492
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,371
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say

493
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,081
I'm real sorry about
what happened before.

494
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,668
The whole thing was just
a misunderstanding.

495
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:58,798
Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship!

496
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,552
You know, we'd like to do that,

497
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,097
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

498
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,850
You have 10 seconds!

499
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,728
I don't... Ten seconds? I don't... There...

500
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,899
You know, okay. Gosh darn it, I give up.
It's yours. You can have it.

501
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,569
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay?

502
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,737
Gwen.

503
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,616
Don't panic.
I've dealt with this guy before.

504
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,159
He's as stupid as he is ugly.

505
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,285
- Come here.
- Jason.

506
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,578
Not now, Gwen.

507
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,497
- No!
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

508
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,415
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right?

509
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,459
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

510
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,503
Push these red buttons and
send everything we have towards him.

511
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,296
- Okay?
- Okay.

512
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,925
All right, Gwen,
put me back on with him.

513
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,845
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back on.

514
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,100
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander!

515
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:58,108
I gave you the "kill" gesture.

516
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,528
Yeah. No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

517
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,615
- Like I know where the hold button is.
- Hey, you guys.

518
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,286
There's a red thingy

519
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,330
- moving toward the green thingy.
- What?

520
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,501
Red thingy moving toward
the green thingy.

521
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,796
I think we're the green thingy.

522
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,133
A little present for you, Commander.

523
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,801
We got to get out of here!
Move the ship! Turn it! Move it! Go!

524
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,430
Oh, no!

525
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,684
Oh, my God!

526
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,903
Tommy, Tommy, let's go!

527
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,030
- Get us out of here!
- Jason, what do I do?

528
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,073
- Let's go! Go, go, go!
- What do I do?

529
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,505
They're turning. They're coming!

530
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,263
Thrust ahead, full!

531
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,850
Fire at will.

532
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,482
- Go faster, Tommy!
- I'm going as fast as I can, Jason!

533
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,525
She's still behind us!

534
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,277
Well, press "turbo. "

535
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,737
I've always said,
"Press the turbo," right?

536
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,741
- It's right here! Right here!
- Well, press it and hold it down!

537
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,956
The enemy is matching velocity.

538
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,668
- Enemy is matching velocity.
- We heard it the first time!

539
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,005
Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

540
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,716
Hi, guys. Listen,

541
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:52,555
they're telling me
the generators won't take it.

542
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,852
The ship is breaking apart and all that.
Just FYl.

543
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,563
- We've got to stop!
- We stop and we die.

544
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,358
- Tommy, just hold that thing down!
- You cannot hold the turbo down!

545
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,819
- It's for quick boosts!
- Like you know!

546
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,702
I remember that sound.
That's a bad sound.

547
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,998
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We might
be able to lose them in this cloud here.

548
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,210
- I don't think that's a cloud.
- Mathesar, what is it?

549
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,756
This is the Tothian minefield left
standing from the great war of 12185.

550
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,888
Oh, God!

551
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:50,864
Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one?

552
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:55,034
Sorry, man, they're drifting towards us.
I think they're magnetic!

553
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,583
Continue forward, sir?

554
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,711
Patience, Lieutenant.

555
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,881
Patience.

556
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,602
- We've got to stop!
- We're almost through this.

557
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,167
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

558
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,753
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?

559
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,048
- Tommy! You all right?
- Oh, man!

560
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,718
No, my arm is broke.
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

561
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,722
- I'll take him to medical quarters.
- Thanks, Mathesar.

562
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,357
Alex, where are you going?

563
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,400
To see if there's a pub!

564
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,622
Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

565
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,583
Aft vector guards, 96% damage.

566
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:31,005
Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 34, 40...

567
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,052
- What about the engines?
- Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

568
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:40,098
Computer, what about the engines?
Why don't we have power?

569
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,309
The beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress.

570
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,728
It's fractured.

571
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,565
Can it be repaired?

572
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,775
Computer, can it be repaired?

573
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,736
Damage to
beryllium sphere irreparable.

574
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,239
New source of beryllium
must be secured.

575
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,907
We need another one.

576
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,994
You broke the ship.
You broke the bloody ship!

577
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:11,087
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

578
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,967
Negative. No reserve
beryllium sphere exists on board.

579
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,762
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

580
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,140
You know, that is
really getting annoying!

581
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,976
Look, I have one job on this lousy ship.

582
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,605
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay?

583
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,356
Sure, no problem.

584
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,284
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

585
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,286
How have you failed us?

586
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,082
We have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations.

587
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,669
The fault must lie with us, with the ship.

588
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,256
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

589
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,093
It's my fault. We screwed...

590
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,680
We are not the people you think we are.

591
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,515
I don't understand.

592
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:15,360
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theater? Films?

593
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,821
The historical documents
of your culture. Yes, in fact,

594
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,158
we have begun to document
our history from your example.

595
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:26,037
No, not historical documents.
They're not all historical documents.

596
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,916
I mean, surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

597
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,461
Those poor people.

598
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,297
Oh, brother.

599
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,842
We're screwed.

600
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,806
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way

601
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,225
that's contrary to reality?

602
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,187
You are speaking of...

603
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,981
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

604
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,026
We have only recently
become aware of this concept

605
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,070
in our dealings with Sarris.

606
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,115
Often, Sarris will say
one thing and do another.

607
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,867
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.

608
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,955
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great cost.

609
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,082
But if you are saying that any of you

610
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,960
could have traits
in common with Sarris...

611
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:28,891
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

612
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:35,440
And we might be able to get there
if we reconfigure the solar matrix

613
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,735
in parallel for endothermic propulsion.

614
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,486
What do you think?

615
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,743
- We'll do that!
- All right!

616
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,665
That's right again. That's...
Come on, group hug. Come on.

617
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,973
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

618
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:13,227
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

619
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,855
I have studied
your missions extensively.

620
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,275
Though I am Thermian,
I have lived my life by your philosophy,

621
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,360
by the code of the Mak'tar.

622
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,697
Good, that's very nice.

623
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,616
By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus...

624
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,619
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was only...

625
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,037
Just don't.

626
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,665
Yes, sir.

627
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,886
Never give up. Never surrender.

628
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,355
Dr. Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

629
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,982
I have programmed it
to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere

630
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,693
of sufficient density.

631
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,112
Good luck on your mission, sir.

632
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,865
Thanks.

633
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,876
You're doing good, Tommy.

634
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,385
I changed my mind. I want to go back.

635
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,555
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

636
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,516
Yeah, but that's when I thought I was
the crewman that stays on the ship

637
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,852
and something is up there
then it kills me.

638
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,104
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster

639
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,981
five minutes after we land on the planet!

640
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,108
You're not gonna die on the planet, Guy.

641
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,861
I'm not? Then what's my last name?

642
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,030
It's... I don't know.

643
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,867
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

644
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,703
Because my character isn't important
enough for a last name.

645
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,372
Because I'm gonna die five minutes in.

646
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,292
Guy, you have a last name.

647
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,587
- Do I? Do I?
- Yes!

648
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:07,008
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

649
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:11,137
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

650
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,638
Are we there yet?

651
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,433
- Mommy!
- Tommy!

652
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,394
- Look out!
- Oh, no! Pull out!

653
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,104
Oh, yeah!

654
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,357
Come on. Oh, boy! Come on.

655
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,959
Hey! Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

656
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,378
Is there air? You don't know!

657
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,054
Seems okay.

658
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,695
Here we go.

659
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,577
Which way, Alexander?

660
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,377
This way!

661
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,713
Wait. No.

662
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,220
That way.

663
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,472
- You were holding it upside down.
- Shut up.

664
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,765
You know,
with all that makeup and stuff,

665
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,684
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.

666
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,686
You think you could do better, Laredo?

667
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,981
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- We're screwed. We're so screwed.

668
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,857
Come on, come on, come on.
If we want to finish this mission,

669
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,401
we have to use some self-control.

670
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,487
Self-control?
That's funny coming from a guy

671
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,865
who slept with every Terrakian slave girl
and moon princess on the show.

672
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,742
Did it ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive

673
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,911
we might have been able...

674
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,916
Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

675
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,585
Where are the miners?

676
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,423
- Something bad happened here.
- Will you relax?

677
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:18,389
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

678
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,419
Look at that. Would you look at that?

679
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,798
They look like little children.

680
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,552
Could they be the miners?

681
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,722
Sure, they're like, three years old.

682
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,935
Miners, not minors!

683
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,104
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

684
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,566
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

685
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,528
Sure, they're cute now, but in a second,
they're gonna get mean.

686
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,113
They're gonna get ugly somehow,

687
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,200
then there's gonna be
a million more of them.

688
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,161
Look. There's a little hurt one.

689
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,756
Hi. Hi there.

690
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,594
Did you guys ever watch the show?

691
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,017
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

692
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,362
I'm so sick of being right.

693
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,572
Let's get out of here
before one of those things kills Guy.

694
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,659
Wait a minute! We're not going
anywhere without a beryllium sphere.

695
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,702
We need a plan.
Fred, I need a diversion

696
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,496
to clear the compound of those things.

697
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,873
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.

698
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,999
Tommy, get up on that ridge.

699
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,127
If you see them come back
give me a signal, all right?

700
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,920
Why does this sound so familiar?

701
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,631
"Assault on Voltareck lll," episode 81.

702
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,467
- We're doing episode 81?
- Whatever. The one with the hologram.

703
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,719
- The wall of fire.
- Well, how the hell is Fred

704
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,638
supposed to project a hologram?

705
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,474
- Are we doing episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan, Guy.

706
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,476
What difference does it make
if it's episode 81 or not?

707
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,020
'Cause I died in episode 81.

708
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,522
- Episode 51, right?
-51. 51.

709
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,650
This is ludicrous.
Why are you listening to this fellow?

710
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,154
May I remind you he's wearing
a costume, not a uniform.

711
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,074
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.

712
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,494
Look, they're gone.

713
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,955
- Where'd they go? Back inside?
- I don't know.

714
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,082
Nobody was watching?

715
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,792
All right, all right. Listen up.
Here's the plan.

716
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,961
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will go down and get a sphere.

717
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,880
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter
and Tommy, you're lookout.

718
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,299
You see anything at all,
you give us a signal, all right?

719
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,675
What kind of a signal?

720
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,220
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands like this.

721
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,433
What are you, an infant?
Look, we have these.

722
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,896
That. Sorry.

723
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,731
Let's go.

724
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,949
- Does the rolling help actually?
- It helps.

725
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,702
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

726
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,004
What?

727
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,300
Never give up. Never surrender.

728
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,219
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, shut up.

729
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,223
Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of them, Jason!

730
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,643
Run, Jason! Run!
They're coming! They're everywhere!

731
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,396
- They're everywhere!
- Jason, they're everywhere!

732
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,233
- They're everywhere!
- Come on, let's go!

733
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,402
- They're coming!
- Hurry!

734
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,824
- They're everywhere! Come on!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

735
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,077
Don't look back. Do not look back!

736
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,621
- Oh, God.
- We're not gonna make it!

737
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,791
Oh, God!

738
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,670
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

739
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,507
Go, go, go! Come on! Push it harder!
Let's go, Tommy!

740
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,759
I got it but it's gonna
take a few seconds.

741
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,386
I got it, I got it!

742
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,096
- Oh, yeah!
- Go ahead.

743
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,597
There's no time. Get in! Get in!

744
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,766
Come on. I've forgotten you've got
to be the hero, haven't you?

745
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:35,437
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight! Oh, no! Jason Nesmith...

746
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,065
Jason! Jason, come on! Hurry!

747
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,277
- I'm on it!
- Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

748
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,196
No, no, no! Jason, please!

749
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,117
- Tommy, stop the pod! He's not in!
- But I can't stop it, it's on autopilot!

750
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,827
- Go! Leave him!
- No!

751
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,881
Oh, right!

752
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,884
Of course, it's always about you, isn't it?

753
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:46,717
- Gorignak! Gorignak!
- Gorignak! Gorignak!

754
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,805
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

755
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,807
Yeah, Gwen, you got me.

756
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,018
- Thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

757
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,772
As a matter of fact, I have Gorignak
staring me in the face right now.

758
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,108
But you know what?
I think I can take him.

759
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:08,197
Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.

760
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,074
- The digital conveyor?
- Yes.

761
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,659
You mean
I'm gonna be diced into cubes

762
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,536
and sent up there in a million pieces?

763
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,581
- Right.
- Well, you know what?

764
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,459
I think I'll take my chance
with Gorignak.

765
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:25,381
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?

766
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,716
It has never been successfully tested.

767
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,969
- What did he say?
- Hold, please.

768
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,430
Theoretically the mechanism
is fully operational.

769
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,309
However it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.

770
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,895
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.

771
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:44,316
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.

772
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,569
I mean, I can't. I can supervise...

773
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,446
Jason, we're gonna test it.

774
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,449
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

775
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,368
Hey, I'm doing all right
with the pig lizard.

776
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,495
Please, Fred? And hurry.

777
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,669
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.

778
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,089
The operation of the conveyor is
much more art than science.

779
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,841
Stand back, Jason.

780
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,577
What? What was that?

781
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,829
- Nothing.
- I hear some squealing or something.

782
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:42,791
- Oh, no. Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

783
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,377
I heard that. It turned inside out?

784
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,133
And it exploded.

785
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:55,846
Did I just hear that that animal
turned inside out and then it exploded?

786
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,097
Hello?

787
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,059
Hold, please.

788
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,645
Hey, wait a minute, guys, guys.

789
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,690
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?

790
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,193
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

791
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:16,074
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!

792
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,915
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

793
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,709
What the hell you talking about?

794
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,386
Oh, darn.

795
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,775
Digitize me!

796
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,527
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys. Digitize me!

797
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,028
- Oh, no, not me.
- Come on, they...

798
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,530
They based it on your hand movements.

799
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,073
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

800
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,450
- No, no, no.
- I'm not the guy.

801
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,202
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen,
I'm Fred Kwan.

802
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,204
I'm not even...
Kwan's not even my real name.

803
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,456
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.

804
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,377
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

805
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,213
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!

806
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,965
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

807
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,926
Go for the mouth or the throat,
its vulnerable spots!

808
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,845
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!

809
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,224
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.

810
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,810
Can you form some sort of
rudimentary lathe?

811
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,145
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!

812
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,147
Alexander, you're my advisor.
Advise me!

813
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,192
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.

814
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,236
What is its motivation?

815
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:38,031
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

816
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,494
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.

817
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,456
Fred! Fred, can you hear me?
Fred, are you there?

818
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,002
- Kind of.
- You can do it, Fred! It's up to you!

819
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,297
Oh, no, no, no.
Jason, I'll just... I'll just mess it up.

820
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,674
You did it for four years on the show!
Do it now!

821
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,552
That was the show. I'm not that guy!

822
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:02,097
Fred, you never forgot a line!
You never missed a mark!

823
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,683
That's not me anymore man.

824
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,355
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.

825
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,319
You can do this, Fred! I know
in my heart you're gonna save my life.

826
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,488
- I am?
- No doubt about it, Fred.

827
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,532
Fred!

828
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,702
Fred, can you hear me?

829
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,413
Fred!

830
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,751
Fred? I don't want to die down here.

831
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,378
Digitize me, Fred!

832
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,675
Oh, wow.

833
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,678
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

834
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,064
I see you managed to get your shirt off.

835
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,695
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

836
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,199
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?

837
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:06,328
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Great! Engines and pods?

838
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,330
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

839
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,499
Well, crank this sucker up,
you could drop us off

840
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,959
and you guys can be back in
your home planet before supper.

841
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,379
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.

842
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,839
Sure you do. Family, friends. Come on!

843
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,925
We are all that is left.

844
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:30,227
- I didn't know that.
- Sir, I have raised the command deck.

845
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,693
Mathesar, meet us
up at the command deck.

846
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,944
Mathesar.

847
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,198
Mathesar! Quellek!

848
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,118
Why can't we reach them?

849
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:10,350
Commander. Thank God you're alive.

850
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,522
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

851
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:20,861
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

852
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,529
Leave him alone.

853
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,034
You wish to save the life of this man?

854
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,619
Yeah. Yes.

855
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:37,919
Then tell me, what does it do,
this Omega 13?

856
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,005
I don't know what it does.

857
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,510
I said I don't know!

858
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,433
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

859
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,394
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

860
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,521
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

861
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,941
Do you think I'm a fool?

862
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:04,237
That the Commander does not know
every bolt, every weld in his ship?

863
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,575
Prepare a tear harness

864
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,328
for the female.

865
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,040
No! Gwen, no!

866
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,834
You brute! Let go of me!

867
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,129
I'm not the Commander.

868
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,964
What did you say?

869
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,383
I said, "I'm not the Commander. "

870
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,012
Leave them alone.
There's no reason to hurt them.

871
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,598
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

872
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,394
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

873
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,315
Computer,

874
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,444
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

875
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,013
Wonderful.

876
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:20,272
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

877
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,899
Bravo!

878
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,527
Bravo.

879
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,738
This is a moment I will treasure.

880
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:33,159
Explain to him who you all really are.

881
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,038
Tell him!

882
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,001
Explain!

883
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:49,801
Mathesar, there's no such person
as Captain Taggart.

884
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:54,764
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am an actor.

885
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,560
We're all actors.

886
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,646
He doesn't understand.

887
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,526
Explain as you would a child.

888
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,033
We pretended.

889
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,998
We lied.

890
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:26,338
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

891
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,758
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I...

892
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:34,763
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

893
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,265
We don't have a ship.

894
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,059
But there it is.

895
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,148
That ship is that big.

896
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,276
But inside, I see many rooms.

897
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,072
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

898
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:56,910
Our beryllium sphere is wire
with plaster around it.

899
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,037
And our...

900
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,540
Our digital conveyor is...

901
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,127
...Christmas tree lights.

902
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,588
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

903
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,926
Just like me.

904
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,765
But why?

905
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,728
It's difficult to explain.

906
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,065
On our planet, we...

907
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:34,155
We pretend to entertain and...

908
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:41,079
Mathesar, I am so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

909
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,208
So now you know.

910
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:51,256
Lieutenant Lathe,
hardwire the reactor core to overload.

911
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,301
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

912
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,637
Sarris, what about my people?

913
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:01,599
Yes, far too simple a death for them,
isn't it?

914
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,937
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.

915
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,065
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

916
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,609
Son of a...

917
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,242
Release them

918
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,744
into space.

919
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:27,417
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

920
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,004
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

921
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,217
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

922
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,385
Hey!

923
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,721
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

924
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,182
Where's the happy ending, Jason?

925
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,727
"Never give up. Never surrender. "

926
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,111
Maybe it's about time
you just backed off,

927
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,572
you fin-headed monstrosity.

928
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:58,865
Jason.

929
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,617
You what?

930
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:04,204
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

931
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,956
you scene-stealing hack.

932
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,211
Oh, right!

933
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:17,967
Well, how does it feel, Jason?
Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!

934
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,887
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die just because of you!

935
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,847
- I told you to shut up!
- Both of you, get in there.

936
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,265
Hundreds to die,

937
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,977
just because you want to play
at being commander, you raving lunatic.

938
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,146
Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?

939
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,286
Look out, Jason!

940
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,872
Get his gun! Get the gun!

941
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,542
Take that!

942
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,101
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.
Did you see that?

943
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:11,479
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

944
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,361
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.

945
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,988
- Raving egomaniac?
- Wonder where I got that from?

946
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,489
Hey, guys.

947
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,409
Look.

948
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,331
They're suffocating.

949
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,591
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

950
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,011
Core implosion
estimated in eight minutes.

951
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:49,017
General, your transport
is ready for departure.

952
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:58,067
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

953
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:02,280
Core implosion
estimated in seven minutes.

954
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:07,202
- Computer, shut down the core.
- Unable.

955
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:12,498
Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.

956
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,500
All right, all right, listen up.
This is what we gotta do.

957
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,128
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to
the core and shut it down manually.

958
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,006
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve, shut it off,

959
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,424
before those Thermians run out of air.

960
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:22,759
Alexander, get to the barracks,

961
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,719
see if you can't wedge a door open
in case they can't do that.

962
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,512
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me?

963
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:27,639
What do I do?

964
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,475
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!

965
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,269
Practice driving.

966
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,064
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

967
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,483
- That's right.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason,

968
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,486
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

969
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,988
and unless you took a Learning Annex
course I don't know about,

970
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,824
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor, either.

971
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,078
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

972
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,834
Brandon, honey, the garbage.

973
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,920
Mother, I'm quite busy.

974
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,298
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

975
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,218
Just 10 more minutes, okay, Ma?
I promise.

976
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,693
Hello? Anybody there?

977
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:27,865
Hello?

978
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,869
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.

979
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:36,291
I play Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, NSEA Protector.

980
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,378
We accidentally traded voxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.

981
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:46,134
Commander, I see. Okay.

982
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,094
What's your name, son?

983
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,638
Brandon.

984
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,641
Brandon, I remember you.
From the convention, right?

985
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:57,061
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

986
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,230
and I was a little short with you.

987
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:03,818
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna...

988
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,571
I just wanted to tell you that
I thought a lot about what you said...

989
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,324
- It's okay. Now, listen.
- But I want you to know

990
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,118
that I'm not
a complete brain case, okay?

991
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:15,997
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

992
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,499
- Hold... Wait a minute...
- I know there's no beryllium sphere...

993
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,377
- Stop. Stop for a second. Stop. Wait.
- ... no digital conveyor, no ship.

994
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,795
It's all real.

995
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,798
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

996
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,844
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble
and we need your help.

997
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:35,016
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

998
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:39,187
Core implosion
estimated in six minutes.

999
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,484
Sir, it's you. Thank Ipthar.

1000
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:49,322
Quellek? What are you doing up there?

1001
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,370
I avoided capture
by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.

1002
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,705
Where is everyone?

1003
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,625
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

1004
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:07,465
All right, we're at level C, hallway five.
Now what?

1005
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:11,094
Go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1006
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,137
Now, that leads to
a system of utility corridors

1007
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,347
through the bowels of the ship.

1008
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,141
- Open.
- You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.

1009
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,977
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1010
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,773
38, 39, 40.

1011
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:30,738
All right. All we have to do
is turn off the valve to the barracks.

1012
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:36,786
Hi, Brandon.

1013
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,206
No time for pleasantries, Kyle.
We have a level 5 emergency.

1014
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,500
You've still got the utility systems
walk-through, right?

1015
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,962
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28.
I think Hollister has the upper levels.

1016
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,005
Great, we'll get everybody online.

1017
01:13:56,181 --> 01:14:00,268
- PedaI to the metaI, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

1018
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:06,607
General! I have just received word
that the commander of the Protector

1019
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,527
and his command crew
have escaped custody.

1020
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,571
What?

1021
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,992
Find them!

1022
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:19,662
But, sir! My men...
The core implosion is not reversible.

1023
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,039
Find them!

1024
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,793
All right, Brandon,
I see five ducts in this room.

1025
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,253
Which way do we go?

1026
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:32,467
Enter the passage second to your left,
and just continue straight for 50 meters.

1027
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,011
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

1028
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:37,346
There will be a slight drop.

1029
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:48,483
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?

1030
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,407
They're dying.

1031
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,493
Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing?

1032
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,495
- Yes.
- Don't look down.

1033
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,080
Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.

1034
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,165
What are you talking about?

1035
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,084
You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13!

1036
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,003
It must be spectacular.

1037
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:14,091
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls

1038
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,845
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single...

1039
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,655
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

1040
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:39,825
Many have believed
that it is a matter-collapser.

1041
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,955
A bomb capable of destroying pretty
much everything in about 13 seconds.

1042
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:49,502
But myself and others are convinced
that what it is is a matter-rearranger,

1043
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:52,338
effecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1044
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:53,381
Why 13 seconds?

1045
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:57,301
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1046
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:00,555
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1047
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,142
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

1048
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:10,231
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1049
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:14,652
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction.
I got this. I'm okay,

1050
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,030
I might be able to hold them back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1051
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,282
That's suicide.

1052
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,410
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.
I'm a dead man anyway.

1053
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:25,246
If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1054
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,500
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

1055
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,086
You ever think about that?

1056
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,255
- Plucky?
- Well, besides,

1057
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:37,133
I just had this really interesting idea.

1058
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,052
Are you stoned?

1059
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,765
Gotta get it open, give them some time.

1060
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,517
Sir, perhaps together,

1061
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,770
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
"Larak tarath. "

1062
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:53,024
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1063
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:58,195
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!

1064
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,497
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

1065
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,835
You want to take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1066
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:14,503
"The chompers"?

1067
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,469
Well, screw that.

1068
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,304
How are we supposed
to get through this?

1069
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,348
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

1070
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:30,394
Okay, the sequence is 2242...

1071
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,396
- What is this thing?
- ... 2242...

1072
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,148
I mean, there's no useful purpose
for there to be

1073
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,651
a bunch of chompy-crushy
things in the middle of a hallway!

1074
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,278
- Gwen! Gwen!
- No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.

1075
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,822
It makes no logical sense!
Why is it here?

1076
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,949
- 'Cause it's on the television show!
- Well, forget it!

1077
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:47,662
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1078
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,831
Okay, Commander, now,
as soon as the first crusher hits you...

1079
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:51,957
It just did!

1080
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,251
- Okay, go now.
- Go!

1081
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:55,920
Go!

1082
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,338
Stop!

1083
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:58,422
Go!

1084
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,093
Come on, come on, come on.

1085
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:08,599
Go!

1086
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:09,975
Go! Go!

1087
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,519
No, stop! Stop!

1088
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:12,812
Go!

1089
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,355
Stop! Wait a minute! No!

1090
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:17,400
I want you to jump, Commander, jump!

1091
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,111
Whoever wrote this episode should die!

1092
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,573
This should be interesting.

1093
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,596
It's the simple things
in life you treasure.

1094
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,684
That's great.

1095
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,604
Now, we better get...

1096
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,028
Hey, get a room, guys, okay?

1097
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:15,750
Hey, Fred.

1098
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,339
That's not right.

1099
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:54,371
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.

1100
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,958
Open!

1101
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,671
We are saved.

1102
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,965
He has saved us.

1103
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,469
Commander Taggart has saved us!

1104
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,601
It's just not fair.

1105
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,315
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the command deck.

1106
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,612
I'm... I'm shot.

1107
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,505
Quellek? Quellek?

1108
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,013
It's not too bad.

1109
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:57,017
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

1110
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,145
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.

1111
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,606
I have been blessed, sir. I...

1112
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,568
Don't speak, Quellek.

1113
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,449
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

1114
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,952
but even though
we had never before met,

1115
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,872
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1116
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:22,960
Quellek,

1117
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,464
by Grabthar's hammer,

1118
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,051
by the sons of Warvan,

1119
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,473
you shall be avenged.

1120
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:17,348
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!

1121
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,934
All right, Brandon, I'm here.
How do I shut this thing down?

1122
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,602
Okay, just push the blue button.

1123
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:24,438
- The blue button? Is that it?
- Yeah, why, what's wrong?

1124
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:28,233
Nothing, I just thought
it'd be more complicated than that.

1125
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,905
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.

1126
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:45,668
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!

1127
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,506
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

1128
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:54,051
- of the Commander's predicament.
- Don't forget the recyclables!

1129
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:58,347
Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.

1130
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,600
-9,8...
- Gwen, I...

1131
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,519
- ... 7,6...
- I've always...

1132
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,313
- ... 5,4...
- Jason, Jason.

1133
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,233
...3,2,1.

1134
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,620
It always stops at one on the show.

1135
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,248
What were you saying?

1136
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,208
- Sir!
- What?

1137
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:29,420
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.

1138
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,880
Impossible! Impossible!

1139
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:36,427
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

1140
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,929
Tear her apart!

1141
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,024
He's finished, he's finished.

1142
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,610
Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.

1143
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:57,823
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.

1144
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,326
We need that armor back up!

1145
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:05,622
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armor engaged.

1146
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,543
All right, Tommy, see if you can't
lose them in that minefield.

1147
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,087
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal, right now!

1148
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,381
- Pedal to the metal!
- All right, let's go!

1149
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,769
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

1150
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,271
Thrust ahead, full!

1151
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,399
Into the field, go!

1152
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:41,992
Tommy, can you get us closer
to these mines?

1153
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,327
Closer?

1154
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,832
I could try.

1155
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,924
General, I've lost them.

1156
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:01,428
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

1157
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,681
Wait! I see something.

1158
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,602
Yes. Yes! There they are.

1159
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:11,188
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1160
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:14,775
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1161
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,944
Fire at will.

1162
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:26,120
We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

1163
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,123
No! Divert all energy to the armor!

1164
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,707
How adorable!

1165
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:34,378
The actors
are going to play war with me.

1166
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:37,464
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us
at mark two.

1167
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,258
Accelerate to mark four.

1168
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:46,557
Let me remind you, sonny,

1169
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,560
I am a general.

1170
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:56,275
If you are counting on me to blink,
then you are making a deadly mistake.

1171
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:59,987
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.

1172
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:03,490
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognize a bad one.

1173
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,659
You're sweating!

1174
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:07,661
Armor almost gone, Jason!

1175
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:12,916
You fool! You fail to realize
that with your armor gone,

1176
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:17,129
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1177
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:22,301
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.

1178
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,639
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

1179
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,532
- Yes!
- Yes!

1180
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,913
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1181
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,791
This is fantastic!

1182
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:01,798
Mathesar!

1183
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:05,177
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1184
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,512
Come here.

1185
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:11,099
"The ship was a model as big as this. "

1186
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:14,353
A very clever deception indeed.

1187
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:26,281
Set a course for home, Commander?

1188
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:29,034
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, it's just point and click.

1189
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:31,078
But we're going to have to go through
the black hole, though.

1190
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,746
Any objections?

1191
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,707
All right, set her up.

1192
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,506
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1193
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,510
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1194
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:50,347
My people have no commander.

1195
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,186
Mathesar, I think your people
have a great commander,

1196
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,355
sir.

1197
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:09,533
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.

1198
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,968
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1199
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:30,012
Systems register functional.

1200
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:32,097
All systems are working, Commander.

1201
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:34,016
Jason, before the black hole,

1202
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,476
there was an energy surge
from Sarris' ship.

1203
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,479
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander.

1204
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,399
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we...

1205
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:46,069
Hey, you know,
you could put an eye out with that thing.

1206
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,198
Fred?

1207
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,257
No!

1208
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,992
Mathesar!

1209
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,953
Activate the Omega 13!

1210
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,980
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1211
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,359
Systems register functional.

1212
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:09,403
All systems are working, Commander.

1213
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,363
Jason, before the black hole,

1214
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:14,324
there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1215
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:20,122
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1216
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:23,583
Let go of me. Let... It's not Fred!

1217
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,585
That's Sarris. Listen to me!

1218
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,004
I'm telling you, it's not Fred,
that's Sarris!

1219
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,507
He's gonna try to kill all of us!

1220
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,351
Never give up. Never surrender.

1221
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:46,273
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!

1222
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:49,151
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.

1223
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,695
We need to separate, or we'll die.

1224
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:59,870
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.

1225
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,206
Crew to the secondary deck.

1226
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:06,501
Mathesar!

1227
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,591
Goodbye, my friends.

1228
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:21,725
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

1229
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,586
On, Teb, on!

1230
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,137
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,

1231
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:03,934
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,

1232
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:06,895
much to the disappointment
of all these fans.

1233
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,313
Bye. Be back soon!

1234
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:11,691
Well... Wait. Brandon, where are you
going with all those fireworks?

1235
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,778
The Protectorgot super-accelerated
coming out of the black hole

1236
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,072
and it's, like, nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

1237
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:20,200
which, you guys know,
is pretty unstable, obviously,

1238
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:23,453
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it
on the vox ultra-frequency carrier

1239
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,748
and use Roman candles
for visual confirmation.

1240
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:29,000
All right, dinner's at 7:00.

1241
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:33,922
Well, he's outside.

1242
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:06,097
Lieutenant Laredo, Tommy Webber!

1243
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,060
Hi, Tommy!

1244
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:15,565
The beautiful Tawny Madison,
Gwen DeMarco!

1245
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:20,445
Yes!

1246
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,239
Wow, what effects!

1247
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:28,203
Another shipmate!
Yes, the more, the merrier!

1248
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:34,209
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen,
Fred Kwan, and a friend.

1249
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:39,506
Dr. Lazarus, Alexander Dane!

1250
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:43,259
Give him a big hand. He's British!
Yes, sir!

1251
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:48,598
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
Jason Nesmith!

1252
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:00,110
Great driving, Tommy.

1253
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,945
Yes! Yes!

1254
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,330
Quick, quick! Go, go! Move, move!

1255
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:23,550
Once again,
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,

1256
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:25,343
Mr. Jason Nesmith!

1257
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:33,101
Come on, give it up for the crew,
the NSEA Protector!

1258
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:36,730
True love! Yes!

1259
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:39,983
Wow!

1260
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:42,986
Come on!

1261
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:48,616
They're here for you, folks. Come on!

1262
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:50,660
What a show!

1263
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,038
What a show! Yes!

1264
01:35:57,042 --> 01:36:00,086
Yes! Give it up! Wow!

1265
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,049
Come on, give it up! Give it all up

1266
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:09,471
for the crew of your favorite show,
Galaxy Quest! Wow!

1267
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,601
Come on, come on!

1268
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:29,157
Don't forget to buy a Galaxy Quest
T- shirt on your way out. Thank you.

1269
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,126
And now, back again after 18 years,
the new adventures ofGalaxy Quest.

1270
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:58,778
Never give up. Never surrender.

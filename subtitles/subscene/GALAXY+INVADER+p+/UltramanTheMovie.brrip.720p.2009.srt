1
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,377
From a distant star they came.

2
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,047
A brotherhood of heroes.
Their names are legend ...

3
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,193
Ultraman!

4
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,896
Ultra Seven!

May
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,301
Ultraman Jack!

6
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,337
Ace!

7
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,874
Taro!

8
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,345
The Ultra Brothers!

9
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,017
Born in the nebula known as M78,

10
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,154
they fight for peace and justice
throughout the galaxy.

11
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,157
Warriors great
compassion and courage.

12
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,026
Over time ...

13
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,897
part of humanity to the stars.

14
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:23,203
Pioneers Astronomical Zeta,
development experts planetary

15
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:26,673
begin to explore the universe
looking for resources.

16
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,943
But soon they find
Fierce battles

17
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:34,548
with terrible monsters,
the scourge of the galaxy.

18
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,684
Ray, a half-human warrior
and half-alien Raybrad.

19
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:42,623
He is one who has the power Rayonix
to control certain monsters.

20
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,993
With them, he fights for peace

21
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,729
while battling his
bloodthirsty nature.

22
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,432
With the fate of
universe in the balance,

23
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,671
a great new challenge awaits
humanity and Ultramans.

24
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,073
The legend begins now ...

25
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,223
MEGA MONSTERS BATTLE
ULTRA GALAXY LEGENDS

26
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,890

27
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:31,726

POLICE HEADQUARTERS SPACE

32
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,638
I'm back.

33
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,840
Well, Mebius.

34
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,176
The energy is negative ...

35
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,945
waving monsters.

36
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,581
I have a bad feeling.

37
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,085
Many planets have been affected.

38
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,888
Ice, Ace and 80 were
sent to investigate.

39
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:57,357
We have to find
what is causing this.

40
00:05:57,392 --> 00:06:02,496
A horde of monsters agitated
would be hard ... even for us.

41
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,631
Maybe we should send ... he?

42
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,437
No, not yet.

43
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,339
It? You mean ...

44
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,678
There is an increased flow
Nucleus of Energy.

45
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,522
People, keep alert.

46
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,494
This can be ...

47
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,002
PRISON SPACE

48
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,633
Who goes there?

49
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,967
Do not move!

50
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,945
Good and powerful.

51
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:44,765
Ultra Black Warrior
locked for eternity!

52
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:49,469
He will serve me well!

53
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,606
Belial!

54
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,641
Ultraman Belial!

55
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,012
A shadow living in the Land of Light!

56
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:35,616
Reine this universe to me!

57
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,120
Here, cunningly stolen
Valley of Flames,

58
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,222
Giga-Battlenizer!

59
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,258
Stolen?

60
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,004
I got it!
This universe is ours!

61
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,715
This is true.

62
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,723
Damn.

63
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,991
Belial! Stay where you are!

64
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,993
You go back to prison!

65
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,399
I'll have a good heating.

66
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:26,533
Come on!

67
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,609
Ultra signal Taro!

68
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,344
It was what I feared.

69
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:41,114
There was an escape from
Prison Space!

70
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,384
He's behind the Tower Rais Plasma!

71
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,187
We have to protect
the tower at all cost!

72
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,488
Come on!

73
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,590
Yes!

74
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,509
This is the best they can do?

75
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,077
You bore me to death.

76
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,746
Try me!

77
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,918
Belial! Do not forgive!

78
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,320
This one has more spirit!

79
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,956
Strium Kousen!

80
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,314
Taro!

81
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,484
I'm back!

82
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,600
This is terrible!

83
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,289
Take this!

84
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,970
You too!

85
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,774
Idiots!

86
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,099
Hikari!

87
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,580
Mebius!

88
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,360
I will level the city!

89
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,463
Belial, enough!

90
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,499
You'll have to go through us!

91
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,701
He should never have come back.

92
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,837
You talk a lot.

93
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,451
Are you okay?

94
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,473
Personal! Fusion-ray!

95
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,442
Finally ...

96
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,548
Stop it already gone too far.

97
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,249
Get your hands off me!

98
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,020
Belial!

99
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,122
The Spirit of Ultra Warrior in you
is truly lost.

100
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:39,726
I want the supreme power in the universe.

101
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:43,497
With the supreme power, the New Order
to be my creation!

102
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,980
Take this!

103
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:34,848
Stop!

104
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,620
- Taro!
- Taro!

105
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,498
And so it falls into the old guard ...

106
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,633
Taro!

107
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,238
Taro! Get up, Taro!

108
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,355
You're fine.

109
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:25,165
Finally it will be mine!

110
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,843
And so begins my reign!

111
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,956
No. .. I will not kill him.

112
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,560
Keep looking forever
their fallen people.

113
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,828
Belial ...

114
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,496
Hilarious!

115
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:41,441
If the light fade
the planet will die!

116
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,678
It is up to me to keep him alive.

117
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,085
Planet Ultra reborn.

118
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,088
Until then, I will protect this light!

119
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,156
Taro!

120
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:12,806
Our son ... is
protecting the last light.

121
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,974
Yes.

122
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,945
There is still hope.

123
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,606
Can not be ...

124
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,007
Mebius!

125
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,141
Are you okay?

126
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,879
Not much time left.

127
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,081
How do we beat?

128
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:58,285
The power of Ultra alone
will not be enough.

129
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,554
But through it ...

130
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:01,255
It?

131
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:05,526
Rayonix a human ... he
share the blood of Belial!

132
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:06,994
Rayonix? "

133
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:11,865
He's kind Raybrad. He has
power to control monsters.

134
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,069
Maybe it will help us
to defeat Belial.

135
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,706
Where do I find?

136
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,846
Come on, Space Pendragon.

137
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:30,817
Musashi! Long time!

138
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,520
Lord Hyuga, you look good.

139
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:37,090
I see you are on the route
for the planet Dent.

140
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:41,528
It is very similar to Earth and can
become a foothold for humanity.

141
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:44,298
I hear it's beautiful.

142
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,968
But there is no sign of any monster.

143
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,703
So boring!

144
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,738
What do you want?

145
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,708
We deliver cargo,
not hunt monsters.

146
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:55,876
I know!

147
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:56,977
I do not think you know ...

148
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,845
I know!

149
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,347
A planet like the Earth ...

150
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:08,069
Planet Dent: All clear. Landing.
PLANET DENT

151
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,503
Really nice.

152
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,239
Ray

153
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,109
It is much like Earth.

154
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,713
Oxygen is so yummy!

155
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:39,753
Meteorite?

156
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,855
Guys, beware!

157
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:49,563
That's Zaragosa!
What are you doing here?

158
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,103
Fire!

159
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,786
Are you okay?

160
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,523
I'll take care of the rest!

161
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,025
Ray!

162
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,900
Battlenizer Monsload!

163
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,576
Go, Gomora!

164
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,370
We will provide coverage!

165
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,371
Yes, sir!

166
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,547
Ray needs help!

167
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:50,817
Attacking it only makes you stronger!

168
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,319
So what do we do?

169
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,721
When in power-up,

170
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,590
it freezes for a moment!

171
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:00,894
We will have to strike when the moment
when this happens.

172
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:04,865
Ok! Pendragon, take off!

173
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:05,899
Ok!

174
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:13,807
Ray, come in!

175
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:14,741
Boss!

176
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:17,077
Oki has a plan.

177
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:22,916
Distracted for Zaragosa
you destroy it!

178
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,318
Understood!

179
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,420
Missile Wyvern!

180
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,656
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

181
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,765
Now!

182
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:05,492
Super Wave Swing!

183
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,004
Cool!

184
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:19,139
He has improved!

185
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,942
As a hero!

186
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:28,882
Gomora, very well!

187
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,019
Come back!

188
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,134
Ultraman!

189
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,468
Mebius!

190
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,504
Ultraman Mebius!

191
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,072
He looks hurt!

192
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,186
Ray!

193
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:10,624
What ...

194
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:14,795
What happened?

195
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,271
Where am I?

196
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:28,675
Ultraman?

197
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,011
No, it's not!

198
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,582
I can feel ...

199
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,885
Rayonix!

200
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,119
No way!

201
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,923
His name is Belial.

202
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,892
Who is it?

203
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:49,162
He is a demon that will leave
worlds in ruins.

204
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,604
We must stop him.

205
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,673
I'm Mirai Hibino.

206
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,675
Hibino ...

207
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,310
Mirai?

208
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,914
Rayonix human ... Ray

209
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,116
We need your help.

210
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,254
A long time ago ...

211
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:18,725
Raybrad was an alien ...
a creature with great power.

212
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,396
A black minister who
terrorized the universe

213
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,798
with his flock of monsters.

214
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:28,035
You have the DNA of the people Raybrad.

215
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,871
He has been a long time.

216
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,974
The battle ended Rayonix.

217
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:38,278
I got rid of my destiny.

218
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:43,217
There is a mission that
only you can do.

219
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,890
Let me show you
truth of my planet.

220
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,267
This is ...

221
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:05,873
Nebula M78, my house
to 270,000 years ago ...

222
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:07,875
Planet Ultra.

223
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:15,449
Our ancestors looked like
much with humans.

224
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,084
But ...

225
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:23,457
The sun!

226
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:27,861
The planet quiet
faced his end.

227
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,597
But they never surrendered.

228
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:34,568
After many years of research,

229
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,971
our greatest minds together
created the Tower of Lightning Plasma.

230
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,874
An artificial sun.

231
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,312
Our new history began.

232
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:51,084
The energies in the transformed

233
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:53,887
and gave us great powers.

234
00:30:57,157 --> 00:31:01,428
The beginning of Ultramans!

235
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:03,664
We use these powers

236
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,667
to fight for universal peace

237
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:11,004
But there was one ...

238
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,574
A large Ultra ...
young, strong ...

239
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,010
and ambitious.

240
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,681
In their search for higher
powers, he tried

241
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:24,518
catch the energy of the plasma radius.

242
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:34,161
But it was too much for him.

243
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,701
He was exiled from the Land of Light

244
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:45,472
So that's the best deal with them?

245
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:46,740
Who is it?

246
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,243
I'm Raybrad

247
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:52,412
I reign the universe.

248
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,082
I'll give you the power you seek.

249
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:01,088
No, stop!

250
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,156
That's it.

251
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:07,694
The birth of
Ultra Black Warrior, Belial.

252
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:12,399
Giga-Battlenizer can
control 100 monsters.

253
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:14,001
A deadly weapon.

254
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:20,974
Now, the all powerful Belial had
revenge against the Land of Light!

255
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:23,177
Go! Attack!

256
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,748
Belial! Destroy everything!

257
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:33,754
Eliminate Ultramans and
Destroy the Land of Light!

258
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,724
Personal flee! Now!

259
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,259
Belial!

260
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:40,928
Zoffy!

261
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:54,408
Mary, seeing as I become
King of the Galaxy!

262
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:56,610
We will not allow!

263
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,045
Really?

264
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:00,814
Stop!

265
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:02,115
Ken!

266
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,483
You!

267
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:06,186
This is your home!

268
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:07,167
Home?

269
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:11,892
All this means nothing to me!

270
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:15,562
I came back for revenge!

271
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,240
You're finished!

272
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:43,924
Belial! He who dishonors
the Land of Light!

273
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,225
Ultraman King!

274
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:54,401
Stop! Let me go!

275
00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:58,138
You pay for your
sins in the dark!

276
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,911
Forever!

277
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:09,183
The King held Belial
Prison Space.

278
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:12,719
And sealed the Giga-Battlenizer
Valley of Flames.

279
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,488
The Land of Light ..

280
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,324
lady had a history.

281
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:24,097
Now and again Belial
Land of Light is dying.

282
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:28,669
The entire universe
it will be soon!

283
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:35,409
We have to stop him!

284
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:40,247
You, a Rayonix, and we
Warriors Ultra ...

285
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,950
together we can defeat
the strongest of enemies.

286
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,118
Please fight me!

287
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:53,794
Okay ... will be honored.

288
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:58,065
To protect my team, no ...

289
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,435
to protect this universe!

290
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,271
Take me with you!

291
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,306
To the Land of Light!

292
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,841
Come on!

293
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:19,119
PORTAL TOMB

294
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:28,195
The Munsters BURIED

295
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:40,340
I let them make messes again!

296
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:58,125
Come back to life! Monsters!

297
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:37,397
My Monster Battalion returned!

298
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,572
What is this place?

299
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,508
The Land of Light

300
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,309
But she is ..

301
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:07,728
Mirai, what should we do?

302
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:34,121
That's ...

303
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,863
Dorako! And Bemstar!

304
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,938
Saramandra too!

305
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:03,884
Mirai!

306
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,771
Alien Shaplay!

307
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,107
So .. some of you survived.

308
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:28,842
Belial sent?

309
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,143
Correct.

310
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,683
I'll catch them!

311
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:55,469
Ray-san!

312
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:16,623
Damn!

313
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:56,763
Stand!

314
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:00,634
Ray-san!

315
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:05,572
Windom! Act! Micle! Go!

316
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,093
You are ...

317
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:36,870
I'll kill you first!

318
00:40:58,825 --> 00:40:59,660
Yes!

319
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,239
Hunt them down!

320
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:48,842
Incredible!

321
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:56,917
Micle! Windom! Act! Come back!

322
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,528
You two have survived!

323
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:08,362
Yes.

324
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:10,330
You're back, Mebius.

325
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:11,999
Ray

326
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,501
How long.

327
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,537
Glad you came.

328
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,072
You are ...

329
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,176
Ultraman?

330
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:25,212
E. ..

331
00:42:26,346 --> 00:42:27,414
Ultra Seven?

332
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:34,555
We do not have enough energy to
Ultra maintain our ways.

333
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,324
We are caught in this way.

334
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,459
No way.

335
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:42,429
Mebius, which was feared came out in force.

336
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:45,799
Monsters of the Cemetery
Revived monsters!

337
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,837
He used the power of the Tower
Lightning Plasma.

338
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,473
He used our power to do so?

339
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,943
Let's go to the Tower!

340
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,550
Inside the Tower,

341
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:08,355
Ultraman Taro remains
protecting the light they can.

342
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:15,195
The light may be the last chance for our
Heroes return to form of Ultraman.

343
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:22,002
Your mind wanders, brother.
It can be very helpful.

344
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,139
Hey, it's a great idea.
We should get him!

345
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,443
No, we can not even
achieve it as well.

346
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:30,777
It?

347
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:35,549
A young fighter with
unlimited potential!

348
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,527
K76 PLANET

349
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:16,757
Damn! I can not do
anything in this armor!

350
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:18,759
Part of your training!

351
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,695
Be patient!

352
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:39,813
Damn!

353
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,960
Stay away.

354
00:44:57,397 --> 00:45:01,468
I can still beat him ...
even in this rattletrap!

355
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,555
I left him with Leo.

356
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:27,027
We can not see it until
that your training ends.

357
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,462
Why not?

358
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:34,134
Once, he was also behind
the energy of the plasma radius.

359
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:38,038
He was young, immature.
Tempted by power.

360
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:42,042
He almost lost his soul to evil.

361
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,945
Just as Belial.

362
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,313
Stop!

363
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:48,315
Why?

364
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:50,617
Stay away from it!

365
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:52,586
You're not ready!

366
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:56,790
Do not underestimate me!
I'm ready!

367
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:58,225
Do not move!

368
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:02,162
You are violating the law Ultra.

369
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:05,098
Come with us!

370
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:06,400
Let me go!

371
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:07,901
Be quiet!

372
00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:09,436
Let me go!

373
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:15,008
You are no longer qualified
Warrior as Ultra.

374
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:22,282
That was the hardest thing
I've had to do.

375
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:26,353
He was too young to realize

376
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:29,690
the danger of power without justice.

377
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,965
The danger of power without justice.

378
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:06,426
You only believe in physical force.

379
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,696
This is not the true strength!

380
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:11,665
Shut up!

381
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,667
Stop rambling!

382
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:26,647
Brother Taro, hold on!

383
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:28,782
Beware!

384
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:36,156
Still not finished!

385
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,824
Go, Blackking!

386
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:43,397
Damn! I can not transform!

387
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,766
Let me!

388
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,941
Battlenizer Monsload!

389
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,580
Attack! Gomora!

390
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:08,222
Go ahead!

391
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,858
Ray-san, thank you!

392
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:02,075
Taro ...

393
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,284
Finished!

394
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,219
We'll take care of it.

395
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:45,252
Now, Mirai!

396
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:46,019
Yes!

397
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:00,434
Gomora, Super Wave Swing!

398
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,956
Ultra Willpower!

399
00:50:45,946 --> 00:50:47,881
Immense energy.

400
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:58,125
Use my power ... save us!

401
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:17,010
This is our last chance.

402
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:23,217
The Planet Ultra will perish if not
recover the Center of Energy.

403
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,519
We have to defeat Belial.

404
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:30,057
Come to the Graveyard of Monsters!

405
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:54,281
Mebius!

406
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:23,277
I will use them and
the universe will be king!

407
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:33,287
What?

408
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,259
Belial!

409
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,362
We are here to stop this.

410
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,299
Still alive, huh?

411
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:47,801
Who are you?

412
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,336
I am Ray

413
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,505
A Rayonix Earth!

414
00:52:52,272 --> 00:52:55,509
Interesting! We are brothers!

415
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,377
We're different!

416
00:52:57,744 --> 00:52:58,879
How so?

417
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:04,718
I fight for my team, for peace!

418
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,455
Useless folly!

419
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,325
You're a disgrace Raybrad.

420
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:15,596
I will like to watch
you all die!

421
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:18,832
Go! 100 Monsload!

422
00:53:51,698 --> 00:53:53,367
Attack!

423
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:02,676
The Center for Energy!

424
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,182
Mebius, you know what to do.

425
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:09,082
Yes!

426
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:12,286
Gomora! Cover the Mebius!

427
00:54:32,806 --> 00:54:34,274
Come on, Gomora!

428
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:03,290
Ray was with that
Ultraman ... for M78?

429
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:04,658
Yes, sir!

430
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:07,995
The planet's Ultraman!
We also must go!

431
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:12,032
He is 3 million light years.

432
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:16,236
Would take decades to get there.

433
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:18,071
Really.

434
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:20,574
Something is approaching!

435
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:32,619
Enemy?

436
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:33,487
Fugitive!

437
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:36,123
Stay away from my Pendragon!

438
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,961
A ship? From where?

439
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:45,899
Return fire!

440
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:48,335
Missile Wyvern! Shoot!

441
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:49,336
Shoot!

442
00:57:58,011 --> 00:57:58,745
Pick!

443
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,081
No, stay alert!

444
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:02,149
It is ...

445
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,330
It's not a ship!

446
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,298
Dragon Space Nurse!

447
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:19,666
A monster!

448
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,035
Is winding us!

449
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:25,172
Will crush our ship!

450
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:26,540
Damn!

451
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:29,443
Freeze!

452
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:33,814
Human surrender immediately!

453
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:36,683
Alien Z-Ton!
Why are you here?

454
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:39,286
To delete you.

455
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:44,424
May be able to join your partner
Monster in the Graveyard.

456
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:45,993
A Graveyard of Monsters?

457
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,637
Damn, who are you?

458
00:58:57,337 --> 00:59:01,341
Alien Z-ton, his
quarrel is with me now.

459
00:59:28,368 --> 00:59:30,838
What did you think of my
Waddle ultra thin?

460
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,109
Are you okay?

461
00:59:37,277 --> 00:59:38,545
Thank you.

462
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:41,281
Are you?

463
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,884
I am Shin Asuka.

464
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,385
Asuka?

465
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:51,225
I was known on Earth
as Ultraman Dyna.

466
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:55,195
Ultraman Dyna!?

467
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,764
Great. Maybe you can help us.

468
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:00,267
We need to get to
Graveyard of Monsters!

469
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:03,237
To save our partner!

470
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:06,874
This is serious.

471
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,579
Ok! I will lead them to
Graveyard of Monsters!

472
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,787
Damn! Looks like someone

473
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:25,225
first go to the graveyard!

474
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:29,796
Dyna!

475
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,485
Are safe now.

476
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:58,825
Ok Let's go to the Cemetery
Dyna Ultraman monsters.

477
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,427
And save the Ray!

478
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:01,929
Ok!

479
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:27,421
Show you how
a real monster fight.

480
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:57,050
He will be a problem.

481
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,128
Mebius!

482
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,084
Gomora, Litra, go!

483
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:49,403
Stay down!

484
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:59,780
Rayonix Earth! Listen.

485
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:02,783
Your place is with me ... brother.

486
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,254
Together we can govern
the universe will.

487
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,089
Never. We will defeat you.

488
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,758
You can fight me.

489
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:15,796
But can not fight
against what you are.

490
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:16,797
What?

491
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:24,071
Show me your true power!

492
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:28,475
You'll pay for this! Belial!

493
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:49,029
The perverse nature of Raybrad!

494
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:58,805
Finally. Your true self!

495
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:03,710
Use this power and end
Ultra with the Warriors!

496
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:06,547
Personnel ... back.

497
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:19,226
Ray-san!

498
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:24,331
Attack!

499
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,745
Destroy! Kill!

500
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:02,302
That's right! Mate Ultra Seven!

501
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:05,906
Stop!

502
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,815
Who is that?

503
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:15,883
That's ...

504
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:24,958
My god. It is a gathering of monsters.

505
01:05:27,628 --> 01:05:29,096
I caught the leader.

506
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:36,937
Ray!

507
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,872
Ray was lost!

508
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:40,574
We have to stop him!

509
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:43,110
Haruna, we landed!

510
01:05:44,478 --> 01:05:46,046
Land! Here?

511
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,781
Ok!

512
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:04,565
Ray, come on!
Come to light!

513
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:10,938
Ray!

514
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:20,681
Get out!

515
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:42,336
Ray! Come back to us! Please!

516
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:43,637
Ray!

517
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:47,341
You're one of us, Ray!

518
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:52,513
We're your family, Ray!
Not him ... us!

519
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:26,413
Hear my voice, Ray Hear me!

520
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:55,576
Head ...

521
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,184
Humans! How dare they intefere?

522
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:07,688
No!

523
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:12,626
Brother!

524
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:13,594
Seven!

525
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:22,903
Seven was ...

526
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:31,745
Kill him.

527
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,122
Our last hope.

528
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,035
Imbecile!

529
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,188
That was close.

530
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:49,823
Find a safe place.

531
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,964
I glad you're okay.

532
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:05,138
Now, where were we?

533
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:06,006
Wait!

534
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,375
Wait? Is surrendering?

535
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:12,279
You just saved a little life.

536
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:14,414
So what?

537
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:18,085
Shut up and let's finish this!

538
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:19,520
Zero ...

539
01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:22,656
do you remember?

540
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:27,094
The day you were exiled?

541
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:29,229
Only then forget it!

542
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:33,534
Seven, at that time did
you just do.

543
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:35,068
What?

544
01:10:35,135 --> 01:10:38,038
You were immature.

545
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:45,546
Seven If they had not detained,
you would have been lost.

546
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:49,716
You would have ended as Belial.

547
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,096
Eye Slugger!

548
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:11,071
Why the Eye Slugger
Seven of here?

549
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:19,446
The Graveyard of Monsters ...
Belial is creating disorder there.

550
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:24,151
Ultra Seven is asking for help.
He's calling his son.

551
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:26,186
Son?

552
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:29,323
Seven is ... my father?

553
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:33,126
We could not tell you before.

554
01:11:33,193 --> 01:11:37,064
Seven entrusted to us ...

555
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:41,502
to train him. To help you find
their spirit of Warrior Ultra.

556
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,473
Looks like you're time has come.

557
01:11:50,277 --> 01:11:51,411
Go!

558
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:53,313
Ultraman Zero!

559
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:09,997
This is my fault!

560
01:12:10,197 --> 01:12:11,865
Ultra Seven!

561
01:12:12,599 --> 01:12:15,869
Ray, not now! Suffer later!

562
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:20,174
I'm bored.

563
01:12:20,707 --> 01:12:22,910
Going to finish this now!

564
01:12:28,382 --> 01:12:31,185
Stay away from them!

565
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:50,804
He's back!

566
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:03,851
My son ... you grew up ...

567
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,665
Who are you?

568
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,042
Zero!

569
01:13:29,276 --> 01:13:32,312
Ultraman Zero! Son of Seven!

570
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:41,188
The son of Seven?

571
01:13:41,288 --> 01:13:45,359
You can join the
his father in hell!

572
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,760
Attack!

573
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:41,708
My turn.

574
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:53,387
You pay for what you did!

575
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:57,024
Ok! I'll kill you!

576
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:29,116
Now ended.

577
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:05,686
Incredible!

578
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:06,253
Awesome!

579
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:09,022
It must be the strongest Ultraman!

580
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:11,225
That is all that is concerned?

581
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:21,134
Personnel ...

582
01:18:22,536 --> 01:18:23,237
Etam all right?

583
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,371
Are you alright brother?

584
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:25,138
Yes.

585
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,777
Zero, the Center for Energy should be
brought back home immediately.

586
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:31,812
Understood.

587
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,532
What's happening?

588
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:36,910
You believed me
defeat so easily?

589
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:40,480
It ... it ...

590
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:43,450
The monsters have merged!

591
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:44,918
A monster made of monsters.

592
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,621
Let's smash it.

593
01:19:47,654 --> 01:19:48,555
Ok!

594
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:57,598
Attack!

595
01:19:58,332 --> 01:19:59,233
Gomora!

596
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:06,573
This fight is also ours!

597
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:07,474
Ok!

598
01:20:21,555 --> 01:20:22,322
Zero!

599
01:20:22,422 --> 01:20:23,156
Yes!

600
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,193
No use!

601
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,147
Shoot!

602
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:49,016
Shoot!

603
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:50,684
Ok! Shoot!

604
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:52,519
Go!

605
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:00,727
Leo!

606
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:05,566
Their lives will end

607
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:06,867
in a rain of fire!

608
01:21:35,028 --> 01:21:36,663
Giga-Battlenizer!

609
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:51,411
My Battlenizer also
should work on it!

610
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:57,584
Listen, 100 monsters!

611
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:00,921
Listen to me!

612
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,631
No, stop!

613
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:22,876
Look!

614
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,946
The monsters are revolting!

615
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:28,382
It's Ray! He did it!

616
01:22:28,982 --> 01:22:30,717
Now the chance!

617
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,519
Zero, you can!

618
01:22:33,587 --> 01:22:34,621
Ok!

619
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,076
The sacred light chose the Zero!

620
01:22:57,678 --> 01:22:58,912
Deem coverage to Zero!

621
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:00,447
Understood!

622
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,591
Me too!

623
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:31,545
We provide coverage to our ultimate weapon!

624
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:32,846
Ok!

625
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,715
Pedanium launcher!

626
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:36,350
Shoot!

627
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,018
Go!

628
01:23:48,829 --> 01:23:50,797
Super Wave Swing!

629
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:14,555
Not finished yet!

630
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,191
I swear I'll be back!

631
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:20,827
And I'll be waiting for you.

632
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:28,769
You'll pay for this!

633
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:33,340
Haruna, takes us out of here!

634
01:24:33,373 --> 01:24:34,408
Ok!

635
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:07,007
Cool!

636
01:25:07,641 --> 01:25:09,076
Hooray!

637
01:25:09,111 --> 01:25:10,444
We did it!

638
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:25,052
Incredible! Unbelievable!

639
01:26:25,087 --> 01:26:27,154
Hey, look at that!

640
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:28,555
Calm down.

641
01:26:28,589 --> 01:26:33,560
But we are the only human
to see the Land of Light!

642
01:26:33,595 --> 01:26:34,828
Beware!

643
01:26:35,162 --> 01:26:36,897
You have to stay behind
force field.

644
01:26:36,932 --> 01:26:38,298
Oh, sorry!

645
01:26:38,765 --> 01:26:43,470
The light from the planet is
too strong for you.

646
01:26:47,508 --> 01:26:50,210
Thanks ... for everything.

647
01:26:50,744 --> 01:26:54,515
No, we who must
thank you.

648
01:27:02,823 --> 01:27:03,557
Ray ..

649
01:27:04,424 --> 01:27:06,760
we are in debt.

650
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,864
See you on Earth.

651
01:27:11,098 --> 01:27:11,999
Yes.

652
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:18,872
Someday.

653
01:27:23,043 --> 01:27:23,777
Well ..

654
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,346
we still have to deliver cargo.

655
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:27,247
Ok

656
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:30,584
We're kind of too off course.

657
01:27:30,851 --> 01:27:32,753
Are we leaving?

658
01:27:32,786 --> 01:27:33,820
Well, you can stay!

659
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:35,389
Without this!

660
01:27:35,822 --> 01:27:37,558
I will send you.

661
01:27:38,992 --> 01:27:42,062
I'm still on a journey.

662
01:27:42,796 --> 01:27:44,264
Thank you!

663
01:27:45,632 --> 01:27:46,533
Beauty!

664
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:50,871
Come on.

665
01:27:50,904 --> 01:27:52,139
Goodbye.

666
01:28:16,997 --> 01:28:18,498
Hurry! Hurry!

667
01:28:21,835 --> 01:28:23,470
Hurry! Hurry!

668
01:28:23,537 --> 01:28:24,938
Come on!

669
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:39,786
I am very proud
you ... my son.

670
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:42,523
Father ..

671
01:29:07,214 --> 01:29:09,449
Ultra Warriors!

672
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:13,153
Once again we are together

673
01:29:13,188 --> 01:29:16,223
in the light of justice.

674
01:29:16,258 --> 01:29:20,127
But our work
not finished yet.

675
01:29:20,394 --> 01:29:24,131
Out in the universe,
evil still remains.

676
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:27,234
We shall find.
We will fight him.

677
01:29:27,269 --> 01:29:31,905
We will defeat our enemies
and protect the innocent.

678
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:37,511
This is the code for the Ultra people.

679
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:42,649
Let's start date.
Here, in this Land of Light

680
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:45,252
For peace! For justice!

681
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:49,489
For the future of the galaxy!

in "The Quasar Dilemma," remember,
you used the auxiliary of deck B...

160

could you get this...
deck B for gamma override.

161

Yeah, but that's when I thought
I was the crewman...

is up there, and it kills me.

Because my character isn't
important enough for a last name,

01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:32,427
Core implosion estimated
in nine minutes.

986
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:38,058
- Core overload. Emergency shutdown: overridden.
- Hey!

987
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,728
[ Alexander ]
Where's the happy ending, Jason?

988
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:46,358
Never give up, never surrender.

989
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:57,411
Maybe it's about time you just backed
off, you fin-headed monstrosity.

990
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,455
- [ Gwen ] Jason?
- You what?

991
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:04,918
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

992
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,129
you scene-stealing hack.

993
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,342
Oh, right.

994
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,596
Well, how does it feel, Jason?

995
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:18,515
- Was it worth it? You murdered us all!
- Shut up.

996
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,976
Hundreds to die
just because of you.

997
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,437
- I told you to shut up.
- Both of you, get in there.

998
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,481
Hundreds to die just because
you wanna play a big commander.

999
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:29,484
- You raving lunatic.
- Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?

1000
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:48,837
- [ Alexander ] Look out, Jason!
- Get his gun! Get the gun!

1001
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,215
[ Guy ]
Take that!

1002
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,518
[ Screaming ]

1003
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:08,106
Sorry, I was... Door was
a little sticky. Did you see that?

1004
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:11,151
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

1005
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,450
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack, thank you.

1006
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:20,869
- Raving egomaniac.
- Can't think where I got that from.

1007
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,871
Guys.

1008
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:24,915
Look.

1009
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,587
They're suffocating.

1010
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:40,055
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown: overridden.

1011
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,767
Core implosion estimated
in eight minutes.

1012
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:49,439
General, your transport
is ready for departure!

1013
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:58,615
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown: overridden.

1014
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:02,119
Core implosion estimated
in seven minutes.

1015
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:07,291
- Computer, shut down the core.
- Unable.

1016
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:12,462
Memory checks invalid.
Core system's hardware damaged.

1017
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:15,132
All right, listen up, this is what
we gotta do. Gwen, you and I,

1018
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:17,634
we're gonna get to the core
and shut it down manually.

1019
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:19,636
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve.

1020
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:21,471
Shut it off before
those Thermians run out of air.

1021
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:24,892
Alexander, get to the barracks. Wedge
a door open, in case they can't do that.

1022
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,144
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me? What do I do?

1023
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:31,565
You're gonna practice driving.
Let's go!

1024
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,567
Practice driving.

1025
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:36,945
- So we get to shut down a neutron reactor.
- That's right.

1026
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:38,947
I hate to break it
to you, Jason,

1027
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:41,742
but I don't know how to
shut down a neutron reactor,

1028
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:44,077
and unless you took a learning annex
course I don't know about,

1029
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:46,997
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor either.

1030
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,334
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

1031
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:56,298
- [ Knocking ]
- Brandon, honey, garbage.

1032
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:58,800
Aw, Mother, I'm quite busy.

1033
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,261
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

1034
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:05,432
[ Sighing ] Just ten more minutes.
Okay, Ma, I promise.

1035
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,602
[ Sighing ]
Great.

1036
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,274
[ Beep ]

1037
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:21,990
- [ Beep ]
- Hello? Anybody there?

1038
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:25,869
Hello?

1039
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,913
Hello?

1040
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:31,875
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.

1041
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:36,255
I play Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
N.S.E.A. Protector.

1042
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:40,217
We accidentally traded boxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.

1043
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:44,930
Oh? Oh.
Commander, I see.

1044
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,933
- Okay.
- What's your name, son?

1045
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:50,602
[ Sighs ]
Brandon.

1046
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,438
Brandon, I remember you
from the convention, right?

1047
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:57,150
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

1048
01:11:57,234 --> 01:11:59,194
and I was a little short
with you.

1049
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:03,198
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna...

1050
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:06,660
I just wanted to tell you that
I-I thought a lot about what you said.

1051
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:09,496
- It's okay. Listen.
- But I want you to know...

1052
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,041
that I'm not a complete
brain case, okay?

1053
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:16,086
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

1054
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:18,338
- H-Hold... Wait a minute.
- [ Brandon Continues ]

1055
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:22,342
Stop for a second.
Stop. Wait. It's all real.

1056
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:26,346
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

1057
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:29,892
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble,
and we need your help.

1058
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:35,439
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown: overridden.

1059
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,775
Core implosion estimated
in six minutes.

1060
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:42,070
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Screaming ]

1061
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,698
Sir, it's you.
Thank Ipthar.

1062
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:49,369
Quellek?
What are you doing up there?

1063
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,834
I avoided capture by using
your Mak'tar stealth face.

1064
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,837
- Where is everyone?
- Come with me.

1065
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,340
I'll explain on the way.

1066
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,303
All right, we're at level "C,"
hallway five. Now what?

1067
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:11,141
Um, go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

1068
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:14,311
And that leads to a system of utility corridors
through the bowels of the ship.

1069
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:17,147
- Open.
- You know, I'm gonna get Kyle.

1070
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:20,025
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

1071
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,112
...38, 39, 40.

1072
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,785
All we have to do is
turn off the valve to the barracks.

1073
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:38,252
- Hi, Brandon.
- No time for pleasantries, Kyle.

1074
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:42,256
We have a level five emergency.
You still got the utility systems walk-through, right?

1075
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:46,009
Yeah, I've got sectors one through twenty-eight.
Hollister has the upper levels.

1076
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:48,053
Great.
We'll get everybody on-line.

1077
01:13:55,978 --> 01:14:01,275
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

1078
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:05,237
General!
I have just received word...

1079
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,948
that the commander of the Protector
and his command crew...

1080
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,200
have escaped custody.

1081
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,202
What?

1082
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:19,793
- Find them!
- But sir! My men... The core implosion...

1083
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:22,129
Find them!

1084
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:27,050
All right, Brandon, I see five ducts
in this room. Which way do we go?

1085
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:29,136
Enter the passage
second to your left...

1086
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,306
and just continue straight
for 50 meters.

1087
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,642
Ducts?
Why is it always ducts?

1088
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,728
- Ah, there will be a slight drop.
- [ Screaming ]

1089
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:48,864
Thanks for the heads-up,
Brandon! You okay?

1090
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,580
They're dying.

1091
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:59,166
- Wait a minute. We gotta go across this thing?
- Yes.

1092
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:03,212
- Don't look down.
- What I'd give to see what you're seeing.

1093
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,216
- What are you talking about?
- You're deep in the underbelly of the Omega 13!

1094
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:10,219
Oh, it must be spectacular.

1095
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,096
It-It doesn't look
like much to me.

1096
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:18,977
There's just these few walls
and this dumb spinning fan that we have in every single...

1097
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:36,161
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

1098
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:39,456
Uh, many have believed
that it is a matter collapser.

1099
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,752
A bomb capable of destroying pretty much
everything in about 13 seconds.

1100
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:47,172
- But myself and others are convinced that what it is...
- I'm gonna go. Go.

1101
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:49,591
Is a matter rearranger,

1102
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:52,344
affecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

1103
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:57,182
Why 13 seconds? That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

1104
01:15:57,266 --> 01:16:00,978
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1105
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:05,607
- [ Lasers Blasting ]
- Go, go, go, go!

1106
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:08,944
We-We gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1107
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,114
Listen.
I'll go in.

1108
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,867
I'll create a distraction.
I've got this. I'm okay.

1109
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,786
I'm gonna be able to hold him back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

1110
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,331
- That's suicide.
- I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.

1111
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:25,294
I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

1112
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:29,464
Guy, Guy, maybe you're
the plucky comic relief.

1113
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:31,466
You ever think about that?

1114
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,636
- Plucky?
- Oh, besides,

1115
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,182
I just had this
really interesting idea.

1116
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,309
Are you stoned?

1117
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:43,478
Gotta get her up
and give them some time.

1118
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:46,481
- [ Grunting ]
- Sir, perhaps together...

1119
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:49,860
the Mak'tar chant of strength:
Larak tarath.

1120
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:52,988
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1121
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:57,409
[ Together ] Larak tarath, larak tarath,
larak tarath, larack tarath.

1122
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,504
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

1123
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:12,633
You wanna take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1124
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:14,510
"The chompers"?

1125
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:23,185
- Well, screw that.
- How are we supposed to get through this?

1126
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:25,354
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

1127
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,689
Okay, the sequence is...

1128
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,526
two-two-four-two...

1129
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:33,695
What is this thing?
I mean, it serves no useful purpose...

1130
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,199
for there to be a bunch of chompy, crushy things
in the middle of a hallway!

1131
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:41,245
We shouldn't have to do this.
It makes no sense! Why is it here?

1132
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:44,039
- 'Cause it's on the television show.
- Well, forget it!

1133
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,543
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1134
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,878
Okay, Commander, now, as soon
as the first crusher hits you...

1135
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,922
- [ Screaming ]
- It just did!

1136
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,216
- Okay, go now.
- Go! - [ Screaming ]

Go! Go!

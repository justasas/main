It is a Translation by software so
quit whinning

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,900
In a Nearby galaxy

4
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,400
It is part of virgo

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,440
Are there a life?

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,170
If no signs of life there,
what their standards?

7
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,940
Prepare equipment

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,210
nearby galaxy, we found something moving very fast

9
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,720
Please

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,450
What the hell is that?

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,880
I had never seen a vehicle like that

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,920
It looks just as ancient transportation

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,490
Well, it's next target is a galaxy

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,290
First, we landed on the planet's normal

15
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,430
and see the condition of the surrounding

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,300
We went with the speed of light

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,430
Departure ..!!

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,610
Do you guys ever heard of the express train?

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,550
Where to dismissal
very confidential, cool right?

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,820
And the dismissal is
in places very amazing

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,020
To get tickets is very difficult to

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,360
Many people who want to buy

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,060
I got 3 tickets

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,300
Who wants to come with me?

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,460
I wanted

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,030
I wanted

27
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,370


28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,630
Well if so

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,940
But what Nobita, he also wanted to be sure

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,810
Shizuka, I will not ask

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,580
Oh, he come .. he might hear us

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,950
Nobita ..

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,780
You want to ask me so I can go, right?
But sorry tickets are already full

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,320
I do not care

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,450
Do you see Doraemon?

36
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,220
It's been 3 days he did not come home

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,020
He never went for it, without asking first
to me

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,130
Maybe he had an accident

39
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,630
Or maybe there is someone targeting pockets of magic

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,330
You do not say no-no ..!

41
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,340
I'm so worried about him

42
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,500
If something happened to him ..

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,810
I do not know what else to do...

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,940
Do not worry ..

45
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm sure Doraemon'll be fine

46
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
That's right

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,050
My cat has also been missing for
1 week, but in the end returned to the house

48
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,450
The saying is true Suneo

49
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,550
You must install doraemon photo posters all over the place

50
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,120
Do not forget to place shelter animals

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,530
He's not an animal ..

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,530
DORAEMON....

17 Doraemon Movie Nobita and the Galaxy Superexpress

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,260
Welcome Watching

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm home ..

57
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,720
Where have you been?

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,550
Doraemon looking than earlier

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,320
Huh, Doraemon?

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,090
Nobita, be careful ..!

61
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Good

62
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,390
Doraemon

63
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,130
Why so late, exhausted from where have you been?

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,760
I should be asking you ..!

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,130
I was very troubling to you

66
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,000
Sorry .. sorry ..

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm no purpose, so
I have to go to Century 22

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,940
Purposes what?

69
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,070
I went to buy tickets

70
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,680
What ..! You go for it
just to buy a ticket?

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,880
This is a mystery train tickets,
a lot of people in the age 22 who want membili tickets

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,920
mystery train  22 century ..?

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,620
So I queued for
3 days to get tickets

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,520
This is it "Mystery Train Ticket"

75
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,570
You know why he went so long

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
That's because he was buying a train ticket
mystery

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,540
Trains  this mystery is a
spaceship shaped rail

78
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,840
The pemberangkatannya from the central station galaxy, and the dismissal so in secret

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
The amazing thing is, all the passengers
no one knows where the place dismissal

80
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,880
I would like to invite you, too,
but it seems you already have an appointment

81
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,880
Go into space, it seems very interesting ..

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,990
Ah, I've regretted that
had made the wrong decision

83
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,260
What? would you say if I invited
where it is not attractive?

84
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,090
Anyway, the place is very dangerous space

85
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,300
There are very dark place, then vacuum

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,860
And there are many evil aliens

87
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,700
Dan will have an accident,
then sucked into a black hole

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Then you will stay there for
forever and not be able to return to Earth

89
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
Is that true?

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,310
Doraeemon

91
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,920
I think it is highly unlikely if the train mystery
experienced anything like it

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,050
mystery train is actually a spaceship

93
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,690
type ships that are not used anymore because of the changing times
and
maketh a vehicle for sightseeing

94
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,320
In the past, it was used as a means of transportation
very
important to have inter-galaxy

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,330
But now it is no longer a vehicle that uses

96
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,930
Since the advent of tools called Door Where Only

97
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,100
And now the vehicle is only used as a vehicle for sightseeing
only

98
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,400
Oh, thank goodness ..

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,640
So so so story

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,900
Absolutely

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,340
Approximately how  days for this trip?

102
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,610
I still do not know

103
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,680
Since galaxy is a vast place

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,150
But we do not have to worry

105
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,650
Because we can go home at any time using the
Doors Where Only

106
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,980
true is not it?

107
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,120
Wow, really great

108
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,350
Thanks a lot Doraemon

109
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,520
Sounds very interesting ..

110
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,020
I can not wait...

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,570
We've reached the edge of the galaxy that

112
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,370
First, we find an uninhabited planet

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,610
planet  But it seems there is only
rocks only, no other option

114
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,710
Okay, now we landed
and build a base

115
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,790
toothbrushes, bath soap, comic books ..

116
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,530
I think you do not need all that

117
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,030
Let's quickly go

118
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,690
Do not forget to turn off the lights

119
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,030
Also do not forget the window

121
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,070
would be a problem if the mother finds out.

122
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,570
The station was where?

123
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,740
Train fire will wait for us at the top of the hill school

124
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,680
Here? but when the train will arrive?

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,590
Exactly at 12

126
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,960
And do not be late even though only 1 minute

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,930
My heart was pounding

128
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,060
I'm as

129
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,960
Ah, I slept first yes

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,670
Do not stay long yes

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
It ..!

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Ah...

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,200
Well, it's huge

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,260
Let's quickly run

135
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,970
What is totally outer space wagon

136
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,540
Yeah right, how cool is it?

137
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,570
Carriage in which we exist?

138
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,080
Our carriage at no 7

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,980
here, Excuse me ..

140
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,480
Excuse me ..

141
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,620
Let's see...

142
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,050
Well,, huge

143
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,420
What is true is on the train?

144
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,230
In each car there are 5 rooms

145
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,860
Equipped with meeting
and the bathroom too

146
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,060
Awesome ..

147
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,100
But why so quiet here?

148
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,270
Hello conductor ..
Two passengers of the earth has gone up ..

149
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,240
Odd

150
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,580
Ah, train set

151
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,640
No conductor or masinisnya ..
It's a very mysterious train ..

152
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,590
Ah, the earth looks smaller ..

153
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,570
Are you sure you'll be fine?

154
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,810
Do not worry

155
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,570
Besides the ticket price is also very expensive...

156
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,140
It would be fine ..

157
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,310
Unfortunately Shizuka could not join

158
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,650
And here are 5 rooms

159
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,480
What...

160
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,820
But he was already involved with Suneo

161
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Okay ..

162
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,290
Better now we see room

163
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,720
You want the room where?

164
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,020
I'm in room no. 1

165
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,560
If so I'm in the room no. 2

166
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
Okay

167
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,760
Wow, this is too big for the room occupied alone

168
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,430
Ah, definitely padded mattress

169
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900
Squishy once ..

170
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,370
"Thank you for join this trip '

171
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,570
' Every passenger should be taking this"

172
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,510
"That way you will be able to survive in space"

173
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,240
"you will feel comfortable, without worrying
more oxygen and high temperatures "

174
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,750
This way I do not have anymore space suits

175
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,850
Ah, what's this button?

176
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,890
Well, I could look out the screen

177
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,020
red planet that seems so close

178
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,060
Surely it is the planet Mars

179
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,920
And it's definitely a collection of asteroids

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,630
Nobita Hey, let's take a look at the other cars

181
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,260
Good

182
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,070
As if this train has how many cars?

183
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,000
Hm .. if not one was 58 carriages...

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,740
Hah, 58 carriage?

185
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,670
When viewed from the outside still only 8 carriages

186
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,140
But actually there are 120 cars you know ..!

187
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,810
What, 120 wagon?

188
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,950
There are so many cars here,
I'm not strong anymore ..

189
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,160
Wait ..

190
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,230
Not so fast way ..

191
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,060
Doraemon ..!

192
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,070
What is Nobita?

193
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,870
A.. There is a ninja

194
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,940

195
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,040
Ninja?

196
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,410
There's nothing here

197
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,040
You must be exhausted, so the illusion
a no-no ..

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
With this you will not be tired anymore

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,420
Why did not before ..

200
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,220
Not
suspect in the train station using bamboo propellers hehe ..

201
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,060
So once plush

202
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,720
How nice, right?

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560

True

210
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,410
What is it?

211
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,870
Jupiter

212
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,180
Planet Jupiter? huge ..!

213
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,780
Jupiter is the largest planet that is
in our solar system

214
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,650
Is that so?

215
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,290
Passenger Earth

Where were you?

220
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,600

This train will jump into the space and time

233
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,440
So we could not see anything

234
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,580
This will take a while

235
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,380

Hey, is not no one...

And bring a gun

338
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,180
You come on...

339
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,420
Basic cowards...

But I actually shot at him earlier ..

341
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,350
Really weird ..

342
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,260
Ninja, the creature in the mirror, then cowboy ..

343
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,830
Then there would be anything else right?...

344
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,730
Nobita ..

345
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,770

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,040
Where are the others?...

350
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,770
Do not know

351
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,740

It is very satisfactory service ..

354

We came here not for something like that ..! ¥ h

355
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,920
Oh well we go alone

356
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,190
Yeah, I think they also need peace

357
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,730
What place is still far away?

358
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,700


359
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,930
There, the landscape is very nice ..

360
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,970
How? the landscape is very beautiful is not it?...

361
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
A beautiful view? where?

362
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,240
But first there too!

363
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,210
Nobita, why be like this?

364
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,010
I do not know.

365
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,090
Nobita, are you okay? ..

366
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,490

Do not worry, this is only a mild head injury

369
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,900
Let him rest a little

370
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
He would realize more

371
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,470
thankfully ..

372
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,670
But why the sudden glow?

373
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,080
"Beginning of the creation of a galaxy"

374
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,940
In other words ..

375

This place will menampilakan visual images

376
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,150
Yang recounts the beginning of the creation of a galaxy

377
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,980
Because the trains are on time and space

378
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,250
So this show was at the start

379
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,260
Ah, Nobita it turns out you're awake? ..

380
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,620
Thankfully ..

381
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,530
Where is this?

382
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,330

"Virgo is our galaxy .."

387
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,710
I do not understand ..

388
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,250
Let's go back to the room and play video games

389
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm here alone

390
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,220
Okay, so if I want to find doraemon

391
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,260
Now more crowded than last night

392
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,900
You where doraemon?

393
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,300
Nobita...

394
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,830
What is Suneo?

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,940
A.. No

396
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,770

397
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,870

399
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,850
True, I saw a terrible pirate

400
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,810
He's in my room

401
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,510

402
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,480

He came and broke the glass...

406
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,930
What? ..

407
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,000
Will you look into...

408
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,270
No nothing...

409
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,340
Glass which are solved by it?

410
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,300
There ..

411
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,170
Why?

412
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,370
I sure see it ..!

413
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,470
If I did not believe you at

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,180
Yes, I believe...

415
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,050
Previously I've said if
I saw a cowboy, right?

416
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,010
I saw a pirate

417
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,020
We have to ask this to doraemon

418
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,750
Shizuka ..

419
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,420
Do you see doraemon?

420
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,130
He's not here...

421
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,430
He goes everywhere huh ..?

422
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,070
Doraemon  ..

423
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,440
Ah, you guys...

424
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,510
You out of nowhere?

425
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,940
We seek you out earlier ..

426
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,080
You follow me

427
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,510
I'll explain everything in the meeting room

428
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,520
What happened?

429
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,750
What is it exactly?

430
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,580
What is it?

431
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,150
- What's going on?
- Is something wrong?

432
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,390
Here ..

433
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,290
Train company is providing emergency alerts

434
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,300
What? mission thieves? ..

435
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,170
The mission of the Black Shadow in mysterious

436
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,900
They've landed in this galaxy

437
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,800
And make a base in an uninhabited planet

438
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
A base?

439
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,540
They come with using the spacecraft

440
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,110
I've never heard of them

441
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,740
We do not believe this is happening

442
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,150
She said this trip is guaranteed safe

443
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,110
Now what should we do?

444
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,320
Better for you to go to your room and lock the door

445
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,450
And pray lah ..

446
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,650
Why did you take us into dangerous
trip like this ..

447
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,920
What?

448
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,960
You are asking yourself right?

449
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,790
What did you say?

450
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,360
I want to go home ..

451
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,830
Oh, yes ..!

452
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,900
We can kembai the door anywhere, right?

453
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,070
Ah. very true

454
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,110
Why not occurred to me ya ..

455
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,110
If black shadow appeared ..

456
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,540
Then all the passengers and no masinisnya

457
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
They can not do anything about it

458
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,050
So their plan was going to fail ..

459
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,080
Let's go home

460
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
Good

461
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Please

462
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,520
Ah, the doors closed

463
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,290
Perhaps the black shadow had mengkuncinya

464
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,390
Their actions really clever

465
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,200
Now it is no longer a way out

466
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,770
The train is already out of space and time

467
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,080
Now being in the universe

468
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,080
Train is entering a collection of small planets plenet-high speed

469
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,920
It will probably take quite a while

470
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,220
So be careful ..

471
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,300
Mom ..

472
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,570
Why would eventually be like this?

473
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,540
Hey, guys ..!

474
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,880
Do not you realize something?
As it is today ..

475
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,350
Before, we always had a dangerous adventure
..

476
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,080
No matter what, we
always together and fight to the end ..

477
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,320
Let's do the same thing

478
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,990
There is no other option, we have
fight against them until the end ..

479
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,390
Nobita suddenly talking like that

480
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,460
It's remarkable...

481
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,030
Good word once

482
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,390
If they were to attack

483
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,960
Let us versus them together

484
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,630
Good

485
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,000
We were villains ..

486
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,770
"Circle Invisible Wall"

487
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,010
Nobita you go into the hole and saw the situation beyond

488
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,310


489
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,910
Be careful ..!

490
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,850
Why?

491
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,150
As if being in space

492
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,850
bamboo blades will not be able to use the

493
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,450
So yes

494
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,150
Wah ..

495
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,720
Nobita, watch out

496
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,690
I remember something ..

497
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,900
"Shoes And Gloves Anti Slippery"

498
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,260
With this there is nothing to worry about anymore

499
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,370
It's like the frog only

500
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,430
Let's go ahead

501
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,650
There is a man ..

502
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,220
Ah, chief machinist

503
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,690
guys, here is very dangerous ..!

504
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,590
But you're doing here?
Does not matter with
carriage without anyone driving?

505
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,890
Train is on the run automatically

506
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,330
You are here too I suppose?

507
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,830
You are...

508
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,170
I Bam ..

509
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,970
A reporter

510
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,970
Nobita  Do you?

511
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,340
I robot doraemon

512
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,370
May I ask?

513
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,140
Why would a journalist participating in this trip?

514
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,350
I just was on vacation ..

515
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,450
But just as it happened

516
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,120
Ah.

517
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,320

There

519
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,620
Anything else ..!

520
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,390
One by one, the light emerging from behind a rock ..

521
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,420
It was definitely the black shadow

522
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,830
And give signals to others

523
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,860
Then waiting to attack us

524
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,860
Is that a gun?

525
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,300
This is not just a shot emergency signaling

526
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,500
But it's better than nothing at all

527
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,510
They come ..!

528
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,890
Here, let me do it.

529
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,660
This is not a toy ..

530
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,020
Do not worry, after all ..

531
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,190
Nobita very proficient at shooting

532
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,330
Success

533
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,070
They are coming more and more

534
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,070
Fast  ask for help

535
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,680
What should I do? ..

536
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,250
I do not know ..

537
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,760
Success again ..

538
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,420

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,860
Do not be happy first

540
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,840
Doraemon

541
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,280
Ah, we shall fall

542
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,350
We are heading to a planet that had smoke ..

543
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,530
What is this?

544
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,930
Nobita ..

545
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,170
Where is this?

546
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,770
Is this heaven?

547
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,110
It's not possible...

548
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,410
But, wagon looks fine

549
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,650
What really happened?

550
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,700

551
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,250

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,520
They have disappeared ..

555
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,890
Unfortunately

556
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,730
If they came back again

557
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,800
I'll beat him to a pulp ..

558
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,330
I will beat...

559
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,800
Do not take for granted ..

560
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,070
They might still be here in hiding ..
And immediately came lucky strike again ..

561
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,870
Nonsense

562
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,440

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,280
Where did the head machinist?

565
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,150

647
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,410

Hey ancient human ..

672
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,960
What are you doing?...

673
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,420
You really stupid

674
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,060
What you do not know the road wheels

675
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,400
Ah, right!

676
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,430
Road wheels

677
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,070

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,400
You look down

679
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,040
The road is made of balls very small

680
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,540
If you want to go ahead

681
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,370
So little balls will receive a response from your mind

682
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,240
I mngerti

683
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,360

685
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,430
How about this?

686
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,630
Is not it hard to control?

687
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,300
True, in fact it can be controlled automatically

688
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,230
So easy to control...

689
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,670
But I ask that you not go to a planet forbidden

690
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,800
Okay, I understand

691
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,100
Anyway we do not want to go there

692
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,210
Hope your trip enjoyable

693
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,250
Towards planet cowboy, go ..! !

694
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,890
What is it? forbidden planet?

695
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,860
Previously the place was used for mining

696
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,660
But now it is not anything else
there is only a hole dug only

697
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,600
Very dangerous, never approached the place

698
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,510
Welcome to the Gun Smoke City

699
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,050

To become a sheriff

702
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,630

I will be Sheriff

709
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,750
What? ancient people also joined this event ..!

710
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,750
You should carry a bow and arrows
, instead of a gun ..

711
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,850
You do not laugh at me

712
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,020
'll see ..!

713
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,130
How?
If the costume is appropriate?

714
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,060
As a real cowboy

715
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,760
Ah, what's this real gun?

716
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,700
Not

717
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,970
here writing ..

718
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,800
If the robot enemy hit by this bullet

719
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,170
Then the body will be disabled.

720
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,910
But if the human body

721
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,940
Then the body will swell

722
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
And fly into the air

723
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,680
So the bullet would not be harmful

724
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,510
View only

725
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,510
I can definitely be a winner

726
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,020
This is the place

727
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,520
For all participants please gather here

728
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,220
As the targets here are six empty bottles and cans

729
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,120
Participants may shoot after a whistle from my

730
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,590
You have 6 bullets, if the remaining two or more then you are forever barred

731
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,600
So who would like to first start? ..

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,800


733
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,000
Seems he is very strong

734
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,900
Looks like someone at the time of cowboys

735
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,340
Is it ready? ..

736
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,140
Whenever I'm ready!!

737
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,580
Ah, just one shot, you fail ..

738
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,520
It looks like the gun is broken

739
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,420
It is not possible

740
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,720
Strange ..

741
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,420
Next ..

742
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,720
Pity

743
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,260
The shot misses

744
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,200
Only shot 2 ..

745
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,130
Failed

746
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,200

You shoot me ..?

753
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,120

On this planet are not allowed to use
babling bamboo blades

815
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,120
If people are going to protest

816

817
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,490

Hurry

821
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,430
If you use a horse, it is possible

822
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,630
Okay ..

823
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,270
Though this kind...

824
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,140
However, this is only left for us

825
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,240
Sorry

826
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,880
But when we would arrive

827
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,810
It was getting dark

828
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,250
According to the guidebook

829
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,020
They are headquartered in DEATH VALLEY

830
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,620

Are you okay?

836
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,040
Yes, in 1 hour also will shrink ..

837
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,320
It seems everyone has been shot

838
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,080
Man  fashioned ..

839
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,890
Penjahatya so great, you have to be careful

840
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,190
Nobita, it looks like we are close ..

841
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,720
Let's go

842
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,960
There

843
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,130
We approached slowly

844
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,000
But, do not let them know our arrival

845
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,300
"Liquid Powder"

846
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,140
With this we can take a dip in the ground

847
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,440
True

848
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,050
Nobita, be careful ..

849
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,710
Good

850
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,220
Quietly take a look through the window ¬ Ý ¬ Ý

851
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,790
Some come

852
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,930
No one dared to come here

853
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,330
They are all really cowards

854
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,000
Huh? why is there a cap?

855
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,740
Ah, Nobita will be caught

856
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,110
What is it?

857
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,980
A fox? he wears a badge sheriff

858
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,320
Faster  check around

859
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,820
Who knew he brought a friend

860
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,460
Let me check

861
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,890

863
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,600

00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,840
Nobita has mnyelamatkan this city of the criminals ..

865
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,310
Boring

866
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,580
let's go to another planet

867
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,050
Wait

868
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,820
Do you want to go to a planet where?

869
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,720
It really is great ..

870
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,850
I want to show it to Shizuka

871
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,360
What is Giant and Suneo do, huh?

872
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,390
Is also fun ninja on the planet? ..

873
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,430
This is because of you

874
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,300
Why did you choose this ninja planet? ..

875
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,700
It's not noisy, if we continue to talk
will fall ..!

876
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,200
Giant ~ ..

877
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,340
Do not waste my time ..!

878
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,680
You do not practice with sincerely

879
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,920
Ninja is strong, and not afraid to die

880
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,690
Do not be afraid that his name had ..

881
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,390
Exactly what are you trying to teach us?

882
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,990

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,720
We want the name  can walk on water ..

884

Using the techniques of magic that can penetrate walls

885
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,330
But we learned this

886
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,570
Not the same as what we know
on TV and comics

887
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,370
You people very impatient ..

888
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,770
Suneo, we go to another planet only

889
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,070
Okay

890
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,740
Hold

891
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,880

A ninja will always show his best

895
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,090
Using this scroll, you can disappear.

896
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,860
With this you can also penetrate walls?

897
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,260
Can disappear and through walls?...

898
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,230
How how to use it?

899
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,270
In it was programmed by computer

900
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,170
Then you keep it in your mouth

901
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,840
Then think something like

902
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,210
Through the wall, the power to fly

903
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,810
And turned into a rat

904
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,280

Really great

910
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,930
Now you will carry out a mission

911
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:56,690
If you succeed

912
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,590
Then I will give you the real secret tricks

913
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,700
Go into the house and stole a confidential document

00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,340
Because actual rolls have a lot of great moves

917

918
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,540
Suneo, let's go

919
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,410

Stop

921
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,250

this way ..

923
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,170
With moves through the wall, we
can enter very easily

924
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,170
It's pretty quiet , where ya at?

925

Why only selected him?

1006
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,410
I waited this role up to 5 times

1007
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,280
What is this?

1008
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,650
Do you still want to follow?

1009
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,390
I told you from the beginning

1010
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,720
Planet fairy was very boring

1011
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,390
Now my decision ..

1012
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,660
We went to a planet of dinosaurs

1013
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,730
Then fight dinosaurs

1014
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,800
There looks no sign of life ..

1015
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,670
Reporting to headquarters

1016
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,700
One person would I catch

1017
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,000
So then you want to be a princess what?.

1018
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,050
Asda, what's wrong with you?

1019
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,100
You what? Asda ..

1020
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,920
Why the sudden you shut up?

1021
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,950
Asda, what are you doing?

1022
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,290
Finally this body so Miliku

1023
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,000
- I've wanted to have a body like this
- Asda ..

1024
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,500
- What are you doing?
- Why did you leave us here?

1025
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,910
Emergency calls

1026
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,140
General, I no.008

1027
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,850
I have managed to get into the human body

1028
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,490
At a small planet where there are many people who live ..

1029
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,990
I await orders from you ..

1030
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,320
This General Heahdquartes

1031
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,030
No.008 you really terrific

1032
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,860
Send immediately forces there

1033
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,530
Our mission is to enter their bodies all

1034
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,870
Once we get him, then
will be easy to carry out secret missions ¥ O

1035
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,300
Everything is ready to strike ..!!

1036
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,540
Then we would soon control the entire universe

1037
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,780
Then the guards caught us

1038
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,050
and enter us into the dungeon

1039
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,960
But with the power of the ninja stance

1040
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,120
We got away

1041
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,360
On the planet very nice fairy

1042
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,200
The cowboy  planet too, we enjoy...

1043
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,300
If so, tomorrow we will go to a planet where?

1044
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,170
Planet Dinosaur course ..!!

1045
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,500
Right

1046
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,110
Is not nothing?
We'll get attacked by dinosaurs...

1047
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,840
The problem is it's not a real dinosaur, so it will be very safe

1048
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,710
Well, should we go to bed now, see you tomorrow ..
sampa

1049
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:39,700
Location is at the galaxy's
There are many small planets

1050
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,160
Though small planet

1051
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,730
But there are abundant mineral

1052
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,940
Dan called mineral planet

1053
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,240
Since many people are digging

1054
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,040
now only a small planet full of holes

1055
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,810
Then they lose their job

1056
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:04,290
And everything is back to his hometown

1057
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,390
If this let alone

1058
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,860
Then mineral planet will be damaged

1059
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,760
Our dream is to build a park
lmpian It has been discussed several times

1060
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,700
I know ..

1061
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,000
Therefore, in the wake of a Dream Park

1062
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,200
True

1063
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,470
The people on the planet minerals

1064
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,510
Everything moved here

1065
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,940
Bam, this is what I'm looking for

1066
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,610
I want you to write this story

1067
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,010
then released at the media, so that everyone knows

1068
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,820
Okay, I will do it ..

1069
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,350
Then I published in the media

1070
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,550
First, we have to think about security

1071
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,860
In Dreams Park
How many robots that were damaged?

1072
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,890
And that could endanger visitors

1073
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,030
It is quite impossible ¯ Ã ª º

1074
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,230
You see the building there?

1075
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,930
It is the central controller

1076
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,700
Working 24 hours without stopping

1077
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,800
Attention all planets around

1078
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,540
Starting from such a large robot to robot dinosaurs
smallest

1079
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,680
But, what if
an accident there ..?

1080
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,440
Behind control center that

1081
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,350
There is installed a communications tower that will emit a signal

1082
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:12,750
If there is an error, then
aid will directly come within 1 day

1083
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,530
Well, tomorrow...

1084
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,230
I'm going to visit all the places that are here

1085
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,860
If you have time, stop here ..

1086
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,730
- Okay ..
- Please follow me ..
- Thanks

1087
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,540
Do not be shy...

1088
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,070
Ah, it's too late ..

1089
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,710
That is, what light is that? ..

1090
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,180
It was just a meteor...

1091
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,550
Disni are common things like that

1092
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,020
Thank you.

1093
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,150
Equally, during the night...

1094
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:45,990
Good night...

1095
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,590
We've seen it all

1096
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:55,260
Now  saaatnya to take action

1097
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,170
Each of you must choose one man

1098
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,330
Then go into the body, and you will be a man

1099
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,970
Our goal in the control center

1100
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,140
and communications center

1101
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,680
We should make all the robots being fucked

1102
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,750
That's it ..

1103
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,780
The man was an employee at the head office communications

1104
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,850
001, do it ..!

1105
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,700
Ah, you're what?

1106
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,870
Are you okay?

1107
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,800
It's okay .. I'm fine

1108
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,340
Alright, time turns case ..

1109
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,170
Are you sure you okay??

1110
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,940
Do not worry, I'm fine really ..!

1111
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,180
Well, selamt night ..

1112
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,980
Confirm identity

1113
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,020
Confirmation fingerprint

1114
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,420
Confirmation finished

1115
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,420
Door open ..

1116
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,990
Tomorrow, I will destroy all the equipment here


1117
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:04,070
Communications  would be cut off, so there will be no relief
can come here

1118
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,030
's easy ..

1119
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,200
What, no one calling ..

1120
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,870
Detected an alien who is not well known around there

1121
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,540
Would you please check back around there.

1122
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,310
Well, I'll check it out ..!

1123
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,810
Basic, stupid people

1124
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,620
Soon you will soon come to an end ..

1125
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,420
Doraemon, are you awake? ..

1126
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,390
Doraemon

1127
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,760
Yes, good morning.

1128
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,760
Good morning ..

1129
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,930
Shizuka, What are you doing?
It's still early ..

1130
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,700
Before that I wanted to ask more

1131
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,410
Ah, Doors Everywhere?
Do you want to go? home?

1132
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,210
- To the bathroom
- Ah?

1133
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,110
Since last night I have not gone to the bathroom

1134
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,810
In the end it was the bathroom door

1135
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,050
Why did you just say?

1136
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,020
Ha ..  ha .. Shizuka .. Shizuka .. You were weird ..

1137
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,020
I'm still sleepy, sleep ah ..

1138
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,290
Good morning ..!

1139
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,330
Let's go to the planet of dinosaurs

1140
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,700
But...

1141
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,630
What?

1142
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,130
While in the bathroom?

1143
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,900
Bath under the stars ..

1144
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,440
Feels very fun

1145
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,920
Ah, it's not polite!!

1146
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,390
What is this? robot from the Garden of Dreams?

1147
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,090
This UFO toy, huh?

1148
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,900
Is it true that it is a UFO?

1149
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,130
It looks just a toy unusual

1150
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,430
Feels very soft

1151
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,630
Already let alone

1152
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,570
Let's quickly go

1153
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,040
right

1154
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,040
Departure

1155
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,980
Ah, Mr. Bam ..

1156
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,210
Good morning

1157
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,520
Do you want to come with us to the planet
dinosaurs?

1158
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,850
No thanks

1159
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,520
You guys go ahead, I was there first needs ..

1160
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,660
Hurry you'll be late

1161
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,760
Well if so

1162
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,460
We berngkat first yes ..!

1163
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,700
Today we will do a suspenseful adventure
..

1164
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,780
On this planet is the Mesozoic era

1165
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,750
Here there are 3 kinds of time, ie the time Triassik,
Jurassic era, and the era of dinosaurs era

1166
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,620
Taken together, they live in the same place

1167
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,360
Enjoy adventures ..

1168
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,090
On the first day you should find that you like dinosaurs

1169
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,130
Then you make as a friend

1170
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,930
Once you get a dinosaur, then ..

1171
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,740
In the next days you will follow a contest

1172
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,810
Ah, what a race contest?

1173
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,310
True, Start start from the volcano and its
Finish seaside

1174
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,110
As a prize for the winner, you may bring back dinosaurs
that you like

1175
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,650
I want diosaurus greatest

1176
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,380
Giant , where you want to save?

1177
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,980
Ah, oh yes yes ..!

1178
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,850
What is here also there tyranosaurus?

1179
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,660
Of course there is.

1180
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,360
Is he going to attack us?

1181
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,960
Yes of course.

1182
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,230
Would we be eating?

1183
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,230
True, after you eat...

1184
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,170
Then what will happen?

1185
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,600
You will go into the stomach, and then after the
exit you will be fossilized

1186
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,370
Then the game is finished.

1187
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,540
It is not possible ..!

1188
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,440
But do not worry

1189
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,740
Our officer will return you to the original state again

1190
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,710
thankfully ..

1191
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,220
If so we have to be very careful

1192
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,750
Here we shall use bamboo propellers

1193
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,490
I wanted to capture the dinosaur and friends with

1194
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,060
I want the greatest diosaurus

1195
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,630
According to your device. .

1196
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,270
Here are dinosaurs, that were located not far from here

1197
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,970
Let's go down

1198
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,810
should be around here ..

1199
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,640
That is, there ..!

1200
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:01,570
True?

1201
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,180
- Where?
- Where?

1202
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,910
Where is it?

1203
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,090
Shizuka, Come here does nothing ko ..!

1204
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,520
Dragon Sword is a type of herbivore

1205
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,260
It's okay, just touch.

1206
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,190
He will not eat you ..

1207
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,260
Is that true?

1208
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,060
True, you just try it ..

1209
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,460
Why is he silent?

1210
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,960
Is he sleeping?

1211
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,100
I'll make it move...

1212
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,400
Ah, do not do it ..!

1213
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,210
Dragon Sword is not a suitable race

1214
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,880
True enough

1215
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,380
I would look for a smaller course lah,
because I think it's good labih

1216
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,350
If so, let us look for more ..

1217
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,920
What do you think?

1218
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,990
I also agree

1219
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,490
So what are you waiting?

1220
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,190
According to the guide tool, around here
there are other types of dinosaurs

1221
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,230
Let's go

1222
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,990
Alright, let Suneo ..

1223
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,200
If you find something not forget
call the other, yes ..!

1224
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,540
It's very broad, huh?

1225
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,420
It is Velociraptor dinosaurs, carnivorous type

1226
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,350
He was not a great

1227
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,990
But he has a smart brain

1228
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:28,660
For example, he uses a dinosaur
for fishing target, after that ..

1229
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,560
Friends are in hiding and waiting to attack from behind

1230
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,510
Ah, so close ..

1231
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,980
Look, a Triceratops

1232
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,980
He dinosaurs running slow ..

1233
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,990
My stomach is hungry ..

1234
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,590
Let's take a break first, after that we proceed further

1235
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,990
Good

1236
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,420
Biscuits mini

1237
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,960
It was very tasty ..

1238
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,130
Although only eat one, but immediately can make a full stomach

1239
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,870
seems tyranosaurus has good speed...

1240
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,710
What is it? dinosaur chicks

1241
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,150
Hey, it's just food for the people not for the dinosaurs

1242
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,320
No, not eating ..!!

1243
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,790
Oh no, I really hate small dinosaur ..

1244
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,720
I'm just like a big dinosaur

1245
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,900
Giant, you liha footprints?

1246
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,100
Wow, this is definitely the biggest dinosaur footprints here

1247
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,630
this means....

1248
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,600
Giant, there .. it ..!

1249
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,540
Ah, it's huge ..

1250
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,340
It must Brachiosaurus ..

1251
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,890
Finally I found a huge dinosaur was also ..

1252
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,490
He fits untuku ..

1253
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,290
Although the fast is not necessarily running, right?

1254
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,790
Are you saying?

1255
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,130
If ants and dog races run.

1256
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,230
Who will win?

1257
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,900
If so how to get it?

1258
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,040
Sorry, I had to find other dinosaur ..

1259
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,170
There must be a way to get it

1260
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,710
I will not give up

1261
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,610
Ah, I know.

1262
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:28,580
Suneo, wait ..!

1263
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,750
What is it?

1264
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,520
I need your help ..

1265
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,820
What? ~

1266
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,520
You see, why he
very long neck?

1267
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,490
That's because ..

1268
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,430
But that's not my problem ..

1269
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,160
You do not know ya ..!

1270
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,900
That's because she likes to eat young leaves at the top
tree

1271
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,070
So what to do?

1272
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,700
Fast
you'll get untuku young leaves in the tree

1273
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,870
Why should I? ..

1274
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:55,640
Why is not he alone who took it ..

1275
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,940
Get it a lot ..!

1276
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:01,580
Well, now you approach the mouth ..

1277
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,620
And for him to follow you .. ¥ L

1278
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,520
Good ..

1279
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,190
Now faster  more ..

1280
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,800
Ah, but I also have to find dinosaurs for riding

1281
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,070
Continues is so...

1282
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,940
Make him to continue to follow you ..

1283
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,070
You really outrageous...

1284
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,680
I do not know if I can find a dinosaur
I like...

1285
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,580
Ah, funny as hell ..

1286
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,180
Do you want this? ..

1287
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,160
How, do you like?

1288
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,630
You can not ride
Although there is no choice, but I have to keep looking ..

1289
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,590
I'm sorry ..

1290
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,630
Ah, you follow me ..

1291
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,900
However, eating too much is not good

1292
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:02,040
Ah, dinosaur mother ..

1293
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,510
Is it a ferocious dinosaur?

1294
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,150
This is the kind Gallomimus Variety ..
Can run very fast and eating all the food

1295
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,480
This is the type that is suitable for riding

1296
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,880
You want to be friends with me, right?

1297
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,950
Come on, eat ..

1298
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,970
Do they have found dinosaur? ..

1299
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,500
Do not know too if they had found him or not
..

1300
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,710
Doraemon, what if Ptesaurus?

1301
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,680
Yeah, right

1302
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,280
If you can fly in the air, it must be very fast flight
..

1303
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,750
Let's try it ..!

1304
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,660
Departing

1305
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:53,160
See, there are lots of them in the sea ..

1306
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,860
Looks like they're looking for food

1307
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,830
But how to ride it??

1308
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,230
Alright, I'll give it a try ..

1309
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,370
Success ..

1310
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,780
Doraemon ..

1311
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,380
This is very enjoyable ..

1312
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,810
Okay I'll try

1313
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:15,280
Can ..

1314
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,120
Nobita, if we use
Ptesaurus maybe we'll be the first ..

1315
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,990
You come on ..!

1316
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,330
Let's faster ..

1317
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,030
I'm tired, let me down...

1318
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,770
We might be the winner...

1319
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,910
It would not be possible ..

1320
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,080
Ah, why?

1321
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,550
Suneo, quickly stop him ..!

1322
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,220
Suneo

1323
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:54,720
Giant

1324
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,420
Why would he be like that? ..

1325
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,570
Ah, It's Tyrannosaurus

1326
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,740
He's heading here

1327
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,110
What should we do?

1328
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,480
Ah, you're too heavy so it can not fly

1329
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,080
Do not leave me ..

1330
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,590
Ah, bamboo propellers ..

1331
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,260
Giant

1332
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,690
Mama .. Mama ..

1333
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,710
Hey, why him?

1334
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,540
Stop

1335
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,210
Nobita, have you been able to control it?

1336
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,380
True, if you pull your left leg, then he will turn to the left ..

1337
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,950
Look doraemon ..

1338
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,360
Nobita ..

1339
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,360
Why is this?

1340
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,160
Everything is falling down ..

1341
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,630
Actually, what has happened?

1342
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,900
Do the engines were damaged ..

1343
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,840
Who's calling?

1344
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,170
I Doraemon

1345
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:26,150
- I'm catching Tyranosaurus, but suddenly like
- Actually, what has happened?

1346
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,650
But because of this incident we are so over

1347
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,920
Hmm .. but, really well yes......

1348
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,020
How Shizuka?

1349
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,160
I'll call him

1350
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,390
Dinosaurs Gallomimus suddenly fell Variety

1351
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,230
What is it exactly?

1352
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,530
Is there also the same?

1353
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,830
What makes Dream Park is really suck ..

1354
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,870
We must immediately ask her ..

1355
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,940
Let us go to the head office

1356
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,310
Sorry ..

1357
01:06:54,310 --> 01:07:00,280
The robots are controlled from the central office control

1358
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,620
If so please contact them to immediately fix

1359
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,490
Actually we just got in contact to the control center

1360
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:11,590
but no response ..

1361
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,190
This is from the center of the planet

1362
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:17,860
Control Center, you hear? ..
Please answer ..

1363
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,740
Looks like something is happening beyond

1364
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,310
Ah, how can this be?

1365
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,880
All robots become chaotic....

1366
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,260
Why would they be?

1367
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,830
Something may have occurred in the central office control

1368
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,460
Let's check

1369
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,160
Control Center... control center ..
Please answer...

1370
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,700
Ah, look at that ..

1371
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,410
Ptesaurus group wants to attack us

1372
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:07,880
Go ASAP

1373
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,220
Hurry...

1374
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,060
We ran out of space

1375
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,460
They will not follow us into space

1376
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,130
Okay, faster

1377
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,430
Looks like they will attack us from the air

1378
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,970
Do not worry, high speed ..

1379
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:35,670
Apparently they had not attended a us again

1380
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,550
It is the center of the planet

1381
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,090
The situation there seems is night

1382
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,760
See there ..!

1383
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,360
Is there a fire?

1384
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,370
Looks like something did happen on this planet

1385
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,910
Quickly we investigate ..!

1386
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,320
We should split up to check it out ..

1387
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,930
I and Suneo will check where it came from smoke

1388
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,200
If something happens quickly call us...

1389
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,170
I understand, Suneo fast ..

1390
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,740
You

1391
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:37,340
Be careful ..

1392
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,770
This is definitely communication towers, right?

1393
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,320
Hello .. is there anybody in there? ..

1394
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,390
This place is really falling apart

1395
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,120
The fire is huge

1396
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,490
Giant  very dangerous here, let's go ..

1397
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:04,500
- Are there people inside?
- No, Giant do not go ..!

1398
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,470
A place like this where there may be someone inside ..

1399
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,700
I'll wait here ..

1400
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,710
Who's there?

1401
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,710
Here there is no one there ..

1402
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,580
Suneo, what is it? Suneo ..

1403
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:28,920
Where are you? Suneo ..

1404
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,860
Why did you run away like that,
base coward ..

1405
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,260
Suneo ..

1406
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,930
We've checked the entire building

1407
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,670
But no one

1408
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,170
Even a cockroach was not there ..

1409
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:44,800
How can this be?

1410
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,640
Where did all the people?

1411
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,880
Giant, you find something?

1412
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,210
Suneo disappear

1413
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,380
What, Suneo missing?

1414
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:00,020
Giant, you wait over there ..

1415
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:02,420
Boy, always cause problems ..

1416
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,460
Ah, do not stop suddenly so ..!

1417
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,230
Ssstt, There's something wrong ..

1418
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,830
Hidden ..

1419
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,870
There's something behind the wall of the garden ..

1420
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,670
What is it?? ..

1421
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,950
It is a toy from Dream Park ..

1422
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,860
He is moving on its own ..

1423
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,060
Ah, look up there!

1424
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,800
There are many ghosts that fly over

1425
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,010
It's just a robot from the planet and the planet Fairy Tale

1426
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,080
Actually, what happened here? ..

1427
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,310
I do not know, let's have to look for Giant ..

1428
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,520
Nobita, here ..

1429
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,420
Giant

1430
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,190
Are you finding Suneo?

1431
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,790
No, I can not go anywhere

1432
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,960
Maybe he was captured by the monster

1433
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,100
Yeah, right ..

1434
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:23,140
Suneo

1435
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,100
Giant, where are you?

1436
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,170
You suddenly disappeared, we were
worrying you ..

1437
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,480
I'm sorry ..

1438
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,580
Now you no where?

1439
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,410
I've found a safe place to hide

1440
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,450
You come on here ..

1441
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,990
Well, we'll soon get there ..

1442
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:42,490
Is it true that there is no monster ..

1443
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,620
But, if we continue here long
get caught, too ..

1444
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,890
Stop ..!

1445
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,610
Ah, apparently there ..

1446
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,280
Suneo, are you okay?

1447
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,010
Ah, finally met also ..

1448
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,820
Good, all here ..

1449
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,650
Well, fast do ..!

1450
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,190
What are you doing? ..

1451
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:21,460
Do not worry that I'm just making you fall asleep...

1452
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,700
No.0009, nice work.

1453
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,900
Bring them into the cabin with the others.

1454
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,900
While there are 600 people, but it's still not enough

1455
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,670
In our base, there are 8 million parasites are waiting ..

1456
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:43,020
Now we have to immediately find another galaxy
to add shortcomings ..

1457
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,350
Heh, the water is up

1458
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:48,320
I know, we've mnghabiskan everything ..

1459
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,360
The food also was not there

1460
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,860
Do not people come here and save us
..

1461
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,560
How could anyone want to come to a place like this?

1462
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,130
It's all because asda

1463
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,970
Since her father's rich, he's just so delicious
se us

1464
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,770
I'm so membecinya ..!

1465
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,470
True,
If I'll see you, I'll teach him a lesson ..

1466
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,910
Ah, you see? is not it a spaceship?

1467
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:11,640
Yeah right ..!

1468
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:19,720
We're here.

1469
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,420
Please save us ..

1470
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:42,110
Suneo, come quickly open the door ..!

1471
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,510
Let us out

1472
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:47,050
It's not much to say, just shut up ..!

1473
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,850
Suneo, we are friends
Why are you doing this to us?

1474
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:55,420
What was Suneo? I am the parasite no.0009

1475
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,260
Hah, he said parachute? ..

1476
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:58,390
Parachute?

1477
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,630
No, but PARASITES ..!

1478
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,790
We are a highly intelligent species

1479
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:03,960
If you surrender your body to us

1480
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,500
So, you'll be one of us ..

1481
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,240
He told me to be one of us ..

1482
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,170
It is a parasite?

1483
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:14,910
Parasites?

1484
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,680
He lives in the human body

1485
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,150
By taking over his brain

1486
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,420
So he can mngendalikan whole body

1487
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,920
Like the stuffed toy?

1488
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,850
I can not believe it happened

1489
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,120
If it continues like this, the world would be taken over by their
all

1490
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,030
Doraemon, use
Everywhere door to ask for help as soon as possible ..

1491
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,630
Yes. You're right

1492
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,170
Doraemon, are you okay?

1493
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:42,770
He had locked his magic bag

1494
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,500
So the magic bag can not be used?

1495
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,310
Yes

1496
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,110
Ah, you...

1497
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:54,450
Sorry to make you faint

1498
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,750
When I realized this, but it was too late ..

1499
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,720
Everywhere many monsters roam

1500
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,960
Lucky I met with the head machinist ..

1501
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,320
If not, maybe I've become one of them

1502
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,560
The situation became more serious ..

1503
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,560
Doraemon , is not there another way out?

1504
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
I have a great way ..

1505
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,740
But it is very risky

1506
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,170
We should try

1507
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,740
Patrol report...

1508
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,810
I see a fairly thick smoke

1509
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:33,350
Yesterday I had burned several buildings

1510
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:37,120
Perhaps the smoke was coming from the building which I have burned

1511
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,260
Do not mind, anyway here are no longer human

1512
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,660
= = I understand

1513
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,310
It worked

1514
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:02,010
We create a thick smoke

1515
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:05,620
Then the train left the planet with
hiding in thick smoke this

1516
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,920
Because of suspected smoke just plain

1517
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,020
So the monster was not aware of

1518
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,020
= = Thank God...

1519
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,040
What, run away?

1520
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:34,580
Since you say have arrested 600 people, therefore
I immediately came here

1521
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,750
But why did you let them escape? ..

1522
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,250
No. . 0008

1523
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,350
If the security team to know, then
master plan for the universe will fail miserably

1524
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,220
You have to do something ..!

1525
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,160
You did not have to worry

1526
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,360
It will not happen, because I had to take half of
fuel

1527
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,070
What do you mean?

1528
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,600
So, they would not have been able to go far

1529
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,710
If the fuel runs out, they will land on the planet
a short distance away from here

1530
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:06,980
If so, find them quickly
600 people and bring it to me

1531
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,590
Doraemon

1532
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,130
Looks like this room upside down ..!

1533
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,500
How can this be right? ..

1534
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,330
Earlier I was sleeping and suddenly this way

1535
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:29,840
Sorry, this is all my fault ..

1536
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,140
I do not realize if it turns out the material is low burn

1537
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,410
Due to running out of fuel, so
carriage fell into the planet

1538
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,710
But this is not your fault

1539
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,510
mean this train now landed on a planet?

1540
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:41,750
Seems so

1541
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,950
Hey man, why you locked me like this ..!

1542
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:50,120
I'm sorry, because you are not Suneo, so I was locked in there

1543
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,820
Be patient ..

1544
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,890
Ah, you guys here ..

1545
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,790
Bamboo blades are very useful
I use it to patrol

1546
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:59,460
other passengers stay safe

1547
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,900
They all still sound asleep

1548
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,140
Let's take a look at conditions beyond

1549
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,410
Well, the carriage overturned all

1550
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,210
Looks very chaotic ....

1551
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:13,580
Luckily we are all still alive ..

1552
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,250
This is due to touch down between the gray cart

1553
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,980
Is this volcanic ash?

1554
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:22,650
True, the ash was produced by artisanal mining in plenet mineral

1555
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:25,320
Planet That place is off limits?

1556
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,490
Yes

1557
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,800
The front of the train was damaged

1558
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,630
What could be improved?

1559
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,700
Very difficult

1560
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,970
Overall, we give up

1561
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:40,640
We can no longer fight ..

1562
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,710
We're doomed to die in this place ..

1563
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:46,480
Calm down, we're not that bad Events

1564
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,780
Please follow me ..

1565
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,920
Near this mountain there is a town called
dg mineral town

1566
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,220
But now it is no longer occupied

1567
01:19:56,220 --> 01:20:00,130
Although now uninhabited, but here
there are still a lot of food and drink

1568
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,660
Let's quickly take a look ..

1569
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,400
Is it true, Fun ..

1570
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:07,030
Now that he's home

1571
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,000
Ah, true

1572
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,340
food is aplenty

1573
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,740
As supermarkert

1574
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,540
Hamburger spicy specials ..

1575
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,740
Spaghetti pasta

1576
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:21,810
My favorite food ..

1577
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:24,820
Unfortunately here is no dorayaki

1578
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,450
Bon appetite

1579
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:28,420
Eat as much as you like

1580
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,390
Wow, it feels so good

1581
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:33,060
True

1582
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,260
Hey, chief machinist

1583
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,800
Iya

1584
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,960
I found this thing out of the building

1585
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,970
There is a mineralized corridor approximately
1000 meters below ground

1586
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:44,700
Yes, of course

1587
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:51,110
Well, this is what will bring us out of the mines
towards the underground station, right?

1588
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,810
Absolutely

1589
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,580
And there is a train station that still express the
can be used as a means of transportation, right?

1590
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,920
I want to eat anymore ..

1591
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,420
Although there is train

1592
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:04,520
But all the tracks are closed all

1593
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,260
Pity

1594
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,390
I think this way we
get out of this place ..

1595
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,760
It would not be possible

1596
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,730
Anyway dijalur was a lot of that collapse

1597
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,200
So, the train could not be used again

1598
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,270
Okay ..

1599
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:18,140
So do not even try to go in there

1600
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,970
okay .. okay ..

1601
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,810
We should discuss a plan anymore ..

1602
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:30,050
There is a train again here

1603
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,020
Although the train exits are closed

1604
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,550
But here there are many holes

1605
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:37,760
One of the holes is definitely heading
to where the train was.

1606
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,590
I'll look for it by using
map, so I will not get lost

1607
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,860
Browsing at the start ..!

1608
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:49,000
I am the Giant, the adventurer strong ..

1609
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,070
Ah, we've forgotten Suneo ..

1610
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,210
Not parasites never feel hungry?

1611
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,810
Because the human body, so...

1612
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,540
We should give him a little food too

1613
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,850
But she's very nasty ..

1614
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,220
You're all prepared

1615
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,790
We need to find where it landed train

1616
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,730
Okay, full speed ..

1617
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,770
Melangkahnya  carefully ..

1618
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,400
Doraemon, it's okay?

1619
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,840
This...

1620
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,370
That's the time it entered the UFO when I was in the shower

1621
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:31,710
Basic toys less kick ass ..!

1622
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,350
What it's really just a toy?

1623
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,880
Who knows what to do with the parasite creature

1624
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:41,120
I will show it on the host Bam ..

1625
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,560
Suneo, we bring you some food for you

1626
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,090
Open the door carefully

1627
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,390
Suneo, you what? Suneo ..

1628
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,800
What is it?

1629
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:59,800
Man is really easy to enter ..

1630
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,280
The line was supposed to take me to the floor 3 F

1631
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,050
Then in front of it ..

1632
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,680
Ah, no, the line was closed again ..

1633
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,020
So .. to get to the 7th floor, I have to turn around and then
..

1634
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:20,460
Ah, is there a point yng covered again ..

1635
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,630
I do not care, here there are many others
path, I will try it ..

1636
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,300
I am the Giant ..

1637
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,000
It fell off when I shoot
with the spray in the bathroom

1638
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,130
spray?

1639
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,640
Yes, a spray that is in the bathroom.

1640
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,370
Hey, there's something in it

1641
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:35,940
What is this?

1642
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:40,910
Previously I have never seen this type

1643
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:42,710
Do you shoot with it?

1644
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,120
Yeah, that's true

1645
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,920
It is a spray soap

1646
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,360
With this the body will be protected for a time

1647
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,320
So the parasite could not enter

1648
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,000
Mr Bam

1649
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,400
Please come here for a while .. .

1650
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,000
Nobita, what is it?

1651
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Nobita

1652
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,500
Nobita

1653
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,010
Nobita, get up ..

1654
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,880
What? .. I just attacked you?

1655
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,120
That's because you invaded by parasites ..

1656
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,290
But we've found a weakness

1657
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,060
Oh, Suneo is back

1658
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,290
thankfully ..

1659
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:29,930
Doraemon  and you all listen

1660
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,260
I really did not realize you guys had attacked

1661
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,830
Do not worry, it's his actions parasites ..

1662
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,270
Now that everything is together again

1663
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,570
Ah, Giant where?

1664
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,340
Ah right, Giant go where ya?

1665
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,210
I've given up ..!

1666
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:49,810
I do not believe has been lost here
how this ..!

1667
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,810
Ah, there was the sound of someone ..

1668
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,860
Do you come to save me? ..

1669
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,460
Are you going to save me? ..

1670
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,660
- Thankfully ..
- Thankfully ..

1671
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,840
Ah, why this, we both lost

1672
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,970
What a pity ..

1673
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:16,310
I think you know the way out ..

1674
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:19,810
I came here to look for
train left here

1675
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:23,150
trains? I see there is a train station in the rear

1676
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:24,980
true?

1677
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,420
Train fire really there ..

1678
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:31,090
We can use this train to get out of this planet

1679
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:32,820
We will survive ..

1680
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:39,060
But how do we get
out of the basement?

1681
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:44,640
Ah right,
may be our fate to die here

1682
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,810
Maybe I should eat something first

1683
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,610
Ah, what was it?

1684
01:25:54,510 --> 01:26:00,650
Giant, where are you?

1685
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,350
I do not find everywhere Giant

1686
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:05,390
I will check on the train

1687
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,690
Actually, he goes where?

1688
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:11,600
Hey, You're all I found footprints here

1689
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,030
I'm going to look

1690
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:17,000
-
do not go - or you'll get lost

1691
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,340
But I can not let him ..

1692
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,510
- Giant
- Takeshi

1693
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,380
Danger, this place would collapse

1694
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,320
Giant

1695
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:42,860
-
Giant - Giant

1696
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,930
It is no longer a choice

1697
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,970
Giant, I'm sorry ..

1698
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,530
Though he is rude, but his heart is very good

1699
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,400
I will greatly miss him ..

1700
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,720
Strength ninja, moves through walls ..

1701
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,520
Giant

1702
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,390
You terrific

1703
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,550
You survived

1704
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,490
We did it

1705
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,330
Put ​​all food and drink into the train

1706
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,800
But I think we need some weapons

1707
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,640
Here, no, because this place always peaceful

1708
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,410
But as long as this planet will be maintained

1709
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,710
So do not worry

1710
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,860
detected a strong gravitational wave energy

1711
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,990
Radar discover the presence of a train

1712
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:48,190
Finally the train came too

1713
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:52,660
- Raise the screen
- Received, Rev screen

1714
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:56,370
This time I will definitely catch

1715
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:58,240
You have to get it

1716
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,240
Railway has been found

1717
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,040
Finally, they found also

1718
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,440
They did not imagine it would be so soon

1719
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,240
They have found us

1720
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,510
At this rate they will easily catch
us

1721
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:08,910
We do not have weapons

1722
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,450
Is this train can be accelerated again?

1723
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,250
We are entering a collection area asteroids

1724
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:16,520
If we want to avoid a collision, we need
special skills in driving

1725
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,290
I leave it to you

1726
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:20,360
I'm going to try to steer this train as much as possible

1727
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,360
Fight. .

1728
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,190
We can not pass through this area a

1729
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:26,260
Reduce speed .. if not, we are going to collide with the asteroid

1730
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:27,930
Do not reduce the speed

1731
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:32,170
We do not need to reduce the speed
, we shoot them with guns

1732
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,170
Shoot them ..

1733
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,280
Do not shoot the cars

1734
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,590
We need the human body

1735
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:54,690
Train out of control We'll be landing on the planet

1736
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,140
Surrender  is your man and come on
exit...

1737
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,180
Then submit your body to us

1738
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,880
We will not hurt

1739
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:21,720
Why are they silent?

1740
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,650
Come on, we try to pick out ..

1741
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,900
Stop, do not run ..

1742
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,940
Damn, we are caught up ..!

1743
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,510
Shoot ..!

1744
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,650
Asda

1745
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,320
Asda, you okay?

1746
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,160
What is it? Where am I?

1747
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,820
What happened?? ..

1748
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,560
Asda

1749
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,460
Shoot continues, there are still many enemies ..

1750
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,730
Yeah right

1751
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,160
Backward ..

1752
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,430
Its leaders want to escape ..

1753
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:11,400
Do not let get away ..

1754
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,470
I will not be defeated by man

1755
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:18,880
He entered

1756
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,180
and hide in the ship

1757
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:26,580
You'll view the actual strength ..

1758
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:31,490
Parasites that enter the body robot

1759
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:34,660
Parasites not only get into the bodies of living alone

1760
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,560
But he can also control the computer

1761
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,130
Come on fire ..! ?

1762
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:45,440
Ah, did not work.

1763
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,140
The liquid can not be absorbed into the body

1764
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:51,140
We need to find a point of weakness

1765
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,210
Basic Human stupid

1766
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:56,910
You think you can escape

1767
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,650
Ah, no man is standing here

1768
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,290
looks like her body is very weak. .

1769
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:11,360
It's not important, what is important now
I need to log into his body ..

1770
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,900
Nobita

1771
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,200
It is not possible ..

1772
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,130
Nobita, you are terrific ..

1773
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,940
Nobita looks cool ..

1774
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,270
When he was shot parasite

1775
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,240
Ah, it's nothing ..

1776
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,740
See, the troops flee parasites

1777
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,360
I'm sorry you melbatkan into this

1778
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,800
We are very grateful to you all

1779
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,270
In this way, not
parasitic forces will probably come back to this place

1780
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:31,840
Soon we will immediately fix all the damage that occurs in
Dream Park this

1781
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,280
We'll fill fuel

1782

Thank you very much

1785
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,960
Head machinist,
please deliver them to the destination.

1786
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,290
Good

1787
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:57,270
Be careful on the street, bye ..

1788
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:05,180
Bye...

1789
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,150
Although dangerous, but very pleasing ..

1790
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:19,790
Other passengers also survived all

1791
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:24,030
asda father has promised to fix everything

1792
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,530
Thankfully

1793
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:28,100
I also must take responsibility

1794
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,700
But it's not your responsibility

1795
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,540
parasites who should be responsible

1796
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,570
True, it is their fault

1797
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,640
Giant, you're acting like parasites alone ..

1798
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:36,770
Ah, really ..

1799
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:41,510
Apparently ancient man also likes to joke

1800
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:42,480
I do not think...

1801
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,620
I'm really sorry you guys are mocking ridicule

1802
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:47,850
They're coming from the 20th century ..

1803
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:50,660
So they are ancestors You
